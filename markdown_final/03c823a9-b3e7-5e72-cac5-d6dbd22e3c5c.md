## Question

How do you monitor iron deficiency treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to monitor iron deficiency treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals of monitoring. Then, I should verify the key parameters to track and why. Next, I will stratify by treatment modality and patient population, including oral iron, IV iron, CKD, IBD, pregnancy, pediatrics, and special scenarios like IRIDA. After that, I should define response thresholds and timelines. Finally, I will integrate safety monitoring, troubleshooting nonresponse, and a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the goals of monitoring so I don't miss the forest for the trees: the aims are to confirm hematologic response, ensure iron repletion of stores, detect treatment failure early, and surveil for recurrence and adverse effects, with the ultimate objective of restoring hemoglobin, replenishing ferritin, improving quality of life, and preventing relapse, which aligns with BSG guidance on treatment endpoints and follow-up strategy [^586f90e2] [^cbd61487].

> I need to check which parameters are most informative and when to rely on them. Hemoglobin is the primary early endpoint for erythropoietic response, ferritin tracks iron stores but is an acute phase reactant, transferrin saturation helps distinguish absolute from functional deficiency and is less confounded by inflammation, and reticulocyte indices can give earlier signals of response, though they are not universally available; I should confirm that ferritin thresholds vary by context, with < 45 ng/mL strongly suggestive of iron deficiency in anemia and higher cutoffs problematic in inflammation, and that TSAT < 20% supports iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^b091a7ae] [^7f7d9730] [^7e0a572d].

> Now, for oral iron in general adult IDA, let me verify the early monitoring cadence and response thresholds. BSG recommends checking hemoglobin at about 4 weeks to confirm a reticulocyte-driven rise, and a hemoglobin increase of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency and predicts a satisfactory subsequent response; if hemoglobin has not risen by about 1 g/dL by 2–4 weeks, I should double-check adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or alternate diagnoses and consider switching to IV iron rather than escalating oral dose, and I should continue therapy for roughly 3 months after normalization to replete stores, with ferritin typically rising within 1–2 weeks of effective oral therapy [^586f90e2] [^80df5a00] [^9a4cae76] [^7e0a572d].

> Hold on, I should verify the IV iron monitoring specifics because ferritin kinetics differ. After IV iron, ferritin surges and cannot be interpreted for at least 1 week, so I should avoid early ferritin checks; instead, I can monitor hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks and reassess iron status no sooner than 4 weeks post-infusion, with many programs rechecking at 3 months; for ferric carboxymaltose, I need to remember the risk of hypophosphatemia and check phosphate after the first 1–2 doses, and I should observe patients for at least 30–60 minutes after the first dose depending on the agent, with resuscitation capability available [^9037efdd] [^0d84c01b] [^e1f6e4ec] [^a44cc23c].

> Next, I should review CKD-specific monitoring because thresholds and cadence differ. KDIGO advises evaluating ferritin and TSAT at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, testing more frequently when initiating or changing ESA, after IV iron, with bleeding, or when stores may be depleted; UKKA recommends monitoring every 1–3 months during IV iron to avoid toxicity, viewing ferritin > 800 µg/L with normal CRP as suggestive of overload and TSAT > 40% as a caution; I should confirm that IV iron is generally considered when ferritin is ≤ 500 µg/L and TSAT ≤ 30%, balancing benefit and risk [^03d50a9e] [^8f44aba1] [^d697e824] [^b723149d].

> For IBD, let me consider the higher recurrence risk and inflammation effects. ECCO recommends monitoring for recurrent iron deficiency every 3 months for at least a year after correction, then every 6–12 months, and to suspect persistent disease activity if anemia recurs despite clinical remission; I should double-check that higher post-treatment ferritin levels correlate with delayed recurrence, supporting the strategy of re-treating when ferritin falls below about 100 µg/L or hemoglobin drops below 12–13 g/dL depending on sex [^6db5d802] [^0f5d6c7c] [^9274ebc2].

> In pregnancy, I should confirm that early hemoglobin checks help detect nonresponse. RCOG suggests reassessing hemoglobin at 2 weeks to ensure a rising trend if oral iron is initiated, and if there is no rise with confirmed adherence, further evaluation and escalation are warranted; I need to ensure I account for physiologic hemodilution and trimester-specific norms when interpreting hemoglobin changes [^56214296].

> For pediatrics, let me verify age-appropriate intervals. In children with IDA, reassessing hemoglobin about 4 weeks after starting therapy is reasonable, with ferritin and TSAT guiding store repletion; in children with intestinal failure or on parenteral iron, more frequent monitoring is prudent due to infection and overload risks, with some experts recommending checks every 1–3 months depending on severity and route of therapy [^0517de86].

> But wait, what if the patient has IRIDA where hepcidin is inappropriately high and oral iron is ineffective. I should confirm that IV iron is preferred and that the monitoring target shifts to maintaining TSAT around 15% rather than normalizing hemoglobin, with ferritin checked before each dose to avoid reticuloendothelial iron overload; I need to ensure I also monitor phosphate with ferric carboxymaltose due to hypophosphatemia risk [^efd28965] [^a6b59f1d].

> I will now examine response thresholds and timelines so I don't misclassify failure. A hemoglobin rise of about 1 g/dL within 2–4 weeks of oral therapy is expected in uncomplicated IDA, and a rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks strongly predicts a satisfactory overall response; if hemoglobin fails to rise by about 1 g/dL by 2–4 weeks, I should verify adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, inflammation, or alternate etiologies and pivot to IV iron rather than simply increasing oral dose, which often adds side effects without benefit [^7e0a572d] [^80df5a00] [^9a4cae76].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring and when to stop or adjust therapy. During IV iron, observe for hypersensitivity and monitor for hypophosphatemia with ferric carboxymaltose; avoid interpreting ferritin within 1 week of IV iron; in CKD, be cautious with repeated IV iron when ferritin is high and TSAT is not low, and consider holding iron if ferritin exceeds about 800 µg/L without inflammation; in all patients, I need to ensure we do not overshoot — once hemoglobin is normal and ferritin is replete, stop or taper therapy and transition to surveillance [^0d84c01b] [^d697e824] [^586f90e2].

> Let me consider recurrence surveillance after successful treatment. BSG recommends periodic blood counts, perhaps every 6 months initially, to detect recurrent IDA, with closer intervals in high-risk groups like IBD; I should confirm that persistent or recurrent IDA warrants re-evaluation for ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or disease activity, and that long-term maintenance iron may be appropriate if the cause is irreversible or unknown [^21b693f7] [^6ab7dcd2] [^4f9b4a7f].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Start with oral iron in most nonurgent cases, reassess hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks, continue for about 3 months after normalization, then monitor periodically; if no early hemoglobin rise, switch to IV iron and reassess at 2–4 weeks; after IV iron, avoid early ferritin, recheck iron status at 4–12 weeks, and tailor retreatment to ferritin and hemoglobin trends; throughout, address the underlying cause and adjust for special populations as above [^586f90e2] [^cbd61487] [^9037efdd].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have a concise, clinically usable summary. Monitor hemoglobin early and often to confirm response, use ferritin and TSAT to gauge stores and functional availability while remembering inflammation confounds ferritin, adapt cadence to treatment route and patient population, escalate promptly when response is inadequate, and surveil for recurrence after repletion; this approach balances efficacy, safety, and evidence-based thresholds across diverse clinical contexts [^586f90e2] [^b091a7ae] [^7e0a572d].

Monitor iron deficiency treatment by tracking **hemoglobin every 2–4 weeks** [^586f90e2] until normalization, then **ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) every 1–3 months** [^d697e824] to ensure store repletion and avoid overload [^d697e824]. Expect a **hemoglobin rise of about 1 g/dL every 2–3 weeks** [^d83b9680]; if there is no rise by 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss [^9a4cae76] and consider IV iron [^cbd61487]. Continue oral iron for ~3 months after hemoglobin normalization to rebuild stores [^586f90e2], then monitor for recurrence every 6–12 months [^21b693f7]. In CKD, monitor iron status monthly on dialysis and every 3 months off dialysis [^03d50a9e]; in IBD, check every 3–6 months [^7bda54a5]. Watch for adverse effects: GI upset with oral iron [^7e0a572d] and hypophosphatemia or infusion reactions with IV iron [^0d84c01b].

---

## Clinical parameters for monitoring

### Hemoglobin (Hb) levels

- **Frequency**: Check Hb every 2–4 weeks [^notfound] until normalization, then every 3–6 months [^notfound].
- **Expected response**: Hb should rise ~1 g/dL every 2–3 weeks [^d83b9680]; a ≥ 10 g/L rise in 2 weeks predicts success [^80df5a00].
- **Nonresponse**: If Hb does not rise by 1 g/dL in 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss [^notfound] and consider IV iron [^cbd61487].

---

### Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT)

- **Frequency**: Monitor ferritin and TSAT every 1–3 months during therapy [^d697e824].
- **Targets**: Aim for ferritin > 100 µg/L and TSAT > 20% to indicate repletion [^e471c185].
- **Overload risk**: Ferritin > 800 µg/L with normal CRP suggests iron overload; reduce or stop IV iron [^d697e824].

---

### Reticulocyte count

Reticulocytes rise within **3–5 days** of effective therapy, providing an early signal of response [^fe5b35ec].

---

## Monitoring by treatment modality

### Oral iron therapy

- **Adherence**: Confirm adherence and tolerability at each visit [^fe5b35ec].
- **GI effects**: Manage nausea, constipation, or diarrhea with dose changes or alternative formulations [^cbd61487].
- **Duration**: Continue for ~3 months after Hb normalization to rebuild stores [^586f90e2].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy

- **Infusion monitoring**: Observe for 30–60 minutes after infusion; monitor for hypotension, dyspnea, or allergic reactions [^e1f6e4ec].
- **Hypophosphatemia**: Monitor phosphate, especially with ferric carboxymaltose; check after the first 1–2 doses [^8271d660].
- **Iron indices**: Recheck ferritin and TSAT 4–12 weeks after infusion to guide retreatment [^9037efdd].

---

## Special populations and considerations

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, **monitoring frequency** is monthly on hemodialysis and every 3 months off dialysis [^9d420228]. Functional iron deficiency is common; use TSAT and ferritin to guide therapy [^336dab3a]. Avoid **iron overload** by keeping ferritin ≤ 500–800 µg/L and TSAT ≤ 40% [^d697e824].

---

### Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

In IBD, **monitoring frequency** is every 3–6 months due to high recurrence risk [^7bda54a5]. Intravenous iron is often preferred in active disease or when oral iron is not tolerated [^72338ce7]. Recurrence is common; maintain ferritin > 100 µg/L when possible [^c190f1d3].

---

### Pregnancy

In pregnancy, **monitoring frequency** is every 4 weeks until Hb normalizes, then every trimester. Intravenous iron is considered when oral iron is not tolerated or is ineffective [^b091a7ae].

## Adverse effects and safety monitoring

| **Treatment** | **Common adverse effects** | **Monitoring and management** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral iron | - GI upset <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Diarrhea | - Dose adjustment <br/> - Alternative formulations <br/> - Consider IV iron if intolerance persists [^cbd61487] |
| IV iron | - Hypophosphatemia <br/> - Infusion reactions <br/> - Rare anaphylaxis | - Monitor phosphate <br/> - Observe during infusion <br/> - Resuscitation equipment available [^0d84c01b] |

---

## Long-term follow-up and recurrence prevention

Schedule **periodic checks** every 6–12 months after correction to detect recurrence [^21b693f7]. Address underlying causes — such as bleeding, malabsorption, or chronic disease — to reduce recurrence [^679ec03d]. Consider maintenance therapy for recurrent IDA with unknown or irreversible causes [^4f9b4a7f].

---

## Summary of monitoring recommendations

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Target/response** |
|-|-|-|
| Hemoglobin | Every 2–4 weeks until normalization | Rise ~1 g/dL every 2–3 weeks [^d83b9680] |
| Ferritin | Every 1–3 months | > 100 µg/L [^e471c185] |
| Transferrin saturation | Every 1–3 months | > 20% [^e471c185] |
| Reticulocyte count | 3–5 days after initiation | Increase indicates response [^fe5b35ec] |
| Phosphate (with IV iron) | After first 1–2 infusions | Monitor for hypophosphatemia [^8271d660] |

---

Effective monitoring hinges on **regular Hb checks**, judicious use of ferritin and TSAT, and vigilance for adverse effects. Adjust therapy based on response and patient-specific factors to restore iron stores and prevent recurrence.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

Intravenous iron has become an essential component for the treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Individuals administering Intravenous iron should have knowledge in intravenous iron administration, including a pre-infusion assessment to evaluate infusion reaction risks, pre- and post-infusion monitoring, identification of and management of infusion reactions, accurate documentation of these reactions, laboratory monitoring and recognition and management of treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia. This comprehensive consensus provides step-by-step guidance and tools for practitioners to promote safe delivery of intravenous iron, recognition, and management of infusion reactions and treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia.

7 A pregnancy takes about 700 mg of iron, and a whole blood donation of 500 cc contains 250 mg of iron. Screening and Primary Prevention The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening pregnant women for IDA, but found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening in other asymptomatic persons. However, the guidelines did recommend routine iron supplementation in asymptomatic infants six to 12 months of age who are at high risk of IDA. Infants are considered to be at high risk if they are living in poverty; are black, Native American, or Alaskan Native; are immigrants from a developing country; are preterm or low birth weight; or if their primary dietary intake is unfortified cow's milk. Treatment Transfusion should be considered for patients of any age with IDA complaining of symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea on exertion.

It also should be considered for asymptomatic cardiac patients with hemoglobin less than 10 g per dL. However, oral iron therapy is usually the first-line therapy for patients with IDA. 34 As noted in the etiology section, iron absorption varies widely based on type of diet and other factors. Bone marrow response to iron is limited to 20 mg per day of elemental iron. An increase in the hemoglobin level of 1 g per dL should occur every two to three weeks on iron therapy; however, it may take up to four months for the iron stores to return to normal after the hemoglobin has corrected. There also is a delayed reaction, which consists of myalgias, headache, and arthralgias, that can occur 24 to 48 hours after infusion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will usually relieve these symptoms, but they may be prolonged in patients with chronic inflammatory joint disease.

43 Sodium ferric gluconate is usually administered intravenously in eight weekly doses of 125 mg for a total dosage of 1, 000 mg. No test dose is required. Another intravenous preparation, approved for use in the United States in 2000, is iron sucrose. In iron deficiency not associated with hemodialysis, 200 mg is administered intravenously five times over a two-week period. Safety profiles are similar to sodium ferric gluconate, although published experience is more limited. 28.

Monitoring

Iron overload is a potential risk of IV iron therapy. Our experience suggests that IV iron therapy in IRIDA elevates ferritin levels without significantly affecting TSAT, indicating that iron is primarily stored in the reticuloendothelial system. An increase in TSAT suggests iron redistribution from the reticuloendothelial system to the circulation, signalling that the ferritin set point — the level at which iron becomes available for erythropoiesis and other (parenchymal) tissues — has been reached. While this iron redistribution improves iron availability and haemoglobin levels, it may also result in a decreased erythropoietic iron demand, potentially leading to toxic parenchymal iron overload, necessitating reduced treatment frequency.

Unlike inappropriately low‐hepcidin disorders such as HFE‐hereditary hemochromatosis, where iron accumulates in parenchymal tissues with a higher toxicity risk, IRIDA primarily results in iron overload in the reticuloendothelial macrophages. Although the long‐term effects of such iron accumulation remain unclear, patients with (loss‐of‐function) ferroportin disease, who have similar biochemical profiles, typically do not experience severe complications despite excessive high ferritin levels. Additionally, evidence from CKD patients suggests that excess reticuloendothelial iron, during at least a few years, is well tolerated.

Given the unknown long‐term risks, we recommend checking ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin before each administration. If TSAT levels rise but the patient remains symptomatic with low haemoglobin requiring therapy, we advise reducing IV iron administration frequency. As IRIDA patients typically cannot achieve TSAT within the reference range due to hepcidin dysregulation, we recommend maintaining TSAT around 15%. In our experience, this percentage allows for sufficient iron availability for erythropoiesis without causing unnecessary excessive iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system. Importantly, the goal is not to normalize haemoglobin, as we cannot exclude that prolonged iron loading in the reticuloendothelial system may pose long‐term risks. Ferritin levels should be kept as low as possible while ensuring acceptable haemoglobin and quality of life.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

### Iron therapy for the treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: intravenous or oral? [^7ab8e7d2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Iron deficiency is widespread in patients with heart failure. Currently, however, it is not universally monitored or managed despite convincing evidence that iron deficiency is a risk factor for poor outcome independent of anaemia status. Iron is poorly absorbed from oral preparations, compounded by chronic inflammation and other contributing factors in patients with heart failure, which delays or prohibits iron replenishment. Evidence for a clinical benefit using oral iron preparations in heart failure is lacking. Clinical studies have instead focused on the use of i.v. iron, which bypasses the problem of gastrointestinal absorption and poor compliance. Early studies using iron sucrose consistently showed that correction of iron deficiency improved exercise capacity, cardiac function, symptom severity, and quality of life. These studies were recently confirmed in the large 6-month FAIR-HF study, where functional capacity, symptoms, and quality of life rapidly increased in patients with heart failure of NYHA class II–III and impaired LVEFin comparison with placebo treatment. Longer term data were provided by the CONFIRM-HF trial, in which symptomatic, iron-deficient patients with heart failure showed a sustained improvement in functional capacity, symptoms, and quality of life, and reduced risk of hospitalization due to worsening heart failure over 1 year of i.v. iron therapy. The ESC Guidelines point out that ferric carboxymaltose may be considered for treatment of these patients, although the effect in patients with preserved LVEF remains unknown. It should also be borne in mind that assessment of the hard endpoint of mortality is not feasible within the population sizes possible in controlled studies, and that a full assessment of safety would require more extended follow-up. The structures of new i.v. preparations permit far larger doses of iron to be administered safely in a single visit. Routine diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in patients with symptomatic heart failure, regardless of anaemia status, and prompt intervention using i.v. iron therapy should now be considered, pending the outcome of larger ongoing randomized controlled trials and longer term safety data.

### An approach to hemequity: identifying the barriers and facilitators of iron deficiency reduction strategies in low-to middle-income countries [^2a17a59a]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Moving forward, future research must address methods of assessing IDA in resource‐constrained settings to allow for early detection of IDA, especially given the higher prevalence of inherited red blood cell disorders in LMICs and uncertain risk of iron overload in those with severe disorders. Future IDA reduction strategies in the LMIC setting must be multifaceted, understanding that IDA is an outcome determined by social, political, environmental and nutritional variables. Future innovations should include the following components: (1) maternal health education involving women, communities and health personnel; (2) women's empowerment in community decision‐making; (3) community ownership in the design and delivery of the intervention; (4) mobilization of existing resources with integration into existing communicable disease and maternal and child health programmes; and (5) feedback and reflexivity with strong monitoring and evaluation systems. Finally, anaemia is also one of many end‐organ manifestations of iron deficiency and clinical and functional impairments that occur in the absence of anaemia. Therefore, we must reframe iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia as a diagnosis that matters and as a condition that is worthy of treatment. Iron replacement remains the mainstay of treatment for iron deficiency. Reconceptualizing iron replacement as treatment and not just as 'supplementation' will raise the level of evidence required and therefore the scope of research being conducted in this realm.

### Screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: a structured review and gap analysis against UK national screening criteria [^c8e90a56]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

All other options for managing the condition should have been considered (e.g. improving treatment, providing other services), to ensure that no more cost-effective intervention could be introduced or current interventions increased within the resources available

Primary prevention of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in the UK has been described in section 3. Routine supplementation with oral iron tablets in the UK not recommended as it is in other countries such as the US. There are no further interventions known to be more cost effective that could be introduced in the UK.

There should be a plan for managing and monitoring the screening programme and an agreed set of quality assurance standards. Adequate staffing and facilities for testing, diagnosis, treatment and programme management should be available prior to the commencement of the screening programme

Whilst there have been no randomised trials of a screening programme, other similar antenatal screening programmes e.g. sickle cell and thalassaemia, have comprehensive plans for monitoring and agreed quality assurance standards. There have been no formal studies to establish adequate staffing testing, diagnosis and treatment for a programme that would address iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia.

Evidence-based information, explaining the consequences of testing, investigation and treatment, should be made available to potential participants to assist them in making an informed choice

There is no evidence-based information specific to a screening programme for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. The infrastructure for delivering information to participants to assist them in making an informed choice exists within antenatal and postnatal care in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The characteristics of what makes information accessible and acceptable to pregnant women in allowing them to make an informed choice has been studied in the context of antenatal screening programmes for other conditions such as thalassaemia.

Public pressure for widening the eligibility criteria, for reducing the screening interval and for increasing the sensitivity of the testing process, should be anticipated. Decisions about these parameters should be scientifically justifiable to the public

The sensitivity of the testing process may be increased as ferritin testing in pregnancy becomes more widespread in practice. The sensitivity of the testing process may also be improved, if and when, newer iron status indicators such as hepcidin become more affordable and widely available. Given the side effects of oral iron, it is possible that the eligibility criteria for those requiring IV iron may widen.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^a6b59f1d]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In IRIDA, inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels impair oral iron availability for erythropoiesis, making IV therapy more effective as it partially bypasses the hepcidin–ferroportin block. Oral iron therapy should be attempted initially; however, if ineffective, IV therapy should be considered promptly to prevent under‐treatment, especially in paediatric patients. IV treatment should be carefully titrated to achieve acceptable haemoglobin levels while avoiding iron overloading macrophages, guided by ferritin, TSAT and haemoglobin levels. Monitoring serum phosphate levels is advised during ferric carboxymaltose therapy due to the risk of hypophosphatemia. While anti‐hepcidin therapies target the root cause, no such agents are currently approved for IRIDA.

### Iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease: updates on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^acf51a64]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a complication that affects a majority of individuals with advanced CKD. Although relative deficiency of erythropoietin production is the major driver of anemia in CKD, iron deficiency stands out among the mechanisms contributing to the impaired erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced kidney function. Iron deficiency plays a significant role in anemia in CKD. This may be due to a true paucity of iron stores (absolute iron deficiency) or a relative (functional) deficiency which prevents the use of available iron stores. Several risk factors contribute to absolute and functional iron deficiency in CKD, including blood losses, impaired iron absorption, and chronic inflammation. The traditional biomarkers used for the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with CKD have limitations, leading to persistent challenges in the detection and monitoring of IDA in these patients. Here, we review the pathophysiology and available diagnostic tests for IDA in CKD, we discuss the literature that has informed the current practice guidelines for the treatment of IDA in CKD, and we summarize the available oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in CKD. Two important issues are addressed, including the potential risks of a more liberal approach to iron supplementation as well as the potential risks and benefits of IV versus oral iron supplementation in patients with CKD.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Oral Iron for Prevention and Treatment: the New Management Strategy for ADH

Given this new evidence, what is the way forward in the management of ADH patients? Iron deficiency is the most frequent micronutrient deficiency globally, affecting one‐third of non‐pregnant women. 17 Certain risk groups, such as individuals with ADH, need to be regarded as at high risk of complications. The strategy will undoubtedly have to be the avoidance and treatment of iron deficiency, in order to maintain or re‐establish normophosphatemia in ADH patients. Hence, in our view there are three distinct groups of patients carrying FGF23 mutations, judged by their ferritin status, with different proposed management criteria (see Table 1):
The first group constitutes normophosphatemic and iron‐sufficient ADH patients who require regular monitoring of both elements but no regular iron supplements.
The second group are normophosphatemic patients at risk of iron deficiency, specifically all women during the reproductive age, people on vegetarian or vegan diets, or with malabsorptive or cardiac conditions, where preventative supplementation doses of oral iron are indicated. These should follow the WHO guidance on iron supplementation. 16, 17
The third group consists of hypophosphatemic ADH patients who require oral iron in treatment doses (3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron) until normophosphatemia is reached, followed by the WHO supplementation regimen.

Table 1
Clinical Management of ADH Patients Depending on Iron Status

Oral iron therapy needs to be handled with caution. Careful and regular monitoring of iron status is therefore recommended in subjects with ADH, to avoid iron toxicity 18 and overload. 14 During phases of hypophosphatemia, active vitamin D analogues and oral phosphate can of course be given alongside iron therapy. For subjects who do not tolerate or accept iron substitution, both conventional therapy as well as burosumab are available treatment options. As for all forms of hypomineralization, 25OH vitamin D should be kept in the normal range.

Evidence from the medical literature on oral iron therapy in ADH, 11, 12, 13 including our long‐term observation presented here, indicate that ferritin, a marker of the body's iron store, may be the best indicator relevant to medical decision making. We therefore propose ferritin as the main monitoring parameter by which to judge the need for iron supplementation in ADH.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^58fc2d1d]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.

### Iron assessment to protect the developing brain [^3431b373]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) before the age of 3 y can lead to long-term neurological deficits despite prompt diagnosis of ID anemia (IDA) by screening of hemoglobin concentrations followed by iron treatment. Furthermore, pre- or nonanemic ID alters neurobehavioral function and is 3 times more common than IDA in toddlers. Given the global prevalence of ID and the enormous societal cost of developmental disabilities across the life span, better methods are needed to detect the risk of inadequate concentrations of iron for brain development (i.e., brain tissue ID) before dysfunction occurs and to monitor its amelioration after diagnosis and treatment. The current screening and treatment strategy for IDA fails to achieve this goal for 3 reasons. First, anemia is the final state in iron depletion. Thus, the developing brain is already iron deficient when IDA is diagnosed owing to the prioritization of available iron to red blood cells over all other tissues during negative iron balance in development. Second, brain ID, independently of IDA, is responsible for long-term neurological deficits. Thus, starting iron treatment after the onset of IDA is less effective than prevention. Multiple studies in humans and animal models show that post hoc treatment strategies do not reliably prevent ID-induced neurological deficits. Third, most currently used indexes of ID are population statistical cutoffs for either hematologic or iron status but are not bioindicators of brain ID and brain dysfunction in children. Furthermore, their relation to brain iron status is not known. To protect the developing brain, there is a need to generate serum measures that index brain dysfunction in the preanemic stage of ID, assess the ability of standard iron indicators to detect ID-induced brain dysfunction, and evaluate the efficacy of early iron treatment in preventing ID-induced brain dysfunction.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scope and evidence on early detection and treatment focus on young children ages 6 to 24 months and show limited direct evidence. No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months with reported health outcomes. In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment for iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The USPSTF previously concluded there was poor evidence of interventions improving health outcomes in asymptomatic children, and in the current review no studies applicable to the U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status due to intervention and improvement in child health outcomes.

How to administer and monitor intravenous ferric carboxymaltose therapy?

Ferric carboxymaltose contains 50 mg iron/mL. A 2 mL ampoule contains 100 mg of iron and a 10 mL ampoule contains 500 mg of iron. The determination of the initial iron need is calculated based on body weight and Hb levels, rather than ferritin or TSAT levels (used to diagnose the presence of iron deficiency) (Figure 1). The maximum recommended cumulative dose of FCM is 1000 mg iron (20 mL FCM)/week.

Intravenous FCM can be given as an injection or infusion. It is easily administered as an undiluted slow bolus injection (100 mg/min, or 15 min for a 1000 mg dose). Note that if administered as an IV infusion, FCM should not be over‐diluted as this affects the stability of the drug. A dilution plan of FCM for IV infusion is displayed in Table 3. Patients should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 min following each IV injection.

Table 3
Dilution plan for ferric carboxymaltose for intravenous infusion

After IV administration of the correction dose, we recommend that iron status be re‐evaluated at 3 months. Early re‐evaluation of iron status (i.e. within 4 weeks of IV iron administration) should be avoided as serum levels of ferritin can increase markedly following administration of IV iron and cannot be utilized as a marker of iron status during this time.

Further iron repletion should be provided as needed. If there is no response or Hb levels decrease, further investigation for other underlying causes should be considered as clinically indicated, particularly occult blood loss. After correction of iron deficiency, as part of routine follow‐up consider re‐evaluation of iron parameters (ferritin and TSAT) 1–2 times per year. Iron status should be re‐evaluated if patients remain symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications, or in the event that Hb levels decrease (Figure 1).

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Iron supplementation, response in iron-deficiency anemia: analysis of five trials [^c51b3a08]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Oral iron-replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia, but it is often poorly tolerated or ineffective. Hemoglobin response at day 14 of oral iron may be useful in assessing whether and when to transition patients from oral to intravenous (IV) iron.

Methods

Pooled data from 5 randomized trials were analyzed to compare oral and IV iron-replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. Treatment criteria and assignment to oral versus IV iron were defined per protocol; this analysis included only subjects receiving oral iron. Responders were subjects with ≥ 1.0-g/dL increases in hemoglobin at day 14, and nonresponders were those with smaller increases. Demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated for association with hemoglobin response at multiple timepoints.

Results

Most subjects (72.8%) were classified as responders. The proportion of subjects with hemoglobin increases ≥ 1.0, ≥ 2.0, and ≥ 3.0 g/dL was greatest among those with postpartum anemia, intermediate among those with heavy uterine bleeding or gastrointestinal-related causes of anemia, and lowest among those with other causes; this proportion was also significantly greater among responders than nonresponders. A ≥ 1.0-g/dL increase in hemoglobin on day 14 most accurately predicted satisfactory overall hemoglobin response to oral iron on day 42/56 (sensitivity 90.1%; specificity 79.3%; positive and negative predictive values of 92.9% and 72.7%, respectively). Iron-replacement therapy improved quality of life and reduced fatigue.

Conclusion

Hemoglobin responses < 1.0 g/dL at day 14 of oral iron identify subjects with iron-deficiency anemia who should be transitioned to IV iron supplementation.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^72338ce7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^e471c185]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and management of pyruvate kinase deficiency in children [^2c6b4bf2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a rare, congenital red blood cell disorder caused by a single gene defect. The spectrum of genotypes, variants, and phenotypes are broad, commonly requiring a multimodal approach including enzyme and genetic testing for accurate and reliable diagnosis. Similarly, management of primary and secondary sequelae of PK deficiency varies, mainly including supportive care with transfusions and surgical interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life. Given the risk of acute and long-term complications of PK deficiency and its treatment, regular monitoring and management of iron burden and organ dysfunction is critical. Therefore, all children and adolescents with PK deficiency should receive regular hematology care with visits at least every 6 months regardless of transfusion status. We continue to learn more about the spectrum of symptoms and complications of PK deficiency and best practice for monitoring and management through registry efforts (NCT03481738). The treatment of PK deficiency has made strides over the last few years with newer disease-modifying therapies being developed and studied, with the potential to change the course of disease in childhood and beyond.

2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

Guideline 4.2 - monitoring of treatment - iron therapy

We recommend regular monitoring of iron status (every 1–3 months) in patients receiving intravenous iron to avoid toxicity (2B): a serum ferritin consistently greater than 800 microgram/L with no evidence of inflammation (normal CRP) may be suggestive of iron overload (1B).

Rationale

Intravenous iron therapy in particular has potential risks as well as benefits. Toxicity associated with high ferritin outcomes was originally reported in the context of multiple transfusions in the pre-ESA era. The risk persists that intravenous iron may reproduce similar toxicity and thus regular monitoring during therapy is required. Similarly with ongoing iron losses on HD regular monitoring to avoid worsening iron deficiency is required. The safety of persistently very high ferritin levels remains unknown. In a cohort of 58,058 prevalent haemodialysis patients in the USA, both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality had increasing rates across increasing ferritin levels, whereas the opposite (inverse) association was observed for TSAT increments. Serum ferritin levels between 200 and 1200 microgram/L and iron saturation ratio between 30 and 50% were associated with the lowest all-cause and cardiovascular death risks. However, association studies are biased by the fact that serum ferritin is also a marker of inflammation. In unadjusted, time-varying model, serum ferritin > 800 microgram/L during each quarter was associated with increased death rate. Significant iron overload in the liver and spleen (assessed through T 2 magnetic resonance) has been described in 19 of 21 HD patients with serum ferritin > 1000 microgram/L and severe comorbidities who were treated with IV iron. Similarly, Rostoker et al. prospectively studied a cohort of 119 fit HD patients who were receiving iron and ESA therapy and measured their liver iron content by means of T 1 and T 2 magnetic resonance. Mild to severe hepatic iron overload was observed in 84% of the patients, 36% of whom had severe iron overload approaching that found in haemocromatosis.

Clinical settings in which more frequent iron testing may be necessary include the following:
Initiation of ESA therapy
Achieving less-than-target Hb level during ongoing ESA therapy
Recent bleeding
After surgery
After hospitalization
Monitoring response after a course of IV iron
Evaluation for ESA hypo-responsiveness

Guideline 4.3 - monitoring during intravenous iron administration

We recommend that resuscitative medication and personnel trained to evaluate and resuscitate anaphylaxis should be present at each administration of intravenous iron. (1A)

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^9a4cae76]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat IDA, first because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Second, as parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful Hb response with a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should therefore be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of IRT, and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant to oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding and concurrent deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

Logistically it may be difficult to arrange monitoring 2 weeks after starting oral IRT in all cases. Indeed because of the lower doses of iron used in alternate day regimens, a 28-day review may be more appropriate. At this point, a rise in Hb of 20 g/L or into the normal range would be accepted as an adequate response. Whichever monitoring regimen is used, intolerance and/or ineffectiveness should be managed promptly and appropriately.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^cc0fa07c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in IBD

Iron supplementation should be administered in all cases of manifest anemia. Cases of iron deficiency without manifest anemia require an individualized approach according to clinical symptoms. In these cases, the timing and type of therapy is determined according to symptoms, etiology, degree of severity and dynamics of the hemoglobin decrease, and the comorbidities and risks of therapy. Iron supplementation can be administered orally or intravenously.

Oral iron administration

Oral iron supplementation has been the therapy of choice for many years. Despite recent recommendations of international expert guidelines, the use of IV iron preparations remains the subject of safety worries and is therefore still widely considered a last resort.

In IBD patients, iron(II) or iron(III) compounds may be administered orally in the absence of absolute indications for IV therapy (see below), and in IBD patients with mild anemia (Hb > 10 g/dL) and inactive disease oral iron replacement can be used. This approach is supported by an the recently published study of Lomer et al and our own data, which showed, that intestinal iron absorption is normal in quiescent or mildly active IBD patients.

However, as more than 90% of ingested iron remains unabsorbed, oral iron supplementation is associated with the frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as nausea, flatulence, diarrhea and gastric erosion. Furthermore, a potential for the exacerbation of IBD through the generation of reactive oxygen species (Fenton reaction) by non-absorbed iron has been revealed in both animal and human studies. Upon initiation of oral iron supplementation, the patient's response, tolerance and adherence should therefore be monitored. Patients showing insufficient response (Hb increase < 2 g/dL within 4 weeks) or intolerance to oral iron, as well those with severe IDA (≤ 10 g/dL) and active disease (CRP > 5 mg/L), should receive IV iron as first-line therapy.

### Daily versus alternate-day iron supplementation for pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized controlled trial [^e7edeba3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the most effective regimen to raise hemoglobin (Hb) by comparing alternate-day dosing of iron to daily dosing in pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia. Women with Hb < 11.0g/dL and ferritin ≤ 25 µg/L between 12 0/7 and 34 0/7 weeks' gestation were recruited. A total of 88 patients were randomized using block randomization with 1:1 allocation to receive either 1 tablet of 325mg ferrous sulfate on consecutive days or 2 tablets every other day. The primary outcome, the change in Hb after 6 weeks of treatment was assessed using an analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline level. Secondary outcomes included change in ferritin, hepcidin, side effects, and compliance. Patients completed a questionnaire to assess for adverse symptoms and adherence was monitored by installing a pill reminder app on smartphones of patients. A total of 88 patients were consented. The daily iron group had a greater proportion of nulliparous women (40 vs. 7%). Most patients (98%) had mild anemia (Hb: 9–10.9g/dL) at recruitment, with a median gestational age of 28.1 weeks (interquartile range [IQR]: 25.6, 30.9) and median duration of treatment of 42 days (IQR: 35, 45). At 6 weeks, the daily iron group had a mean increase in Hb of 0.8 ± 0.9g/dL, whereas the alternate-day iron group had a mean increase of 0.5 ± 1.0g/dL (baseline adjusted difference of means: -0.3 [95% confidence interval: -0.7, 0.1], p = 0.15). Frequency of adverse effects attributable to iron were similar between groups. Patient self-reported compliance to treatment was also similar between groups. Among those that used the app, compliance was higher among the daily group compared with the alternate daily group (median: 95.5% [IQR: 75, 100] vs. 85% [IQR: 40, 92]), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). This trial suggests that there are no significant differences between alternate-day iron supplementation and daily iron supplementation for treating iron deficiency anemia. · Intermittent iron provides no additional benefit compared to daily iron in the treatment of anemia. · Patient compliance to treatment was similar between the groups. · The frequency of side effects was not significantly different between the groups.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^c5673633]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Current situation

In 2013, a study across nine European countries was performed to evaluate the routine practice in the management of IBD-associated anemia. A total of 344 gastroenterologists from nine European countries were surveyed; 56% of the patients had at least moderate anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl), 15% had severe anemia (Hb < 6 g/dl). It was reported that 92% of the patients were treated with iron, but only 28% received intravenous iron (67% oral iron) despite international guidelines that recommend intravenous iron as first-line treatment in moderate to severe IDA in patients with IBD. This demonstrates that intravenous iron remains underused in Europe. There is a need to increase awareness and implementation of the international guidelines. The high prevalence of iron deficiency also indicates that monitoring is not sufficient.

Another paper in 2012 evaluated 631 online patient surveys from patients with IBD and anemia. It was reported that 33% of these patients received no treatment for anemia. Of those treated, only 27% received intravenous iron. Depending on the formulation of oral iron, 68–77% of the patients were dissatisfied with oral iron, mostly because of poor tolerability. In contrast, 72% of the patients treated with intravenous iron were satisfied with their treatment.

### Noninvasive testing… [^b091a7ae]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain. Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency.

Noninvasive Testing Several common conditions associated with IDA can be diagnosed noninvasively, before or after endoscopy. Frequent blood donation, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption syndromes may be suggested by initial evaluation. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Iron Supplementation Oral iron supplementation should be provided for most patients with iron deficiency. Oral iron formulations appear to be similarly effective and tolerated.

Although 150 mg or more of daily elemental iron was previously recommended, studies show improved absorption and tolerability with lower dosing or every-other-day dosing. The hemoglobin level should increase after one month of oral iron supplementation. Lack of hemoglobin change may be because of low adherence, malabsorption, or blood loss. Intravenous iron may be appropriate with malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, or ongoing blood loss. Editor's Note: Dr. Sonoda is the resident representative for AFP. These guidelines from the AGA add specific recommendations for the workup of IDA. The recommendation to diagnose iron deficiency with a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng per mL is consistent with a previous.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^03d50a9e]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO iron status evaluation during ESA therapy — recommendations and rationale: Evaluate iron status (TSAT and ferritin) at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, including the decision to start or continue iron therapy (Not Graded), and test more frequently when initiating or increasing ESA dose, when there is blood loss, when monitoring response after a course of IV iron, and when iron stores may become depleted (Not Graded). The rationale states that in patients on ESA therapy, ferritin and TSAT should be measured at least every 3 months; falling TSAT and/or ferritin likely reflect ongoing blood loss or consumption of iron stores and can be used to anticipate the need for future or additional iron supplementation; and in patients on oral iron, testing can assess adherence. Increasing TSAT and/or ferritin may indicate excessive treatment that can be stopped or reduced, whereas increasing ferritin with stable or declining TSAT may indicate inflammation, infection, or other clinical situations requiring reassessment of continued iron administration; more frequent testing may be appropriate following initiation of ESA or iron therapy or when ESA dose or dose frequency is increased, and iron status testing is important in assessing patients who become less responsive to ESA treatment.

2.1 Important Pre-Treatment Information

Discontinue administration of any iron-containing products prior to administration of INFeD.

Assess baseline hematologic (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin) to monitor response to therapy.

Administer a test dose of INFeD prior to administration of therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Iron Deficiency Anemia

Calculate the INFeD dose based upon Table 1 and formulas below. Continue INFeD until hemoglobin is within the normal range and iron stores are replete.

Administer daily doses of no more than 2 mL of INFeD until the total required dose is administered. Monitor response to therapy by evaluating hematologic parameters (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin). Iron storage parameters may improve prior to hematologic parameters. Serum ferritin may not be an accurate measure of body iron stores in patients on chronic dialysis.

Conclusions

This anaemia service evaluation confirms the real-world effectiveness and safety of IIM for the treatment of ID/IDA in patients with gastroenterological disorders. This study supports existing findings that patients with gastroenterological disorders have a high iron need. Ideally, patients should be systematically monitored during the 6- to 12-month period following intravenous iron treatment to capture a decrease in ferritin levels, and prompt a consideration of the need for retreatment to prevent the recurrence of ID/IDA.

### Evaluation and management of iron deficiency in children undergoing intestinal rehabilitation – A position paper from the NASPGHAN intestinal rehabilitation special interest group [^0517de86]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Monitoring while receiving treatment and preventing iron overload — children with intestinal failure (IF) undergoing intestinal rehabilitation (IR): If treatment is initiated due to biochemical iron deficiency (ID), monitoring should include hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), and transferrin saturation (TSAT); for severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA), evaluation of the response will typically need to occur 1 month after treatment completion, whereas milder ID or ID without anemia may be monitored every 3–6 months, and serum hepcidin can be considered when the diagnosis of ID is unclear. We recommend assessing response to treatment every 3–6 months for children with ID without IDA and we recommend assessing response to treatment every 1–3 months for children with IDA. Monitoring for complications must be considered, particularly in those on intravenous supplementation or with underlying hemochromatosis because iron overload can occur, liver enzymes and platelet counts are monitored routinely in this population, and increased serum iron can impair phagocytosis and increase the risk for infection and sepsis.

The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Monitoring recovery from iron deficiency using total hemoglobin mass [^5f2c0cd9]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Using hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) to diagnose borderline iron deficiency and monitor the progress of its treatment is difficult because of the confounding effects of plasma volume. Because hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is not affected by plasma volume, it may be a more sensitive parameter. The aim of this study was to monitor Hbmass, iron storage, and maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) during and after oral iron therapy in subjects with severe and moderate iron deficiency.

Methods

Three groups of female recreational athletes were monitored for at least 22 wk, as follows: 1) severe iron deficiency group (SID) (n = 8; ferritin, ≤ 12 ng·mL), 2) moderate iron deficiency group (MID) (n = 14; ferritin, ≤ 25 ng·mL), and 3) control group (n = 8; ferritin, > 25 ng·mL). Hbmass and iron status were determined before, during, and up to 12 wk after at least 10 wk of oral iron supplementation. In total, five V˙O2max tests were performed before, during, and after the supplementation period.

Results

Hbmass increased markedly in the SID group (15.6% ± 11.0%, P < 0.001) and slightly in the MID group (2.2% ± 3.7%, P < 0.05) by the end of the supplementation period and remained at this level for the following 12 wk. [Hb] and Hbmass were similarly affected, but Hbmass was more closely related to mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin than [Hb]. The SID group incorporated 534 ± 127 mg of iron into ferritin and hemoglobin, whereas the MID group incorporated 282 ± 68 mg of iron. V˙O2max increased only in the SID group by 0.20 ± 0.18 L·min (P < 0.05) and was closely related to Hbmass (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Hbmass is a sensitive tool for monitoring recovery from iron deficiency anemia and assessing the effectiveness of iron supplementation in individuals with severe or moderate iron deficiency.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^57e766ad]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease

A third of patients with active IBD are estimated to have iron deficiency, though other mechanisms including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, marrow suppression due to the anaemia of chronic disease, and overt blood loss may all contribute to the anaemic state.SF levels of up to 100 µg/L in the presence of inflammation may still reflect iron deficiency, and so an estimate of transferrin saturation may be helpful. The absorption of oral iron may be impaired by the systemic inflammatory process, as well as by small bowel involvement and/or previous surgery, and this may favour intravenous IRT in some cases.

Current European guidelines suggest that oral IRT in patients with IBD should contain no more than 100 mg elemental iron a day. Intravenous iron is indicated for those who are intolerant of oral iron and have moderate to severe IDA (Hb < 100 g/L). Optimising nutritional and pharmacological management to bring active IBD into remission would be expected to help improve IDA metrics and response to iron therapy.

It has been suggested that patients with IBD and IDA should be monitored for recurrent iron deficiency every 3 months for at least a year after correction, and periodically thereafter. Recurrent IDA may indicate persistent intestinal inflammatory activity even in the face of clinical remission and normal inflammatory biomarkers.

### Anaemia management in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: routine practice across nine European countries [^e000dce6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Anaemia and iron deficiency (ID) are common complications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In patients undergoing iron therapy, intravenous iron supplementation is recommended in preference to oral therapy. This study evaluated routine practice in the management of IBD-associated anaemia and ID to verify implementation of international treatment guidelines.

Materials and Methods

Gastroenterologists from nine European countries (n = 344) were surveyed about their last five IBD patients treated for anaemia (n = 1404). Collected information included tests performed at anaemia diagnosis, haemoglobin (Hb) levels and iron status parameters, the anaemia treatment given and, if applicable, the iron administration route.

Results

Selection of diagnostic tests and treatment for IBD-associated anaemia varied considerably across Europe. Anaemia and iron status were mainly assessed by Hb (88%) and serum ferritin (75%). Transferrin saturation was only tested in 25% of patients. At diagnosis of anaemia, 56% presented with at least moderate anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) and 15% with severe anaemia (Hb < 8 g/dl). ID (ferritin < 30 ng/ml) was detected in 76%. Almost all patients (92%) received iron supplementation; however, only 28% received intravenous iron and 67% oral iron. Management practice was similar in 2009 and 2011.

Conclusion

In clinical practice, most IBD patients received oral iron even though this administration route may aggravate the disease, and despite international guidelines recommending intravenous administration as the preferred route. The high frequency of ID suggests insufficient monitoring of iron status in IBD patients. There is a need to increase awareness and implementation of international guidelines on iron supplementation in patients with IBD.

Follow up

The goal of iron supplementation should always be complete normalization of Hb and iron storage. It should be kept in mind that even after normalization of Hb levels, iron storages are still not filled up because anemia is only the end point of iron deficiency. Iron treatments should be followed up clinically and using laboratory tests at least within 4 weeks in asymptomatic patients and more frequently in symptomatic patients. An important surveillance factor is the wellbeing of the patient. Clinically, QoL can improve within a few days after initiation of iron therapy and previous symptoms of anemia decrease.

An adequate erythropoietic response has been defined as an increase of Hb of at least 2 g/dl or normalization within 4 weeks. As described above, reticulocyte count and reticulocyte production index are faster parameters of successful treatment and will be increased within 1–2 weeks following oral or intravenous iron with or without EPO.

As described above, iron storage can be assessed using ferritin and transferrin saturation. During oral or intravenous iron supplementation, transferrin saturation can be falsely elevated. Ferritin levels also overestimate the iron available for erythropoiesis in the bone marrow during intravenous iron treatment. Therefore, assessment of iron storage should only be performed a minimum of 4 weeks after the last intravenous iron application. After termination of iron therapy, the parameters of iron storage should be above the lower limits of normal. A recent study has pointed out that the time until reoccurrence of iron deficiency in patients with IBD can be delayed with higher post-treatment ferritin values above 100 μg and even more so above 400 μg/liter. However, it was suggested that a ferritin level of 800 μg/liter and a transferrin saturation of 50% should be used as upper limits for intravenous iron to prevent iron overload.

Patients on oral iron should be monitored clinically about tolerability and side effects. In oral iron therapy, ferritin can be used for monitoring during treatment and is expected to increase within 1–2 weeks and Hb levels should also be monitored.

If a patient is on oral iron and the erythropoetic response is not adequate, or if oral iron is not tolerated, the patient should be switched to intravenous iron. If treatment with intravenous iron is not successful, other causes of anemia should be reevaluated. If (concomitant) ACD is possible, additional use of erythropoietin-stimulating factors should be considered. Optimal treatment of the underlying IBD is also an important factor in the treatment of anemia at all levels.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and iron deficiency: CLEVER trial design and protocol [^2ba4c09e]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

HbA1c is the gold standard for glycemic control in pre-diabetes and diabetes. However, its validity has been questioned, especially in the presence of imbalanced iron homeostasis. The CLEVER trial aims to evaluate the relationship between iron deficiency and HbA1c (a biomarker for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of type 2 diabetes) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial.

Methods

The CLEVER (intravenous ferric CarboxymaLtosE for improVement of mEtabolic parameters in type 2 diabetes patients with iRon deficiency) trial is a randomized, single-blind, proof-of-concept study with two treatment arms. 140 men and women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and iron deficiency will receive either placebo or ferric carboxymaltose (500 or 1000 mg) as intravenous infusions. The primary outcome measure is the change in HbA1c level between baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints include change of iron status and metabolic markers as well as treatment safety and tolerability. Furthermore, the potential clinical improvement in quality of life and the reliability of HbA1c measurement in patients with type 2 diabetes and iron deficiency will be investigated.

Results

Both excessive iron and iron deficiency are associated with metabolic disorders; excessive iron is a risk factor for the development of diabetes, whereas iron deficiency is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. It has been suggested that iron increases insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. CLEVER is the first study to investigate the hypothesis that intravenous substitution with ferric carboxymaltose reduces HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and iron deficiency, thereby improving metabolic status and quality of life.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^7e0a572d]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe 2+ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy, and their use is not recommended.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^b723149d]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia — intravenous (IV) iron dosing and monitoring thresholds: An initial course of IV iron amounting to approximately 1000 mg is common practice and may be repeated if hemoglobin does not rise and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose cannot be decreased and if transferrin saturation (TSAT) remains ≤ 30% with serum ferritin ≤ 500 ng/ml (≤ 500 μg/l); serum ferritin and TSAT should not be measured until at least one week after the most recent IV iron dose. In CKD 5HD, iron loss related to hemodialysis has been reported between 1–2 g of iron per year, and an apparent ongoing need for iron supplementation in CKD ND or CKD 5PD patients, or for more than 1–2 g/yr in CKD 5HD patients, should trigger a search for a source of blood loss; in CKD 5PD, IV iron is often provided at periodic (e.g., monthly) visits. Two approaches to ongoing IV iron in CKD 5HD are described — periodic iron repletion in response to iron status tests versus maintenance treatment with smaller doses at regular intervals to maintain iron test parameters — and limited evidence suggests regular maintenance IV iron is associated with use of lower ESA doses and may result in lower cumulative iron doses.

### When should iron supplementation in dialysis patients be avoided, minimized or withdrawn? [^d01dfce1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Medium credibility.

Most hepatologists avoid iron therapy (oral and parenteral) in HCV‐infected patients without kidney disease with the goal of avoiding a rise in viral replication, aggravation of histological lesions, and HCC development. 56 However, in ESRD patients it is impossible to withhold iron supplementation due to recurrent blood loss which invariably results in depletion of iron stores and severe iron deficiency. 6, 38 Thus, iron replacement should be used cautiously with careful monitoring in HCV‐infected ESRD patients. 38 It was recently proposed to use in this setting the minimalist Japanese strategy applying to iron therapy. 38, 57, 58

The Japanese Society for Dialysis, out of concern for iron overload, proposed as early as 2011 that minimal IV iron (up to 650 mg in the induction phase) be given to hemodialysis patients and only in cases of true iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg/L), and also warned against maintenance IV iron therapy. 57 This careful strategy of iron repletion allowed adequate hemoglobin levels with low ferritin, moderate transferrin saturation without any detrimental effect on survival and was again advocated this year for Japanese dialysis populations. 58, 59, 60

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — anaemia and iron status management notes that preliminary data indicate that iron deficiency may be associated with reduced exercise capacity, and perhaps also with a higher mortality, independent of the presence or severity of anaemia; based on these data, regular monitoring of iron status should be considered in patients with PAH and iron deficiency, and iron substitution should be considered in patients with iron deficiency; some studies suggest that oral iron absorption is impaired in patients with PAH, so i.v. iron administration may be preferred, although controlled trials are lacking.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Mircera [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Individualization of Dosing

Individualize and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL for adult patients. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — anaemia and iron management defines iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 μg/L, or serum ferritin 100–299 μg/L and transferrin saturation < 20%, and recommends regular monitoring of iron status. In patients with severe iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] < 7–8 g/dL), i.v. supplementation is recommended, while oral ferrous formulations are often poorly tolerated and efficacy may be impaired; one small open-label study suggested good tolerability and efficacy of ferric maltol in severe pulmonary hypertension with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency and anaemia, but two small, 12 week, randomized, cross-over trials in PAH without anaemia showed no significant clinical benefit, and randomized controlled trials comparing oral vs i.v. iron are lacking.

### Use of magnetic resonance imaging to monitor iron overload [^54a0de5c]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of iron overload requires robust estimates of total-body iron burden and its response to iron chelation therapy. Compliance with chelation therapy varies considerably among patients, and individual reporting is notoriously unreliable. Even with perfect compliance, intersubject variability in chelator effectiveness is extremely high, necessitating reliable iron estimates to guide dose titration. In addition, each chelator has a unique profile with respect to clearing iron stores from different organs. This article presents the tools available to clinicians to monitor their patients, focusing on noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging methods because they have become the de facto standard of care.
