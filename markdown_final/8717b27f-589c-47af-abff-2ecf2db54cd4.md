## Question

Side effects of sleep apnea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects and complications of sleep apnea, focusing on obstructive sleep apnea and how the evidence fits together. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prevalence to frame risk. Then, I should delineate the core pathophysiologic mechanisms that plausibly drive multisystem effects. Next, I will categorize complications by organ system: cardiovascular, metabolic/endocrine, neurocognitive, and functional/safety. After that, I need to consider respiratory and sleep-specific comorbidities as well as treatment-emergent issues and perioperative risk. Finally, I will examine mortality data, evidence quality and controversies, phenotype heterogeneity and precision medicine implications, and synthesize clinical takeaways and guideline-aligned management considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep causing reduced or absent airflow, leading to sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia; moderate-to-severe OSA affects about 13% of men and 6% of women aged 30–70 in the US and is substantially underrecognized in routine care, which amplifies the burden of preventable complications [^113Hxugf]. Hold on, I should verify heterogeneity as it matters for outcomes; yes, OSA is a heterogeneous disorder with variable symptoms and susceptibility to end-organ effects, which will influence how "side effects" manifest across individuals [^114cWKqq].

> Next, I should review the core mechanisms that plausibly link OSA to multisystem harm. The recurring pattern of intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic inflammation is consistently described, forming the mechanistic substrate for cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive sequelae; let me double-check that endothelial injury and autonomic surges are emphasized across sources, and they are [^115NCoVy] [^114cKhNd]. Wait, I should also note that standard severity metrics like AHI incompletely capture physiologic burden, which is one reason outcome associations can appear inconsistent [^115gEpKE].

> I will now examine cardiovascular complications, since that's where the evidence is strongest. OSA is linked to hypertension (including resistant forms), coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, stroke, and broader cardiovascular morbidity; I need to ensure I'm not overclaiming causality — observational associations are consistent, but large RCTs of CPAP have not uniformly reduced hard cardiovascular events, which I'll address shortly [^113Hxugf] [^116EFF7p]. Hold on, let me verify the RCT controversy: contemporary syntheses note neutral primary outcomes in multiple trials, underscoring that cardiovascular risk modification with CPAP may be phenotype- and adherence-dependent rather than uniform across all comers [^113TH2sZ].

> Now, metabolic and endocrine consequences. Let me consider insulin resistance and diabetes first: OSA is common in type 2 diabetes and independently associates with worse glycemic control (higher HbA1c) even after accounting for adiposity; the only randomized trial testing CPAP's effect on HbA1c was disappointing, potentially due to insufficient nightly use that misses REM-predominant apneas later in the night — yes, that timing and adherence explanation fits [^111tQvWX]. I should also note broader cardiometabolic clustering with inflammatory and vascular biomarkers that portend diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, although we still need better prognostic markers for precision risk stratification [^11316hJ9] [^114cKhNd].

> Let me review neurocognitive and neurodegenerative impacts. OSA-related sleep fragmentation and hypoxia are implicated in deficits in attention, processing speed, learning, and working memory; OSA-induced brain injury has been described, with neuroinflammation and intermittent hypoxia as plausible drivers; and importantly, most studies suggest PAP is associated with reduced incidence or delayed onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, which I should explicitly confirm — yes, nine of eleven studies report protective associations with PAP [^112YwTbU] [^116t2o9p] [^113Hxugf]. But wait, I should acknowledge variability: preconditioning phenomena and phenotype differences may influence who benefits most and to what degree [^112YwTbU].

> Next, I should assess functional and safety consequences. Excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired vigilance, and reduced productivity are common and drive increased risks of motor vehicle crashes and occupational injuries; treatment that alleviates sleepiness improves health-related quality of life and safety metrics, but let me verify guideline alignment on treating symptomatic patients — AASM recommends PAP to address excessive sleepiness in adults with OSA, which fits here [^115PdHb7] [^116f93ot] [^113zKF1W].

> I need to check respiratory and sleep-specific comorbidities and atypical symptoms. Beyond classic snoring and sleepiness, patients may have insomnia, nightmares, PLMD/RLS, bruxism, nocturia, GERD, chronic cough, dysphagia, and morning headaches; these nonclassical symptoms complicate recognition and often co-occur with OSA, affecting management strategies [^115PbcUM]. But wait, what about airway diseases? There is a reciprocal interaction between OSA and asthma that can worsen control and remodeling, and sleep-related issues are also relevant in COPD care even if evidence for screening impact is limited to date [^113n929N] [^114UikHw].

> I should review treatment-emergent and perioperative issues because they can be construed as "side effects" or associated risks. Undiagnosed OSA increases postoperative respiratory and cardiac complications, including atrial fibrillation; many centers use STOP-BANG for preoperative risk triage and emphasize perioperative monitoring and PAP optimization when feasible — let me confirm that structured preop strategies are recommended, and they are [^111Wk1nh] [^116bZE7z]. Medication interactions can also modify sleep architecture (for example, TCAs/SSRIs reducing REM and sleep efficiency), which can confound symptom expression; wake-promoting agents for residual sleepiness like solriamfetol improve alertness but can raise blood pressure and heart rate modestly, so I need to be precise that these hemodynamic changes reflect drug effects rather than OSA per se [^114nsxSV] [^115LhMJY]. Finally, treatment-emergent central sleep apnea is a recognized phenomenon in some patients initiating PAP and may warrant phenotype-based approaches such as adaptive servo-ventilation when persistent, after excluding other causes [^116uuHm3].

> Let me consider mortality and severe outcomes. Long-term observational data and guideline syntheses note associations with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death, and certain cardiac populations warrant targeted screening for sleep apnea, including those with VT, tachy-brady and sick sinus syndromes, stroke, and survivors of sudden cardiac death; I should also note pandemic-era data suggesting higher mortality in some OSA-treated cohorts with COVID-19, though confounding by comorbidity is likely [^113Hxugf] [^116EFF7p] [^113r1i9W].

> Hold on, I should verify heterogeneity, limitations of AHI, and the precision medicine pivot, because this frames why "side effects" vary widely. AHI poorly predicts adverse outcomes and response to therapy in many settings; alternative metrics such as hypoxic burden and autonomic signatures may better stratify cardiovascular risk, aligning with the shift toward phenotype-based care that distinguishes "symptomatic" and "vulnerable cardiovascular" phenotypes and tailors PAP goals accordingly [^117T5FAV] [^112gS9Tz] [^113TH2sZ]. Let me reconsider: this does not mean AHI is useless, but I need to emphasize that it is insufficient alone for prognostication and treatment selection in many patients [^114cWKqq].

> Next, I should review evidence quality and controversies to avoid overstating benefits or harms. Randomized trials such as SAVE-class trials have generally not shown that CPAP reduces major cardiovascular events in secondary prevention populations, likely reflecting phenotype heterogeneity, suboptimal adherence, and the insensitivity of AHI-based selection; however, symptom relief, quality-of-life improvement, blood pressure reductions in sleepy/high-burden patients, and potential cognitive benefits remain well supported, so a nuanced message is warranted [^113TH2sZ] [^113Hxugf] [^113Q8vZJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied uniform cardiovascular risk modification with PAP; I should correct that to emphasize targeted benefit in selected phenotypes with sufficient nightly use, rather than a universal event-reduction effect [^113TH2sZ].

> Finally, I need to synthesize clinical implications. Sleep apnea's side effects constitute a multisystem burden mediated by intermittent hypoxia, autonomic dysregulation, and sleep fragmentation, manifesting as daytime sleepiness and impaired function in the short term and as hypertension, arrhythmias (especially AF), CAD, HF, stroke, diabetes/metabolic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and increased mortality risk over time; effective therapy improves symptoms and quality of life but may not reverse established cardiovascular disease, underscoring the value of early identification and phenotype-aware treatment using PAP, oral appliances, weight loss, and related strategies aligned with guidelines [^113Hxugf] [^113zKF1W] [^117B7Ltp] [^113Um96J].

Sleep apnea causes **daytime sleepiness** [^115PbcUM] and **cognitive impairment** [^112YwTbU] due to repeated nocturnal hypoxia and arousals [^113Hxugf]. It increases risk of **hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke, and coronary artery disease** [^116EFF7p] through sympathetic activation [^115NCoVy], oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction [^115NCoVy]. Metabolic effects include **insulin resistance**, **type 2 diabetes** [^111tQvWX], and dyslipidemia [^115PbcUM]; mood disorders, sexual dysfunction, and **reduced quality of life** [^115PdHb7] are common. Untreated OSA raises risks [^115PbcUM] of motor vehicle accidents [^116f93ot], perioperative complications [^111Wk1nh], and early mortality [^113Hxugf]. Treatment with CPAP [^113zKF1W] or oral appliances [^117B7Ltp] improves symptoms and may reduce cardiovascular risk [^113TH2sZ].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

Sleep apnea is strongly associated with **cardiovascular complications**, including:

- **Hypertension**: Repeated hypoxia and arousals drive sympathetic activation [^115NCoVy] and endothelial dysfunction, promoting hypertension [^116EFF7p].

- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias [^116EFF7p] from autonomic instability [^115NCoVy] and hypoxemia.

- **Heart failure**: Higher risk of incident and worsening heart failure [^116EFF7p], especially with central sleep apnea [^115Q6Sp2].

- **Coronary artery disease and stroke**: Elevated risk of myocardial infarction and stroke [^116EFF7p] via inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction [^115NCoVy].

---

## Neurological and cognitive side effects

Sleep apnea significantly impacts **neurological and cognitive function**:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Deficits in attention, memory, and executive function [^115PbcUM] from intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation [^112YwTbU].

- **Mood disorders**: Higher rates of depression, anxiety, and irritability [^115PbcUM] due to chronic sleep disruption [^112YwTbU] and hypoxia [^114cKhNd].

- **Daytime sleepiness**: Excessive sleepiness [^115PbcUM] increases accident risk [^116f93ot] and impairs daily functioning [^115PdHb7].

---

## Metabolic side effects

Sleep apnea is linked to significant **metabolic disturbances**:

- **Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes**: Intermittent hypoxia [^115PbcUM] and sleep fragmentation worsen insulin resistance and diabetes risk [^111tQvWX].

- **Dyslipidemia**: Altered lipid metabolism [^115PbcUM] increases cardiovascular risk [^115NCoVy].

- **Obesity**: Bidirectional relationship with obesity [^114cKhNd], worsening metabolic syndrome [^115PbcUM].

---

## Respiratory side effects

Sleep apnea impairs **respiratory health**, notably causing **chronic hypoxemia** [^115PbcUM] — recurrent apneas lead to intermittent hypoxemia [^115PbcUM] that contributes to pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain [^115NCoVy] — and, in severe cases, progression to **respiratory failure**, including chronic respiratory failure.

---

## Psychological and quality of life impacts

Sleep apnea significantly reduces **quality of life**, with chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and mood disturbances limiting daily activities and social interactions [^113Hxugf] [^115PdHb7], and it confers **increased accident risk**, as daytime sleepiness [^115PbcUM] raises motor vehicle and occupational accident risk [^116f93ot] [^113Hxugf].

---

## Long-term health consequences

Untreated sleep apnea leads to **severe long-term health consequences**, including **increased mortality**, with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^115PbcUM], and **chronic diseases** [^115PdHb7], reflecting a greater risk of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease [^115NCoVy], diabetes [^111tQvWX], and respiratory failure.

---

## Treatment and management

Effective management of sleep apnea prioritizes **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** [^113zKF1W] as first-line therapy that improves symptoms and may reduce cardiovascular risk [^113TH2sZ]. Oral appliances are alternatives for patients intolerant of CPAP [^117B7Ltp] [^113PaXWG], and lifestyle modifications [^115PbcUM] — such as weight loss, exercise, and alcohol avoidance — improve outcomes [^113Um96J].

---

Sleep apnea causes **multisystem morbidity** [^114cKhNd] across cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, and respiratory domains, with substantial quality-of-life and mortality impacts; **timely diagnosis and treatment are essential** [^111prfud] to reduce these risks.

### Sleep apnea: Types, mechanisms, and clinical cardiovascular consequences [^115NCoVy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease. These disordered breathing events are associated with a profile of perturbations that include intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which are critical mediators of cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke.

Several discoveries in the pathogenesis, along with developments in the treatment of sleep apnea, have accumulated in recent years. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of sleep apnea, the evidence that addresses the links between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, and research that has addressed the effect of sleep apnea treatment on cardiovascular disease and clinical endpoints. Finally, we review the recent development in sleep apnea treatment options, with special consideration of treating patients with heart disease. Future directions for selective areas are suggested.

### The impact of sleep and hypoxia on the brain: potential mechanisms for the effects of obstructive sleep apnea [^112YwTbU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, highly prevalent, multisystem disease, which is still largely underdiagnosed. Its most prominent risk factors, obesity and older age, are on the rise, and its prevalence is expected to grow further. The last few years have seen an exponential increase in studies to determine the impact of OSA on the central nervous system. OSA-induced brain injury is now a recognized clinical entity, although its possible dual relationship with several other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders is debated. The putative neuromechanisms behind some of the effects of OSA on the central nervous system are discussed in this review, focusing on nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation.

- **Recent findings**: Recent preclinical and clinical findings suggest that neurogenic ischemic preconditioning occurs in some OSA patients, and it may partly explain variability in clinical findings at the time of writing. However, the distinct parameters of the interplay between ischemic preconditioning, neuroinflammation, sleep fragmentation, and cerebrovascular changes in OSA-induced brain injury are still largely unclear, requiring further research.

- **Summary**: Early diagnosis and intervention in patients with OSA are of paramount importance. Future clinical studies should utilize multimodal investigative approaches to enable more reliable referencing for the acuity of the pathological process, as well as its reversibility following treatment.

### More than sleepiness: Prevalence and relevance of nonclassical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea [^115PbcUM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that affects nearly one billion people worldwide, leading to substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial and societal costs. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in two major pathophysiological consequences: arterial oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. The typical OSA syndrome is represented by an overweight male patient who reports heavy snoring, witnessed apneas, nocturnal gasping, excessive daytime sleepiness, and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.

This standard picture contrasts with a subgroup of individuals who do not report discomfort at night, do not complain about sleepiness at all, or have unusual symptoms such as bruxism, morning headache, nocturia, acid reflux, chronic cough, and dysphagia, which are not directly linked with the nocturnal breathing problem. Due to these nonspecific symptoms, OSA often remains undiagnosed. Additionally, intrinsic sleep disorders can coincide with or be provoked by OSA, including nightmares, chronic insomnia disorder, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and restless legs syndrome (RLS), among others. When these conditions occur together, implications for therapeutic management may arise. This review presents current data regarding the prevalence of these atypical symptoms and concomitant sleep disorders, along with their clinical relevance.

### Impact of sleep apnea on economics [^115PdHb7]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) alters sleep quality and is associated with sleepiness and decreased cognitive functioning. It has therefore always been recognized as a major public health issue with potential societal consequences, including accidents, increased morbidity, and cognitive deficits that impair work efficiency. The number of patients diagnosed and treated for OSA has increased drastically in the last few years. In response to this epidemic, health authorities have encouraged studies investigating how patients cope with OSA and its diagnosis, comparing ambulatory to hospital-based polysomnography.

Based on epidemiological knowledge, this review aims to carefully describe the possible links between sleep apnea and public health concerns, along with identifying the certitudes and missing data concerning the consequences of sleep apnea on accidents, work economics, and health-related quality of life.

### Circulating biomarkers to identify cardiometabolic complications in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: A systematic review [^11316hJ9]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and myocardial infarction. However, it is difficult to predict which patients are at particularly high risk. This systematic review aimed to identify potentially useful circulating biomarkers that could predict cardiometabolic complications in OSA. We searched the Cochrane EBM, EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. Search concepts included "obstructive sleep apnea", "biomarkers", and "risk-stratification". Manuscripts were included if they studied adults with OSA, circulating (blood) markers, and relationships with clinical outcomes. After screening, ten studies were included. These studies addressed cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and metabolic syndrome. In general, levels of inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules, and vascular proteins were associated with the presence of cardiometabolic disease in OSA patients. Although studies regarding prognostic circulating biomarkers in OSA are limited, a number of potentially promising biomarkers were identified in our review. However, more research is needed using prospective cohorts to determine which biomarkers are most robustly associated with, and useful in predicting future cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae in OSA patients. Identification of such biomarkers could guide more selective and targeted therapy for OSA in an emerging era of precision-based medicine.

### The PAP-RES algorithm: Defining who, why and how to use positive airway pressure therapy for OSA [^112gS9Tz]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Untreated OSA negatively impacts health-related quality of life and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Despite available data suggesting that cardiovascular risk might differ according to clinical phenotypes and comorbidities, approaches to OSA treatment usually take a "one size fits all" approach. Identification of cardiovascular vulnerability biomarkers and clinical phenotypes associated with the response to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy could help redefine the standard treatment paradigm.

The new PAP-RES (PAP-RESponsive) algorithm is based on the identification of OSA phenotypes likely to impact therapeutic goals and modalities. The paradigm shift is to propose a simplified approach that defines therapeutic goals based on OSA phenotype: from a predominantly "symptomatic phenotype" (individuals with a high symptom burden that negatively impacts daily life and/or accident risk or clinically significant insomnia) to a "vulnerable cardiovascular phenotype" (individuals with comorbidities [serious cardiovascular or respiratory disease or obesity] that have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis or a biomarker of hypoxic burden and/or autonomic nervous system dysfunction). Each phenotype requires a different PAP therapy care pathway based on differing health issues and treatment objectives.

### Diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^113Hxugf]. CMAJ (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on obstructive sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: OSA is a condition characterized by recurring episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to cyclic reduction or cessation in airflow.

- **Pathophysiology**: OSA is caused by periods of dynamic airway collapse during sleep. Factors that increase the risk of collapse include obesity, male sex, postmenopausal state, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, maxillary insufficiency, retrognathia, polycystic ovarian disease, androgen supplementation, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15) in adults (30–70 years of age) is estimated at 13% in men and 6% in women.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations of OSA include reduced sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Long-term complications include arrhythmias, hypertension, cardiovascular events, stroke, impaired cognitive function, depression, and even premature death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Regular CPAP use is associated with an improvement in sleep apnea symptoms and health-related quality of life. Randomized studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events.

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine systematic review, meta-analysis, and GRADE assessment [^113Ta2sb]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review provides supporting evidence for the accompanying clinical practice guideline on the treatment of central sleep apnea (CSA) syndrome in adults.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of positive airway pressure therapies (PAP), non-PAP therapies, and pharmacological treatment to no treatment to improve patient-important outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical meaningfulness of using various interventions to treat CSA in adults. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations.

- **Results**: The literature search resulted in 6,701 articles, out of which 103 articles provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in adults: Common questions and answers [^113PaXWG]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to oral appliances, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering the offer of educational or behavioral resources; a nasal mask; humidified air; mandibular advancement devices; or a referral for upper airway surgery in patients intolerant of or otherwise nonadherent to positive airway pressure therapy.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^114cWKqq]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a substantial clinical and public health problem because it contributes to harmful effects on quality of life, daytime symptoms, road traffic incidents, and cardiometabolic disease. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnoea is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, with patients exhibiting varied susceptibility to long-term complications and different responses to treatment. This narrative review summarizes the knowledge of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea, particularly highlighting the role of symptom clusters, polysomnogram phenotypes, physiological endotypes, and circulating biomarkers in defining subtypes. In the near future, the prognostic accuracy of these measures in predicting long-term complications in obstructive sleep apnoea will likely be improved, together with better matching of treatments to disease subtypes.

The ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines specifically address the management of patients with heart failure (HF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). They recommend considering the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy to improve sleep quality and reduce daytime sleepiness in these patients.

### Enhancing public health and safety by diagnosing and treating obstructive sleep apnea in the transportation industry: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^116f93ot]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may lead to serious health, safety, and financial implications, including sleepiness-related crashes and incidents, in workers who perform safety-sensitive functions in the transportation industry. Evidence and expert consensus support its identification and treatment in high-risk commercial operators. An Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the diagnosis and treatment of OSA in commercial truck and rail operators was issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and Federal Railroad Administration, but it was later withdrawn. This reversal has led to questions about whether efforts to identify and treat OSA are warranted.

In the absence of clear directives, we urge key stakeholders, including clinicians and patients, to engage in a collaborative approach to address OSA by following, at a minimum, the 2016 guidelines issued by a Medical Review Board of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, alone or in combination with 2006 guidance by a joint task force. The standard of care demands action to mitigate the serious health and safety risks of OSA.

### Arousability in obstructive sleep apnea: Friend or foe [^114Z65FH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Similarly, although it is difficult to imagine why a shorter apnea should be more harmful than a longer one when viewed in the light of its lesser downstream effects, it is easy to envision some upstream predisposing host factor that prematurely causes apnea termination (the authors call it "arousability"). It is possible that the mortality risk demonstrated in this study stems not from the shorter apneas per se, but rather from this predisposing factor. If this is the case, then treatment of OSA in these individuals would not be expected to confer a mortality benefit, as treatment would decrease the frequency of apneas and apnea-related arousals but would not be expected to improve arousability itself.

On the other hand, it is possible that increased arousability exerts its effects through sleep fragmentation. However, that explanation is not borne out by the data, as sleep efficiency was not different between the groups. Why might one patient be more arousable than another? Genetic factors surely play a role, and the authors have previously described a genetic locus associated with apnea duration. Other predisposing factors, such as frailty, unrecognized physical or mental illness, and sympathetic overactivity, might also contribute.

The study has some limitations. Because the subjects were drawn from a community-based sample, there was a paucity of severe cases. Only 12% of the subjects had severe OSA, and the mean apnea length in the longest quartile was only 27.8 seconds, which is not long enough to result in the profound hypoxemia that is often seen in clinic populations.

### Sleep disordered breathing in the elderly [^1162fqEi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing, especially obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has a high prevalence among the elderly, where it may present with atypical symptoms. Untreated OSA can reduce quality of life and have adverse health consequences. Effective treatment is available, so all physicians treating the elderly should be aware of the clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, and treatment options for OSA.

### Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea overlap: What has the evidence taught us [^113n929N]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma are highly prevalent chronic respiratory disorders. Beyond their frequent coexistence arising from their high prevalence and shared risk factors, these disorders feature a reciprocal interaction whereby each disease impacts the severity of the other. Emerging evidence implicates airway and systemic inflammation, neuroimmune interactions, and effects of asthma-controlling medications (corticosteroids) as factors that predispose patients with asthma to OSA. Conversely, undiagnosed or inadequately treated OSA adversely affects asthma control, partly via effects of intermittent hypoxia on airway inflammation and tissue remodeling. In this article, we review multiple lines of recently published evidence supporting this interaction. We provide a set of recommendations for clinicians involved in the care of adults with asthma and identify critical gaps in our knowledge about this overlap.

### The treatment of central sleep apnea syndromes in adults: Practice parameters with an evidence-based literature review and meta-analyses [^115cuqSt]. Sleep (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for central sleep apnea, specifically in relation to hypnotics, the AASM 2012 guidelines recommend considering the use of zolpidem or triazolam for patients with idiopathic CSA, only in the absence of underlying risk factors for respiratory depression.

### Definition, discrimination, diagnosis and treatment of central breathing disturbances during sleep [^113rCT9V]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for central sleep apnea, particularly in patients with high altitude-induced CSA, ERS 2017 guidelines recommend considering the provision of oxygen-enriched air or acetazolamide. This intervention aims to reduce high-altitude periodic breathing and improve nocturnal oxygen saturation in healthy lowlanders staying at altitude. Additionally, combined treatment with acetazolamide and automatic positive airway pressure is recommended to prevent central apneas and enhance nocturnal oxygen saturation.

### Cancer risk associated with continuous positive airway pressure: A national study [^1168iKY8]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects a large proportion of the general population, with an approximate prevalence of 15%–30%. A consequence of untreated sleep apnea is excessive fatigue during the day, which is known to negatively impact daily function, including decreasing workplace productivity and increasing the risk of motor vehicle accidents. Long-term consequences of sleep apnea include resistant hypertension, increased stroke risk, and major morbidity, which have been shown to contribute to early mortality. Studies have consistently described the adverse effects and decreased quality of life associated with untreated OSA. Guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the gold standard for OSA management. Given the poor outcomes associated with untreated OSA, understanding factors that affect compliance with CPAP is an important clinical question that has health implications for a large number of patients.

The U.S. FDA issued a Class 1 safety recall notice in July 2021 for CPAP devices due to the risk of carcinogen exposure from the degradation of the polyurethane sound abatement foam. Class 1 safety recall notices are the most serious type of recall, only used in cases of severe injury or death. CPAP devices function by producing airflow through a well-fitted mask that creates enough pressure to force the upper airway open, thereby reducing hypoxemic events associated with respiration during sleep. The efficacy of CPAP machines is well established in the literature, with numerous studies demonstrating their effectiveness.

### The epidemiology of adult obstructive sleep apnea [^112L2sj8]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a chronic condition characterized by frequent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. Its effect on nocturnal sleep quality and ensuing daytime fatigue and sleepiness are widely acknowledged. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnea is also being recognized as an independent risk factor for several clinical consequences, including systemic hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and abnormal glucose metabolism. Estimates of disease prevalence are in the range of 3% to 7%, with certain subgroups of the population bearing higher risk. Factors that increase vulnerability for the disorder include age, male sex, obesity, family history, menopause, craniofacial abnormalities, and certain health behaviors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol use.

Despite the numerous advancements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of the disorder, a majority of those affected remain undiagnosed. Simple queries of the patient or bed-partner for the symptoms and signs of the disorder, namely, loud snoring, observed apneas, and daytime sleepiness, would help identify those in need of further diagnostic evaluation. The primary objective of this article is to review some of the epidemiologic aspects of obstructive sleep apnea in adults.

### Opportunities for cardiovascular benefits in treating obstructive sleep apnea in the secondary prevention scenario [^113Q8vZJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Understanding the cardiovascular (CV) impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is now a mature research field. Over more than four decades of experimental, translational, and clinical studies — most of them observational or small randomized trials — many consequences of OSA have been identified, such as hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, the challenge has been to achieve the pinnacle of scientific evidence. In any research field, randomization reduces bias and provides a rigorous tool to examine cause-and-effect relationships between an intervention and outcome.

An obvious initial strategy is to select patients with a high CV-risk profile to increase the chance of detecting differences during a relatively short period, ensuring feasibility. Events in the primary prevention scenario usually have a lower incidence, requiring significantly more patients and longer follow-up times than secondary prevention studies. However, despite promising indications from previous observational studies in primary prevention, expected outcomes have not materialized in secondary prevention.

Recent randomized trials, such as SAVE (Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints), RICCADSA (Randomized Intervention with CPAP in Coronary Artery Disease and Sleep Apnea), and ISAACC (Impact of Sleep Apnea Syndrome in the Evolution of Acute Coronary Syndrome), focused on patients with OSA and previous CAD or cerebrovascular disease, CAD only, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) respectively, have shown neutral results in their primary outcomes. Despite this, sub-analyses suggested significant effects in specific patient subgroups.

### Cardiovascular outcomes in obstructive sleep apnoea and implications of clinical phenotyping on effect of CPAP treatment [^113TH2sZ]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is believed to lead to a cluster of serious adverse health sequelae, particularly in the context of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many OSA cohorts studying cardiovascular endpoints have drawn positive conclusions, or at least in some OSA subgroups. However, the modifying effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on cardiovascular outcomes is highly controversial. Several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have reported negative results in terms of either primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention by treatment of OSA with CPAP.

At the time of writing, the apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) remains the key parameter on which severity of OSA is categorised, in turn guiding physician prescription for CPAP therapy. However, it has long been observed that the pathophysiology downstream of sleep disordered breathing, resulting in adverse health outcomes, may not be adequately reflected by AHI on polysomnograms (PSG). Furthermore, due to the heterogeneity among OSA subjects, it is increasingly recognised that the effect of CPAP on health outcomes may not be uniform across the entire spectrum of the OSA population.

The aims of the study were to determine the association between various polysomnographic measures of OSA and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in a sleep clinic cohort, and to evaluate the impact of CPAP therapy, which has been prescribed per usual criteria in consensus recommendations, based on consideration of AHI, symptoms, and background cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks.

### Insights, recommendations, and research priorities for central sleep apnea: Report from an expert panel [^115TjBBe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is commonly encountered among patients with sleep-disordered breathing; however, its clinical consequences are less well-characterized. The senior author, A.M., convened an expert panel to discuss the common presentations of CSA, as well as challenges and knowledge gaps in its diagnosis and management.

The panel identified several key research priorities essential for advancing our understanding of the disorder. Within the diagnostic realm, panel members discussed the utility of multinight assessments and the importance of developing and validating novel metrics and automated assessments to differentiate central versus obstructive hypopneas. This would help evaluate their impact on clinical outcomes and management.

- **Therapeutic landscape**: The panel agreed that therapies should primarily aim to alleviate sleep-related symptoms after optimizing treatment to address the underlying cause.

The panel concluded that there is a critical need to further investigate the clinical consequences of CSA, as well as the implications of therapy on clinical outcomes, particularly among those who are asymptomatic. Future research should focus on:

- Endo-phenotyping central events for a better mechanistic understanding of the disease.
- Validating novel diagnostic methods for routine clinical practice.
- Using combination therapy and conducting comparative effectiveness trials to elucidate the most efficacious interventions for managing CSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and multimorbidity [^112qaQod]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Millions of North Americans are affected by the consequences of sleep disorders. Among these disorders, sleep apnea syndrome has the highest rate of mortality and morbidity. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, 858,900 Canadians reported suffering from sleep apnea, and almost 26% of Canadians are at high risk of developing the condition. This disorder poses a major public health problem due to its prevalence, severity, and socioeconomic burden. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined as the cessation of naso-buccal air flow for more than 10 seconds and is diagnosed based on an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) value greater than five per hour of sleep, usually accompanied by a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation. It is estimated that 80% of obstructive sleep apnea cases remain undiagnosed, making it difficult to identify patients at risk of associated comorbidities. Reuveni et al. suggest that programs be developed to increase the level of suspicion of OSA among primary care providers.

OSA syndrome is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. Fletcher reported that 70% to 90% of patients with OSA have hypertension. Associations between OSA and heart failure, OSA and arrhythmias, OSA and diabetes, OSA and insulin resistance, and OSA and metabolic syndrome have also been reported. Successful treatment of OSA helps to better control many of the associated diseases and chronic conditions. Men, people 40 years old and over, and those with a high body mass index (BMI) or a large neck circumference are at greater risk for OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^11687iiU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The evaluation for sleep apnea begins with a comprehensive sleep assessment, which includes a thorough clinical history documenting signs or symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, snoring, witnessed apnea, or difficulty concentrating, a physical examination, and a review of the medical history for relevant comorbidities and other risk factors (Table 1). Patients with suspected sleep apnea following this assessment should undergo diagnostic testing, the criterion standard of which is polysomnography.

Treatment of OSA is generally reserved for those individuals with an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI; the number of apneas and hypopneas observed per hour) ≥ 5, measured during a sleep study in patients with either signs/symptoms of sleep apnea or associated medical conditions (including hypertension, HF, coronary artery disease, significant arrhythmias, and other forms of CVD). Alternatively, an AHI ≥ 15 is often treated as OSA even in the absence of signs, symptoms, or associated medical conditions. Severity is also determined using the AHI, with 5 to 14 considered mild, 15 to 30 moderate, and > 30 severe disease.

Significant night-to-night variability of AHI has been observed in studies of consecutive night polysomnography, with 7% to 25% of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for moderate-to-severe OSA the second night despite a negative result the previous evening. Guidelines therefore recommend repeating polysomnography in patients with a negative initial study when clinical suspicion of OSA remains high.

### A systematic review of COVID-19 and obstructive sleep apnoea [^113r1i9W]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to review the rapidly emerging COVID-19 literature to determine: 1) the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and adverse COVID-19 outcomes, 2) potential causal mechanisms, 3) the effect COVID-19 has had on OSA diagnosis, and 4) the effect COVID-19 has had on the treatment and management of OSA during this period. PubMed was systematically searched up to June 2, 2020. Studies were included if they had examined the relationship between COVID-19 and OSA, were in English, and had the full text available.

The findings from this study suggest that many of the risk factors and co-morbidities associated with OSA, which include obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, are associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. There are plausible mechanisms by which OSA may independently increase one's risk of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, and data from the newly published CORONADO study suggests that OSA-treated patients may be at increased risk of death from COVID-19.

It is clear that the pandemic has had a major effect on the treatment, management, and diagnosis of OSA. Moving forward, it may be necessary to explore new diagnosis and treatment pathways for these individuals.

### Taking care of persistent sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea [^115LhMJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The investigators addressed potential concerns regarding medication use. Adverse events were common (68% vs. 48% for placebo) but were overwhelmingly mild to moderate in severity (95%). At lower doses, few adverse events led to drug discontinuation (< 6%), whereas at the highest dose, more participants were affected (14%). Of some concern, the highest dose caused a 2.5-mg increase in systolic and a 1.5-mg increase in diastolic blood pressure. Further, heart rate increased by 2–3 beats per minute at doses above 75 mg. To put the potential effect of these small changes into perspective, it has been estimated that a 2 mm Hg decrease in average blood pressure in the general population would reduce all-cause mortality annually by 3%, whereas a 2–3 beats per minute increase in heart rate in healthy middle-aged men has been estimated to increase mortality over the course of 16 years by 3.2–4.8%.

This study has notable strengths. The investigators used a double-blind placebo control design, assessed a variety of doses, incorporated both objective and subjective measures of sleepiness, and monitored a reasonable range of adverse effects over the course of 12 weeks. There is little doubt that solriamfetol has robust clinically important effects on alertness at doses of 75 mg and higher and is reasonably tolerated by many patients in the short term. The authors note two limitations: the study's duration limits an assessment of potential long-term cardiovascular consequences, and the lack of an active comparator, such as modafinil, prevents a firm understanding of relative efficacy.

### Predictors of obstructive sleep apnea severity in adolescents [^114s2Sj7]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Untreated obstructive sleep apnea has severe health consequences, yet little is known about predictors of sleep apnea severity in the adolescent population.

- **Objective**: To evaluate clinical and demographic factors associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity in adolescents.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective case series of 224 children (53% male), ages 12 to 17 years who underwent polysomnography from January 1, 2013, to June 4, 2015. The study was conducted in a large tertiary referral children's hospital associated with an academic medical center in Dallas, Texas. Children were excluded if they were missing clinical data (e.g. tonsil size), had major comorbidities (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities), or had previously undergone tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The mean (SD) age was 14.6 (1.7) years (range, 12.0–17.9 years), and the patients were 55% Hispanic, 30% African American, 13% White, and 2% other.

- **Exposures**: Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and polysomnographic parameters.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Correlation between demographic and clinical characteristics and the apnea-hypopnea index.

- **Results**: In 224 adolescents (53% male) aged 12 to 17 years, the mean (SD) apnea-hypopnea index was 14.9 (28.7) (range, 0.0–187.7) and was positively correlated with CDC-defined weight categories (P = 0.04) and tonsillar hypertrophy. Males were more likely to have an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 10 than females (OR, 1.8; 95% CI,…).

### American Thoracic Society patient information series. Other therapies for sleep apnea [^117MyYLG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment is necessary for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) because untreated OSA can lead to serious health problems. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [see ATS Patient Series: http://patients.thoracic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obstructive-sleep-apnea.pdf]. For those who cannot use CPAP or wish to explore alternative options, there are other therapies available that may be effective for individuals with OSA.

### Does gender matter: Sex-specific aspects of symptoms, outcome, and therapy of obstructive sleep apnea [^112sMCbM]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has traditionally been perceived as a male-dominated condition. Consequently, female individuals with OSA have often been under-diagnosed and under-treated compared to their male counterparts. Recent data, however, suggest that several OSA-related adverse cardiovascular outcomes are more pronounced in women.

Recent findings indicate that there are sex-specific characteristics of OSA. These include atypical symptoms and a greater quality of life impairment, with several adverse outcomes being more pronounced in female individuals than in male individuals. Additionally, the review provides updated evidence on the influence of female gender on the under-treatment of OSA, with limited evidence supporting gender differences in the effects of OSA treatment.

There is significant evidence suggesting gender-based differences in the frequency, severity, clinical presentation, and outcomes of OSA. Recognizing these gender differences could enhance screening through the development of female-specific screening instruments, enabling early diagnosis and individualized therapeutic plans for improved disease management and outcomes.

### Sleep-disordered breathing-year in review 2024 [^1138Ekyn]. Pediatric pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing: A future perspective is needed. It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of oSDB is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is "neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity".

An important publication by Solano-Pérez E et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children. There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypopneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently. This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypopneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long-term consequences of pediatric OSA, such as cardiovascular disease. As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences and conversely.

### Latest advances in sleep medicine: Obstructive sleep apnea [^113BPE3m]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

This article is a review of the pertinent scientific data regarding obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as presented in the medical literature. Attention regarding the diagnosis of OSA focused on the debate regarding home testing as compared to in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG), with a surprising result of possibly more cost benefit from PSG. New advances abound in the treatment of OSA, including those directed at preventing pharyngeal collapsibility. Multiple studies reviewed the comparative effects of oral appliances in conjunction with CPAP, with little difference between the two noted, especially for mild OSA. Finally, a number of studies evaluated both the risks of OSA and outcomes from the use of CPAP, including functional outcomes, direct cardiac benefits, and overall cardiac mortality.

### Definition, discrimination, diagnosis and treatment of central breathing disturbances during sleep [^117MJRAp]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). High credibility.

Regarding central sleep apnea, particularly in patients with treatment-emergent CSA, the ERS 2017 guidelines recommend not using the term "treatment-emergent CSA" for cases in patients with underlying cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, or neurological diseases, or for pre-existing CSA before initiating positive airway pressure and transient CSA.

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^114Kopw1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The guideline was developed to address deficiencies in previously published practice guidelines and related reviews. These earlier publications have largely failed to sufficiently examine and objectively establish obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a perioperative risk factor. Additionally, few guidelines have focused on an objective assessment of how to identify patients with OSA.

An example of this is the ASA Practice Guideline for the Perioperative Management of Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, which was updated in 2014 from its 2006 version. It recommends preoperative screening to identify undiagnosed OSA, the initiation of CPAP therapy preoperatively where possible, and postoperative monitoring of OSA patients. However, a significant dilemma arises because these broadly based recommendations are built on limited evidence. Furthermore, the cost of implementation is high. To address this issue, a more focused and practical approach is needed to balance the reduction of postoperative adverse events and improvement of long-term health benefits with the appropriate allocation of healthcare resources.

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^114cKhNd]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by the collapse of the upper airway during sleep and is the most common respiratory disorder related to sleep. It is a major global health problem with substantial economic and social burdens because untreated obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with daytime sleepiness, poor sleep quality, reduced work productivity, and increased rates of road traffic incidents and occupational injuries. This condition also causes multiple adverse physiological and biochemical effects, including hypoxaemia, oxidative stress, inflammation, sympathetic activation, cortical arousal, tachycardia, and vasoconstriction. In some patients, these adverse effects cause end organ damage and long-term complications, including premature cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, chronic kidney disease, and neurodegeneration.

Precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, is an approach tailored to the prevention and treatment of disease that takes into account variability in genes, the environment, and lifestyle for each person. It targets treatments to patients who are most likely to benefit from them, in contrast with the traditional one-size-fits-all approach for prevention and care. The goal of precision medicine is to target the right treatments to the right patients at the right time.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is increasingly being recognized as a heterogeneous disease, and emerging evidence suggests the potential of using precision medicine approaches to improve treatment outcomes.

### Sleep, the forgotten, yet potentially modifiable, dimension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care [^114UikHw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

To the editor:

We read with interest the latest Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Executive Summary by Agustí and colleagues published in the journal. We applaud the authors and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease committee members for publishing this thorough and updated guide to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COPD treatment recommendations. The authors present a new definition of COPD, which varies from previous documents and focuses exclusively on characteristics that distinguish this disease from other diseases. The authors define COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, and/or expectorations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction. It should be noted that COPD results from cumulative and repeated genome and environment interactions throughout the course of a lifetime.

We support the authors in identifying multiple comorbidities with direct relationships to COPD, some of which are potentially modifiable. Consistent with a paucity of clear evidence from long-term randomized trials, the approach to sleep issues in COPD, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), other sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, sleep fragmentation, and sleep-related hypoxemia, was minimally discussed. This lack of discussion is understandable in the context of our evidence base given the lack of rigorous trials testing the impact of screening for sleep disorders.

### Split-night polysomnography [^114jYQzW]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder associated with serious health consequences, increased health-care utilization, and economic burden. With greater public and medical attention to sleep disorders, the volume of referrals for sleep studies over the last decade has increased by approximately 12-fold. Despite the steep growth of infrastructure to diagnose and treat OSA, access to such services remains a sizeable problem, as demand overwhelms capacity. To expedite the diagnosis of sleep apnea and the prescription of treatment, one strategy adopted by sleep specialists is to employ split-night polysomnography. This approach encompasses both the diagnosis of OSA and the initiation of positive pressure therapy in a single night. This article reviews the literature examining this combined diagnostic and therapeutic strategy and discusses the applicable third-party issues of procedural coding and reimbursement.

### What is the efficacy of nasal surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^1179kYjq]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. This obstruction is associated with increasing respiratory efforts, resulting in oxyhemoglobin desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and daytime symptoms, most commonly excessive sleepiness. The effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is undoubtedly high in treating those patients who use it regularly; however, for those who refuse it, the success rate is zero. It is for this subset of patients that surgical therapy can be useful. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nasal surgery on nasal resistance, sleep apnea, sleep quality, and nasal volumetric measurement in adult male patients with OSAS.

Twenty male patients with complaints of hypersomnia and snoring were included in the study. Polysomnography was planned for patients with the prediagnosis of OSAS. All patients underwent CPAP treatment before and after surgery. Those with anatomic structural defects causing nasal valve shrinkage were operated on at the Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Department. Volumetric measurements of the nose were obtained before and after the operation.

In our study, it was observed that the respiratory tract space of patients increased subsequent to the surgery, thereby decreasing the OSAS level and making it easier to tolerate the CPAP device. Measurements of internal nasal valve vertex and fields, as well as external nasal valve fields before and after the operation, were significant.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nonsleepy apnea [^112XDMmN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and observational studies suggest that sleep-disordered breathing is associated with the subsequent development of hypertension and ultimately with cardiovascular consequences. It may therefore be assumed that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) not only avoids sleep-related symptoms but could also mitigate cardiovascular consequences. Short-term studies have revealed a drop in blood pressure, especially in more severe, symptomatic cases of obstructive sleep apnea. Two recent studies have reported that nonsleepy obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an absence of reduced blood pressure after CPAP treatment. This suggests that this group of patients is less susceptible to the consequences of apneas, even those with mild-moderate hypertension or other cardiovascular disorders. However, in patients with severe cardiovascular disease or a higher number of obstructive events, CPAP treatment should be seriously considered.

### Central sleep apnea: Pathophysiology and treatment [^112H9xB6]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by a lack of drive to breathe during sleep, resulting in repetitive periods of insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange. These nighttime breathing disturbances can lead to significant comorbidities and an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. There are several manifestations of CSA, including high altitude-induced periodic breathing, idiopathic CSA, narcotic-induced central apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes breathing.

While unstable ventilatory control during sleep is the hallmark of CSA, the pathophysiology and prevalence of its various forms vary greatly. This brief review summarizes the underlying physiology and modulating components influencing ventilatory control in CSA, describes the etiology of each form of CSA, and examines the key factors that may exacerbate apnea severity. The clinical implications of improved CSA pathophysiology knowledge and the potential for novel therapeutic treatment approaches are also discussed.

### Positive airway pressure and cognitive disorders in adults with obstructive sleep apnea: A systematic review of the literature [^116t2o9p]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia represent a rising global public health crisis. Because effective treatments to prevent, cure, or slow the progression of dementia are unavailable, the identification of treatable risk factors that increase dementia risk, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), could offer promising means to modify dementia occurrence or severity. Here, we systematically reviewed the impact of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy on the incidence of cognitive disorders and cognitive decline among middle-aged and older adults with OSA.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL before May 2021 to identify articles that focused on associations between PAP therapy use and cognitive disorders. We included studies that examined the effects of PAP treatment on (1) the incidence of cognitive disorders among individuals aged ≥ 40 years diagnosed with OSA and (2) the progression of cognitive decline among people with preexisting cognitive disorders and OSA.

- **Results**: We identified 11 studies (3 clinical trials and 8 observational studies). In these studies, 96% of participants had OSA (n = 60,840) and 9% had baseline cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or AD) (n = 5,826). Of all study participants, 43,970 obtained PAP therapy, and 16,400 were untreated or in a placebo group. Nine out of 11 studies reported a protective effect of PAP therapy on MCI and AD incidence, such as delayed age at MCI onset, reduced MCI or AD incidence, slower cognitive decline, or progression to AD.

### Quality measure for screening for adult obstructive sleep apnea by primary care physicians [^113J6AYw]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition that remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Untreated OSA is associated with several chronic medical conditions, a reduction in quality of life, and increases in health care costs. Therefore, early identification of undiagnosed cases is important. The implementation of a screening measure in a primary care environment for populations at high risk for OSA could improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care burden of untreated OSA.

### Advances and challenges in pursuing biomarkers for obstructive sleep apnea: Implications for the cardiovascular risk [^112y3GkF]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence from clinical studies and animal models suggests that OSA can promote cardiovascular disease by inducing autonomic, hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic dysregulation. However, most of the evidence addressing hard endpoints in humans is derived from observational studies.

Several challenges have been noted in the pursuit of a comprehensive knowledge base about the impact of OSA, including:

- **The precise mechanisms**: by which OSA causes metabolic and cardiovascular consequences are not clear, limiting our ability to address potential targets in OSA.

- **Patient symptoms**: Several patients with OSA, even with severe forms, present with no or mild daytime symptoms. Beyond the obvious challenges for obtaining good adherence to conventional OSA treatments, there is evidence that symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients with OSA do not necessarily have the same metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.

- **Cardiovascular response variability**: The cardiovascular response to OSA treatment may vary even in those patients with good adherence.

In this scenario, there is an obvious need to develop biomarkers in the OSA research area. This review focuses on describing the advances that have occurred so far in exploring potential OSA biomarkers, with a clear emphasis on cardiovascular risk. Particular attention is devoted to discussing molecular biomarkers, including the potential role of microRNAs, proteomics, and metabolomics. We also discuss the major challenges and perspectives in this growing field.

### Mechanisms and clinical consequences of untreated central sleep apnea in heart failure [^115Q6Sp2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a highly prevalent, though often unrecognized, comorbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). Data from HF population studies suggest that it may present in 30% to 50% of HF patients. CSA is recognized as an important contributor to the progression of HF and to HF-related morbidity and mortality. Over the past two decades, an expanding body of research has begun to shed light on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CSA. Armed with this growing knowledge base, the sleep, respiratory, and cardiovascular research communities have been working to identify ways to treat CSA in HF, with the ultimate goal of improving patient quality of life and clinical outcomes. In this paper, we examine the state of knowledge about the mechanisms of CSA in HF and review emerging therapies for this disorder.

### Patient-centered care in obstructive sleep apnea: A vision for the future [^117BoyE5]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition, with multiple potential neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic consequences. Efficacious treatment is available, but patient engagement is typically required for treatment to be effective. Patients with sleep apnea are phenotypically diverse and have individual needs, preferences, and values that impact treatment decisions. There has been a shift in obstructive sleep apnea management from diagnosis to chronic care management. Making treatment decisions that incorporate an individual patient's values and preferences and are personalized for that patient's biology has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

- **Patient-centered care approach**: A patient-centered care approach in obstructive sleep apnea is reviewed including the following elements:
	- Determining patient-specific needs to guide treatment decisions
	- Understanding patient values, preferences, and other factors impacting treatment decisions and using shared decision-making
	- Enhancing patient education and support to improve treatment adherence
	- Promoting patient engagement
	- Optimizing care coordination, continuity of care, and access to care
	- Determining and assessing patient-centered outcomes

### Central sleep apnea: Pathophysiology and treatment [^113C8dyg]. Chest (2007). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on central sleep apnea (CSA):

- **Definition**: CSA is a sleep disorder characterized by intermittent cessation or reduction of respiratory effort during sleep due to a lack of respiratory drive from the brain.

- **Pathophysiology**: CSA can be idiopathic or associated with underlying disorders such as heart failure (HF), stroke, opioid use, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and high-altitude exposure. The pathophysiology of CSA involves unstable ventilatory control during sleep, leading to periods of insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of CSA is estimated at 7.8% in males and 0.3% in females in the general population, and up to 25–40% in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CSA include male sex, older age, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), stroke, and opioid use.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, CSA presents with symptoms such as frequent awakenings, non-refreshing sleep, nocturnal dyspnea, snoring, difficulty staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. It can present with or without Cheyne-Stokes breathing.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of CSA can vary based on the underlying causes and associated comorbidities. However, with timely diagnosis and appropriate management, the quality of life (QoL) and clinical outcomes can be significantly improved.

### Hypoxic burden - definitions, pathophysiological concepts, methods of evaluation, and clinical relevance [^117T5FAV]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder estimated to affect over a billion people worldwide. When left untreated, OSA is associated with adverse consequences such as daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and neurocognitive impairment. OSA is characterized by repetitive events of either complete (apneas) or partial upper airway collapse (hypopneas). Immediate consequences of these events include oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep. Regardless of whether the underlying mechanisms causing upper airway collapse are anatomic or nonanatomic, the immediate consequences of oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep are commonly observed in almost all OSA patients.

It is thus not surprising that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which considers the frequency of respiratory events associated with either oxygen desaturation or arousals from sleep, has become the prevailing measure of both the presence and severity of OSA. However, AHI is inconsistently related to adverse consequences of OSA. While epidemiological studies suggest that OSA, determined by AHI, is associated with CVD mortality and morbidity, baseline AHI or changes in AHI with the treatment of OSA fail to predict adverse outcomes. Furthermore, pretreatment AHI poorly predicts the degree of clinical improvement obtained with the treatment of OSA. As such, it is not unexpected that randomized control trials hypothesizing that treatment of OSA would lead to a lower incidence of CVD have not yet been successful.

### Associations between the use of common medications and sleep architecture in patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea [^114nsxSV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often associated with other disorders, which are usually treated with medications. Little is known about the extent to which medications are used in the OSA population or the effects of common prescription medications on the sleep architecture of patients with OSA. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of use of medications by patients with untreated OSA and to examine the potential associations between specific, frequently used medication types and indexes of sleep architecture assessed through laboratory-based polysomnography.

- **Design**: This study used a retrospective design with analyses of archival clinical data.

- **Setting**: Tertiary public sleep disorders center in Brisbane, Australia.

- **Patients or participants**: Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of OSA (N = 1779).

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and results**: Of the patients with OSA, 77.1% were taking at least one medication; 12.4% were taking beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents and 20.8% were taking antidepressant or anxiolytic medications. Analyses of covariance demonstrated reliable effects of medication use on sleep architecture, after accounting for age, sex, and body mass index variables. Both tricyclic and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant or anxiolytic medications were associated with a lower percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and lower sleep-efficiency values in patients with OSA compared with those not taking any medications. The use of beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents and aspirin had no consistent effect.

### Society of anesthesia and sleep medicine guidelines on preoperative screening and assessment of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^111Wk1nh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Worldwide, 234 million major surgical procedures are undertaken annually. In view of the increased risk of perioperative complications associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), surgical safety for patients with OSA is a substantial concern on a global level. As of July 2015, the Joint Commission, Division of Health Care Improvement, had received 61 sentinel perioperative event reports in which a patient was diagnosed with or suspected of having OSA.

- **Concerns regarding perioperative care**:
	- The Joint Commission cited the following concerns regarding the perioperative care of patients with OSA:
	1. Lack of training for health care professionals to screen for and recognize OSA
	2. Failure to assess patients for OSA
	3. Lack of guidelines for the care and treatment of individuals at risk for and those diagnosed with OSA
	4. Failure to implement appropriate monitoring of patients with risk factors associated with OSA
	5. Lack of communication among health care providers regarding patients with OSA or potential risk factors associated with OSA
	6. Lack of postoperative evaluation and treatment for OSA

These are all areas awaiting further improvement.

The primary goal of these SASM guidelines is to ensure optimal preoperative evaluation of patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA to improve patient safety. There is now firm evidence that these patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications. Preoperative evaluation, best done in an anesthesia preoperative clinic, enhances anesthetic management of chronic medical conditions such as OSA through documentation of health status and, where appropriate, implementation of strategies to mitigate risk factors associated with OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea in cardiovascular disease: A review of the literature and proposed multidisciplinary clinical management strategy [^116bZE7z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although these limitations may serve as topics of interest for future investigations, the best available evidence does not support the use of PAP therapy specifically for the purpose of reducing the risk of future adverse events at this time. Therefore, we suggest diagnostic testing for patients with established CAD, cerebrovascular disease, or elevated cardiovascular risk in whom sleep apnea is clinically suspected because of signs or symptoms uncovered during clinical sleep assessment.

- **Perioperative risk**: Comorbid OSA is relevant to the perioperative management of patients with CVD planning to undergo surgery. OSA not only increases the risk of respiratory complications, but some studies have reported an increased risk of postoperative AF and other cardiac complications. The high prevalence of undiagnosed OSA combined with the observation that perioperative complications are more common in patients with undiagnosed OSA has prompted many centers to incorporate screening for OSA as a routine component of preoperative assessment. Various sleep questionnaires have been utilized in this role, with STOP-BANG being the most validated in the surgical patient population. A STOP-BANG score ≥ 3 identifies patients at risk of OSA and has been independently associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. In patients with previously diagnosed OSA, preoperative evaluation should include a review of prior sleep study results to confirm the type and severity of sleep apnea as well as assessment of their compliance with PAP and/or other therapies.

### An X on the map for sleep apnea's holy grail: Drug therapy [^112M6ELB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea was anticipated to be an easy target for drug therapies. This condition, characterized decades ago, involves sleep state–dependent reductions in pharyngeal dilator activity. Specifically, in obstructive sleep apnea, increased activity of upper airway dilator muscles during wakefulness ensures airway patency. During sleep, normal state–dependent reductions in muscle tone result in relaxation of these dilators, leading to the collapse of the upper airway and resulting in obstructive apneas (complete collapse) and hypopneas (partial collapse).

One of the critical upper airway dilator muscles for airway patency is the genioglossus (tongue) muscle, which is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. With the understanding that sleep apnea involves a clear sleep state–dependent effect on this important dilator muscle and its nerve, researchers aimed to identify the neurochemical source of sleep-dependent inhibition of the hypoglossal nerve. The goal was to replace the neurochemical in the form of drug therapy to eliminate the need for cumbersome positive airway pressure machines.

Excitatory receptor subtypes were identified in the hypoglossal nucleus, and relevant agonists for these receptors were explored for effects on obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in animal models and in humans. However, identified targets largely had the untoward effect of promoting wakefulness and/or were unsuitable for counteracting the powerful sleep state–dependent hyperpolarization of hypoglossal motoneurons. Researchers failed to identify a universally effective…

### Sleep apnea in schizophrenia: Estimating prevalence and impact on cognition [^1169r3h8]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Undertreated medical illnesses can compound the disabling cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) impairs cognitive domains also affected by schizophrenia, is common, and is treatable. The effects of sleep apnea on cognition in schizophrenia, however, are not well understood. We estimated the prevalence of OSA in a previously characterized sample of 3,942 Veterans with schizophrenia by self-report and with a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk for OSA. We then compared neuropsychological and functional capacity assessment results between those who reported OSA versus those who did not, and between those predicted to have OSA versus predicted not to have OSA.

We expected that many Veterans not reporting sleep apnea would be predicted to have it, and that both reported and predicted sleep apnea would be associated with lower cognitive and functional performance. The reported prevalence of OSA in the sample was 14%, whereas 72% were predicted to be at high risk of OSA. Interestingly, participants who reported having OSA had better cognitive and functional capacity performance (p's < 0.001) compared to those who did not report OSA, particularly on speed of processing assessments (p < 0.001). Predicted OSA, by contrast, was associated with lower speed of processing, verbal learning, and working memory test scores (p's < 0.001). One possible interpretation of these results is that people with higher cognitive capacity may be more likely to seek medical care, while those with cognitive impairments are at greater risk for having untreated illnesses.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^111prfud]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, specifically with respect to the initial sleep study, the AASM 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining polysomnography rather than home sleep apnea testing as a first-line test for OSA in patients with any of the following:

- **Significant cardiorespiratory disease**: For patients presenting with notable issues in the heart or lungs.

- **Potential respiratory muscle weakness due to a neuromuscular condition**: In instances where neuromuscular disorders may impair breathing.

- **Awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep-related hypoventilation**: When patients exhibit signs of reduced breathing rate or depth during sleep or while awake.

- **Chronic opioid medication use**: For patients using long-term opioid therapy.

- **History of stroke**: Especially crucial in post-stroke patients due to possible complications.

- **Severe insomnia**: For patients experiencing extreme difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep.

### Physiologic consequences of upper airway obstruction in sleep apnea [^115gEpKE]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is diagnosed and managed using a metric called the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), which quantifies the number of respiratory events (apnea or hypopnea). This metric, however, often disregards important information regarding the characteristics and physiologic consequences of these respiratory events, such as degrees of ventilatory deficit, associated hypoxemia, cardiac autonomic response, and cortical activity. The oversimplification of the disorder by the AHI is considered one of the reasons for divergent findings on the associations between OSA and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in observational and randomized controlled trial studies.

Prospective observational cohort studies have demonstrated strong associations of OSA with several cardiovascular diseases. However, randomized controlled trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) interventions have not been able to detect a significant benefit of CPAP in reducing CVD risk. Over the past several years, novel methodologies have been proposed to better quantify the magnitude of OSA-related breathing disturbances and their physiologic consequences. As a result, stronger associations with cardiovascular and neurocognitive outcomes have been observed. This review focuses on methods that capture the polysomnographic heterogeneity of OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116EFF7p]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnea, particularly in relation to indications for screening, the 2021 AHA guidelines recommend considering obtaining a sleep study if the following concerning signs or symptoms of sleep apnea are present:

- **NYHA class II-IV HF symptoms**: Patients exhibiting these symptoms should be evaluated for potential sleep apnea.
- **Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome**: Consider a sleep study to further investigate underlying sleep apnea.
- **Sick sinus syndrome**: This condition may warrant a sleep study to assess for sleep apnea.
- **VT**: Ventricular tachycardia may be indicative of obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Survivors of SCD**: Those who have survived sudden cardiac death should be screened for sleep apnea.
- **Stroke**: A history of stroke is another indicator for obtaining a sleep study.

### Mild obstructive sleep apnoea: Clinical relevance and approaches to management [^116xwjk4]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is highly prevalent in the general population worldwide, particularly in its mild form. Clinical manifestations correlate poorly with disease severity as measured by the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), which complicates diagnosis. Full polysomnography might be more appropriate to assess suspected mild cases because limited ambulatory diagnostic systems are least accurate in cases of mild disease. Treatment options for mild obstructive sleep apnoea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oral appliance therapy, along with positional therapy and weight reduction when appropriate. The superior efficacy of CPAP in reducing AHI is offset by the greater tolerance of oral appliances, especially in mild cases. Although severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with adverse health consequences, including cardiometabolic comorbidities, the association with mild disease remains unclear, with reports differing regarding the clinical relevance of mild obstructive sleep apnoea. Improved diagnostic techniques and evidence-based approaches to management in mild obstructive sleep apnoea require further research.

### Understanding sleep apnea physiology: A potential path to improving positive airway pressure effectiveness [^112r7QzU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Future work will ultimately need to clarify the impact of trait identification and personalized management on patient-centered outcomes. As we innovate, we must also bear in mind the costs of complexity. The polysomnograms currently necessary for comprehensive trait identification are costly and often inaccessible, particularly for groups with existing barriers to adherence, such as historically disadvantaged populations and those who live in rural areas. Developing automated approaches to measure traits with home testing would be an important step to mitigating this obstacle. Even then, additional unanticipated burdens to the health system from added complexity in decision-making and care pathways are likely. Ultimately, to reduce the burden of untreated OSA, it will be incumbent on us to integrate personalized strategies in a way that promotes equitable access to high-quality OSA care.

### Should all sleep apnoea patients be treated [^115twADy]. Sleep medicine reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Sleep apnoea is a condition in which people stop breathing during sleep. A number of studies in general and worker populations have shown that the prevalence of an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) > 10 is in the range of 20%. Subjects with an AHI > 10 who complain of excessive daytime somnolence, tiredness, asphyxic episodes during the night, or non-refreshing sleep, among other symptoms, suffer from the sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS). The prevalence of SAHS is around 4%.

Owing to its high prevalence, clinical symptoms, probable secondary cardiovascular consequences, and associated social problems, SAHS has a considerable impact on health, making its management worth considering. Despite challenges to SAHS treatment, recent studies conclude that nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is undoubtedly effective in clearly symptomatic patients, with its use in clinical practice being adequately supported in the treatment of moderate to severe SAHS. Further studies are needed to define the lower range of symptoms to be treated.

One of the most significant problems encountered in this area results from the combination of two situations. On the one hand, different epidemiological studies have demonstrated that an AHI > 10 without symptoms is present in about 15% of the general population. On the other hand, several studies suggest that having a high AHI, even without secondary symptoms, results in some undesirable effects, such as traffic accidents and cardiovascular consequences. In this context, comprehensive epidemiological studies are therefore essential.

### Cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea in different study models and novel perspectives [^114r5PUx]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is heterogeneous in terms of contributing pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, and consequences. Different study models — including animal models of intermittent hypoxia, case-control, cohort, and population-based observational studies, as well as uncontrolled interventional and randomized controlled interventional trials — have contributed to the knowledge base. Controversial findings on underlying mechanisms and consequences of untreated OSA have challenged the field and resulted in uncertainty in treatment recommendations.

The heterogeneity of OSA in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes, alongside the strengths and limitations of different study models and designs used for studying OSA pathophysiology and cardiovascular consequences, are discussed against the background of controversial findings on cardiovascular outcomes in OSA. In addition, recent findings from randomized controlled continuous positive airway pressure therapy withdrawal trials, an efficient and controlled study model, are highlighted.

Novel designs for clinical trials on long-term outcomes in the highly prevalent patient group with OSA, addressing the heterogeneity in underlying mechanisms, different phenotypes in terms of cardiovascular risk, and new treatment concepts, are needed to improve clinical practice standards.

### Association of obstructive sleep apnea in rapid eye movement sleep with reduced glycemic control in type 2 diabetes: Therapeutic implications [^111tQvWX]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is both a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and a frequent comorbidity with an adverse impact on glycemic control. Five independent studies, totaling nearly 1,400 patients with type 2 diabetes, have shown that the prevalence of OSA, assessed by polysomnography (PSG), ranges between 58% and 86%. Several studies have established a robust association — independent of adiposity and other known confounders — between the presence and severity of OSA and insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in nondiabetic adults.

Two studies using the gold standard of in-laboratory PSG to quantify the severity of OSA reported a robust association between increasing OSA severity and rising levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes, after controlling for multiple potential confounders. While the findings of these two studies suggested that the effective treatment of OSA may be a nonpharmacologic strategy to improve glucose control, the results of the only randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes were surprisingly disappointing.

One potential reason for the failure of OSA treatment to improve chronic glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is insufficient CPAP use. Notably, the mean nightly CPAP use in this clinical trial was 3.6 hours. As most rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs in the early morning hours before habitual awakening, one possible explanation lies in the timing of CPAP use.
