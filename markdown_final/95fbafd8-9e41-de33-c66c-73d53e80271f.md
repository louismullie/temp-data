## Question

Is anti malarial prophylaxis indicated in travelers to Philippines?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for travelers to the Philippines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current malaria epidemiology in the Philippines, including species distribution and geographic risk. Then, I should verify what authoritative sources like the CDC Yellow Book and WHO say about prophylaxis recommendations for the Philippines. Next, I will examine drug resistance patterns that constrain options. After that, I need to consider special situations such as pregnancy, children, and long-term travel. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm testing and follow-up needs, including G6PD screening if primaquine or tafenoquine are considered [^6b64a0b2] [^e621c760].

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology. The Philippines has ongoing malaria transmission in some provinces, with Plasmodium vivax predominating and Plasmodium falciparum present in lower proportions; importantly, there are emerging reports of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic species that can be misidentified microscopically and carries significant disease risk, which underscores the need for accurate diagnostics and prevention planning in exposed travelers [^96963f3d].

> Wait, let me verify the resistance context before jumping to drug choices. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum is established across much of Asia, including the Philippines region, so chloroquine cannot be relied upon for falciparum prophylaxis; effective options must cover chloroquine-resistant strains, which directs us toward atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, or tafenoquine depending on patient factors and availability [^fdbd0fe9] [^54d07610].

> I should confirm what the CDC Yellow Book says about the Philippines specifically. Hold on, I should verify whether there is a destination-specific entry. I initially thought there was a dedicated Philippines section, but on rechecking, the Yellow Book does not provide a standalone Philippines malaria profile; instead, it emphasizes individualized risk assessment by itinerary, season, accommodation, and activities, and it directs clinicians to use region-appropriate chemoprophylaxis where transmission risk exists, which applies to the Philippines given documented transmission in some provinces [^b845fbba].

> Next, I should review WHO guidance to ensure alignment. WHO recommends antimalarial chemoprophylaxis for travelers to endemic areas based on regional risk, species, and drug susceptibility; for the Philippines, that supports prophylaxis in at-risk regions, with regimen selection tailored to local resistance and traveler characteristics, reinforcing the need for pre-travel counseling and risk stratification rather than a blanket "no prophylaxis" approach [^notfound].

> Let me consider the practical risk stratification. Travelers to rural provinces with active transmission, those staying overnight without screened or air-conditioned accommodations, and those traveling during the rainy season have higher risk and should generally be offered chemoprophylaxis; conversely, short stays in urban centers with reliable screening and air conditioning may warrant mosquito avoidance alone, but this must be individualized and revisited if itineraries change [^b845fbba].

> I will now examine drug options and their trade-offs. Atovaquone-proguanil is well tolerated, effective against falciparum and vivax, and convenient for last-minute travelers because it starts 1–2 days before travel and continues for 7 days after return; doxycycline is effective and inexpensive but requires daily dosing and 4 weeks post-travel, with added benefits of reducing travelers' diarrhea and influenza-like illness; mefloquine is weekly but has neuropsychiatric adverse effects and resistance concerns in parts of Southeast Asia; tafenoquine is a weekly option for adults with normal G6PD but is contraindicated in pregnancy and G6PD deficiency and requires G6PD testing before use [^1f329572] [^bc479103] [^c1c6cdae] [^e621c760].

> But wait, what if the traveler is pregnant or planning pregnancy? I need to ensure safety. Mefloquine is considered safe in all trimesters for prophylaxis, whereas atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, primaquine, and tafenoquine are generally avoided in pregnancy; if pregnancy is planned soon, switching to mefloquine in advance to achieve steady state is prudent, and tafenoquine and primaquine are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal G6PD-related hemolysis risk [^2a227764].

> For children, I should double-check age- and weight-based dosing. Atovaquone-proguanil is approved down to 5 kg, doxycycline is appropriate for children aged 8 years and older, and mefloquine and primaquine can be used across ages with weight-based dosing; primaquine and tafenoquine require documented normal G6PD before prescribing, and families should be counseled on adherence and what to do if doses are vomited or missed [^4d62d838] [^6b64a0b2] [^b4532ddf].

> Hold on, I should verify long-term travel considerations. For stays beyond 6 months, continuous chemoprophylaxis remains appropriate, with attention to adherence, counterfeit drug risks if sourcing abroad, and plans for prompt evaluation of febrile illness; some long-term travelers may benefit from stand-by emergency treatment strategies in select scenarios, but this should be individualized and coordinated with a travel medicine specialist [^18c6e948] [^52f8d061].

> I need to ensure I address P. knowlesi. Given its zoonotic reservoir and diagnostic pitfalls, travelers with forest or agricultural exposures in affected regions should use robust mosquito avoidance and consider chemoprophylaxis with agents active against blood stages; if malaria is suspected, clinicians should request species-level diagnostics, including PCR when available, to distinguish knowlesi from falciparum or malariae due to management implications [^96963f3d].

> Next, I should review testing and follow-up. Regardless of prophylaxis use, any febrile illness during or up to 12 months after travel warrants prompt malaria evaluation; more than 90% of U.S. travelers who acquire malaria report nonadherence to recommended prophylaxis, so a careful medication history and adherence assessment are essential, and travelers should be counseled on this explicitly [^3a832455] [^27c6e948].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for travelers to the Philippines when their itinerary includes areas with ongoing transmission, particularly rural provinces, substandard accommodations, or travel during higher-risk seasons; regimen selection should prioritize atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine based on patient factors, with tafenoquine considered in appropriate adults after G6PD testing, and all travelers should combine chemoprophylaxis with rigorous mosquito avoidance and be prepared to seek prompt care for fever [^b845fbba] [^fdbd0fe9] [^e621c760].

---

In sum, **malaria prophylaxis is indicated for travelers to the Philippines** when visiting rural or forested areas with ongoing transmission, especially during the rainy season (May–November) [^notfound]. Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine are appropriate options; **chloroquine is not recommended** due to resistance [^fdbd0fe9]. Primaquine or tafenoquine may be considered for short trips to vivax-predominant areas if G6PD status is normal [^6b64a0b2] [^e621c760]. Travelers should also use insect repellent, bed nets, and protective clothing, and seek prompt care for fever during or after travel [^b845fbba].

---

## Geographic distribution and risk assessment

Malaria in the Philippines is **localized to specific regions**, with the highest risk in rural, forested, or mountainous areas of Mindanao, Palawan, and Luzon. Urban centers such as Manila, Cebu, and Davao City have minimal to no risk. Transmission is **seasonal**, peaking during the rainy season from May to November, and is predominantly due to Plasmodium vivax, with Plasmodium falciparum also present [^notfound].

---

## Current recommendations for malaria prophylaxis

The CDC and WHO recommend **individualized risk assessments** based on itinerary, duration of stay, and traveler-specific factors. Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for travelers to areas with ongoing transmission, particularly rural or forested regions, and during the rainy season [^b845fbba].

## Recommended antimalarial medications

| **Medication** | **Dosage and regimen** | **Indications and considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Atovaquone-proguanil | 1 adult tablet daily; start 1–2 days before travel, continue daily during travel, and for 7 days after leaving | - Effective against P. falciparum and P. vivax <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Suitable for last-minute travelers [^1f329572] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg daily; start 1–2 days before travel, continue daily during travel, and for 4 weeks after leaving | - Effective against P. falciparum and P. vivax <br/> - Useful for travelers' diarrhea prevention <br/> - Not suitable for pregnant women or children under 8 years [^bc479103] |
| Mefloquine | 250 mg weekly; start ≥ 2 weeks before travel, continue weekly during travel, and for 4 weeks after leaving | - Effective against P. falciparum and P. vivax <br/> - Weekly dosing <br/> - Contraindicated in patients with psychiatric disorders or seizures [^c1c6cdae] |
| Primaquine | 30 mg base daily; start 1–2 days before travel, continue daily during travel, and for 7 days after leaving | - Effective against P. vivax <br/> - Requires G6PD testing <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy and G6PD deficiency [^6b64a0b2] |
| Tafenoquine | 200 mg weekly; start 3 days before travel, continue weekly during travel, and take a final dose the week after leaving | - Effective against P. vivax and P. falciparum <br/> - Requires G6PD testing <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy and G6PD deficiency [^e621c760] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Mefloquine is the preferred prophylactic agent, as it is considered safe throughout pregnancy. Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, primaquine, and tafenoquine are contraindicated [^2a227764].
- **Children**: Atovaquone-proguanil is suitable for children weighing ≥ 5 kg. Doxycycline is recommended for children aged ≥ 8 years. Mefloquine and primaquine can be used in children of all ages with appropriate dosing [^4d62d838].
- **Long-term travelers**: Continuous chemoprophylaxis is recommended for stays exceeding 6 months, with periodic reassessment of risk and adherence [^18c6e948].

---

## Non-pharmacological preventive measures

In addition to chemoprophylaxis, travelers should adopt the following measures:

- **Insect repellent**: Use DEET-containing repellents on exposed skin [^d6322fe2].
- **Bed nets**: Sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets, especially in rural or forested areas [^d6322fe2].
- **Protective clothing**: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, particularly during dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active [^d6322fe2].
- **Environmental awareness**: Avoid stagnant water and areas with high mosquito density [^notfound].

---

## Post-travel considerations

Travelers should remain vigilant for malaria symptoms for up to 12 months after returning, as P. vivax and P. ovale can cause delayed relapses. Any febrile illness should prompt immediate medical evaluation and malaria testing, regardless of prophylaxis use [^72987f09].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Malaria prophylaxis is **indicated for travelers to the Philippines** who will visit rural or forested areas with ongoing transmission, particularly during the rainy season. Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine are appropriate choices, with primaquine or tafenoquine considered for short trips to vivax-predominant areas if G6PD status is normal. Travelers should also use insect repellent, bed nets, and protective clothing, and seek prompt medical attention for any febrile illness during or after travel.

Antimalarial safety and rationale for prophylaxis — overdose of antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, can be fatal and is a medical emergency, and medications should be stored in childproof containers out of reach of infants and children; although malaria is treatable, malaria could be fatal even when treated, which is why prevention is always preferable to treating infections after they occur, and in rare instances a treatment course may be provided to certain travelers in addition to emphasizing adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis.

### Controversies and misconceptions in malaria chemoprophylaxis for travelers [^895f3c67]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Controversies in malaria prevention arise from the absence of data, conflicting data between different studies, conflicting recommendations, deviation of local practice from scientific data, and varying risk thresholds. Misconceptions about the seriousness of malaria, the tolerability of chemoprophylaxis drugs, and the efficacy and safety of repellents contribute to the controversies.

Objectives

To compare several national guidelines on malaria chemoprophylaxis to identify variations in recommendations. We reviewed studies on tolerability of mefloquine with particular focus on its neuropsychiatric adverse effects and influence on performance. We also describe why most recommended chemoprophylactic regimens fail to prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax malaria and review available options.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched scientific publications in MEDLINE via PubMED for relevant articles with a cutoff date of December 2006 using the search terms malaria, chemoprophylaxis, travel, mefloquine, neuropsychiatric adverse events, tolerability, vivax malaria, and primaquine. Additional references were obtained from bibliographies of the selected articles. There were no language restrictions.

Evidence Synthesis

Gaps and conflicts exist among current guidelines. Health authorities vary in the chemoprophylaxis drugs they recommend, the indications for continuous prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis, and the use of standby emergency treatment. Despite widespread reports on the adverse effects of mefloquine, controlled studies found that serious neuropsychiatric adverse events occur at rates comparable with or lower than other chemoprophylaxis drugs. Moreover, mefloquine does not appear to impair performance while driving, flying, or diving. Vivax malaria causes significant illness in travelers, but current first-line chemoprophylaxis agents do not prevent relapses of vivax malaria. Although not licensed in most countries as primary prophylaxis, primaquine effectively prevents relapses of vivax malaria.

Conclusions

Prevention of malaria in travelers requires detailed knowledge of malaria epidemiology and host-vector-parasite interactions. Decisions are complicated by a lack of standardized recommendations, controversies, and misconceptions. Improved international consensus is indicated to minimize conflicting guidelines, clarify controversies, and promote adherence to preventive measures.

Although efficacious forms of malaria chemoprophylaxis currently exist, many travelers to malaria-endemic areas fail to use them effectively. We suggest that taking antimalarial medications prior to travel may prevent more malaria by improving compliance. Treatment regimens of antimalarial drugs taken prior to travel could protect persons for up to one month of exposure. We urge additional testing of pre-travel malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — fever during travel and after return — travelers in a malaria-endemic area who develop fever should promptly seek medical help and continue malaria chemoprophylaxis, and after returning, fever despite prophylaxis warrants immediate medical care with travel history reporting, malaria testing, and prompt treatment if infection is confirmed; note that malaria chemoprophylaxis, while highly effective, is not 100% effective.

### Primaquine for prevention of malaria in travelers [^a2913a71]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

An expanding risk and range of endemic malaria threatens travelers. Primaquine is an old drug recently demonstrated to offer effective prophylaxis. Clinical trials conducted in Indonesia, Kenya, and Colombia showed that a primaquine base (30 mg per day) had protective efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax of 85%-93%. Among 339 children (age, > 8 years) and adults taking this regimen for 12–52 weeks, there was no greater risk of adverse symptomatic events among primaquine users than among recipients of placebo in double-blind studies. Among 151 subjects evaluated after 20 or 52 weeks of daily primaquine therapy, methemoglobinemia was found to be mild (< 13%; typically < 6%) and transient (duration, < 2 weeks). We consider primaquine base (0.5 mg/kg per day consumed with food) to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective prophylaxis against malaria for nonpregnant persons and those with normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Primaquine's major advantage over most drugs for chemoprophylaxis is that it does not have to be taken before entering or beyond 3 days after leaving a malarious area.

### Prevention of malaria in travelers [^0559ef01]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Malaria is a major international public health problem, responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality around the world each year. As travel to tropical locations increases, U.S. physicians are being asked more frequently to provide recommendations for malaria prevention. An organized approach to reducing the risk of acquiring this disease is necessary. Physicians must review the itineraries of their patients in detail, paying particularly close attention to travel within malaria-endemic areas and drug-resistant zones. Appropriate chemoprophylaxis must be chosen to reduce the risk of acquiring malaria. It also is important to provide advice on the use of protective measures that reduce the risk of mosquito bites. Finally, travelers should be instructed to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms of the disease develop during or after the trip.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^39fe4cb0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria — traveler risk and prophylaxis considerations include that many foreign-born individuals develop malaria in the United States because of distant exposure before arrival or from more recent travel, and U.S.-born individuals can develop malaria during travel to endemic areas; failure to take appropriate chemoprophylaxis is a common problem for both groups and people who formerly lived in malarious areas may believe they are immune and do not need prophylaxis. Such patients are at high risk of infection because they likely have lost partial immunity within 6 months after leaving endemic regions. In returning travelers who are febrile, of the nearly 50 million individuals who travel to developing countries each year, between 5% and 11% develop a fever during or after travel, and malaria is a surprisingly common cause of these fevers.

### Randomized, parallel placebo-controlled trial of primaquine for malaria prophylaxis in papua, Indonesia [^bde09c89]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Malaria causes illness or death in unprotected travelers. Primaquine prevents malaria by attacking liver-stage parasites, a property distinguishing it from most chemoprophylactics and obviating 4-week postexposure dosing. A daily adult regimen of 30 mg primaquine prevented malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax for 20 weeks in 95 of 97 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-normal Javanese transmigrants in Papua, Indonesia. In comparison, 37 of 149 subjects taking placebo in a parallel trial became parasitemic. The protective efficacy of primaquine against malaria was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71%-98%); against P. falciparum it was 88% (95% CI 48%-97%), and > 92% for P. vivax (95% CI > 37%-99%). Primaquine was as well tolerated as placebo. Mild methemoglobinemia (mean of 3.4%) returned to normal within 2 weeks. Blood chemistry and hematological parameters revealed no evidence of toxicity. Good safety, tolerance, and efficacy, along with key advantages in dosing requirements, make primaquine an excellent drug for preventing malaria in nonpregnant, G6PD-normal travelers.

### New strategies for the prevention of malaria in travelers [^dcd6892d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Malaria prevention has benefited from many diverse disciplines of research, including epidemiologic monitoring, development of laboratory techniques, assessment of insect repellents, or pharmaceutical innovations. Strategies in all these sectors have been explored in recent years, resulting in improved options to prevent travelers' malaria. The addition of atovaquone-proguanil for malaria chemoprophylaxis and the recommendation of primaquine as primary prophylaxis have been significant advances. Tafenoquine seems promising. Standby treatment recommendations have been refined. Many areas still need better strategies. Problematic areas include chemoprophylaxis for long-term travelers, expatriates, and pregnant women; optimal criteria for terminal prophylaxis; and the prevention of malaria in populations that are least likely to seek pretravel evaluations, such as those visiting friends and relatives in their home countries (VFRs). Finally, research in travel and tropical medicine should continue to focus on additional strategies to confront the ever-widening challenge of drug-resistant malaria.

### Malaria chemoprophylaxis in the age of drug resistance. I. currently recommended drug regimens [^37fe77d5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

As international travel becomes increasingly common and resistance to antimalarial drugs escalates, a growing number of travelers are at risk for contracting malaria. Parasite resistance to chloroquine and proguanil and real or perceived intolerance among patients to standard prophylactic agents such as mefloquine have highlighted the need for new antimalarial drugs. Promising new regimens include atovaquone and proguanil, in combination; primaquine; and a related 8-aminoquinoline, tafenoquine. These agents are active against the liver stage of the malaria parasite and therefore can be discontinued shortly after the traveler leaves an area where malaria is endemic, which encourages adherence to the treatment regimen. Part 1 of this series reviews currently recommended chemoprophylactic drug regimens, and part 2 will focus on 8-aminoquinoline drugs.

### Malaria prevention in travelers [^a89f5a24]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

A common approach to malaria prevention is to follow the "A, B, C, D" rule: Awareness of risk, Bite avoidance, Compliance with chemoprophylaxis, and prompt Diagnosis in case of fever. The risk of acquiring malaria depends on the length and intensity of exposure; the risk of developing severe disease is primarily determined by the health status of the traveler. These parameters need to be assessed before recommending chemoprophylaxis and/or stand-by emergency treatment. This review discusses the different strategies and drug options available for the prevention of malaria during and post travel.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^6eea1cdb]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis side effects and timing — if tolerability is a concern, chemoprophylaxis can be started earlier, and mefloquine can be started 3–4 weeks in advance to allow potential adverse events to be evaluated before travel; if unacceptable side effects develop, the clinician has time to change the medication before the traveler's departure; the drugs used for malaria chemoprophylaxis are generally well-tolerated, minor side effects usually do not require stopping the drug, and clinicians should determine if symptoms are related to the medicine and make a medication change if needed.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^424eddf3]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis missed doses — compared with drugs with short half-lives, which are taken daily, drugs with longer half-lives, which are taken weekly, offer the advantage of a wider margin of error if the traveler is late with a dose; for a weekly drug, prophylactic blood levels can remain adequate if the dose is only 1–2 days late and the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible, then resume weekly doses on the originally scheduled day; if the traveler is > 2 days late, blood levels might not be adequate, so the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible and resume weekly dosing on the new day of the week, with the next dose 1 week later, then weekly thereafter; for a daily drug, if the traveler is 1–2 days late, protective blood levels are less likely to be maintained, and the traveler should take a dose as soon as possible and resume the daily schedule at the new time of day.

### Management of vivax malaria with low sensitivity to primaquine [^05ac1644]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades there have been numerous reports of primaquine failure in the treatment of Plasmodium vivax extending from the Western Pacific to South East Asia, India and Central and South America. In sub-Saharan Africa only five returning travellers have been reported with relapse of vivax malaria after primaquine and the absence of corroborating reports has prompted investigators to interpret their observations in terms of non-compliance. In 1997, 26 US military personnel serving in Somalia experienced attacks of P. vivax after terminal prophylaxis with primaquine. We have observed repeated relapses of P. vivax in two travellers, one to the Philippines and the other to Kenya despite both conventional and prolonged primaquine therapy. Here we report this clinical problem and propose a response to the emerging failure of the standard regimen of primaquine by considering the existing efficacy and toxicity data.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis patient counseling — adverse event self‑management and missed doses provides practical instructions. The text advises, "It is helpful to provide travelers with approaches to managing any adverse events they may experience from malaria chemoprophylaxis medication (e.g., remember to take with food; change time of day; identify other causes of symptoms; manage symptoms without stopping antimalarial if possible)" and to "know what to do if they miss a dose (take the next dose with food as soon as possible; do not double the dose the day after the missed dose)."

### Prevention of malaria in travelers [^3b634002]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

There are approximately 300 million cases of malaria each year, resulting in 1 million deaths worldwide. Family physicians often encounter patients preparing to travel to malaria-endemic regions. Physicians should have basic knowledge of parasite transmission and malaria prevention. The risk of malaria acquisition is based largely on geographic location and travel season. Most cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia between the months of May and December. Key elements in prevention include barrier protection and chemoprophylaxis. Travelers to malaria-endemic areas should be advised to use mosquito repellent at all times and bed netting at night. Prophylactic medication should be initiated before travel and continued after return. Travelers should be warned that malaria symptoms can present up to one year after a mosquito bite. Symptoms are vague, and may include fever, chills, arthralgias, and headaches. Travelers experiencing symptoms should seek prompt medical attention.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^18c9d4ca]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Malaria prevention and chemoprophylaxis for long-term travelers (Travel > 6 Months) outlines that malaria prevention measures are the same for both short- and long-term travelers, but longer stays mean longer duration of exposure and increased risk of acquiring malaria, travelers' attention to mosquito avoidance can wane over time, travelers might not adhere to a lengthy course of malaria chemoprophylaxis due to forgetfulness, fear of side effects, and a possible declining sense of risk and need over time, travelers might move between highly endemic or low endemic areas within a country or region, travelers might have a decreased sense of risk and concern about malaria after engaging in local conversations and lore, and travelers who become ill with malaria in countries with limited access and quality of health care might not receive appropriate or effective treatment. Additional advice specifies that travelers should not count on being able to obtain safe, reliable malaria chemoprophylaxis medication abroad; strongly advise that before leaving the United States they purchase enough medication to last them for the entire duration of their travel to malaria-endemic areas, emphasize continued adherence to and safety of malaria chemoprophylaxis drugs, develop a plan for seeking immediate care when ill with fever including where to get tested and treated for malaria promptly, advise travelers to purchase travel insurance including contingencies for medical evacuation, and consider prescribing a reliable supply of a treatment dose of antimalarial drugs to be available in case malaria is diagnosed while traveling.

### Review: malaria chemoprophylaxis for travelers to Latin America [^663f85bd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Because of recent declining malaria transmission in Latin America, some authorities have recommended against chemoprophylaxis for most travelers to this region. However, the predominant parasite species in Latin America, Plasmodium vivax, can form hypnozoites sequestered in the liver, causing malaria relapses. Additionally, new evidence shows the potential severity of vivax infections, warranting continued consideration of prophylaxis for travel to Latin America. Individualized travel risk assessments are recommended and should consider travel locations, type, length, and season, as well as probability of itinerary changes. Travel recommendations might include no precautions, mosquito avoidance only, or mosquito avoidance and chemoprophylaxis. There are a range of good options for chemoprophylaxis in Latin America, including atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, and — in selected areas — chloroquine. Primaquine should be strongly considered for nonpregnant, G6PD-nondeficient patients traveling to vivax-endemic areas of Latin America, and it has the added benefit of being the only drug to protect against malaria relapses.

### Chloroquine-resistant malaria in travelers returning from Haiti after 2010 earthquake [^cdacd4a0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Our data highlight the need to implement a therapeutic efficacy surveillance study for assessing in vivo chloroquine sensitivity, which is essential for providing information for rational control strategies and guiding prophylaxis recommendations in Haiti. In addition, physicians treating malaria acquired in Haiti should be aware of the possibility of chloroquine-resistant infections. Patients with persistent fever despite treatment and infected travelers reporting adherence to chloroquine prophylaxis should be treated with alternate antimalarial drug therapy.

### The human immunodeficiency virus-infected traveler [^aa6af5c7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

As the number of travelers from industrialized countries who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases as a consequence of the clinical benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), updated prophylactic knowledge is needed. Vaccine prophylaxis must balance the safety and immunogenicity of vaccines with the estimated risk of acquiring the disease. Further research is needed on antimalarial chemoprophylaxis for travelers who are HAART recipients, because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions. Safe sex practices must be adopted to avoid both spreading of the infection in the host country and superinfection with different HIV strains. Most individuals infected with HIV may travel safely, even though the infectious risk has been reported to be higher for patients with advanced infections than for the general population. These patients are also less likely to produce an effective immune response to vaccines. Migrants and refugees from poor countries are also at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Their legal-residency status may often prevent their access to adequate health services, thus necessitating urgent public health actions.

### Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas [^c1c6cdae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria‐endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE; and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP;) and ClinicalTrials.gov for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non‐randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short‐term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self‐reported or clinician‐assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses.

Mefloquine efficacy

Of 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short‐term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).

In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone‐proguanil and doxycycline in non‐immune, short‐term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants).

Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone‐proguanil

Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone‐proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high‐certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone‐proguanil (940 travellers).

One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short‐term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate‐certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate‐certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate‐certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate‐certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer‐term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high‐certainty evidence) and dizziness (high‐certainty evidence).

Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone‐proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood.

Mefloquine safety versus doxycycline

No difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low‐certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Six cohort studies in longer‐term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short‐term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low‐certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short‐term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.

Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty‐evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low‐certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low‐certainty evidence).

Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.

Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non‐military participants, provided no conclusive findings.

Authors' conclusions

The absolute risk of malaria during short‐term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone‐proguanil).

The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once‐weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 11 popular destinations [^0e591510]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Thailand — malaria risk, seasonality, species distribution, and prophylaxis: Malaria is endemic to specific areas in Thailand, particularly rural, forested areas bordering Burma (Myanmar), rural forested areas bordering Cambodia, and the far south along the border with Malaysia. Transmission is year-round, peaking during the rainy season, with a second, smaller peak in December. Approximately 80% of cases are due to Plasmodium vivax; < 20% are due to Plasmodium falciparum. CDC recommends protection against mosquito bites and malaria prophylaxis for travelers visiting endemic areas; atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or tafenoquine are the recommended prophylactic antimalarial drugs for travelers going to malaria-endemic areas in Thailand, while mosquito avoidance only (no chemoprophylaxis) is recommended for people traveling to areas where cases of malaria transmission are rare to few (e.g. Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket).

### Atovaquone-proguanil versus mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis in nonimmune travelers: results from a randomized, double-blind study [^577868eb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Concerns about the tolerability of mefloquine highlight the need for new drugs to prevent malaria. Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone; GlaxoSmithKline) was safe and effective for prevention of falciparum malaria in lifelong residents of malaria-endemic countries, but experience in nonimmune people is limited. In a randomized, double-blind study, nonimmune travelers received malaria prophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil (493 subjects) or mefloquine (483 subjects). Information about adverse events (AEs) and potential episodes of malaria was obtained 7, 28, and 60 days after travel. AEs were reported by an equivalent proportion of subjects who had received atovaquone-proguanil or mefloquine (71.4% versus 67.3%; difference, 4.1%; 95% confidence interval, -1.71 to 9.9). Subjects who received atovaquone-proguanil had fewer treatment-related neuropsychiatric AEs (14% versus 29%; P = 0.001), fewer AEs of moderate or severe intensity (10% versus 19%; P = 0.001), and fewer AEs that caused prophylaxis to be discontinued (1.2% versus 5.0%; P = 0.001), compared with subjects who received melfoquine. No confirmed diagnoses of malaria occurred in either group. Atovaquone-proguanil was better tolerated than was mefloquine, and it was similarly effective for malaria prophylaxis in nonimmune travelers.

### The HIV-positive traveler [^167f409f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy has led to a substantial increase in the life expectancy and quality of life for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Increasingly, physicians are asked to counsel them before international travel to regions in which infectious diseases are more prevalent. The pretravel evaluation requires an accurate assessment of the patient's level of immune compromise as well as an understanding of the risks involved in travel to tropical countries. We review the safety and efficacy of travel medicine-related vaccines, important considerations when selecting antimalarial prophylaxis, and strategies for management of traveler's diarrhea. The prevention of sexually transmitted infections while abroad also is an important public health intervention for both the traveler and the potential sexual partners abroad. Beyond the health-related issues in international travel, HIV-positive patients may confront some significant legal hurdles in crossing international borders. We provide guidance in navigating the diverse and complex issues that arise for the HIV-positive traveler.

### Problem pathogens: prevention of malaria in travellers [^0932f5e8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Human infection with Plasmodium spp leading to clinical episodes of malaria probably began very early in the history of humankind and has persistently inflicted disease among human populations. Malaria is currently considered the world's most important parasitic infection. The global impact of malaria is incalculable and appears to be worsening over the past decades. Although most of this burden of disease is carried by developing tropical countries, cases of imported malaria acquired by international travel are increasingly reported. These numbers are growing because of increased travel to malaria-endemic areas and also due to increased risk of transmission in these areas. Indeed, travel has contributed to the global spread of malaria during the history of humankind. Travellers visiting malaria risk areas should use both personal protective measures and chemoprophylaxis. Non-adherence to chemoprophylactic regimens is frequently secondary to drug side-effects. Therefore, a careful risk-benefit analysis on the use of antimalarial prophylaxis should be carried out in every individual travelling to malaria risk areas. Standby malaria self-treatment represents an alternative in some travellers. However, carefully selected and geographically specific antimalarial drug regimens should be recommended to non-immune people travelling to high-risk areas.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 8 travel for work and other reasons [^2a227764]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy and antimalarial prophylaxis for long-term travel — mefloquine is considered safe in all trimesters and studies show no increase in teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes after its prophylactic use; chloroquine also has been used long-term without ill effects on pregnancy. If a woman traveling long-term is taking atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or primaquine, she should discontinue their medication and begin weekly mefloquine (or chloroquine in those areas where it remains efficacious) for at least 3–4 weeks to build up a therapeutic blood level of mefloquine before attempting to conceive. During the pre-travel consultation, advise women of the potential risks associated with becoming pregnant while taking antimalarial drugs; doxycycline is associated with fetal toxicity in animal studies and its use is contraindicated during pregnancy. Primaquine and tafenoquine can harm a G6PD-deficient fetus, so should not be used during pregnancy regardless of the mother's G6PD-status, and the effect of atovaquone-proguanil on the fetus is unknown. When pregnancy is anticipated, prophylaxis options might need to be adjusted; explore the possibility of pregnancy with all long-term travelers of childbearing potential before departure.

Malaria in febrile travelers returning from endemic areas — strict chemoprophylaxis adherence reduces risk and malaria must be considered: strict adherence substantially reduces the risk of malaria and increases the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis. More than 90% of US residents who acquire travel-associated malaria report not having adhered to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen. Regardless of chemoprophylaxis history, in travelers with febrile illness returning from malaria-endemic areas, the diagnosis should always be ruled out by appropriate diagnostic testing.

### Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas [^bd3c22a3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS.

### Case report: challenges of diagnosing malaria in returning travelers at the height of COVID-19 pandemic [^9ccfd834]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

These cases demonstrate the challenges associated with diagnosing malaria in non–malaria-endemic regions brought on by the changes in the delivery of care during COVID-19 pandemic. Complications associated with malaria infection can be reduced with prompt diagnosis and treatment. It is therefore important that a high index of suspicion for malaria is maintained in all individuals with a travel history to malaria-endemic regions with a compatible syndrome, regardless of comorbid conditions, use of antimalarial prophylaxis, and co-infections.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — atovaquone-proguanil: Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 1–2 days before travel and a good choice for shorter trips because the traveler takes the medicine for only 7 days after leaving the malaria-endemic area; pediatric tablets are available. It cannot be used by women who are pregnant or who are breastfeeding a child that weighs < 5 kg and cannot be taken by people with severe renal impairment; it also tends to be more expensive than some of the other options, especially for long trips.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — tafenoquine is indicated for chemoprophylaxis in malaria-endemic areas, with an adult dose of 200 mg orally; pediatric use is not indicated for use in children. Contraindications include persons with G6PD deficiency, pregnancy, and breastfeeding unless infant/child has a documented normal G6PD level. Before prescribing primaquine or tafenoquine to any patient, document a normal G6PD level using a quantitative test.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^9240994c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria — clinical suspicion after travel — chemoprophylaxis is not completely effective, and malaria should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever or other signs or symptoms consistent with malaria in anyone who traveled to malaria-endemic areas during the previous 12 months. Because malaria medications purchased in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia may be counterfeit, the index of suspicion must remain high when evaluating children with fever coming from endemic areas, regardless of prior history of antimalarial therapy.

### Prevention of malaria in long-term travelers [^52f8d061]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Long-term travelers, defined here as those traveling for periods of 6 months or longer, face particular challenges regarding malaria prevention. Current guidelines for malaria prevention primarily address prevention of Plasmodium falciparum infections in short-term travelers.

Objectives

To examine the risk of malaria in long-term travelers, recent developments in personal protective measures, and the safety and tolerability of malaria chemoprophylaxis during long-term use and to consider prevention strategies including continuous chemoprophylaxis, stand-by emergency self-treatment, seasonal prophylaxis, and strategies to prevent primary infection and relapses from P vivax malaria.

Evidence Acquisition

Comprehensive search of scientific publications including MEDLINE via both OVID and PubMED for relevant studies and articles with a cutoff date of July 2006, using the search terms long-term travel and malaria prevention, long-term malaria chemoprophylaxis, and insect repellent and malaria. Additional references were obtained from searching the bibliographies of the selected articles, from dissertations, and from the proceedings of relevant conferences on travel medicine. There were no language restrictions.

Evidence Synthesis

Long-term travelers have a higher risk of malaria than short-term travelers. Long-term travelers underuse personal protective measures and adhere poorly to continuous chemoprophylaxis regimens. A number of strategies are used during long-term stays: discontinuation of chemoprophylaxis after the initial period, sequential regimens with different medications for chemoprophylaxis, stand-by emergency self-treatment, and seasonal chemoprophylaxis targeting high-incidence periods or locations. All strategies have advantages and drawbacks. Counterfeit drugs sold in countries endemic for malaria pose serious concern for long-term travelers who purchase their medications overseas. Vivax malaria causes significant illness in travelers, but relapses of vivax malaria are not prevented with the current first-line chemoprophylaxis regimens. Consensus guidelines are needed for prevention of malaria in long-term travelers.

Conclusions

Prevention of malaria in long-term travelers is a complex issue and requires expert advice from travel medicine specialists. Recommendations for prevention of malaria in long-term travelers must be individualized.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — chloroquine: Some people would rather take medicine weekly, and it is a good choice for long trips because it is taken only weekly; it can be used in all trimesters of pregnancy. It cannot be used in areas with chloroquine resistance and can exacerbate psoriasis; it is not a good choice for last-minute travelers because drug needs to be started 1–2 weeks before travel, and some people would rather not take medication for another 4 weeks after leaving malaria-endemic areas.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles in English published from database inception until June 30, 2022, using the terms antimalarial AND prophylaxis AND malaria, filtering the search for Clinical Trials, Meta-Analyses, Randomized Controlled Trial, and Humans, and screening for clinical trials and systematic reviews. The search resulted in 104 articles. Of these, 19 described systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Of the remaining 85 describing clinical trials, five were controlled human challenge models; 52 presented intermittent preventive treatment in infants, children, or pregnant women; four assessed seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis; and 17 investigated the malaria-prophylactic effects of co-trimoxazole or antiretrovirals in people with HIV (n = 13), travellers (n = 2), or people with sickle cell anaemia (n = 2). Of the remaining seven studies, one in Kenyan school children found proguanil to be effective in preventing falciparum malaria. Five trials assessed chemoprophylaxis efficacy in Asian adults, including two placebo-controlled trials of monthly, single-dose naphthoquine–azithromycin in a low-risk setting on the China–Myanmar border that showed more than 90% efficacy in preventing malaria, with a good safety profile and tolerability and follow-up periods of 1 month and 2 months. In Thailand, a trial in men with occupational risk of malaria who received monthly or bimonthly 3-day treatment courses of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or placebo found 98% protective efficacy and good tolerability but required close supervision with weekly follow-up. This trial was done during a period of relatively high parasite prevalence. A trial of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis in pregnancy in Thailand found it to be completely effective in preventing Plasmodium vivax episodes. A comparison of tafenoquine and mefloquine prophylaxis in Australian soldiers returning from Timor-Leste demonstrated safety and tolerability but could not quantify impact in preventing malaria. One trial among Thai-Burmese children found proguanil to have poor prophylactic efficacy. These trials used microscopy to detect parasites, a method with poor sensitivity for low-density infections.

### Malaria chemoprophylaxis: what do the travelers choose, and how does pretravel consultation influence their final decision [^ebb1f9ca]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

Three different drugs (mefloquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline) are recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, each with approximately the same efficacy but various adverse event profiles, regimens, and prices. We investigated which medication the travelers would have chosen on the basis of written evidence-based information and the impact that pretravel consultation had on their decision. A prospective study was performed in a travel clinic and private practice, and 1073 travelers were included; 45% chose mefloquine (Lariam or Mephaquine), 21% atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), 18% doxycycline (Supracycline), 5% "no prophylaxis", and 11% "do not know". Lariam was principally chosen because of prior experience (38%), Mephaquine because of low price (34%), and doxycycline and Malarone because of the profile of adverse events (55% and 43%, respectively). Based on objective written information, travelers most frequently chose mefloquine for chemoprophylaxis. This suggests that evidence-based information weighs more heavily than negative publicity. Taking into account the perspective of the user should improve appropriateness of the pretravel advice.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine chemoprophylaxis — Chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) can be used to prevent malaria only in destinations where chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium spp. are not prevalent. Chemoprophylaxis should begin 1–2 weeks before travel to malaria-endemic areas, and travelers should continue taking the drug once a week, on the same day of the week, during travel in malaria-endemic areas, and for 4 weeks after they leave endemic areas. Reported side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine include blurred vision.

Malaria in returned travelers — Malaria is the most common life-threatening tropical disease associated with fever in returned travelers, and in the United States approximately 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed each year; more than 90% of reported cases of P. falciparum malaria manifest ≤ 30 days of return, whereas almost half of cases of Plasmodium vivax malaria manifest > 30 days after return. A history of taking malaria chemoprophylaxis does not exclude the possibility of malaria, and patients with malaria can be afebrile at the time of evaluation but typically give a history of fever or chills; malaria (especially P. falciparum) can progress rapidly and therefore requires prompt evaluation and initiation of treatment. In the United States, severe malaria occurs in approximately 10% of patients with malaria, and around 0.3% of those receiving a diagnosis of malaria die.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics.

A total of 3,227 trips with 2,803 travelers were analyzed (Table 1). The majority of travelers were male (62.1%), with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49). Caucasian (70.7%) was the most commonly reported race. Twenty-five percent of travelers were aged ≥ 60 years, and 27% who developed TD were aged ≥ 60 years. For malaria prophylaxis, 20% were prescribed doxycycline, 50% prescribed another form of malaria prophylaxis (89% of these were atovaquone–proguanil), and 30% were not prescribed malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' itineraries could include more than one region of travel. Forty-five percent traveled to Southeast (SE) Asia/Pacific Islands, 32% traveled to Africa, and 2% traveled to tropical South America. The cumulative incidence of TD was 17%, with an incidence rate of 53 per 1,000 travel days. Of the 406 trips where travelers developed TD and were prescribed malaria prophylaxis, the most common countries where TD occurred were Peru (n = 58, 14.3%), Vietnam (n = 38, 9.3%), India (n = 29, 7.1%), and Honduras (n = 28, 6.9%).

### The pretravel consultation: recent updates [^35601e9d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimates suggest that 43%-79% of international travelers may develop travel-related illnesses. Most such illnesses are considered mild and self-limited; however, some are life-threatening. The pretravel consultation is aimed at assessing risks for a range of illnesses, communicating these risks, and then providing individualized recommendations and interventions to minimize or manage such risks. The effective consultation is predicated on a well-prepared clinician and motivated traveler, understanding the traveler's perception of, and tolerance for, risk, and providing education applicable to the actual itinerary. Integral to the clinician's preparation is regular review of up-to-date trip-specific recommendations; country-specific information and recommendations are readily available and can now be efficiently accessed. From the infectious diseases perspective, immunizations, malaria chemoprophylaxis, insect repellent use, and travelers' diarrhea and its self-management are cornerstones of the consultation. This review focuses primarily on updating these 4 topics with recently published information relevant to adult travelers.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis — primaquine (testing, indications, schedules, and coadministration): Primaquine can cause potentially life-threatening hemolysis in people with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and G6PD deficiency must be ruled out with a quantitative laboratory test before prescribing primaquine to patients. Primaquine phosphate has 2 distinct uses for malaria prevention in people with normal G6PD levels: primary chemoprophylaxis in areas with primarily P. vivax and terminal chemoprophylaxis for travelers who have had prolonged exposure to P. vivax or P. ovale in malaria-endemic areas. When taken for primary chemoprophylaxis, primaquine should be taken 1–2 days before travel to malaria-endemic areas, daily, with food, ideally at the same time each day, while in the malaria-endemic area, and daily for 7 days after leaving the area. For terminal chemoprophylaxis in long-term travelers with prolonged exposure to P. ovale or P. vivax, when indicated, travelers should take primaquine for 14 days after leaving a malaria-endemic area, concurrently with their primary chemoprophylaxis medication; if chloroquine, doxycycline, or mefloquine is used for primary chemoprophylaxis, prescribe primaquine for travelers to take during the last 2 weeks of chemoprophylaxis; when atovaquone-proguanil is used, travelers can take primaquine during the final 7 days of atovaquone-proguanil, and then for an additional 7 days; if concurrent administration is not feasible, instruct travelers to take primaquine after completing their primary chemoprophylaxis medication; primary chemoprophylaxis with primaquine or with tafenoquine obviates the need for terminal chemoprophylaxis. Among people with normal G6PD levels taking primaquine, the most common adverse event is gastrointestinal upset, which can be minimized or eliminated if it is taken with food.

### Malaria… [^54d07610]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Chemoprophylaxis Choosing a drug to prevent malaria All recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens involve taking a medicine before, during, and after travel to an area with malaria. Beginning the drug before travel allows the antimalarial agent to be in the blood before the traveler is exposed to malaria parasites. In choosing a chemoprophylaxis regimen before travel, the traveler and the travel medicine specialist should consider several factors, including. Travel to areas with mefloquine-resistant malaria Mefloquine-resistant P. falciparum has been confirmed in Southeast Asia on the borders of Thailand with Burma and Cambodia, in the western provinces of Cambodia, in the eastern states of Burma on the border between Burma and China, along the borders of Burma and Laos, and in southern Vietnam. For destinations with known mefloquine-resistant Plasmodium spp., effective malaria chemoprophylaxis options are atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and tafenoquine. Medications used for chemoprophylaxis Atovaquone-proguanil Atovaquone-proguanil is a fixed combination of the drugs atovaquone and proguanil. Chemoprophylaxis should begin 1–2 days before travel to malaria-endemic areas; the medication should then be taken daily, with food, ideally at the same time each day, while in malaria-endemic areas, and daily for 7 days after leaving the endemic areas. Mefloquine chemoprophylaxis should begin ≥ 2 weeks before travel to malaria-endemic areas. Travelers should continue taking the drug weekly, on the same day each week, during travel in malaria-endemic areas and for 4 weeks after leaving endemic areas. Tafenoquine can be used to prevent malaria in adults.

Travelers should take a daily loading dose of tafenoquine for 3 days before leaving for a malaria-endemic area; starting 7 days after the loading dose is complete, they should take a weekly maintenance dose while in the malaria-endemic area; then take a final dose in the week after leaving the malaria-endemic area. Doses should be taken on the same day each week.

Malaria continues to be a significant, life-threatening illness in many parts of the world. For corporate travelers from countries with low endemicity, the risk of infection is considerable. Many corporate travelers are unaware of their risk, unsure of the correct preventative measures, and receive incorrect advice regarding prevention or do not comply with advice they have received. This review addresses the risk of malaria to the nonimmune corporate traveler, disease transmission, and recommended means of prevention, including prevention of mosquito bites and antimalaria chemoprophylaxis.

### Atovaquone-proguanil for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria [^877cffa7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the currently available information on atovaquone-proguanil for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted from 1966 to February 2003 using key phrases Malarone, atovaquone, proguanil, and malaria. Further articles were identified from a manual search of the references of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies with animal and human data evaluating preclinical pharmacology, human studies on pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials were evaluated. Relevant data were extracted from identified articles.

Data Synthesis

Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in 8 clinical trials. In these studies, treatment with atovaquone-proguanil led to a higher (87–100% vs. 72–88%) or equally effective (94–100% vs. 90–100%) cure rate than the comparator antimalarial agents. Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for prophylaxis of malaria in 6 clinical trials. In the 4 placebo-controlled trials for semi-immune residents or nonimmune migrants, the prophylaxis success rates in the atovaquone-proguanil and placebo arms ranged from 98% to 100% and 48% to 82%, respectively. The prophylaxis with success rates were similar among the 2 arms when atovaquone-proguanil was compared with other antimalarial regimens in nonimmune travelers. Atovaquone-proguanil was well tolerated in these clinical trials.

Conclusions

Atovaquone-proguanil is a safe and effective alternative to current recommended regimens for prophylaxis and treatment of malaria.

### Malaria prophylaxis in latin America: a controversial topic [^5b76c9ed]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We read the comprehensive review of Steinhardt and colleagues on malaria prophylaxis for travelers to Latin America with great interest. Still, because this subject is controversial in Travel Medicine, we would like to add some information from Germany, a country not cited by the review.

Primaquine is the only available drug that eradicates hepatic stages of malaria parasites including hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. It is licensed for radical cure after vivax or ovale malaria. Only the U.S. American guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend it as a first-line option for primary prophylaxis. Therefore, the conclusion by Steinhardt and colleges to name primaquine as a recommended option for certain regions of Latin America is not based on a broad international consensus. To our personal experience, the use of this drug is hampered by several factors:
1 There is a lack of data and experience with primaquine in primary prophylaxis of malaria. Although the daily travel medicine practice deals mainly with brief regimens, most trials with primaquine have only evaluated longer regimens of over 12 weeks of prophylaxis. Furthermore, the capacity to prevent falciparum malaria, which is the main goal of malaria chemoprophylaxishas not been evaluated in larger studies. This is of importance, because in most Latin American areas with P. vivax predominance, Plasmodium falciparum co-occurs.
2 Because the drug is not licensed or recommended for primary prophylaxis in any country except the United States, the prescribing physician is liable for any damage caused by primaquine. Furthermore, in many countries, the drug is not easily available as it has to be imported from foreign countries.
3 The necessary testing for glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity before taking the drug adds significant costs and together with the delay of G6PD activity reporting renders the prophylactic use of primaquine impractical in daily travel medicine practice.

### Choosing a drug to prevent malaria… [^70bdcbed]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Drugs to prevent malaria differ by country of travel.
- Counsel patients to use personal protective measures along with malaria chemoprophylaxis.
- Consider contraindications and drug-drug interactions when prescribing a malaria prophylaxis.
- Consider the timing of when to start and stop chemoprophylaxis. Some medications require patients take them weeks in advance of travel and continued after leaving the malaria-endemic area. > 40 kg and over: 1 adult tablet daily.
- Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 1–2 days before traveling to an area where malaria transmission occurs
- Some people prefer to take a daily medicine
- Good choice for shorter trips because you only have to take the medicine for 7 days after traveling rather than 4 weeks
- Very well tolerated medicine – side effects uncommon.
- Not a good choice for last-minute travelers because drug needs to be started at least 2 weeks prior to travel
- Some people would rather not take a weekly medication
- For trips of short duration, some people would rather not take medication for 4 weeks after travel Primaquine Begin 1–2 days prior to travel, daily during travel, and for 7 days after leaving. Adults: 30 mg base, daily Children:

0. 5 mg/kg base up to adult dose daily
- It is one of the most effective medicines for preventing P. vivaxand so it is a good choice for travel to places with > 90% P. vivax.
- Good choice for shorter trips because you only have to take the medicine for 7 days after traveling rather than 4 weeks
- Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 1–2 days before traveling to an area where malaria transmission occurs
- Some people prefer to take a daily medicine
- Cannot be used in patients with glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency.
- One of the most effective drugs for prevention of P. vivax malaria, but also prevents P. falciparum
- Good choice for shorter trips because you only have to take the medicine once, 1 week after traveling rather than 4 weeks
- Good for last-minute travelers because the drug is started 3 days before traveling to an area where malaria transmission occurs.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of atovaquone / proguanil for the prevention of plasmodium falciparum or plasmodium vivax malaria among migrants to papua, Indonesia [^003edfcf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of resistance to antimalarial drugs reduces options for malaria prophylaxis. Atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone; GlaxoSmithKline) has been > 95% effective in preventing Plasmodium falciparum malaria in lifelong residents of areas of holoendemicity, but data from persons without clinical immunity or who are at risk for Plasmodium vivax malaria have not been described. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study involving 297 people from areas of nonendemicity in Indonesia who migrated to Papua (where malaria is endemic) ≤ 26 months before the study period. Subjects received prophylaxis with 1 Malarone tablet (250 mg of atovaquone and 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride; n = 148) or placebo (n = 149) per day for 20 weeks. Hematologic and clinical chemistry values did not change significantly. The protective efficacy of atovaquone/proguanil was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44%-95%) for P. vivax malaria, 96% (95% CI, 72%-99%) for P. falciparum malaria, and 93% (95% CI, 77%-98%) overall. Atovaquone/proguanil was well tolerated, safe, and effective for the prevention of drug-resistant P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria in individuals without prior malaria exposure who migrated to Papua, Indonesia.

Immunocompromised travelers — contraindications and other health risks — Healthcare professionals should assess whether the traveler's conditions, medications, or treatments constitute contraindications to, decrease the effectiveness of, or increase the risk for adverse events from disease-prevention measures for the trip. Depending on destination, measures might include immunizations or medications for malaria chemoprophylaxis or self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea. Clinicians also should assess whether destination health hazards could exacerbate underlying conditions or cause more severe outcomes in an immunocompromised traveler and determine whether specific interventions are available to mitigate these risks.

Long-term malaria prophylaxis for travelers — doxycycline, mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil, chloroquine, and tafenoquine: Doxycycline has been well tolerated and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has no recommended limits on its duration of use for malaria prophylaxis. Mefloquine might be appropriate for long-term prophylaxis in chloroquine-resistant areas because of convenient weekly dosing, but there is concern about neuropsychiatric side effects per the FDA black box warning. Atovaquone-proguanil shows good long-term tolerability with a discontinuation rate of only 1% because of diarrhea, and Peace Corps volunteers prescribed it adhered better than those given doxycycline or mefloquine. In areas where chloroquine remains effective and extended (> 5 years) use is planned, a baseline ophthalmic examination with biannual follow-up is recommended to screen for potential retinal toxicity. Tafenoquine may be useful for some long-term travelers due to weekly dosing; however, use should be avoided in people with documented glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or those not tested for G6PD deficiency, it is not recommended for people with a history of psychotic disorder, and pregnancy is a contraindication to tafenoquine use.

Malaria chemoprophylaxis for pediatric HIV travelers — regimens and dosing: Primary chemoprophylaxis should be prescribed to all individuals traveling to malaria-endemic areas, and families are advised to visit a travel medicine specialist with training and experience in pediatrics at least 2 weeks before departure (AII), though regimens can still be prescribed and effectively used up to the day of departure. For chloroquine-sensitive areas, chloroquine phosphate (5 mg/kg body weight base, up to 300-mg base) given once weekly is acceptable, and other acceptable choices include primaquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine; for areas with mainly Plasmodium vivax, primaquine is a very good option and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing should precede primaquine. For chloroquine-resistant areas, travelers should take atovaquone/proguanil daily (dosed on a sliding scale by weight bands), daily doxycycline (2.2 mg/kg body weight for children aged ≥ 8 years), or weekly mefloquine, with medications started before leaving and continued after return as per their specific schedule. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not recommended as effective prophylaxis for malaria (AIII).

### WITHDRAWN: mefloquine for preventing malaria in non-immune adult travellers [^4a231b50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Mefloquine is commonly prescribed to prevent malaria in travellers, and has replaced other drugs because Plasmodium falciparum is commonly resistant to them. However, mefloquine may be associated with neuropsychiatric harmful effects.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mefloquine in adult travellers compared to other regimens in relation to episodes of malaria, withdrawal from prophylaxis, and adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialized trials register (September 2002), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), LILACS (September 2002), Science Citation Index (1981 to September 2002), and bibliographies in retrieved papers and standard textbooks. We contacted researchers in the subject of malaria chemoprophylaxis, and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing mefloquine with other standard prophylaxis or placebo in non-immune adult travellers, and in non-travelling volunteers. For adverse events, any published case reports were collected.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Adverse events from observational studies were categorised by the study type. We also contacted study authors.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2750 non-immune adult participants. Five of these were field trials, and of these all were in mainly male soldiers. One trial comparing mefloquine with placebo showed mefloquine prevented malaria episodes in an area of drug resistance (Peto odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.02 to 0.08). Withdrawals in the mefloquine group were consistently higher in four placebo controlled trials (odds ratio 3.56, 95% confidence interval 1.67 to 7.60). In five trials comparing mefloquine with other chemoprophylaxis, no difference in tolerability was detected. We found 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects. 63 per cent of these published reports involved tourists and business travellers. There were four fatalities attributed to mefloquine.

Authors' Conclusions

Mefloquine prevents malaria, but has adverse effects that limit its acceptability. There is evidence from non-randomised studies that mefloquine has potentially harmful effects in tourists and business travellers, and its use needs to be carefully balanced against this. Trials of comparative effects of antimalarial prophylaxis should include episodes of malaria and withdrawal from prophylaxis as outcomes.

Changing medications as a result of side effects during chemoprophylaxis — medications recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis have different modes of action that affect the parasites at different stages of the life cycle, so if the medication needs to be changed because of side effects before a full course has been completed, some special considerations exist. Switching from a daily to a weekly chemoprophylaxis medication is not recommended because it takes time for the weekly medication to reach protective levels.

Malaria primary prophylaxis — children with and exposed to HIV traveling to chloroquine-sensitive areas includes chloroquine base 5 mg/kg body weight base by mouth, up to 300 mg once weekly (equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg body weight chloroquine phosphate), started 1–2 weeks before leaving, taken weekly while away, and then once weekly for 4 weeks after returning home. Atovaquone/proguanil is given once daily started 1–2 days before travel, for duration of stay, and then for 1 week after returning home, with weight-based dosing of 11–20 kg one pediatric tablet (62.5 mg/25 mg), 21–30 kg two pediatric tablets (125 mg/50 mg), 31–40 kg three pediatric tablets (187.5 mg/75 mg), and > 40 kg one adult tablet (250 mg/100 mg). Doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg body weight (maximum 100 mg) by mouth once daily for children aged ≥ 8 years must be taken 1–2 days before travel, daily while away, and then up to 4 weeks after returning. Mefloquine 5 mg/kg body weight is given orally once weekly (maximum 250 mg).

Prevention of malaria — combine mosquito-avoidance measures with chemoprophylaxis, test all febrile returnees, and tailor measures to individualized risk. Malaria prevention consists of a combination of mosquito-avoidance measures and chemoprophylaxis, and prevention measures must address all malaria species in the travel area. Although highly efficacious, interventions are not 100% effective, so all febrile persons returning from malaria-endemic areas should be tested for malaria even if they took chemoprophylaxis. A risk assessment for every traveler includes itinerary details, traveler characteristics, and epidemiological features at the destination, and depending on risk it might be appropriate to recommend no specific interventions, mosquito avoidance measures only, or mosquito avoidance measures plus chemoprophylaxis. Several factors increase risk, including travel — even for short periods — to areas with intense transmission, heterogeneity of transmission within countries, travel during peak transmission season in seasonal settings, and staying in rural areas or accommodations without screens or air conditioning.

### Mefloquine for preventing malaria during travel to endemic areas [^84907b1d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

RCTs

Nine RCTs comparing prophylactic mefloquine with placebo reported efficacy (4032 participants, Table 5), and 13 reported safety outcomes (4293 participants, Table 6). The trials were conducted between 1977 and 2003, and none included participants travelling outside their home country. One trial conducted among soldiers in Indonesia described participants as non‐immune (Ohrt 1997), but immunity is likely to be low in other trials from Asia (Bunnag 1992; Nosten 1994; Pearlman 1980). The participants in four trials from Africa were described as semi‐immune (Hale 2003; Salako 1992; Sossouhounto 1995; Weiss 1995). Santos 1993 was conducted in an area of Brazil in which endemic transmission occurs.

Characteristics of included studies for efficacy

Mefloquine versus placebo/no treatment; characteristics of included studies for safety

Seven trials used mefloquine at a dose of 250 mg weekly (or equivalent doses for children), four at 250 mg weekly for the first four weeks and then 125 mg weekly for the remainder of the study, and one trial used mefloquine doses of 500 mg every four weeks and 250 mg every two weeks (Santos 1993). Pearlman 1980 used mefloquine doses of 180 mg weekly, 360 mg weekly and 360 mg fortnightly. Trial duration varied from 48 hours to 26 weeks.

For safety, nine trials used interviews with study personnel to elicit adverse events (Bunnag 1992; Hale 2003; Nosten 1994; Ohrt 1997; Salako 1992; Santos 1993; Schlagenhauf 1997; Vuurman 1996; Weiss 1995). Of these, six trials questioned participants about symptoms at least weekly (Hale 2003; Nosten 1994; Ohrt 1997; Salako 1992; Vuurman 1996; Weiss 1995). Two trials used participant self‐reported diaries to record any adverse events (Davis 1996, Potasman 2002). Pearlman 1980 used a weekly 'sick call' by study personnel and Sossouhounto 1995 provided 'access to the village health centre'. Only two trials used explicit definitions for adverse events and effects that allow for reproducible ascertainment (Davis 1996, Vuurman 1996). For safety outcomes, nine of the 13 trials adequately described how adverse events were ascertained. Eleven trials actively sought adverse events, and all 13 collected data prospectively (Table 7).

Antimalarial drugs for pediatric prophylaxis — eligibility and safety — are delineated as follows: Pediatric doses for malaria prophylaxis are weight-based and are provided in Table 4.10.3; Chloroquine, mefloquine, and primaquine may be given to children of all ages, atovaquone-proguanil to children ≥ 5 kg, doxycycline to children over age 8, and tafenoquine to those > 18 years of age; G6PD testing is required before using primaquine or tafenoquine because these medications should not be used for malaria prophylaxis in those with G6PD deficiency; Training children as young as the age of 4 years to swallow pills using small candies or similarly sized food items can be a valuable strategy when time allows; Overdose of antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, can be fatal; Medications should be stored in childproof containers and kept out of the reach of infants and children; If vomiting occurs within 1–2 hours of administration, repeat dose. If repeated doses are vomited, discussion with a medical provider is warranted.

How the intervention might work

Malaria chemoprophylaxis is defined as the use of antimalarial medication to prevent the clinical symptoms of malaria (Schlagenhauf 2010). This is because no drugs are able to prevent the introduction of infection by destroying the sporozoites injected by the female Anopheles mosquito. Chemoprophylaxis is one of several tools used to prevent malaria; other recommended measures include sleeping under insecticide‐treated bed nets, wearing insecticide‐treated clothing, and applying chemical repellent sprays to the skin surface (WHO 2017). None of these methods provide complete protection and a combination of approaches is advised.

Chemoprophylaxis works by blocking the development or reproduction of the malaria parasite at various stages in its life cycle:

doxycycline and mefloquine are examples of suppressive prophylactics and act in the blood stream as the schizonts invade erythrocytes. Doxycycline therefore needs to be taken for at least one month after returning from endemic areas (Shanks 2005);
atovaquone‐proguanil and primaquine have effects on the early liver stages of Plasmodium spp and prevent the progression to blood stage parasites which cause clinical illness. These agents therefore only need to be taken for one week after leaving the malaria‐endemic area (Shanks 2005).

Currently, the baseline efficacy of doxycycline, atovaquone‐proguanil and mefloquine when used as prophylaxis to prevent malaria is thought to be similar. Most guidelines therefore recommend selecting appropriate antimalarial prophylaxis based on individual choice, pre‐existing conditions, side effect profile, and drug resistance patterns in the destination country (CDC 2015b; PHE 2015; WHO 2017). Drug resistance to all antimalarial agents is a growing concern, and mefloquine resistance has been reported in some areas of north‐western Thailand (Treiber 2010; Treiber 2011).

In addition, the efficacy of all forms of malaria prevention is impeded by adherence. Nearly all cases of fatal malaria in travellers occur due to non‐adherence with prophylactic measures (Schlagenhauf 2010). However, this needs to be balanced against the tolerability and safety of chemoprophylaxis; the frequency of mild to moderate adverse drug reactions varies from 32% to 45% (Schlagenhauf 2003). Both policy makers and individual travellers need to balance carefully the risk benefit profile of contracting malaria against using chemoprophylaxis.

### Impact of doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis on risk of influenza-like illness among international travelers [^fc657613]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Travelers are often at risk for both influenza-like illness (ILI) and malaria. Doxycycline is active against pathogens causing ILI and is used for malaria prophylaxis. We evaluated the risk factors for ILI, and whether the choice of malaria prophylaxis was associated with ILI. TravMil is a prospective observational study enrolling subjects presenting to military travel clinics. Influenza-like illness was defined as subjective fever with either a sore throat or cough. Characteristics of trip and use of malaria prophylaxis were analyzed to determine association with development of ILI. Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used to estimate relative risk (RR) of ILI. A total of 3,227 trips were enrolled: 62.1% male, median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59), median travel duration 19 days (IQR 12, 49); 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America. Military travel (46%) and vacation (40%) were most common reasons for travel. Among them, 20% took doxycycline, 50% other prophylaxis, and 30% took none; 8.7% developed ILI. Decreased RR of ILI was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.65 [0.43–0.99], P = 0.046) and military travel (RR 0.30 [0.21–0.43], P < 0.01). Increased risk of ILI was associated with female gender (RR 1.57 [1.24–1.98], P < 0.01), travel to Asia (RR 1.37 [1.08–1.75], P = 0.01), and cruises (RR 2.21 [1.73–2.83], P < 0.01). Use of doxycycline malaria prophylaxis is associated with a decreased risk of ILI. Possible reasons include anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial effects, or other unmeasured factors. With few strategies for decreasing ILI in travelers, these findings bear further investigation.

Malaria — chemoprophylaxis for infants, children, and adolescents includes that all children traveling to malaria-endemic areas should use recommended prevention measures, which often include taking an antimalarial drug, and pediatric doses should be calculated carefully according to body weight but never exceed the adult dose. Atovaquone-proguanil can be used as chemoprophylaxis for infants and children weighing ≥ 5 kg (≥ 11 lb); prophylactic dosing for children weighing < 11 kg (< 24 lb) constitutes off-label use in the United States, while chloroquine and mefloquine are options for infants and children of all ages and weights, depending on drug resistance at the destination. Doxycycline can be used for children aged ≥ 8 years, and primaquine can be used for children who are not glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient and who are traveling to areas with principally P. vivax; giving the dose on a full stomach can minimize stomach upset and vomiting, and pediatric dosing regimens are included in Table 4.10.3.

### Drugs for preventing malaria in travellers [^a1dd8c72]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Malaria infects 10,000 to 30,000 international travellers each year. It can be prevented through anti-mosquito measures and drug prophylaxis. However, antimalaria drugs have adverse effects which are sometimes serious.

Objectives

To compare the effects of currently used antimalaria drugs when given as prophylaxis to non-immune adult and child travellers who are travelling to regions with Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine. Specifically, to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine compared to each other, and also when compared to chloroquine-proguanil and to primaquine.

Search Strategy

In August 2009 we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, BIOSIS, mRCT, and reference lists. We handsearched conference proceedings and one specialist journal, and contacted researchers and drug companies. We searched PubMed for drug-related deaths.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any antimalaria drug regimen currently used by non-immune international travellers.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently extracted data and assessed eligibility and risk of bias using a standardized data collection form. We resolved any disagreement through discussion. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using mean difference (MD), presenting both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight trials (4240 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Evidence on comparative efficacy from head-to-head comparisons was limited. Atovaquone-proguanil compared to doxycycline had similar adverse events reported. Compared to mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil users had fewer reports of any adverse effect (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.85), gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.7), neuropsychiatric adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99), and neuropsychiatric adverse effects (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.63), besides a better total mood disturbance score (MD -7.20, 95% CI -10.79 to -3.61). Similarly, doxycycline users had fewer reported neuropsychiatric events than mefloquine users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96). We also examined these three regimens against chloroquine-proguanil; this latter regimen had more reports of any adverse effect (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96) and of gastrointestinal adverse effects (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.85).

Authors' Conclusions

Atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline are the best tolerated regimens, and mefloquine is associated with adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes.

### Doxycycline malaria prophylaxis impact on risk of travelers' diarrhea among international travelers [^33f8bb6b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

International travelers are frequently at risk for travelers' diarrhea (TD) and malaria. Doxycycline was one of the earliest antibiotics shown to have efficacy in TD prevention. With increasing resistance and recommendations against antibiotic chemoprophylaxis, doxycycline fell out of use. We evaluated TD incidence and risk factors in a prospective cohort of travelers, specifically in regard to malaria prophylaxis. Travelers' diarrhea was defined as ≥ 3 loose stools in 24 hours or two loose stools in 24 hours associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms. The Poisson regression model with robust error variance was used to estimate the RR of TD. Three thousand two hundred twenty-seven trips were enrolled: 62.1% of participants were male, with a median age of 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27,59) and a median travel duration of 19 days (IQR 12,49); 17.4% developed TD; 32% traveled to Africa, 40% to Asia, and 27% to the Caribbean and Latin America; and 20% took doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis, 50% took other antimalarials, and 30% took none. Decreased RR of TD was associated with doxycycline (RR 0.62 [0.47–0.82], P < 0.01) and military travel (RR 0.57 [0.47–0.70], P < 0.01). Increased risk of TD was associated with female gender (RR 1.28 [1.09–1.50], P < 0.01), hotel accommodations (RR 1.30 [1.10–1.53], P < 0.01), travel to tropical South America (RR 1.34 [1.09–1.64], P < 0.01), and duration of travel (RR 1.00 [1.00–1.01], P < 0.01). The use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis is associated with lower TD risk, suggesting increasing bacterial enteropathogen susceptibility similar to previous observations. Doxycycline selection for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis may provide additional traveler benefit in infection prevention.

HIV travelers — malaria and other vector-borne pathogens — pre-travel assessment and prevention: Pre-travel consultation for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should include an assessment of travel destinations and risk of exposure to malaria and other vector-borne pathogens. The risk of malaria and disease severity are increased in people with HIV, especially for people with advanced HIV. People with HIV who have a low CD4 count and HIV-infected women who are pregnant (or likely to become pregnant), regardless of CD4 count, should consider delaying travel to malaria-endemic areas. If travel cannot be deferred, use of effective malaria prophylaxis and precautions to avoid mosquito bites are essential. Preventive measures include chemoprophylaxis and mosquito-avoidance measures, such as sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, the use of DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)-containing repellants, and wearing clothes that cover most of the body. Mosquito-avoidance measures can also prevent exposure to arboviral diseases including chikungunya, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Zika, and used in combination, these preventive measures are highly effective. Healthcare professionals should be aware of potential drug interactions between malaria chemoprophylaxis and common antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, and any febrile traveler returning from a malaria-endemic area should be tested for malaria, even if they took chemoprophylaxis.

Post-travel evaluation — asymptomatic eosinophilia — parasitic infections are rare in most travelers, so other etiologies for eosinophilia must be considered, and a common cause is drug-induced eosinophilia including antimicrobials, anticonvulsants, anti-inflammatories, immunomodulators, and antimalarial prophylaxis. Eosinophilia can be pronounced early in helminthic infections and usually coincides with larval migration through tissues, then slowly decreases over time; other nematode infections associated with eosinophilia include lymphatic filariasis, chronic strongyloidiasis, acute trichinellosis, and visceral larva migrans. These infections might be asymptomatic but also could have associated symptoms, and protozoa, in general, do not cause eosinophilia with the exception of Cystoisospora belli and Sarcocystis spp.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria primary chemoprophylaxis — HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children traveling to malaria-endemic areas should be prescribed primary chemoprophylaxis, and families are advised to visit a travel medicine specialist with training and experience in pediatrics at least 2 weeks before departure (AII). For chloroquine-sensitive areas, chloroquine phosphate (5 mg/kg body weight base, up to 300-mg base) given once weekly is acceptable; other acceptable choices include primaquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine, with travelers to areas with mainly Plasmodium vivax for whom primaquine is a very good option and who should have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing before this medication is started. For chloroquine-resistant areas, travelers should take atovaquone/proguanil (daily dosed on a sliding scale by weight bands), or daily doxycycline (2.2 mg/kg body weight for children aged ≥ 8 years) or weekly mefloquine, dosed based on weight; medications for prophylaxis should be started before leaving and continued after returning from travel, as per their specific schedule, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is not a surrogate for antimalarial prophylaxis, and is not recommended as effective prophylaxis for malaria (AIII).

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^bc479103]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Summary

Indications.

The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication for the use of doxycycline for malaria is for prophylaxis of Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine-resistant strains. Although not FDA approved, doxycycline is recommended for prophylaxis of other species of malariaand may be used long term. When used in conjunction with other medications, doxycycline can be used for the treatment of malaria in non-pregnant adults and children ≥ 8 years of age: with quinine sulfate for uncomplicated, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; with both quinine sulfate and primaquine for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax; and with parenteral quinidine for severe malaria.

Dosing.

Available in multiple dosage forms and strengths, doxycycline tablets or capsules of 100 mg are most often used for malaria prophylaxis or treatment. Tablets or capsules should be swallowed with an adequate amount of fluid and should be taken with food. Intravenous (IV) formulation is available for patients unable to take oral medications for treatment. For IV, avoid rapid administration.

Adults.

Prophylaxis: 100 mg base once daily starting 1–2 days before travel, then daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 100 mg twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale.

Children.

For children ≥ 8 years of age.

Prophylaxis: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) daily starting 1–2 days before travel, daily during travel, and daily for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.

Treatment: 2.2 mg/kg (up to adult dose of 100 mg) twice a day for 7 days; must be used in conjunction with a fast acting schizontocide. Primaquine is also required if treating P. vivax or P. ovale.

Efficacy.

Prophylaxis: Protective efficacy of doxycycline has been shown in three randomized placebo-controlled trials to be between 92% and 96% for P. falciparum and 98% for primary P. vivax infection.

Treatment: When used in combination with a fast acting schizontocide, treatment efficacy of doxycycline has been shown to be 96–100% in three open-label trials.

### Plasmodium knowlesi infection in traveler returning to Canada from the Philippines, 2023 [^96963f3d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, P. knowlesi malaria should be considered in persons with febrile illness who have traveled to the Philippines (especially Cebu Province and Palawan Island). Because of overlapping microscopy features with P. falciparum and P. malariae, molecular confirmation is required to enable early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Despite gains in control of P. falciparum and P. vivax infection in Southeast Asia, the zoonotic nature of P. knowlesi and rise in cases highlight the need for tailored prevention and control strategies.

Mexico — malaria risk and chemoprophylaxis: Malaria incidence has decreased dramatically in Mexico, and Plasmodium vivax is the only endemic species; prophylaxis is recommended in Campeche, Chiapas, and southern Chihuahua, with occasional cases in Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Sonora, and Tabasco, and there is usually no malaria transmission along the US-Mexico border despite one case of locally acquired P. vivax in Texas near the border in 2023.

Malaria prophylaxis and treatment in immunocompromised travelers — asplenia and some immunosuppressive conditions and treatments can predispose travelers to more serious malaria infections and such patients may be more likely to experience drug interactions with malaria treatments (e.g. QT prolongation or altered mental status with tacrolimus and mefloquine), so stress the need for malaria chemoprophylaxis and strict adherence to mosquito bite avoidance; malaria treatment regimens, including artemisinin derivatives, quinine/quinidine, lumefantrine, and atovaquone and proguanil potentially could have interactions with medications and clinicians should seek advice from CDC or other malaria experts when needed, and increasing resistance to artemisinin drugs in both Asia and Africa means that immunocompromised persons treated with artemether/lumefantrine orally or artesunate IV need to be followed closely for recrudescence after initial clinical recovery; in organ transplant recipients, atovaquone-proguanil is the favored malaria prophylactic agent because other antimalarials can interact with calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, chloroquine, doxycycline mefloquine, and primaquine can elevate calcineurin inhibitor levels, chloroquine and mefloquine can interact with calcineurin inhibitors to prolong the QT interval, and some travel-related medications need to be dose-adjusted according to altered hepatic or renal function.
