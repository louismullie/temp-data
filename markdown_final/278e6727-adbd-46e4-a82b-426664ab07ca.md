## Question

Treating fluid in ear

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage otitis media with effusion (fluid in the ear) in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing OME from acute otitis media. Then, I should verify the natural history to anchor the watchful waiting strategy. Next, I will review which medical therapies to avoid and why. After that, I need to check when to obtain hearing testing and how to monitor. Then, I will examine surgical indications and age-based procedural choices. I should also consider special populations and shared decision-making. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight key counseling points and evidence gaps, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines and high-quality trials where available.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because OME is fluid behind an intact tympanic membrane without signs of acute infection. Pneumatic otoscopy is the key bedside maneuver to document middle ear effusion and reduced tympanic membrane mobility, and if the diagnosis remains uncertain, tympanometry can provide objective corroboration. I should double-check that I'm not conflating OME with AOM, which requires acute inflammatory signs or symptoms, as that would change management entirely [^111V3q59] [^1165A9xp] [^111nc5aK].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before proposing any intervention, because most effusions resolve spontaneously. Approximately half of cases resolve within 3 months and up to 95% resolve within 1 year, so watchful waiting is appropriate for most children who are not at risk, and I need to ensure families understand this favorable trajectory to avoid unnecessary treatments [^111DMZrm] [^115UoGJR] [^1132zHVL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to prescribing medications that don't help. I should confirm that antibiotics, intranasal or systemic steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants are not recommended for OME because benefits are small or transient and harms, including adverse effects and resistance, outweigh any marginal gains. The OSTRICH randomized trial showed no significant improvement in acceptable hearing at 5 weeks with oral prednisolone, reinforcing the guideline stance against routine steroid use [^112EjPNp] [^115cw4ZV] [^113n6vCk] [^111YhnVb].

> I need to check when to escalate beyond observation. If OME persists for 3 months or longer, or if the child is at risk for developmental sequelae, I should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test, because persistent bilateral effusion with hearing loss can impact speech and language development. At-risk children include those with baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral risk factors, and they warrant earlier and closer follow-up [^113WF1cB] [^1131Dqsw] [^114G4Uh5].

> Let me consider surgical options carefully and align them with age and hearing status. For children under 4 years, tympanostomy tubes are the procedure of choice when surgery is indicated, and adenoidectomy should not be performed solely for OME without another indication such as nasal obstruction or chronic adenoiditis. For children 4 years and older, shared decision-making can include tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both, with evidence suggesting adenoidectomy may reduce recurrence and future surgery in older children. I should confirm that tubes improve short-term hearing and reduce time with effusion, though long-term developmental benefits are less clear and tympanic membrane sequelae can occur [^113QGkvV] [^113zLGjS] [^116aLddA] [^111kPfZj] [^113Tcd2i].

> But wait, what if the family prefers to avoid surgery? I should review non-surgical alternatives such as autoinflation, which may modestly improve short-term outcomes and quality of life in cooperative children, though evidence certainty is low and adherence can be challenging. Hearing aids are reasonable when surgery is deferred or contraindicated, acknowledging comfort and psychosocial considerations, and I should ensure families understand the trade-offs and uncertainties [^112hhMdf] [^1165K74n] [^111DoZR1].

> I should double-check special populations and counseling needs. Children with craniofacial anomalies, cleft palate, Down syndrome, or other syndromes have higher prevalence and persistence of OME and merit proactive surveillance and earlier intervention discussions. After newborn hearing screening failures, I need to counsel that most fluid-related losses resolve but a minority may have permanent sensorineural hearing loss requiring follow-up audiometry. Shared decision-making is essential in at-risk children where documentation of effusion and hearing status may be more difficult [^114G4Uh5] [^116M6YSV] [^115BheY2].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and documentation. For chronic OME, re-evaluation every 3 to 6 months is reasonable until the effusion resolves, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities emerge, and I should document resolution of effusion, improved hearing, or improved quality of life as outcomes to track care value and guide next steps [^112JpuvH] [^112zLhzB].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. First, confirm OME with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry if needed. Second, if duration is under 3 months and the child is not at risk, recommend watchful waiting with return precautions. Third, if duration is 3 months or longer, or the child is at risk, obtain hearing testing. Fourth, if hearing is normal and symptoms are minimal, continue observation with periodic reassessment. Fifth, if there is mild to moderate bilateral hearing loss with persistent effusion, discuss tympanostomy tubes, with adenoidectomy considered in children 4 years and older or when there are additional indications. Sixth, if surgery is deferred, consider autoinflation or hearing aids as temporizing strategies, with clear counseling about uncertainties and follow-up plans [^111V3q59] [^117LHq12] [^116aLddA] [^112hhMdf].

> I should confirm key counseling messages to prevent misinterpretation. Families should know that most ear fluid resolves on its own, that routine medications like antibiotics and steroids do not help and can cause harm, that persistent fluid with hearing loss may warrant tubes, and that water precautions after tubes are generally unnecessary except in specific scenarios such as dirty water exposure or current drainage. I need to ensure families understand the risks and benefits of tubes, including otorrhea and tympanosclerosis, and the possibility of tube extrusion or the need for replacement [^117Kyqvf] [^115ztNrV] [^111kPfZj].

> Finally, I will examine evidence gaps and ensure humility in recommendations. High-quality randomized data are limited for several decisions, including the optimal timing of surgery in subgroups, the role of adenoidectomy under age 4, and the long-term developmental impact of tubes versus watchful waiting. Ongoing research and individualized judgment remain crucial, and I should revisit decisions as new evidence emerges and as the child's hearing, speech, and developmental status evolve [^117MA9Wv] [^111kPfZj] [^112YAxw6].

Treat fluid in the ear (otitis media with effusion) with **watchful waiting for 3 months** [^115UoGJR] from diagnosis or onset, as most cases resolve spontaneously [^111DMZrm]. Avoid **antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, and decongestants** [^112EjPNp] because they are ineffective and may cause harm [^115cw4ZV] [^116ut4Jd]. If fluid persists beyond 3 months or causes hearing loss, arrange **hearing testing** [^113WF1cB] and consider tympanostomy tubes [^111kPfZj] or autoinflation [^112hhMdf]. Educate families on the natural course, monitor at 3–6 month intervals [^112JpuvH], and refer to ENT if hearing loss, speech delay, or structural abnormalities occur [^114DqTAM].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Confirm the diagnosis with **pneumatic otoscopy** [^111V3q59] to document middle ear effusion; use tympanometry [^112YAxw6] if the diagnosis is uncertain after otoscopy.

---

## Initial management: watchful waiting

- **Watchful waiting**: Strongly recommended for 3 months [^115UoGJR] from diagnosis or onset, as most cases resolve spontaneously [^111DMZrm].

- **Parent education**: Explain the natural history, need for follow-up, and potential sequelae [^112nBRd5].

- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate every 3–6 months [^112JpuvH] until effusion resolves, hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities are suspected.

---

## Medical management

Medical management should **avoid antibiotics** [^111eJxRX] because they are ineffective and may cause harm [^113boyzE]. Also avoid **steroids** (systemic or intranasal) [^113ame9A] and **antihistamines/decongestants** [^114ag5Xj] because they are ineffective and may cause adverse effects [^115cw4ZV].

---

## Indications for further intervention

Intervention is indicated if any of the following are present:

| **Indication** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Persistent effusion | ≥ 3 months [^1165A9xp] |
| Hearing loss | Documented by age-appropriate testing [^113WF1cB] |
| Speech/language delay | Suspected or confirmed [^114G4Uh5] |
| Structural abnormalities | Tympanic membrane or middle ear [^1131Dqsw] |

---

## Surgical management

- **Tympanostomy tubes**: Recommended for persistent effusion with hearing loss or other indicated symptoms [^117LHq12] [^114r7BTp].

- **Adenoidectomy**: Consider in children ≥ 4 years old or with recurrent effusion [^113zLGjS] [^112EPWma].

- **Autoinflation**: May be considered in children ≥ 4 years old as an alternative or adjunctive therapy [^112hhMdf] [^111DoZR1].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular hearing assessments** [^113WF1cB] to detect and quantify hearing loss, as well as **ongoing clinical evaluation** [^112JpuvH] to track effusion resolution, hearing improvement, or structural changes [^112JpuvH].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education and counseling should cover the **natural history** of OME and its high rate of spontaneous resolution [^111DMZrm]. Families should also be informed about **potential complications**, including hearing loss, speech delay, and structural abnormalities [^1131Dqsw]. Shared decision-making should be used to discuss watchful waiting, medical options, and surgical interventions [^111aU8Ds].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Watchful waiting**: 3 months [^115UoGJR] from diagnosis or onset.

- **Avoid**: Antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants [^112EjPNp].

- **Hearing testing**: If effusion persists ≥ 3 months or hearing loss is suspected [^113WF1cB].

- **Surgery**: Tympanostomy tubes for persistent effusion with hearing loss or other indicated symptoms [^117LHq12].

- **Follow-up**: Every 3–6 months until resolution or intervention [^112JpuvH].

---

Fluid in the ear is best managed with **watchful waiting** [^115UoGJR], avoidance of ineffective medications [^112EjPNp], and selective use of surgery for persistent cases with hearing loss or developmental risk [^116aLddA].

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1165A9xp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. In approximately one in three children with OME, however, a bacterial pathogen is identified in the middle ear fluid. In most cases, OME causes mild hearing impairment of short duration. When experienced in early life and when episodes of (bilateral) OME persist or recur, the associated hearing loss may be significant and have a negative impact on speech development and behaviour. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants, and oral and topical intranasal steroids in OME. This review focuses on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 22 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. Secondary outcomes included resolution of OME at other time points, hearing, language and speech, ventilation tube insertion and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data using standardised data extraction forms and assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We presented dichotomous results as risk differences as well as risk ratios, with their 95% confidence intervals. If heterogeneity was greater than 75% we did not pool data.

Main Results

We included 23 studies (3027 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points of evaluation. Overall, we assessed the studies as generally being at low risk of bias. Our primary outcome was complete resolution of OME at two to three months. The differences (improvement) in the proportion of children having such resolution (risk difference (RD)) in the five individual included studies ranged from 1% (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.12; not significant) to 45% (RD 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65). Results from these studies could not be pooled due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Pooled analysis of data for complete resolution at more than six months was possible, with an increase in resolution of 13% (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19). Pooled analysis was also possible for complete resolution at the end of treatment, with the following increases in resolution rates: 17% (RD 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24) for treatment for 10 days to two weeks, 34% (RD 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.50) for treatment for four weeks, 32% (RD 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.47) for treatment for three months, and 14% (RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.24) for treatment continuously for at least six months. We were unable to find evidence of a substantial improvement in hearing as a result of the use of antibiotics for otitis media with effusion; nor did we find an effect on the rate of ventilation tube insertion. We did not identify any trials that looked at speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Data on the adverse effects of antibiotic treatment reported in six studies could not be pooled due to high heterogeneity. Increases in the occurrence of adverse events varied from 3% (RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.07; not significant) to 33% (RD 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.44) in the individual studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of our review do not support the routine use of antibiotics for children up to 18 years with otitis media with effusion. The largest effects of antibiotics were seen in children treated continuously for four weeks and three months. Even when clear and relevant benefits of antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must be balanced against the potential adverse effects when making treatment decisions. Immediate adverse effects of antibiotics are common and the emergence of bacterial resistance has been causally linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

### Grommets (ventilation tubes) for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^113Tcd2i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME), or 'glue ear', is very common in children, especially between the ages of one and three years with a prevalence of 10% to 30% and a cumulative incidence of 80% at the age of four years. OME is defined as middle ear effusion without signs or symptoms of an acute infection. OME may occur as a primary disorder or as a sequel to acute otitis media. The functional effect of OME is a conductive hearing level of about 25 to 30 dB associated with fluid in the middle ear. Both the high incidence and the high rate of spontaneous resolution suggest that the presence of OME is a natural phenomenon, its presence at some stage in childhood being a normal finding. Notwithstanding this, some children with OME may go on to develop chronic otitis media with structural changes (tympanic membrane retraction pockets, erosion of portions of the ossicular chain and cholesteatoma), language delays and behavioural problems. It remains uncertain whether or not any of these findings are direct consequences of OME. The most common medical treatment options include the use of decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. The effectiveness of these therapies has not been established. Surgical treatment options include grommet (ventilation or tympanostomy tube) insertion, adenoidectomy or both. Opinions regarding the risks and benefits of grommet insertion vary greatly. The management of OME therefore remains controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of grommet insertion compared with myringotomy or non-surgical treatment in children with OME. The outcomes studied were (i) hearing level, (ii) duration of middle ear effusion, (iii) well-being (quality of life) and (iv) prevention of developmental sequelae possibly attributable to the hearing loss (for example, impairment in impressive and expressive language development (measured using standardised tests), verbal intelligence, and behaviour).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1973 to 2003) and reference lists of all identified studies. The date of the last systematic search was March 2003, and personal non-systematic searches have been performed up to August 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of grommets on hearing, duration of effusion, development of language, cognition, behaviour or quality of life. Only studies using common types of grommets (mean function time of 6 to 12 months) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data from studies were extracted by two reviewers and checked by the other reviewers.

Main Results

Children treated with grommets spent 32% less time (95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 48%) with effusion during the first year of follow-up. Treatment with grommets improved hearing levels, especially during the first six months. In the randomised controlled trials that studied the effect of grommet insertion alone, the mean hearing levels improved by around 9 dB (95% CI 4 dB to 14 dB) after the first six months, and 6 dB (95% CI 3 dB to 9 dB) after 12 months. In the randomised controlled trials that studied the combined effect of grommets and adenoidectomy, the additional effect of the grommets on hearing levels was improvement by 3 to 4 dB (95% CI 2 dB to 5 dB) at six months and about 1 to 2 dB (95% CI 0 dB to 3 dB) at 12 months. Ears treated with grommets had an additional risk for tympanosclerosis of 0.33 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.45) one to five years later. In otherwise healthy children with long-standing OME and hearing loss, early insertion of grommets had no effect on language development or cognition. One randomised controlled trial in children with OME more than nine months, hearing loss and disruptions to speech, language, learning or behaviour showed a very marginal effect of grommets on comprehensive language.

Authors' Conclusions

The benefits of grommets in children appear small. The effect of grommets on hearing diminished during the first year. Potentially adverse effects on the tympanic membrane are common after grommet insertion. Therefore an initial period of watchful waiting seems to be an appropriate management strategy for most children with OME. As no evidence is yet available for the subgroups of children with speech or language delays, behavioural and learning problems or children with defined clinical syndromes (generally excluded from the primary studies included in this review), the clinician will need to make decisions regarding treatment for such children based on other evidence and indications of disability related to hearing impairment. This review does not resolve the discrepancy between parental and clinical observation of a beneficial treatment effect and the results in the reviewed RCT showing only a short-term effect on hearing and virtually no effect on development. Is the perceived, often dramatic, effect of grommets only a short-term one? Are some children more sensitive to OME-related hearing loss than others? If so, how do we identify them?Further research should focus upon indications. Studies should use sufficiently large sample sizes to show significant interactions. There is a need to determine the most suitable variables and appropriate "softer" outcomes to be the subject of these interaction tests. Interesting options include measures of speech-in-noise and binaural hearing. The generally modest results in the trials which are included in this review should make it easier to justify randomisation of more severely affected and higher-risk children in appropriately constructed trials. Randomised controlled trials are necessary in these children before more detailed conclusions about the effectiveness of grommets can be drawn.

### Topical and oral steroids for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^112Yd1P4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. Although most episodes of OME in children resolve spontaneously within a few months, when persistent it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and other treatments, such as autoinflation. Oral or topical steroids are sometimes used to reduce inflammation in the middle ear.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of topical and oral steroids for OME in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies on 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared topical or oral steroids with either placebo or watchful waiting (no treatment).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes, determined by a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise, were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) systemic corticosteroid side effects. Secondary outcomes were: 1) presence/persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including local nasal effects), 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial outcomes, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 26 studies in this review (2770 children). Most studies of oral steroids used prednisolone for 7 to 14 days. Studies of topical (nasal) steroids used various preparations (beclomethasone, fluticasone and mometasone) for between two weeks and three months. All studies had at least some concerns regarding risk of bias. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up. Oral steroids compared to placebo Oral steroids probably result in little or no difference in the proportion of children with normal hearing after 12 months (69.7% of children with steroids, compared to 61.1% of children receiving placebo, risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.33; 1 study, 332 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in OME-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) in OM8–30 score 0.07, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.34; 1 study, 304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Oral steroids may reduce the number of children with persistent OME at 6 to 12 months, but the size of the effect was uncertain (absolute risk reduction ranging from 13.3% to 45%, number needed to treat (NNT) of between 3 and 8; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain regarding the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects, and we were unable to conduct any meta-analysis for this outcome. Oral steroids compared to no treatment Oral steroids may result in little or no difference in the persistence of OME after three to nine months (74.5% children receiving steroids versus 73% of those receiving placebo; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.17; 2 studies, 258 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence on adverse effects was very uncertain. We did not identify any evidence on hearing or disease-related quality of life. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to placebo We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean change in hearing threshold after two months was -0.3 dB lower (95% CI -6.05 to 5.45; 1 study, 78 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that nasal steroids make little or no difference to disease-specific quality of life after nine months (OM8–30 score, MD 0.05 higher, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.46; 1 study, 82 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of nasal steroids on persistence of OME at up to one year. Two studies reported this: one showed a potential benefit for nasal steroids, the other showed a benefit with placebo (2 studies, 206 participants). The evidence was also very uncertain regarding the risk of corticosteroid-related side effects, as we were unable to provide a pooled effect estimate. Topical (intranasal) steroids compared to no treatment We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, the mean difference in final hearing threshold after four weeks was 1.95 dB lower (95% CI -3.85 to -0.05; 1 study, 168 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nasal steroids may reduce the persistence of OME after eight weeks, but the evidence was very uncertain (58.5% of children receiving steroids, compared to 81.3% of children without treatment, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 2 studies, 134 participants). We did not identify any evidence on disease-related quality of life or adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, oral steroids may have little effect in the treatment of OME, with little improvement in the number of children with normal hearing and no effect on quality of life. There may be a reduction in the proportion of children with persistent disease after 12 months. However, this benefit may be small and must be weighed against the potential for adverse effects associated with oral steroid use. The evidence for nasal steroids was all low- or very low-certainty. It is therefore less clear if nasal steroids have any impact on hearing, quality of life or persistence of OME. Evidence on adverse effects was very limited. OME is likely to resolve spontaneously for most children. The potential benefit of treatment may therefore be small and should be balanced with the risk of adverse effects. Future studies should aim to determine which children are most likely to benefit from treatment, rather than offering interventions to all children.

### Otitis media: diagnosis and treatment [^114DqTAM]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is diagnosed in patients with acute onset, presence of middle ear effusion, physical evidence of middle ear inflammation, and symptoms such as pain, irritability, or fever. Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^112oWygY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^114Dr3KP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial. The effectiveness of both systemic and topical intranasal steroids in promoting the resolution of effusions has been assessed by randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To examine evidence for or against treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

Searches were conducted in January 2002. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms 'otitis media', 'otitis media with effusion', 'glue ear', or 'OME', and 'steroids', 'glucocorticoids, synthetic', 'glucocorticoids, topical', 'anti-inflammatory agents, steroidal' EMBASE and MEDLINE were also searched for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an antibiotic, were included.

Exclusions

publications in abstract form only since adequate appraisal was not possible; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; studies reporting outcomes with ears (rather than children) as the unit of analysis unless data were of sufficient detail to allow analysis by child.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the published reports by the two authors independently (CCB and JH van der V) using standardised data extraction forms and methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by the two authors using the scheme described in the Cochrane Handbook. Dichotomous results were expressed as an odds ratio using a fixed effects model together with the 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data were analysed using the weighted mean difference in a fixed effects model. Tests for heterogeneity between studies were performed using a Mantel-Haenszel approach. In trials with a cross over design, post crossover treatment data were not used.

Main Results

No study prospectively documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. Follow up was mainly short term. No serious or lasting adverse effects were reported in the six studies that did mention adverse effects. Most comparisons involved small numbers of subjects. The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up in children treated with oral steroids compared to control was 0.22 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up for children treated with oral steroids plus antibiotic compared to control plus antibiotic was 0.32 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.52). However there was significant heterogeneity between studies included in the latter comparison (p < 0.01). Trends favoured steroids for most other comparisons, but confidence intervals included unity. There was no evidence of benefit for steroid treatment for resolution of OME or of resolution of hearing loss associated with OME in the longer term.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Both oral and topical intranasal steroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term. However, there is no evidence of a long term benefit from treating OME effusions or associated hearing loss with either oral or topical intranasal steroids. No serious adverse events were reported in the six studies that presented data on adverse effects. Future studies should document hearing loss associated with OME before the start of study treatment. Follow up should be longer and ideally include health related quality of life and hearing assessments. Data should not be presented only with ears as the unit of analysis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of otitis media [^111nc5aK]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media include rapid onset of symptoms, middle ear effusion, and signs and symptoms of middle ear inflammation. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media. Fever, otalgia, headache, irritability, cough, rhinitis, listlessness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and pulling at the ears are common, but nonspecific symptoms. Detection of middle ear effusion by pneumatic otoscopy is key in establishing the diagnosis. Observation is an acceptable option in healthy children with mild symptoms. Antibiotics are recommended in all children younger than six months, in those between six months and two years if the diagnosis is certain, and in children with severe infection. High-dosage amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is recommended as first-line therapy. Macrolide antibiotics, clindamycin, and cephalosporins are alternatives in penicillin-sensitive children and in those with resistant infections. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be reassessed. Hearing and language testing is recommended in children with suspected hearing loss or persistent effusion for at least three months, and in those with developmental problems.

### Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion [^116AKMh9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'.

Objectives

To determine the effects of autoinflation in adults and children with otitis media with effusion.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1951 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006) and twelve other databases, using the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data from included studies.

Main Results

Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Improvement occurred for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month (Relative Risk of Improvement (RRI) 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 6.58) and at more than one month (RRI 2.20, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.82). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). Pooled estimates showed non-significant change in tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month (RRI 1.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.56) and non-significant improvement in tympanometry at greater than one month (RRI 1.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.67). Non-significant improvements occurred for discrete pure tone audiometry (RRI 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.88) and non-discrete audiometry (WMD 6.95 dB, 95% CI 21.03 to 7.13). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and short follow up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Further research should consider the duration of treatment and the long-term impact of autoinflation on developmental outcomes in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^117Kyqvf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) patient management and follow-up — ear fluid is a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the ear drum without symptoms of infection, and fluid often goes away on its own, so your doctor will often recommend watchful waiting for the first 3 mo; it is most likely to go away quickly if it has been there < 3 mo or has a known start time, while it is much more likely to persist when it has been there for at least 3 mo or when the start date is unknown. Home measures include keeping the child away from secondhand smoke and, if the child is > 12 mo and still uses a pacifier, stopping the pacifier in the daytime may help the fluid go away. Medical treatment does not work well; you should not give your child antibiotics, antihistamines, decongestants, steroids (by mouth or in the nose), or drugs to reduce acid reflux, and no benefits have ever been shown for chiropractic therapy, special diets, herbal remedies, complementary medicine, or alternative (natural) therapies. Ongoing monitoring is advised — the best way to prevent problems is to see the doctor every 3 to 6 mo until the fluid goes away. The fluid cannot directly turn into an ear infection, but during a cold it increases a child's risk of getting an ear infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113QGkvV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — surgery for children < 4 years old: Clinicians should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old, and adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication other than OME exists; this recommendation is based on systematic reviews of RCTs with a preponderance of benefit over harm. If surgery is chosen, tympanostomy tube insertion is the procedure of choice, and adenoidectomy is not recommended for a primary indication of OME in children < 4 years old; more recent evidence suggests that 4 years is a more appropriate cut point and the threshold for adenoidectomy as repeat surgery has been raised to age 4 years.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116aLddA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgery — shared decision making and age-based procedure selection emphasizes that there are 2 aspects of decision making (surgery vs additional observation, and procedure selection), candidacy depends on hearing status, associated symptoms, developmental risk, and anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution, and the poorest spontaneous resolution occurs when effusion is chronic (≥ 3 months) or associated with a type B (flat curve) tympanogram; once surgery is chosen, shared decision making is limited for children < 4 years old because tympanostomy tubes are recommended, whereas in children ≥ 4 years old options include tympanostomy tube placement alone (offers the most reliable short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss and caregivers of at-risk children perceive large improvements after tube placement), adenoidectomy alone (offers comparable OME control to tubes at 6 and 12 months but may be less reliable in the short term, reduces the need for repeat surgery, has more potential anesthetic- and procedure-related complications, and some children may need additional surgery for tympanostomy tube insertion), adenoidectomy plus myringotomy without tubes (has outcomes comparable to tubes with less otorrhea and tympanic membrane sequelae, but tympanostomy tube insertion offers more reliable short-term effusion resolution and middle ear ventilation and is preferable when potential relapse must be minimized or when pronounced inflammation is present), and adenoidectomy plus tympanostomy tube placement (offers combined benefits, especially reducing repeat surgery in children with a history of tympanostomy tube placement, and may benefit children with nasal obstruction or recurrent sinonasal infections insufficient alone to justify adenoidectomy).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^11594LwG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (Statement 5 — screening healthy children) Clinicians should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; this is a recommendation against based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies with a preponderance of harm over benefit. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid unnecessary tests and treatment, aggregate evidence quality of Grade A with a systematic review of RCTs, and high confidence in the evidence, with benefits of avoiding unnecessary tests and treatment and limiting parent anxiety, and risks of potentially missing clinically relevant OME in some children; the benefit–harm assessment is listed as a preponderance of benefit over harm. Patient preference plays a limited role but a parent can request screening if desired, while the word "routine" is used intentionally to allow for specific circumstances where screening may be appropriate; exceptions are none, the policy level is recommendation against, and a difference of opinions is not reported on this page.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^111YhnVb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat any bacteria present in the effusion, or associated biofilms.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of oral antibiotics for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies to 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared oral antibiotics with either placebo or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life and 3) anaphylaxis. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function and 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 19 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (2581 participants). They assessed a variety of oral antibiotics (including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides and trimethoprim), with most studies using a 10- to 14-day treatment course. We had some concerns about the risk of bias in all studies included in this review. Here we report our primary outcomes and main secondary outcome, at the longest reported follow-up time. Antibiotics versus placebo We included 11 studies for this comparison, but none reported all of our outcomes of interest and limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that more children may return to normal hearing by two months (resolution of the air-bone gap) after receiving antibiotics as compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 9.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.51 to 26.18; 20/49 children who received antibiotics returned to normal hearing versus 0/37 who received placebo; 1 study, 86 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME At 6 to 12 months of follow-up, the use of antibiotics compared with placebo may slightly reduce the number of children with persistent OME, but the confidence intervals were wide, and the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.17; 48% versus 54%; number needed to treat (NNT) 17; 2 studies, 324 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Three of the included studies (448 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics versus no treatment We included eight studies for this comparison, but very limited meta-analysis was possible. Hearing One study found that the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may result in little to no difference in final hearing threshold at three months (mean difference (MD) -5.38 dB HL, 95% CI -9.12 to -1.64; 1 study, 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). The only data identified on the return to normal hearing were reported at 10 days of follow-up, which we considered to be too short to accurately reflect the efficacy of antibiotics. Disease-specific quality of life No studies assessed this outcome. Presence/persistence of OME Antibiotics may reduce the proportion of children who have persistent OME at up to three months of follow-up, when compared with no treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.80; 6 studies, 542 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse event: anaphylaxis No studies provided specific data on anaphylaxis. Two of the included studies (180 children) did report adverse events in sufficient detail to assume that no anaphylactic reactions occurred, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the use of antibiotics for OME is of low to very low certainty. Although the use of antibiotics compared to no treatment may have a slight beneficial effect on the resolution of OME at up to three months, the overall impact on hearing is very uncertain. The long-term effects of antibiotics are unclear and few of the studies included in this review reported on potential harms. These important endpoints should be considered when weighing up the potential short- and long-term benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment in a condition with a high spontaneous resolution rate.

### Antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children [^116ut4Jd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterised by an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear behind an intact tympanic membrane, without the symptoms or signs of acute infection. Since most cases of OME will resolve spontaneously, only children with persistent middle ear effusion and associated hearing loss potentially require treatment. Previous Cochrane reviews have focused on the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion, adenoidectomy, nasal autoinflation, antihistamines, decongestants and corticosteroids in OME. This review, focusing on the effectiveness of antibiotics in children with OME, is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children up to 18 years with OME.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 3); PubMed; Ovid EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral antibiotics with placebo, no treatment or therapy of unproven effectiveness in children with OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time points for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution at two to three months post-randomisation (primary outcome) than those allocated to the control treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 2.53; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 5). However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash (primary outcome) than those allocated to control treatment (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.60; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 20). In respect of the secondary outcome of complete resolution at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five meta-analyses, including between two and 14 trials, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from 3 to 7. Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months. In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results. None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with a decrease in the rate of ventilation tube insertion (two trials, 121 children) or in tympanic membrane sequelae (one trial, 103 children), while low quality evidence indicated that children treated with antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months post-randomisation (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should, however, be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on acute otitis media episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when we excluded studies with high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review presents evidence of both benefits and harms associated with the use of oral antibiotics to treat children up to 16 years with OME. Although evidence indicates that oral antibiotics are associated with an increased chance of complete resolution of OME at various time points, we also found evidence that these children are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash. The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions. Furthermore, we found no data on the impact of antibiotics on other important outcomes such as speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Even in situations where clear and relevant benefits of oral antibiotics have been demonstrated, these must always be carefully balanced against adverse effects and the emergence of bacterial resistance. This has specifically been linked to the widespread use of antibiotics for common conditions such as otitis media.

### Clinical overview and treatment options for non-skeletal manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA [^111Cfvkq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Auditory system

By the first decade of life, most patients with MPS IVA may be expected to have either a sensorineural hearing loss or a mixed hearing loss, which is a combination of sensorineural and conductive hearing loss (Riedner and Levin).

Ventilation tubes can be offered to treat conductive hearing loss from retained middle ear fluid. These are placed under general anaesthetic, where a small incision behind the tympanic membrane can be made (myringotomy) to drain the accumulated fluid. A small ventilation tube often called a grommet may then be inserted, which allows air to enter. Grommets will eventually fall out, and once they have fallen out the tympanic membrane will heal, and the fluid can re-occur. T-tubes are a longer lasting type of grommet, and in view of the anaesthetic risks for individuals with MPS IVA, and the risk of the reoccurrence of the middle ear fluid, may be preferable to use on the first occasion.

Bone conduction hearing aids are a nonsurgical option for the first few years of life and can be worn either on a headband or a soft band. These are preferable to air conduction hearing aids if the hearing loss fluctuates, which is often the case with conductive hearing losses caused by middle ear fluid.

As there is a progressive sensorineural element to the hearing loss in MPS IVA, bone conduction hearing aids may cease to be the most appropriate forms of amplification. Post-aural hearing aids may be needed to deliver the gain required for the patient to access the speech frequencies and ideally will work best if the fluctuating conductive element of the hearing loss is reduced by use of ventilation tubes.

Digestive system

Hernias can be repaired surgically, and due to poor connective tissue, special techniques may be needed to prevent recurrence. Approximately 6% of the patients in the International Morquio A Registry reported undergoing herniorrhaphy; the mean age was 8 years at the time of surgery (Montaño et al.). As with any surgical procedure in this patient population, anaesthesia should be performed with caution, and to prevent potential complications, anaesthesiologists should have experience working with MPS patients due to the difficult airway, short stature, restricted head movement, and other features of this multisystem disease.

Regarding oral health, parents or care givers should be given advice on maintaining their child's oral hygiene. Regular preventative maintenance is highly recommended to avoid the need for interventions requiring general anaesthesia.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Surgical treatments for otitis media with effusion: a systematic review [^115YsAMz]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The near universality of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children makes a comparative review of treatment modalities important. This study's objective was to compare the effectiveness of surgical strategies currently used for managing OME.

Methods

We identified 3 recent systematic reviews and searched 4 major electronic databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and cohort studies that compared myringotomy, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tubes (tubes), and watchful waiting. Using established criteria, pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence of relevant studies. We incorporated meta-analyses from the earlier reviews and synthesized additional evidence qualitatively.

Results

We identified 41 unique studies through the earlier reviews and our independent searches. In comparison with watchful waiting or myringotomy (or both), tubes decreased time with OME and improved hearing; no specific tube type was superior. Adenoidectomy alone, as an adjunct to myringotomy, or combined with tubes, reduced OME and improved hearing in comparison with either myringotomy or watchful waiting. Tubes and watchful waiting did not differ in language, cognitive, or academic outcomes. Otorrhea and tympanosclerosis were more common in ears with tubes. Adenoidectomy increased the risk of postsurgical hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Tubes and adenoidectomy reduce time with OME and improve hearing in the short-term. Both treatments have associated harms. Large, well-controlled studies could help resolve the risk-benefit ratio by measuring acute otitis media recurrence, functional outcomes, quality of life, and long-term outcomes. Research is needed to support treatment decisions in subpopulations, particularly in patients with comorbidities.

### Plain language summary: otitis media with effusion [^112z1Txc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This plain language summary serves as an overview in explaining otitis media with effusion (pronounced Oh-TIE-tis ME-dee-uh with Ef-YOO-zhun), abbreviated "OME" and often called "ear fluid". The summary applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with OME and is based on the 2015 "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion (Update)". The evidence-based guideline includes research to support more effective diagnosis and treatment of OME in children. The guideline was developed as a quality improvement opportunity for managing OME by creating clear recommendations to use in medical practice.

### Bilateral auricular seromas: a case report and review of the literature [^112oP9A5]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Hematomas, pseudocysts, and seromas are all part of the differential diagnosis of auricular swellings. Seromas are benign collections of serous fluid that have a tendency to recur. The fluid accumulates in the space between the dermis and perichondrium of the ear. We describe what we believe is the first case of spontaneous bilateral auricular seromas to be reported in the literature. One of the seromas resolved in 4 weeks without treatment, and the other resolved with incision and drainage. It is important for physicians to be aware of auricular seromas when considering the differential diagnosis of an auricular swelling, and to understand the various treatment options.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^114KbQJ2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113zLGjS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — surgery for children ≥ 4 years old: Clinicians should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child 4 years old or older, with recommendations based on systematic reviews of RCTs and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm; for children aged ≥ 4 years, the decision among options is based on shared decision making with a moderate role for patient preferences, and adenoidectomy may be contraindicated in children with cleft palate or syndromes associated with a risk of velopharyngeal insufficiency while reserving adenoidectomy for children aged ≥ 4 years or those with a distinct indication other than OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112EPWma]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Surgery for children aged ≥ 4 years with OME — if a decision is reached to manage OME in a child aged ≥ 4 years with surgical intervention, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, or both can be recommended, and the availability of at least 3 surgical options (tubes alone, adenoidectomy alone, or adenoidectomy plus tubes) creates an opportunity for shared decision making with caregivers; evidence from an individual patient data meta-analysis based on 1761 children from 10 randomized trials (9 comparisons of adenoidectomy with or without tubes vs no surgery or tubes alone) found no clinically important benefits for adenoidectomy in children < 4 years old, whereas children aged ≥ 4 years old spent 50 fewer days with OME over the next 12 months, had lower failure rates (51% vs 70%), and a lower rate of future surgery (2% vs 19%); in that study, failure at 12 months was defined as additional surgery, recurrent AOM, middle ear effusion at least 50% of the time, or average hearing improvement < 10-dB HL; additionally, a review of 15 randomized trials and observational studies evaluated tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy as primary therapy for OM.

### Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion [^1165K74n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006. Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies.

Main Results

Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease executive summary [^115GLUpU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Ménière's disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low- to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many, and approaches typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.

### Otitis media with effusion… [^1165G9qK]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

What is otitis media with effusion. Otitis media with effusion is an ear infection with fluid in the middle ear. This fluid usually doesn't bother children. It almost always goes away on its own. So, this kind of ear infection doesn't have to be treated with antibiotics, unless the fluid doesn't go away. What causes this kind of ear infection. Fluid may build up in the middle ear for two reasons. First, when a child has a cold, the middle ear may produce fluid just like the nose does, but the fluid doesn't drain out of the middle ear as easily as it does from the nose. Second, children who have a "regular" ear infection could have otitis media with effusion the next time, if the fluid stays in the middle ear for a long time. How is this kind of ear infection treated. The best treatment is to let the fluid go away by itself. Are antibiotics ever needed for an ear infection with fluid. Yes.

If the fluid is still there after a few months and is causing hearing loss or problems in both ears, antibiotics may help some children. For this reason, your child's ears should be checked a few months after an ear infection. If the fluid is still there, a hearing test may be the next step. Why not just try antibiotics right now. Giving your child unnecessary antibiotics can be harmful. After each course of antibiotics, the germs in the nose and throat are more likely to become resistant. Resistant germs can't be killed by the usual antibiotics. More expensive and powerful antibiotics have to be used. Some of these antibiotics must be given in the hospital. Since fluid in the ears doesn't usually bother children, it's better to wait and only give antibiotics when they're necessary.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) watchful waiting — Clinicians should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Strong recommendation based on systematic review of cohort studies and preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid interventions with potential adverse events and cost for a condition that is usually self-limited (National Quality Strategy domains: patient safety, efficient use of health care resources). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic review of cohort studies. Level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefit: Avoid unnecessary referrals, evaluations, and interventions; take advantage of favorable natural history.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgical options — shared decision grid compares watchful waiting, ear (tympanostomy) tube placement, and adenoidectomy across age limits, process, timing, benefits, risks, and long‑term expectations. Watchful waiting and ear tubes can be done at any age, but "Adenoidectomy is not recommended for age < 4 y for treating ear fluid that persists for at least 3 mo". Watchful waiting involves "Checking the eardrum every 3 to 6 mo in your doctor's office". Ear tube surgery "takes about 10 to 20 min and usually requires general anesthesia", while adenoidectomy "takes about 30 min and requires general anesthesia". Benefits include that ear tubes "Relieves fluid and hearing loss promptly and prevents relapse of fluid while the tube is in place and stays open", and adenoidectomy "reduces the need for future ear surgery", with "The chance that your child may need future ear tubes is reduced by about 50% after adenoidectomy". Risks for tubes include "About 1 in 4 children get an ear infection (drainage) that is treated with eardrops" and "About 2 or 3 in 100 children have a tiny hole in the eardrum that does not close after the tube falls out and may need surgery". Long‑term, "Most tubes fall out in about 12 to 18 mo" and "About 1 in every 4 children may need to have them replaced".

### Management of cerebrospinal fluid leaks after acoustic tumor removal [^1144Q6Je]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a logical algorithm for management of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak that occurs after acoustic tumor removal, and to describe a method for eustachian tube resection.

Clinical Presentation

We present an algorithm in the form of a flow chart, describe middle fossa craniotomy for eustachian tube resection, and present three cases in which this technique was used.

Technique

For CSF leak, pressure dressing at the wound and bed rest for the patient are advised; lumbar drain is indicated if the leak does not resolve. Occasionally, wound exploration is required. CSF rhinorrhea is treated first with a lumbar drain. If this approach is unsuccessful, the choice of treatment depends on the patient's hearing status. If a patient has no hearing, we perform a blind sac closure of the ear canal and pack the eustachian tube. If a patient has hearing, wound reexploration and lumbar drainage are advised. When conservative and initial surgical procedures for resolving CSF leak fail, we perform a middle fossa craniotomy to identify, divide, and remove a segmental portion of the cartilaginous eustachian tube and then cauterize and occlude both ends.

Conclusion

At centers where surgical removal of acoustic tumors is frequently performed, a logical protocol should be in place for treatment of postoperative CSF leak. The leak location and the patient's hearing status are factors in determining the appropriate treatment method. Middle fossa craniotomy for resection of the eustachian tube is a safe, definitive management option for treatment of recalcitrant CSF rhinorrhea that occurs after acoustic tumor surgery.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss [^116XPkv5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

The rationale for local intratympanic application of drugs for the treatment of inner ear diseases is based on the expected advantages over systemic treatment. These are 1) the bypassing of the blood‐labyrinthine barrier, resulting in 2) higher concentrations in the inner ear fluids despite the lower total amount of drug given, and 3) avoiding the major unwanted effects of systemically administered medications due to lower systemic drug levels.

Pharmacokinetic studies in animals and humans have shown that high doses of systemic corticosteroids are needed to achieve detectable drug levels in the inner ear perilymph and that substances applied to the round window membrane lead to significantly higher drug levels in the inner ear fluids compared to systemic application (Bachmann 2001; Bird 2007; Bird 2011; Chandrasekhar 2000; Niedermeyer 2003; Parnes 1999). Thus, applying drugs locally may be more effective in treating sudden sensorineural hearing loss and may avoid systemic complications and side effects. The introduction of this drug delivery approach has triggered a large number of pre‐clinical studies focused on the pharmacokinetics of local drug delivery to the inner ear and the development of drug delivery systems (reviewed, for example, in: Hoskison 2013; Nakagawa 2011; Pararas 2012; Salt 2009; Salt 2018).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113dCaQC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Irrigation for cerumen impaction — clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction as an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and with a balance of benefit and harm; the action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B with 1 RCT verifying absolute efficacy but multiple treatment arms of comparative studies verifying benefit over cerumenolytic alone, a high level of confidence in the evidence, benefits of resolving cerumen impaction, and risks including external otitis, vertigo, tympanic membrane perforation, otalgia, and temporal bone osteomyelitis with costs of supplies and procedure; it also specifies a large role of patient preferences, medical exceptions including nontintact tympanic membrane, active dermatitis or infection of the ear canal and surrounding tissue, previous intolerance or adverse reaction to this technique, anatomic abnormalities of the ear canal, or history of surgery of the ear or canal (including ear tubes), and a policy level of option.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114Uff4H]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion, a collection of fluid behind the ear drum without inflammatory signs, is often called "glue ear" when present for six weeks. It is an increasingly common presentation in primary care and is probably the most common reason for surgery in children. Otitis media with effusion can lead to significant hearing loss, especially when both ears are affected, and has an important impact on children's lives and development. By the age of 4 years, approximately 80% of children will have had an episode of otitis media with effusion, most of which resolve naturally with an average duration of six to 10 weeks; only 10% of episodes last a year or more. However some cases do not resolve quickly and remain a cause for concern, contributing to variable referral rates and surgery (grommets) in between one and five per 1000 children each year.

A recent review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence found no proven effective medical treatments for otitis media with effusion that are applicable in primary care, where most children are seen. Because the condition might usually be expected to resolve naturally, watchful waiting or active monitoring for three months is now an established clinical recommendation. Active monitoring of such children may be done in primary or secondary care, although questions have been asked as to whether general practitioners have the techniques for active monitoring or whether use of tympanometry in this setting would lead to over-referral. During such periods anticipating natural resolution, temporising medical management is often given, including off-licence use of topical intranasal corticosteroids. The reasons for use of topical steroids include preliminary evidence of effectiveness and lack of proven effectiveness of other commonly given treatments such as antibiotics, decongestants, and antihistamines, which are associated with several potential harms and disadvantages, some of which are major ones such as antibiotic resistance. Autoinflation is not of proven effectiveness, and achieving cooperation is difficult with the youngest children.

### Vestibulocochlear delineation for vestibular schwannoma treated with radiation therapy [^116gwYPo]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radiation therapy is an option for the management of vestibular schwannoma (VS). Moreover, ablative treatments have become more common and can be performed in 1 to 5 fractions. Reports of sensorineural hearing loss vary between 50% and 70%, but data are controversial. Systematic analyses report better results of retained hearing with doses received by vestibulocochlear apparatus less than 12.5 Gy. The dose range can vary between 11 and 16 Gy when treated with ablative doses.

To ensure the preservation of the organs at risk (OAR), the precise contouring of them is mandatory. Because of its proximity to the VS, vestibulocochlear contouring requires discussion. There are few contouring guidelines published, and most of them are OAR guidelines for cancers of the head and neck.

The vestibulocochlear system consists of the vestibule, cochlea, semicircular canals, vestibular aqueduct, and cochlear aqueduct. The vestibule contains the utricle and therefore the saccule. There are 3 semicircular canals, the superior, lateral, and posterior. The space between the bony labyrinth and structure contains a fluid called perilymph. The same fluid (endolymph) fills the space within the body structure, (Fig. 1).

### Ventilation tubes (grommets) for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^111kPfZj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. It may cause hearing loss which, when persistent, may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Insertion of ventilation tubes has often been used as the preferred treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of ventilation tubes (grommets) for OME in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials on 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in children (6 months to 12 years) with OME for ≥ 3 months. We included studies that compared ventilation tube (VT) insertion with five comparators: no treatment, watchful waiting (ventilation tubes inserted later, if required), myringotomy, hearing aids and other non-surgical treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing; 2) OME-specific quality of life; 3) persistent tympanic membrane perforation (as a severe adverse effect of the surgery). Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME; 2) other adverse effects (including tympanosclerosis, VT blockage and pain); 3) receptive language skills; 4) speech development; 5) cognitive development; 6) psychosocial skills; 7) listening skills; 8) generic health-related quality of life; 9) parental stress; 10) vestibular function; 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for key outcomes. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs (2888 children). We considered most of the evidence to be very uncertain, due to wide confidence intervals for the effect estimates, few participants, and a risk of performance and detection bias. Here we report our key outcomes at the longest reported follow-up. There were some limitations to the evidence. No studies investigated the comparison of ventilation tubes versus hearing aids. We did not identify any data on disease-specific quality of life; however, many studies were conducted before the development of specific tools to assess this in otitis media. Short-acting ventilation tubes were used in most studies and thus specific data on the use of long-acting VTs is limited. Finally, we did not identify specific data on the effects of VTs in children at increased risk of OME (e.g. with craniofacial syndromes). Ventilation tubes versus no treatment (four studies) The odds ratio (OR) for a return to normal hearing after 12 months was 1.13 with VTs (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 2.74; 54% versus 51%; 1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, VTs may lead to a large reduction in persistent OME (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65; 20.4% versus 68.0%; 1 study, 54 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the chance of persistent tympanic membrane perforation with VTs at 12 months (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.91; 8.3% versus 9.7%; 1 RCT, 144 participants). Early ventilation tubes versus watchful waiting (six studies) There was little to no difference in the proportion of children whose hearing returned to normal after 8 to 10 years (i.e. by the age of 9 to 13 years) (RR for VTs 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03; 93% versus 95%; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence). VTs may also result in little to no difference in the risk of persistent OME after 18 months to 6 years (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.74; 15% versus 12%; 3 studies, 584 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to pool data on persistent perforation. One study showed that VTs may increase the risk of perforation after a follow-up duration of 3.75 years (RR 3.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 32.38; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the actual number of children who develop persistent perforation may be low, as demonstrated by another study (1.26%; 1 study, 635 ears; very low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus non-surgical treatment (one study) One study compared VTs to six months of antibiotics (sulphisoxazole). No data were available on return to normal hearing, but final hearing thresholds were reported. At four months, the mean difference was -5.98 dB HL lower (better) for those receiving VTs, but the evidence is very uncertain (95% CI -9.21 to -2.75; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No evidence was identified regarding persistent OME. VTs may result in a low risk of persistent perforation at 18 months of follow-up (no events reported; narrative synthesis of 1 study, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus myringotomy (nine studies) We are uncertain whether VTs may slightly increase the likelihood of returning to normal hearing at 6 to 12 months, since the confidence intervals were wide and included the possibility of no effect (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.53; 74% versus 64%; 2 studies, 132 participants; very low-certainty evidence). After six months, persistent OME may be reduced for those who receive VTs compared to laser myringotomy, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.38; 1 study, 272 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, the risk of persistent perforation is probably similar with the use of VTs or laser myringotomy (narrative synthesis of 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There may be small short- and medium-term improvements in hearing and persistence of OME with VTs, but it is unclear whether these persist after longer follow-up. The RCTs included do not allow us to say when (or how much) VTs improve hearing in any specific child. However, interpretation of the evidence is difficult: many children in the control groups recover spontaneously or receive VTs during follow-up, VTs may block or extrude, and OME may recur. The limited evidence in this review also affects the generalisability/applicability of our findings to situations involving children with underlying conditions (e.g. craniofacial syndromes) or the use of long-acting tubes. Consequently, RCTs may not be the best way to determine whether an intervention is likely to be effective in any individual child. Instead, we must better understand the different OME phenotypes to target interventions to children who will benefit most, and avoid over-treating when spontaneous resolution is likely.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Efficacy of intratympanic OTO-104 for the treatment of Ménière's disease: the outcome of three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^114hBgh1]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Ménière's disease is a chronic idiopathic condition of the inner ear predominantly characterized by spontaneous episodes of vertigo; other symptoms include fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The lifetime prevalence of Ménière's disease in the United States has been reported to be 190 per 100,000 people, with an annual incidence of 15.3 per 100,000 people. In addition to the physical symptoms of Ménière's disease, affected individuals endure a material impairment of their quality of life. The economic impact of this condition can be overwhelming for patients and their families; a broader societal impact of Ménière's disease has recently been established.

The underlying etiology of Ménière's disease is unknown, and there is no current cure. Evidence-based treatment options are limited and are directed at either relieving acute symptoms or ablating the function of the inner ear via the use of ototoxic medications and/or by surgical destruction. Repeated intratympanic injections of aqueous corticosteroid formulations have been associated with clinical improvement in patients with Ménière's disease. A number of mechanisms to support the physiological role of corticosteroids in Ménière's disease have been proposed. For example, corticosteroids are known to modify the regulation of inner ear epithelial ion transport by activating the outflow of sodium via epithelial sodium channels and sodium/potassium ATPases. Sodium movement from the labyrinth fluid to the epithelial compartment is hypothesized to result in a reduction in endolymph fluid volume and could translate to a reduction in Ménière's symptoms, such as vertigo. The administration of corticosteroids directly into the middle ear allows maximal drug exposure at the interface with the inner ear while minimizing the potential for systemic adverse effects.

Post–tympanostomy tube insertion management — The guideline development group is advising against routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops following tube insertion, and intraoperative management may involve saline washout, a single application of antibiotic ear drops (with or without a steroid), or no treatment; children with active acute otitis media or purulent effusions at the time of tube insertion are excluded from this recommendation. Supporting data include that a review of nearly 600 patients from 3 RCTs did not find an increase in intraluminal occlusion in patients who did not receive ear drops, although antibiotic drops decreased the rate of postoperative tube obstruction by about 12% (number needed to treat of 8).

### Otitis media with effusion in children [^111DMZrm]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 80% of children have been affected by otitis media with effusion (OME) by the age of 4 years, but prevalence declines beyond 6 years of age. Non-purulent middle-ear infections can occur in children or adults after upper respiratory tract infection or acute otitis media. Half or more of cases resolve within 3 months and 95% within 1 year, but complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, tympanosclerosis, otorrhoea, and cholesteatoma can occur.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent otitis media with effusion in children? What are the effects of pharmacological, mechanical, and surgical interventions to treat otitis media with effusion in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found one systematic review and one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adenoidectomy, antibiotics, antihistamines, autoinflation, bottle feeding, decongestants, exposure to other children, intranasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, oral corticosteroids, passive smoking, and ventilation tubes.

### Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^112hhMdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and mechanical treatment. Autoinflation is a self-administered technique, which aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage middle ear fluid clearance by providing a positive pressure of air in the nose and nasopharynx (using a nasal balloon or other handheld device). This positive pressure (sometimes combined with simultaneous swallow) encourages opening of the Eustachian tube and may help ventilate the middle ear.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy (benefits and harms) of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared autoinflation with either watchful waiting (no treatment), non-surgical treatment or ventilation tubes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) pain and distress. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including eardrum perforation), 3) compliance or adherence to treatment, 4) receptive language skills, 5) speech development, 6) cognitive development, 7) psychosocial skills, 8) listening skills, 9) generic health-related quality of life, 10) parental stress, 11) vestibular function and 12) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 11 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (1036 participants). The majority of studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. Most were carried out in Europe or North America, and they were conducted in both hospital and community settings. All compared autoinflation (using a variety of different methods and devices) to no treatment. Most studies required children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day, for between 2 and 12 weeks. The outcomes were predominantly assessed just after the treatment phase had been completed. Here we report the effects at the longest follow-up for our main outcome measures. Return to normal hearing The evidence was very uncertain regarding the effect of autoinflation on the return to normal hearing. The longest duration of follow-up was 11 weeks. At this time point, the risk ratio was 2.67 in favour of autoinflation (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 4.12; 85% versus 32%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 2; 1 study, 94 participants), but the certainty of the evidence was very low. Disease-specific quality of life Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life (related to otitis media) after short-term follow-up. One study assessed quality of life using the Otitis Media Questionnaire-14 (OMQ-14) at three months of follow-up. Results were reported as the number of standard deviations above or below zero difference, with a range from -3 (better) to +3 (worse). The mean difference was -0.42 lower (better) for those who received autoinflation (95% CI -0.62 to -0.22; 1 study, 247 participants; low-certainty evidence; the authors report a change of 0.3 as clinically meaningful). Pain and distress caused by the procedure Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study assessed this outcome, and identified a risk ratio of 3.50 for otalgia in those who received autoinflation, although the overall occurrence of pain was low (95% CI 0.74 to 16.59; 4.4% versus 1.3%; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 32; 1 study, 320 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Persistence of OME The evidence suggests that autoinflation may slightly reduce the persistence of OME at three months. Four studies were included, and the risk ratio for persistence of OME was 0.88 for those receiving autoinflation (95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; 4 studies, 483 participants; absolute reduction of 89 people per 1000 with persistent OME; NNTB 12; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

All the evidence we identified was of low or very low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the estimated effects. However, the data suggest that autoinflation may have a beneficial effect on OME-specific quality of life and persistence of OME in the short term, but the effect is uncertain for return to normal hearing and adverse effects. The potential benefits should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out autoinflation, and the possible risk of ear pain.

### Adenoidectomy for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^114P4MXP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Adenoidectomy has often been used as a potential treatment for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of adenoidectomy, either alone or in combination with ventilation tubes (grommets), for OME in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared adenoidectomy (alone, or in combination with ventilation tubes) with either no treatment or non-surgical treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes (determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise): 1) hearing, 2) otitis media-specific quality of life, 3) haemorrhage.

Secondary Outcomes

1) persistence of OME, 2) adverse effects, 3) receptive language skills, 4) speech development, 5) cognitive development, 6) psychosocial skills, 7) listening skills, 8) generic health-related quality of life, 9) parental stress, 10) vestibular function, 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (1785 children). Many of the studies used concomitant interventions for all participants, including insertion of ventilation tubes or myringotomy. All included studies had at least some concerns regarding the risk of bias. We report results for our main outcome measures at the longest available follow-up. We did not identify any data on disease-specific quality of life for any of the comparisons. Further details of additional outcomes and time points are reported in the review. 1) Adenoidectomy (with or without myringotomy) versus no treatment/watchful waiting (three studies) After 12 months there was little difference in the proportion of children whose hearing had returned to normal, but the evidence was very uncertain (adenoidectomy 68%, no treatment 70%; risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.46; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 50; 1 study, 42 participants). There is a risk of haemorrhage from adenoidectomy, but the absolute risk appears small (1/251 receiving adenoidectomy compared to 0/229, Peto odds ratio (OR) 6.77, 95% CI 0.13 to 342.54; 1 study, 480 participants; moderate certainty evidence). The risk of persistent OME may be slightly lower after two years in those receiving adenoidectomy (65% versus 73%), but again the difference was small (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; NNTB 13; 3 studies, 354 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 2) Adenoidectomy (with or without myringotomy) versus non-surgical treatment No studies were identified for this comparison. 3) Adenoidectomy and bilateral ventilation tubes versus bilateral ventilation tubes (four studies) There was a slight increase in the proportion of ears with a return to normal hearing after six to nine months (57% adenoidectomy versus 42% without, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.89; NNTB 7; 1 study, 127 participants (213 ears); very low-certainty evidence). Adenoidectomy may give an increased risk of haemorrhage, but the absolute risk appears small, and the evidence was uncertain (2/416 with adenoidectomy compared to 0/375 in the control group, Peto OR 6.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 107.18; 2 studies, 791 participants). The risk of persistent OME was similar for both groups (82% adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes compared to 85% ventilation tubes alone, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07; very low-certainty evidence). 4) Adenoidectomy and unilateral ventilation tube versus unilateral ventilation tube (two studies) Slightly more children returned to normal hearing after adenoidectomy, but the confidence intervals were wide (57% versus 46%, RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.96; NNTB 9; 1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Fewer children may have persistent OME after 12 months, but again the confidence intervals were wide (27.2% compared to 40.5%, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.29; NNTB 8; 1 study, 74 participants). We did not identify any data on haemorrhage. 5) Adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes versus no treatment/watchful waiting (two studies) We did not identify data on the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing. However, after two years, the mean difference in hearing threshold for those allocated to adenoidectomy was -3.40 dB (95% CI -5.54 to -1.26; 1 study, 211 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There may be a small reduction in the proportion of children with persistent OME after two years, but the evidence was very uncertain (82% compared to 90%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.01; NNTB 13; 1 study, 232 participants). We noted that many children in the watchful waiting group had also received surgery by this time point. 6) Adenoidectomy and ventilation tubes versus non-surgical treatment No studies were identified for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

When assessed with the GRADE approach, the evidence for adenoidectomy in children with OME is very uncertain. Adenoidectomy may reduce the persistence of OME, although evidence about the effect of this on hearing is unclear. For patients and carers, a return to normal hearing is likely to be important, but few studies measured this outcome. We did not identify any evidence on disease-specific quality of life. There were few data on adverse effects, in particular postoperative bleeding. The risk of haemorrhage appears to be small, but should be considered when choosing a treatment strategy for children with OME. Future studies should aim to determine which children are most likely to benefit from treatment, rather than offering interventions to all children.

Using the MicroWick to deliver otic medication to the inner ear fluids isa new, unique, effective, safe, efficient, and inexpensive method to treat inner ear disease. This self-treatment method using otic medication represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of inner ear disease. It allows the otologist to treat inner ear disease much as the ophthalmologist treats eye disease using eye drops. In the future, new drugs and medications will likely be developed that will relieve vertigo attacks, improve certain types of sensorineural hearing loss, and reduce tinnitus. The MicroWick will be available for patients to self-administer these medications to the inner ear through the round window membrane.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116Pji9w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) medical therapy — For purposes of counseling parents, the clinician should convey that drugs and medications are not recommended for managing OME. Antihistamines, decongestants, antireflux therapy, and topical nasal steroids are ineffective. Orally administered steroids have short-term efficacy, but after 1 or 2 months the benefit is no longer significant. Antibiotics have a small benefit in resolving OME, but they have significant adverse effects and do not improve HLs or reduce the need for future surgery. Last, despite the popularity of complementary and alternative therapy, there are no RCTs to show benefits in managing OME.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^111WhMGT]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion found no benefit from intranasal steroids. However, the review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, risk ratio 1·99 [95% CI 1·14–3·49] for persistent otitis media with effusion at follow-up), and a non-significant point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, risk ratio 3·80 [95% CI 0·93–15·52]). Oral antibiotics alone were not effective.

Studies included in the systematic review were limited by short-term follow-up, low power, poorly described inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No previous cost-effectiveness studies of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. A non-placebo-controlled trial published subsequent to the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.

Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. We included more patients than the combined total number of participants included in previous studies of oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included hearing, tympanometric, and quality-of-life assessments at follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, language, and other functional outcomes compared with watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.

An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months. We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^117LHq12]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — hearing thresholds, monitoring, and tympanostomy tube decisions are tied to audiologic findings and effusion duration. If a child with OME has hearing levels in the normal range (< 15 dB HL), the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option, and if watchful waiting is continued a repeat hearing test should be performed in 3 to 6 months if OME persists. If a child with OME has mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) and bilateral effusions for 3 months or longer (chronic), the clinician should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion; if mild hearing loss (16–40 dB HL) occurs with a unilateral effusion or with bilateral effusions for less than 3 months, the clinician should assess for signs or symptoms of OME that would make tube insertion an option. If a child with OME has moderate hearing loss (> 40 dB HL), tympanostomy tube insertion should be recommended. Reevaluation at 3- to 6-month intervals should include otologic examination, with audiologic assessment as needed, and any child with evidence of hearing loss on screening or hearing testing should be referred for comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist in a sound-treated booth. One systematic review showed early improvement in hearing levels after tympanostomy tube placement at postoperative 1–3 months, but by 12 to 24 months hearing outcomes were equivalent to watchful waiting, and randomized trials suggest that otherwise healthy children with persistent OME who do not have any of the at-risk criteria in Table 2 can be safely observed for 6 to 12 months without developmental sequelae or reduced overall QOL. Ongoing surveillance is mandatory because the incidence of structural damage increases with effusion duration.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113Rhcve]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — guideline scope and target population includes children aged 2 through 12 years and applies to any setting where OME is identified, monitored, or managed; however, it does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years of age. The document does not explicitly discuss indications for tympanostomy tubes, despite OME being the leading indication for tube insertion, because those indications are covered in a companion guideline; instead, surgical discussions focus on adjuvant procedures (eg, adenoidectomy, myringotomy) and sequelae of OME. It also aims to educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME, the lack of clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants), and includes goals for OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening.

### The physiologic role of corticosteroids in menière's disease: an update on glucocorticoid-mediated pathophysiology and corticosteroid inner ear distribution [^1133udN9]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are multiple treatment options for Ménière's disease (MD), including dietary modifications, aminoglycoside therapy, and surgery. All have limitations, ranging from limited effectiveness to permanent hearing loss. Corticosteroids have long been used to manage MD due to their relative efficacy and tolerability, but the exact mechanism for disease alleviation is uncertain. Until recently, the precise distribution and role that glucocorticoid receptors play in inner ear diseases have remained largely uninvestigated. Several studies propose they influence mechanisms of fluid regulation through ion and water homeostasis. This review will provide an update on the basic science literature describing the activity of endogenous glucocorticoids and exogenous corticosteroids in the inner ear and the relevance to MD, as well as early clinical trial data pertaining to the application of novel technologies for more effective administration of corticosteroids for the treatment of MD.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^116bhEPW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To examine the evidence for treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 26 August 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an oral antibiotic. We excluded publications in abstract form only; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; and studies reporting outcomes by ears (rather than children).

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently extracted data from the published reports using standardised data extraction forms and methods. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We expressed dichotomous results as a risk ratio (RR) and continuous data as weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where feasible we pooled studies using a random-effects model and performed tests for heterogeneity between studies. In trials with a cross-over design, we did not use post cross-over treatment data.

Main Results

We included 12 medium to high-quality studies with a total of 945 participants. No study documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. The follow-up period was generally limited, with only one study of intranasal steroid reporting outcome data beyond six months. There was no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of hearing loss associated with OME. Pooled data using a fixed-effect model for OME resolution at short-term follow up (< 1 month) showed a significant effect of oral steroids compared to control (RR 4.48; 95% CI 1.52 to 13.23; Chi² 2.75, df = 2, P = 0.25; I² = 27%). Oral steroids plus antibiotic also resulted in an improvement in OME resolution compared to placebo plus antibiotic at less than one month follow up, using a random-effects model (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.49; five trials, 409 children). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.01, I² = 69%). There was no evidence of beneficial effect on OME resolution at greater than one month follow up with oral steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) or intranasal steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) at any follow-up period. There was also no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

While oral steroids, especially when used in combination with an oral antibiotic, lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term, there is no evidence of longer-term benefit and no evidence that they relieve symptoms of hearing loss. We found no evidence of benefit from treatment of OME with topical intranasal steroids, alone or in combination with an antibiotic, either at short or longer-term follow up.

### Clinical practice guidelines: whose practice are we guiding? [^115oanpJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has just released an update to the clinical practice guideline (CPG) on otitis media with effusion. This common condition is frequently managed by primary care providers; however, their awareness and utilization of the AAO-HNSF CPGs are unknown. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess familiarity with otologic diagnoses, evaluation skills, and guidelines. Only 38.5% of respondents use pneumatic otoscopy, and roughly 50% utilize a CPG for management of otitis media or for referral for tympanostomy tube insertion. Providers predominantly use the acute otitis media guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics. In this single-institution study, providers are largely unaware of the AAO-HNSF CPGs and could benefit from additional training, including workshops taught by otolaryngologists within individual health care systems or development of a national otolaryngology medical student curriculum. A more immediate option includes referencing our CPGs on specialty societies' websites or newsletters.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113NRANZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with frequent ear infections without persistent middle ear fluid — middle ear effusion after infection often resolves; within 3 months about 90% of children no longer have middle ear fluid. Children may still meet a recurrent infection definition (3 or more in the past 6 months, or 4 in the past 12 months) but, when no effusion is present at the specialty visit, research notes that nearly half will not have more ear infections and only about 1 in 3 children continue to have recurrent ear infections, and Other research shows that 2 out of every 3 children who see an otolaryngologist for repeated ear infections, but who have a normal examination (no middle ear fluid) in the office, do not require ear tubes in the future. The best research evidence we have suggests that inserting tubes will not reduce future ear infections when there is no persistent effusion, but the procedure does involve some minor risks related to the ear tube and general anesthesia. Waiting a bit more time to see how your child does on their own does not carry any risk or harm, since many children will not have any further ear infections at all and most will never need tubes. Exceptions are acknowledged; If any of the following apply to your child, you should discuss with your doctor whether ear tubes may still be of benefit, including weak immune system or other problems putting them at higher risk for infections; prior complications of ear infections; adverse antibiotic reactions, allergies, or inability to take oral antibiotics that make it difficult to treat ear infections when antibiotics are needed; and high risk of developmental problems including permanent hearing loss, delays in speech or language, delays in learning, autism-spectrum disorder, syndromes (e.g. Down) or structural problems with the face and head (e.g., cleft palate), or severe vision loss.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^113n6vCk]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Children with persistent hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion are commonly managed by surgical intervention. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment would enhance treatment options. Underpowered, poor-quality trials have found short-term benefit from oral steroids. We aimed to investigate whether a short course of oral steroids would achieve acceptable hearing in children with persistent otitis media with effusion and hearing loss.

Methods

In this individually randomised, parallel, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial we recruited children aged 2–8 years with symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months and with confirmed bilateral hearing loss. Participants were recruited from 20 ear, nose, and throat (ENT), paediatric audiology, and audiovestibular medicine outpatient departments in England and Wales. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to sequentially numbered identical prednisolone (oral steroid) or placebo packs by use of computer-generated random permuted block sizes stratified by site and child's age. The primary outcome was audiometry-confirmed acceptable hearing at 5 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN49798431.

Findings

Between March 20, 2014, and April 5, 2016, 1018 children were screened, of whom 389 were randomised. 200 were assigned to receive oral steroids and 189 to receive placebo. Hearing at 5 weeks was assessed in 183 children in the oral steroid group and in 180 in the placebo group. Acceptable hearing was observed in 73 (40%) children in the oral steroid group and in 59 (33%) in the placebo group (absolute difference 7% [95% CI −3 to 17], number needed to treat 14; adjusted odds ratio 1·36 [95% CI 0·88–2·11]; p = 0·16). There was no evidence of any significant differences in adverse events or quality-of-life measures between the groups.

Interpretation

Otitis media with effusion in children with documented hearing loss and attributable symptoms for at least 3 months has a high rate of spontaneous resolution. A short course of oral prednisolone is not an effective treatment for most children aged 2–8 years with persistent otitis media with effusion, but is well tolerated. One in 14 children might achieve improved hearing but not quality of life. Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will be supported by this evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116M6YSV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Ear fluid and newborn hearing screening — parent counseling from Table 8 notes that only a very small number of babies who fail will have permanent hearing loss, with only about 2 or 3 of every 1000 children in the US born deaf or hard of hearing; middle ear fluid is a very common cause of a failed newborn hearing screen and is found in about 6 of every 10 children who fail; the newborn hearing screen cannot determine the cause, and about 90% of the time hearing loss goes away when the fluid does, but 10% of children may still have hearing loss that needs further medical attention; after tubes, for about 70% of children hearing loss caused by fluid will go away right after the tubes are in place, however, for about 30% of children it could take up to several months before hearing improves; middle ear fluid is more common in children with an abnormal roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or certain inherited problems; and because parent assessment of child hearing is not always accurate, only a professional hearing test that checks each ear separately can accurately tell how a child hears.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1153D6TN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline for otitis media with effusion (OME) — the guideline states that it offers recommendations for identifying, monitoring, and managing the child with OME and emphasizes appropriate diagnosis and options including observation, medical intervention, and referral for surgical intervention to assist primary care physicians and other health care providers; it also clarifies that it is provided for information and educational purposes only, is not intended as a sole source of guidance, is designed to assist clinicians with an evidence-based framework, is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals, guidelines are not mandates or a legal standard of care, the responsible provider must determine appropriate treatment, adherence will not ensure successful outcomes in every situation, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation emphasizes that these guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or to exclude other decisions reasonably directed to obtaining the same results.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113boyzE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### Serous otitis… [^112eU4sa]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The presence of fluid in the middle ear is not a positive indication for surgery. Most cases will respond to medical management and controlled middle ear inflation. However, myringotomies are usually the treatment of choice in young children with serous otitis and should be performed in conjunction with the thorough removal of all accessible adenoid tissue. In a series of 258 ears containing fluid, 96. 9% were successfully treated by a complete adenoidectomy, myringotomy, and postoperative middle ear inflation when indicated.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^111DoZR1]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion is estimated to affect 50–80% of children by the age of 5 years and costs the National Health Service (NHS) up to £90 million per year. Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and mucolytics are ineffective treatments for this condition. Intervention options are largely limited to watchful waiting, hearing aids, or surgical insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic membrane (with or without adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy). Use of an autoinflation device resulted in a modest benefit for some children aged 4–11 years. However, 80% of children are affected by otitis media with effusion before the age of 4 years, a time when language development is most rapid, hearing loss has its greatest effect on language development, and when children are generally unable to use an autoinflation device. Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but children often find them uncomfortable, might feel self-conscious, and can become a target for bullying. Both hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary care, with major cost implications. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment, especially if implementable in primary care, would enhance treatment options.

Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). A subsequent trial found that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation and the American Academy of Pediatrics, informed by the generally underpowered studies in our review, have recommended against oral steroids for otitis media with effusion. Despite this recommendation, adults diagnosed with otitis media with effusion are more likely to be prescribed oral steroids than those with other diagnoses.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115eHMzd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) introduction — definition, synonyms, and burden state that OME is defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection; synonyms include ear fluid and serous, secretory, or nonsuppurative otitis media; the condition is common because about 90% of children have OME before school age and they develop, on average, 4 episodes of OME every year; and in the United States about 2.2 million diagnosed episodes occur annually at a cost of $4.0 billion.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112JpuvH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) surveillance — "Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected". This is a "Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm", with "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies", "Level of confidence in the evidence: High", and "Policy level: Recommendation". Benefits include detection of structural tympanic membrane changes and new hearing difficulties that may prompt reassessment and discussion of listening-learning strategies with ongoing counseling, while risks/costs are limited to the "Cost of follow-up", and the "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm". Timing is intentionally flexible because "The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months", and patient preference is acknowledged: "Role of patient preferences: Moderate; opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8AQv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms, hearing impact, treatment options, and complication rates are described: Patients seek treatment for a host of symptoms including pain, itching, sensation of fullness, tinnitus, odor, drainage, and cough, and hearing loss can range from 5 to 40 dB depending on the degree of occlusion. Multiple treatment options exist — observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal other than irrigation — with combinations used and manual removal performed with a curette, probe, hook, forceps, or suction under direct visualization. Though generally safe, complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, canal laceration, infection, bleeding, or hearing loss occur at a rate of about 1 in 1000 ear irrigations, which applied nationally estimates that 8000 complications occur annually; other reported complications include otitis externa, pain, dizziness, and syncope.

Ear tubes — indications and water guidance emphasize benefits and simple precautions. Ear tubes are recommended for "frequent ear infections or prolonged fluid in the ears" to "Help decrease the number of ear infections", allow treatment with "antibiotic ear drops instead of antibiotics that are taken by mouth", "Help prevent fluid from backing up" into the middle ear, and "Improve hearing" reduced by fluid. For water activities, "Your child will not usually need ear plugs", and "Head bands or other special efforts… are also unnecessary, but may be helpful" when there is "Pain or discomfort when water enters the ear canal", "Current fluid or drainage", "Swimming in lakes or non-chlorinated pools that are not clean", or "Dunking head in the bathtub". The guide cautions, "NEVER use Play-Doh or Silly Putty as an ear plug — these materials can become trapped in the ear canal and even require surgical removal".

Otitis media with effusion — at-risk infants and children: At-risk children with OME require more frequent hearing assessment and prompt management to prevent additional impact on developmental outcomes. This category includes children with speech-language or academic delay and those with developmental disability of any cause, especially Down syndrome and other craniofacial anomalies in which OME is very common and persistent. Children in these categories should receive otologic and hearing screening or assessment when speech-language delay is identified to allow prompt treatment for OME, and hearing should be reassessed following medical or surgical treatment, at ongoing intervals (at least annually), or as recommended in relevant clinical practice guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^111V3q59]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.
