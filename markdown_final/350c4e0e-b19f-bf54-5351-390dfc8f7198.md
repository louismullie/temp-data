## Question

A cashier worked part-time at a convenience store. As the cashier was sitting behind the cash register, he noticed a boy enter the store. While the boy walked through the store, the cashier watched him on a hidden camera located behind the cashier's counter. Thereupon, the cashier saw the boy pick up two packs of baseball cards and place them in his coat pocket. The boy then walked to the rear of the store, where he picked up a package of cupcakes. The boy took the cupcakes to the front counter and paid the cashier for the cupcakes only. The boy started to walk out of the store when the cashier said, "Hey, kid, I'm not charging you for the baseball cards because you paid for the cupcakes. But next time I'm not going to let you get away with it. " The baseball cards sold for $5 per pack. The boy has committed which, if any, crimes?

Answer Choices:
A. False pretenses.
B. No crime.
C. Robbery.
D. Theft by deception.
E. Embezzlement.
F. Fraud.
G. Larceny.
H. Petit theft.
I. Larceny by trick.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which crime, if any, the boy committed when he concealed two packs of baseball cards in his coat, paid for cupcakes, and left the store without paying for the cards. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the elements of larceny/theft and whether they are satisfied. Then, I should verify whether any deception occurred that would convert this into theft by deception or larceny by trick. Next, I will consider whether the cashier's statement changes the legal status of the taking. After that, I need to check whether robbery or embezzlement could apply. Finally, I will distinguish petit theft from larceny and select the best answer among the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of larceny. Larceny generally requires the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof. Here, the boy took the baseball cards without permission, concealed them, and exited the store without paying, which establishes taking, asportation, lack of consent, and apparent intent to deprive the owner of the cards, so the elements of larceny are satisfied at the moment he left the store without paying [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether any deception occurred that would make this theft by deception or larceny by trick. Theft by deception requires obtaining property by means of a false representation with intent to deprive, and larceny by trick requires obtaining possession by a misrepresentation while intending to convert the property. The boy did not make any false representation to the cashier; he simply concealed the cards and paid for other items, so there was no deception of the owner to obtain the property, and thus neither theft by deception nor larceny by trick applies here [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the cashier's statement. I initially thought the cashier's saying "I'm not charging you for the baseball cards" might retroactively negate the taking, but wait, that would be incorrect because the crime was complete when the boy left the store without paying, and the cashier's subsequent decision not to press charges does not undo the completed larceny; it may affect prosecution, but it does not change the fact that a crime occurred, so the correct view is that the larceny was complete before the cashier spoke [^notfound].

> I need to check whether robbery could apply. Robbery requires the taking of property from the person or presence of another by force or intimidation. There was no force or intimidation here; the taking was surreptitious, so robbery is not applicable [^notfound].

> Let me consider embezzlement. Embezzlement involves the fraudulent conversion of property by one to whom it has been entrusted. The boy was not entrusted with the baseball cards, so embezzlement does not fit the facts [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the distinction between larceny and petit theft. Petit theft is simply a misdemeanor-grade larceny based on the value of the property stolen; it is a subset of larceny rather than a different offense. Given two packs at $5 each, the total value is $10, which in most jurisdictions would qualify as petit theft rather than grand theft, but the most precise general category remains larceny, with petit theft specifying the misdemeanor level by value [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the boy committed larceny when he took the cards by concealment and exited without payment, and because the value is low, this would typically be charged as petit theft. Among the provided options, larceny is the most accurate overarching label, with petit theft also correct but more specific; since larceny is listed and captures the essence of the offense, that is the best choice here [^notfound].

> Final answer: G. Larceny.

---

The boy committed **larceny** (petit theft) [^notfound] when he concealed the baseball cards and left the store without paying, fulfilling the elements of taking, carrying away, and intent to permanently deprive. The cashier's later statement does not negate the crime, as it occurred after the theft was complete. False pretenses, theft by deception, and larceny by trick require a misrepresentation or trick to obtain property, which did not occur here [^notfound]. Robbery requires force or threat, and embezzlement requires lawful possession, so neither applies [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of the boy's actions

### Elements of larceny

Larceny is the **unlawful taking and carrying away of personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive the owner** [^notfound]. The elements are:

- **Taking**: The boy took the baseball cards from the store.
- **Carrying away**: He moved the cards from their original location and concealed them in his coat pocket.
- **Personal property of another**: The cards belonged to the store.
- **Intent to permanently deprive**: By concealing the cards and leaving without paying, he showed intent to keep them permanently.

---

### Application to the facts

The boy's actions meet all elements of larceny: he took the cards, carried them away, and intended to deprive the store permanently. The cashier's statement after the fact does not negate the crime, as the **theft was complete when he left the store without paying** [^notfound].

---

## Distinction from other crimes

### False pretenses and theft by deception

False pretenses and theft by deception require a **misrepresentation to obtain property** [^notfound]. Here, the boy did not make any false statements or engage in deception; he simply concealed the cards and left without paying. Thus, these crimes do not apply [^notfound].

---

### Larceny by trick

Larceny by trick requires obtaining possession through a **trick or misrepresentation**, with the intent to convert the property. The boy did not use any trick or misrepresentation to obtain the cards; he merely concealed them and left without paying. Therefore, larceny by trick does not apply [^notfound].

---

### Robbery

Robbery requires taking property by **force or threat of force**. There was no force or threat involved in this scenario, so robbery does not apply [^notfound].

---

### Embezzlement

Embezzlement involves the **fraudulent conversion of property by one to whom it has been entrusted**. The boy was not entrusted with the baseball cards, so embezzlement does not apply [^notfound].

---

## Classification of the crime

Given the value of the baseball cards ($10 total), this offense is **petit theft**, a misdemeanor form of larceny [^notfound]. The cashier's decision not to press charges does not negate the fact that a crime was committed.

---

## Conclusion

The boy committed **larceny (petit theft)** by unlawfully taking and carrying away the baseball cards with intent to permanently deprive the store. None of the other listed crimes apply because there was no misrepresentation, force, or lawful possession involved [^notfound].

### Collecting data | Occupation and industry data… [^7de47412]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Collect occupation AND industry Occupation and industry are related, but distinct variables Occupation is a person's job. People in the same job have similar training and perform a similar set of tasks. They may also have similar workplace exposures. Examples of occupations include registered nurse, janitor, cashier, and auto mechanic. Industry is the type of business in which a person works. Industry Instead of "manufacturing, " ask what kind of manufacturing. For example, it is better to record "automobile parts manufacturing. " Instead of "food industry, " ask what part of the food industry. For example, it is better to record "restaurant" or "grocery store". current occupation and industry. Current occupation is the job that the person has been doing most recently. A job may be paid or unpaid. Check out this page for more resources related to current occupation and industry data collection.

Chronic conditions Chronic conditions can take a long time to develop and may not go away. If studying cancer or another chronic disease, ask for. Example: A man currently works 20 hours a week as a waiter in a restaurant and 15 hours a week as a clerk at a gas station.
- **Document information on each job separately**: Occupation = waiter; Industry = restaurant Occupation = clerk; Industry = gas station
- If you can only collect information on one job, list. waiter ashis occupation, and restaurantas his industry because he works as a waiter most often. Usual occupation refers to the longest-held job. This is not necessarily the current, highest paid, or most prestigious job. Example: A woman worked as a cook at a fast-food restaurant for 5 years. Later, she worked as a secretary for a car dealership for 25 years. Then, she worked as a care assistant at a retirement home for 10 years.

Though she had three long-term jobs, she worked the longest as a secretary. For. usual occupation and industry, you would list: Occupation: secretary Industry: car dealership In most studies of working populations, it is important to collect work information on everyone ages 16 years and older. However, it is possible to study workers younger than 16, so consider adjusting the age range for your study based on the purpose of your study.

### Why confessions Trump innocence [^99fda5eb]. The American Psychologist (2012). Low credibility.

As illustrated by the story of Amanda Knox and many others wrongfully convicted, false confessions often trump factual innocence. Focusing on consequences, recent research suggests that confessions are powerfully persuasive as a matter of logic and common sense; that many false confessions contain richly detailed narratives and accurate crime facts that appear to betray guilty knowledge; and that confessions in general can corrupt other evidence from lay witnesses and forensic experts-producing an illusion of false support. This latter phenomenon, termed "corroboration inflation", suggests that pretrial corroboration requirements as well as the concept of "harmless error" on appeal are based on an erroneous presumption of independence among items of evidence. In addition to previously suggested reforms to police practices that are designed to curb the risk of false confessions, measures should be taken as well to minimize the rippling consequences of those confessions.

### False confessions: how can psychology so basic be so counterintuitive? [^2bc40b16]. The American Psychologist (2017). Low credibility.

Recent advances in DNA technology have shined a spotlight on thousands of innocent people wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit-many of whom had been induced to confess. The scientific study of false confessions, which helps to explain this phenomenon, has proved highly paradoxical. On the one hand, it is rooted in reliable core principles of psychology (e.g., research on reinforcement and decision-making, obedience to authority, and confirmation biases). On the other hand, false confessions are highly counterintuitive if not inconceivable to most people (e.g., as seen in actual trial outcomes as well as studies of jury decision making). This article describes both the psychology underlying false confessions and the psychology that predicts the counterintuitive nature of this same phenomenon. It then notes that precisely because they are so counterintuitive, false confessions are often "invisible", resulting in a form of inattentional blindness, and are slow to change in the face of contradiction, illustrating belief perseverance. This article concludes by suggesting ways in which psychologists can help to prevent future miscarriages of justice by advocating for reforms to policy and practice and helping to raise public awareness.

### Special operations: a hidden chapter in the histories of facial surgery and human enhancement [^d2fecf83]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

According to the 1907 Hague Convention, which applied in the 1940s, it was 'especially forbidden' to 'kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army': an acknowledgement of a general obligation that military forces had to fight wearing a form of uniform distinguishing themselves from civilians, and that donning civilian clothing with a clear intent to deceive — an act of perfidy — would violate the law of war if it was the proximate cause of killing or wounding. 72

The same convention defined a spy as a person who, 'when, acting clandestinely or on false pretenses obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party'. 73 Although espionage was not a war crime under international law, neither the Hague Convention nor the 1929 Geneva Convention, which applied in the 1940s to the treatment of prisoners, offered much protection to captives deemed to be spies, except for establishing that no one suspected of spying should be punished without first being tried. 74 If a trial was fair, then severe punishment, if properly in line with the captor government's domestic penalties for a proven offence of espionage, could legitimately follow. 75 This was the fate, for example, of Emilio Zappala, who, when interrogated after capture, disclosed Giovanni Di Giunta's surgery and secret mission. A clandestine agent of Britain's SIS, Zappala had been arrested in Italian-controlled Sicily while wearing civilian clothes and carrying faked documents. Weeks later, he was put before a Fascist tribunal in Rome, found guilty of committing espionage, sentenced to death for that offence, and shot. 76

### The comprehensive assessment of theory of mind (CAT): a novel measure of 3-to 8-year-old children's theory of mind and an evaluation of mental-state scaling [^9a99ce8e]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Adding Assessments of Other‐Relevant Concepts Such as Knowledge Expertise, Visual Perspective Taking, Nonmental Representation Reasoning, and True Belief

The commonly used Wellman and Liu scale includes items testing understanding of diverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access, false beliefs, and hidden emotions. There are multiple mental‐state concepts in addition to these commonly studied concepts that have also received considerable attention in the broader field of ToM research such as understanding of intentions and goals (e.g. Woodward), pretense (e.g. Carlson et al.), knowledge expertise (e.g. Lane et al.), visual perspective taking (e.g. Flavell), faux pas (e.g. Happe), and sarcasm (e.g. Happé, 1994). Additionally, several studies investigate understanding of mental‐state concepts as they relate to moral reasoning (e.g. see Lagattuta and Wellerfor review) or emotions (e.g. "affective ToM"; Gallant et al.). The more mental‐state concepts a measure assesses, the more comprehensive characterization of ToM development it offers. However, there are considerations for the number and type of concepts assessed in a single measure such as whether the concepts can be tested with the same item format (e.g. vignette/story format versus behavioral coding of actions that reflect mental state understanding, e.g. Carlson et al.), whether they similarly measure the same underlying construct (e.g. moral ToM versus affective ToM versus cognitive ToM; see e.g. Schurz et al.), whether the concepts are developmentally appropriate for the target age range of participants, and whether the measure is feasible to administer (e.g. given a lengthy duration with more items). Each of these considerations can limit the number of concepts a given measure includes.

### Randomization and placebo effects in clinical trials of major depressive disorder [^be1e77b0]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Research programs in major depressive disorder (MDD) are in some cases shaped by perceived problems arising from the heterogeneity and non-additivity of placebo effects. A recent proposal in this direction has been provided by Gomeni, Hopkins, Bressole-Gomeni, and Fava. In this correspondence we wish to challenge several of the premises that motivate and guide their proposal.

In their opening paragraph, Gomeni, Hopkins, Bressole-Gomeni, and Fava suggest that the validity of statistical inference based on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) depends on covariate balance between the treatment groups. In fact, covariate balance is neither expected nor required for the outcome of any particular randomized allocation in a RCT. Correspondingly, it is not the case that conventional RCT analyses assume, "that the response is only driven by the treatment administered" (p. 1). Rather, it is expected that treatment effect estimates from an RCT will be biased (albeit in an unknown direction) conditional on a given randomization. Valid confidence intervals for a treatment effect do not require a false pretense that this conditional bias has been eliminated, but instead account for uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of the conditional bias by means of increased interval width relative to the width that would be appropriate in the absence of (unknown) conditional biases. As such, RCT designs are valid in MDD even if placebo effects are large, heterogeneous, and non-additive with treatment effects.

### Taking decisions seriously: young children's understanding of conventional truth [^03a56a8d]. Child Development (2000). Low credibility.

Research suggests that young children may see a direct and one-way connection between facts about the world and epistemic mental states (e.g., belief). Conventions represent instances of active constructions of the mind that change facts about the world. As such, a mature understanding of convention would seem to present a strong challenge to children's simplified notions of epistemic relations. Three experiments assessed young children's abilities to track behavioral, representational, and truth aspects of conventions. In Experiment 1, 3- and 4-year-old children (N = 30) recognized that conventional stipulations would change people's behaviors. However, participants generally failed to understand how stipulations might affect representations. In Experiment 2, 3-, 5-, and 7-year-old children (N = 53) were asked to reason about the truth values of statements about pretenses and conventions. The two younger groups of children often confused the two types of states, whereas older children consistently judged that conventions, but not pretenses, changed reality. In Experiment 3, the same 3- and 5-year-olds (N = 42) participated in tasks assessing their understanding of representational diversity (e.g., false belief). In general, children's performance on false-belief and "false-convention" tasks did not differ, which suggests that conventions were understood as involving truth claims (as akin to beliefs about physical reality). Children's difficulties with the idea of conventional truth seems consistent with current accounts of developing theories of mind.

### The comprehensive assessment of theory of mind (CAT): a novel measure of 3-to 8-year-old children's theory of mind and an evaluation of mental-state scaling [^3c1c56f4]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

4 The Present Study

The present study aimed to address several limitations in existing ToM measures by developing a novel measure of children's ToM called the Comprehensive Assessment of ToM (CAT). The CAT importantly expands the original Wellman and Liu scale in several ways, and offers novel insight into children's progression of mental‐state concepts.

We administered the CAT to children 3‐ to 8‐years‐old to shed light on children's progression of mental‐state concepts throughout and beyond preschool. Critically, in addition to assessing commonly examined mental‐state concepts including diverse desires, diverse beliefs, knowledge access, and false belief (all included in the Wellman and Liuscale), the CAT also assesses children's understanding of knowledge expertise, VPT, false signs, and true beliefs. As noted above, these additional concepts were particularly useful to include given they closely relate to the highly studied Wellman and Liu scale, show variability in our target age range, and have been tested in the common vignette‐style item format enabling consistency across all items in the measure. Additional items examining reasoning about intentions and goals, pretense, faux pas, sarcasm, affective ToM, or moral ToM were either not commonly tested in the vignette format, were unlikely to show variability in our target age range of preschool to school‐age children, and/or tested underlying constructs that were possibly different from our target "cognitive" ToM construct captured in the majority of items in the Wellman and Liu scale (Apperly and Butterfill; Schurz et al.). Thus, to facilitate feasibility of administration and to reasonably constrain our measure, we did not include items testing these additional categories. However, in the discussion section, we describe the potential utility of developing additional items in these and other mental‐state categories following the methods and approach outlined in this paper.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^4743a04b]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data analysis

We followed the current guidance provided by the Cochrane collaboration for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The statistical methods for such reviews focus on two statistical measures of diagnostic accuracy of the test: sensitivity (the proportion of offenders who a risk assessment tool predicted to offend) and specificity (the proportion of non-offenders who a risk assessment tool predicted would not offend). The aim of the analysis was to quantify and compare these statistics as well as the error rates (false positive and false negative diagnoses) for each type of test. The required analysis is a bivariate analysis of sensitivity and specificity for each study accounting for correlation between sensitivities and specificities. The resulting model without covariates is a different parameterisation of the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model. We used summary receiver operator characteristic plots to display the results of each study in receiver operating characteristic space, plotting each study plotted as a single sensitivity-specificity point. Parameter estimates from the bivariate model produced a summary receiver operating characteristic curve with a summary operating point (that is, summary values for sensitivity and specificity), 95% confidence region, and 95% prediction region. We used the summary point from each curve to calculate the summary diagnostic odds ratio and both the sensitivity and specificity, each with 95% confidence intervals.

Since binary test outcomes are defined on the basis of a cut-off value for test positivity, we chose these values a priori. Risk assessment tools are predominantly used in clinical situations as instruments for identifying higher risk individuals, thus, we combined participants who were classified as being at moderate or high risk for future offending and compared them with those classified as low risk. We did secondary analyses by comparing participants classified as high risk with those classified as low or moderate risk, an approach consistent with screening, and also by completely excluding those classified as moderate risk.

### Getting it wrong about miranda rights: false beliefs, impaired reasoning, and professional neglect [^950402be]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

Television and other media inundate Americans with innumerable yet fragmentary examples of Miranda warnings; however, familiarity born of repeated exposures cannot be equated with accuracy or understanding. The intended purpose of these warnings is to inform and caution rather than to pacify and reassure — a purpose that cannot be realized when most custodial suspects assume that they already know everything the law insists they should be told. Painstakingly negotiated Constitutional safeguards are further imperiled when attorneys, judges, and forensic evaluators are lulled into complacency by the commonly held misconception that everyone understands their Miranda rights. This article elucidates certain false beliefs and misapprehensions regarding Miranda comprehension and identifies widespread neglect of these issues by the professional community.

### Induction of false beliefs and false memories in laboratory studies – A systematic review [^35547321]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Psychological interventions often use guided discovery and other techniques for diagnostic exploration and intervention planning. This way, memories may arise in the person, which may be true or false. False memories of earlier events can be harmful and result in real suffering, similar to actual traumatic memories. Based on cognitive psychological and psycho-traumatological findings, there is pronounced dissent in the academic disciplines regarding the conceptualization, relevance and research of false memories. This review contributes to the basic question of how often false beliefs and false memories may be induced within the frame of different interactional techniques. A systematic review has been conducted of 59 articles from (quasi-)experimental studies and two qualitative sources from 30 data bases. Three main methods of memory induction provide the basis for reporting: imagination inflation, false feedback, and memory implantation. Due to the conceptual and methodological diversity of the studies, the results appear to be heterogeneous. Free and guided imagery, as well as suggestive statements, could induce false beliefs or false memories in, on average, 20%-50% of the participants who underwent experimental manipulation concerning false past events. A false belief induction may occur after dream interpretation or hypnosis in more than 50% of participants. Personalized suggestion is more effective in inducing memory than the general plausibility of the suggested events. Further research questions are which therapeutic actions seem appropriate in cases of harmful false memories. This depends not only on whether there are veridical elements in the false memory but also on the quality and meaning of the memory for the person's life and ability to cope with burdens.

### Platelet-derived MHC class I confers a pseudonormal phenotype to cancer cells that subverts the antitumor reactivity of natural killer immune cells [^3d69ba55]. Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that play an important role in tumor immunosurveillance, preferentially eliminating targets with low or absent expression of MHC class I and stress-induced expression of ligands for activating NK receptors. Platelets promote metastasis by protecting disseminating tumor cells from NK cell immunosurveillance, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we show that tumor cells rapidly get coated in the presence of platelets in vitro, and circulating tumor cells of cancer patients display coexpression of platelet markers. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, confocal microscopy, and analyses on an ultrastructural level using immunoelectron microscopy revealed that such coating may cause transfer of MHC class I onto the tumor cell surface resulting in high-level expression of platelet-derived normal MHC class I. The resulting "phenotype of false pretenses" disrupts recognition of tumor cell missing self, thereby impairing cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production by NK cells. Thus, our data indicate that platelets, by conferring an unsuspicious "pseudonormal" phenotype, may enable a molecular mimicry that allows metastasizing tumor cells to downregulate MHC class I, to escape T-cell-mediated immunity without inducing susceptibility to NK cell reactivity.

### Five-year-old children value reasons in apologies for belief-based accidents [^cf8f0e1a]. Child Development (2023). Medium credibility.

A less explored kind of transgression, however, are belief‐based accidents in which the intention and outcome do not match. An individual might deliberately eat someone's sandwich by falsely believing that it was theirs. The act of eating the sandwich is intended, but the outcome (i.e. stealing somebody's food) is not. Unlike accidental transgressions, where the unintentional nature of the transgression is observable (e.g. the transgressor's surprised face, gasps) and in the common ground of the victim and transgressor (Köymen et al; Mammen et al; see also Bohn & Köymen,), belief‐based accidents result in different interpretations of the offense. From the victim's perspective, the transgression appears intentional based on the intended action, whereas the transgressor considers it an accident due to the unintended outcome. Thus, giving reasons (e.g. "I thought the sandwich was mine") for belief‐based accidents is crucial to clarify that the harm was unintended, while reasons for accidental transgressions are redundant.

### Fact or fiction: reducing the proportion and impact of false positives [^ee68ca6c]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

False positive findings in science are inevitable, but are they particularly common in psychology and psychiatry? The evidence that we review suggests that while not restricted to our field, the problem is acute. We describe the concept of researcher 'degrees-of-freedom' to explain how many false-positive findings arise, and how the various strategies of registration, pre-specification, and reporting standards that are being adopted both reduce and make these visible. We review possible benefits and harms of proposed statistical solutions, from tougher requirements for significance, to Bayesian and machine learning approaches to analysis. Finally we consider the organisation and methods for replication and systematic review in psychology and psychiatry.

### Make-believe memories [^98bd54f9]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

Research on memory distortion has shown that postevent suggestion can contaminate what a person remembers. Moreover, suggestion can lead to false memories being injected outright into the minds of people. These findings have implications for police investigation, clinical practice, and other settings in which memory reports are solicited.

### Multicenter evaluation of the accelerate phenoTest BC kit for rapid identification and phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing using morphokinetic cellular analysis [^038ea36f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

An advantage of the Accelerate Pheno system is the monomicrobial call. The monomicrobial call is an attribute designed to provide laboratorians and clinicians with an indicator that the blood culture contains a single species; therefore, antimicrobial therapy could be reliably adjusted per Accelerate Pheno system AST results with a low risk of inappropriate antimicrobial de-escalation. Of fresh samples, 89% received a monomicrobial call. Note that the classification as "negative" for the monomicrobial call does not necessarily confirm the presence of multiple organisms. Use of the Gram stain, in conjunction with the monomicrobial call, yields a 99.4% PPV, i.e. only 1 in 100 positive results were in fact mixed. Therefore the risk of de-escalation under false pretenses is very low and should encourage physicians to follow antimicrobial stewardship guidelines for de-escalation when warranted.

Excellent concordance was obtained between the Accelerate Pheno system and the reference BMD method. Accurate detection of antimicrobial resistance resulting in prompt escalation of therapy is critical for a successful outcome when treating bacteremia. Studies have demonstrated that inappropriate empirical therapy is associated with increased hospital mortality. The need for rapid AST results has led to the development of several assays for ID, which cover 80 to 90% of pathogens recovered in positive blood cultures. However, unlike other rapid diagnostic platforms that identify organisms from positive blood culture bottles and detect genetic resistance markers, the Accelerate Pheno system is unique in its ability to identify and provide MIC and categorical phenotypic AST results in 7 h for several antimicrobial agents targeting the Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms using the Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit. This is important because there is an association between high MICs within the susceptible range and adverse outcomes for patients with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. Regular surveillance of MICs is required due to a continuing decrease in susceptibility to the commonly used antibiotics in critically ill patients.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^57ca7b2b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Experts can and often will be deposed — A discovery alternative to deposition testimony is the expert's written report, which typically is shared between the parties before trial; however, some states do not require disclosure of the identity of the expert or even disclosure of the report. In criminal cases, discovery of expert opinion usually is accomplished by pretrial interview with the expert witness or by an expert witness' written report. It is helpful when expert witnesses are willing to be available and to discuss their opinions with both sides in advance of their testimony, and it is not advisable that physicians engage in the practice of having attorneys write their reports; if that does occur, physician experts should read that statement carefully to verify agreement with it.

### Error and discrepancy in radiology: inevitable or avoidable? [^bbe3441b]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Radiologists base their conclusions on a varying number of premises (e.g. available clinical information, statistical likelihood). Any of the bases for conclusions may prove to have been false. Subsequent information may show the original conclusion to have been false, but this does not constitute a prima facie error in judgement, and the possibility that a different radiologist might have come to a different conclusion based upon the same information does not imply negligence on its own.

It is important to avoid the temptation (beloved by plaintiffs' lawyers) to apply the principle "radiologists have a duty to interpret radiographs correctly" to specific instances ("radiologists have a duty to interpret this particular radiograph correctly"). The inference that missing an abnormality on a specific radiograph automatically constitutes malpractice is not correct. Experienced, competent radiologists may miss abnormalities, and may be unaware of having done so. Experienced radiologists may make different judgements based on the same study; thus differences in judgement are not negligence. Unfortunately, juries are often swayed by compassion for an injured defendant, and research has shown that the results of malpractice suits are often related to the degree of disability or injury rather than to the nature of the event or whether physician negligence was present.

### Predatory open-access publishing in anesthesiology [^b6c0ca4f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Predatory publishing is an exploitative fraudulent open-access publishing model that applies charges under the pretense of legitimate publishing operations without actually providing the editorial services associated with legitimate journals. The aim of this study was to analyze this phenomenon in the field of anesthesiology and related specialties (intensive care, critical and respiratory medicine, pain medicine, and emergency care). Two authors independently surveyed a freely accessible, constantly updated version of the original Beall lists of potential, possible, or probable predatory publishers and standalone journals. We identified 212 journals from 83 publishers, and the total number of published articles was 12,871. The reported location of most publishers was in the United States. In 43% of cases (37/84), the reported location was judged as "unreliable" after being checked using the 3-dimensional view in Google Maps. Six journals were indexed in PubMed. Although 6 journals were declared to be indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals, none were actually registered. The median article processing charge was 634.5 US dollars (interquartile range, 275–1005 US dollars). Several journals reported false indexing/registration in the Committee on Publication Ethics and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors registries and Google Scholar. Only 32% (67/212) reported the name of the editor-in-chief. Rules for ethics/scientific misconduct were reported in only 24% of cases (50/212). In conclusion, potential or probable predatory open-access publishers and journals are widely present in the broad field of anesthesiology and related specialties. Researchers should carefully check journals' reported information, including location, editorial board, indexing, and rules for ethics when submitting their manuscripts to open-access journals.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^e1622a05]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement — expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings — states that scientifically sound and unbiased expert witness testimony should be readily available in civil and criminal proceedings and that pediatricians have ethical and professional obligations to assist in these judicial processes; it offers recommendations on advocacy, education, research, qualifications, standards, and ethical business practices aimed at improving expert testimony. The policy history is outlined: AAP first articulated policy in 1989, was revised in 1994, a 2002 revision outlined responsible practices for preparing and presenting expert witness testimony, and a 2009 iteration expanded requirements and qualifications for experts testifying in civil and criminal cases primarily relating to alleged child abuse and/or neglect; this policy statement replaces the previous policy statement, bolsters requirements, and provides new guidance on ways to prevent irresponsible testimony in medical liability proceedings as well as in child abuse cases. The scope applies to medical expert witness consultation or testimony in legal venues including pretrial consultations, civil suits, criminal legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings. The policy statement was reaffirmed June 2024.

### Flipping the conditional: why we are probably wrong about probabilities [^bcf020da]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Diagnostic Dilemmas

The term prosecutor's fallacy is used when referring to evidence presented at court, typically criminal trials. However, we are prone to committing exactly the same logical error when we misinterpret diagnostic tests. Consider the example provided in inference. In many medical laboratories, the initial test for HIT is an immunoassay for antibodies to platelet factor 4. The sensitivity of the standard immunoassay is around 0.90 (90%). If the test is positive, we might (falsely) assume there is a 90% chance the patient has HIT. In fact, in a low‐risk hospitalized patient, with a pre‐test probability of HIT of 0.01 (1%), the chance that the patient actually has HIT when the immunoassay test is positive is only 1.5%.

The sensitivity of a test is the probability of testing positive test when the disease is present, which we can write as. However, we are interested in the inverse conditional probability, the probability the patient has HIT given the test is positive.is the positive predictive value (PPV).

In the case of HIT, the standard immunoassay is not particularly good (sensitivity 0.9 (90%), specificity 0.4 (40%)) and the disease is not particularly rare in hospitalized patients. However, when the prevalence of the disease is very low, even an excellent diagnostic test yields a low PPV.

In his book the Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives, Leonard Mlodinow recounts an alarming encounter with his physician in 1989. The physician explained that Mlodinow had tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and consequently had a 999 out of a 1000 chance of being dead within 10 years. Mlodinow had been obliged to take an HIV test to obtain life insurance. His doctor knew the sensitivity and specificity of the test (both 0.999) and calculated the false positive rate (1 minus the specificity) as 1 in 1000. His physician then erroneously estimated the risk of HIV infection as being 999 in 1000, which in 1989 was equivalent to a 99.9% chance of dying within a few years.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ff1d231e]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

One implication of these findings is that, even after 30 years of development, the view that violence, sexual, or criminal risk can be predicted in most cases is not evidence based. This message is important for the general public, media, and some administrations who may have unrealistic expectations of risk prediction for clinicians. This expectation is not as high in other medical specialties, in which the expectation that the doctor will identify the individual patient who will have an adverse event is not a primary issue whereas psychiatry, in many countries such as the UK, has developed a culture of inquiries.

A second and related implication is that these tools are not sufficient on their own for the purposes of risk assessment. In some criminal justice systems, expert testimony commonly use scores from these instruments in a simplistic way to estimate an individual's risk of serious repeat offending. However, our review suggests that risk assessment tools in their current form can only be used to roughly classify individuals at the group level, and not to safely determine criminal prognosis in an individual case. This approach is mostly used in forensic psychiatry in the UK and other western countries, where they form part of a wider clinical assessment process. These instruments may also assist in developing risk management plans in selected high risk groups, as suggested by recent clinical guidelines in England and Wales. Furthermore, they are preferable to unstructured clinical judgment owing to their increased transparency and reliability.

Another implication is that actuarial instruments focusing on historical risk factors perform no better than tools based on clinical judgment, a finding contrary to some previous reviews. Finally, our review suggests that these instruments should be used differently. Since they had higher negative predictive values, one potential approach would be to use them to screen out low risk individuals. Researchers and policy makers could use the number safely discharged to determine the potential screening use of any particular tool, although its use could be limited for clinicians depending on the immediate and service consequences of false positives. A further caveat is that specificities were not high — therefore, although the decision maker can be confident that a person is truly low risk if screened out, when someone fails to be screened out as low risk, doctors cannot be certain that this person is not low risk. In other words, many individuals assessed as being at moderate or high risk could be, in fact, low risk. Ultimately, however, what constitutes an appropriate balance between the ethical implications of detaining people based on the predictive ability of these tools and the need for public protection will primarily be a political consideration.

### An integrated theory of false insights and beliefs under psychedelics [^a70235af]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychedelics are recognised for their potential to re-orient beliefs. We propose a model of how psychedelics can, in some cases, lead to false insights and thus false beliefs. We first review experimental work on laboratory-based false insights and false memories. We then connect this to insights and belief formation under psychedelics using the active inference framework. We propose that subjective and brain-based alterations caused by psychedelics increases the quantity and subjective intensity of insights and thence beliefs, including false ones. We offer directions for future research in minimising the risk of false and potentially harmful beliefs arising from psychedelics. Ultimately, knowing how psychedelics may facilitate false insights and beliefs is crucial if we are to optimally leverage their therapeutic potential.

### A critique of the false-positive report probability [^0ef34eb3]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The false positive report probability (FPRP) was proposed as a Bayesian prophylactic against false reports of significant associations. Unfortunately, the derivation of the FPRP is unsound. A heuristic derivation fails to make its point, and a formal derivation reveals a probabilistic misrepresentation of an observation. As a result, the FPRP can yield serious inferential errors. In particular, the FPRP can use an observation that is many times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative to infer that the null hypothesis is far less probable than the alternative. Contrary to its intended purpose, the FPRP can promote false positive results. It should not be used. A modified FPRP is derived, but it appears to have limited application and does not address the problem of false reports of significant associations. The conditional error probability is a possible replacement for the FPRP.

### Placing symptoms in context: the role of contextual criteria in reducing false positives in diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders diagnoses [^f2dd0f47]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) definition of mental disorder requires that symptoms be caused by a dysfunction in the individual; when dysfunction is absent, symptoms represent normal-range distress or eccentricity and, if diagnosed as a mental disorder, are false positives. We hypothesized that because of psychiatry's lack of direct laboratory tests to distinguish dysfunction from normal-range distress, the context in which symptoms occur (eg, lack of imminent danger in a panic attack) is often essential to determining whether symptoms are caused by a dysfunction. If this is right, then the DSM diagnostic criteria should include many contextual criteria added to symptom syndromes to prevent dysfunction false positives. Despite their potential importance, such contextual criteria have not been previously reviewed. We, thus, systematically reviewed DSM categories to establish the extent of such uses of contextual criteria and created a typology of such uses.

Results

Of 111 sampled categories, 68 (61%) used context to prevent dysfunction false positives. Contextual criteria fell into 7 types: (1) exclusion of specific false-positive scenarios; (2) requiring that patients experience preconditions for normal responses (eg, requiring that individuals experience adequate sexual stimulation before being diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions); (3) requiring that symptoms be disproportionate relative to circumstances; (4) for childhood disorders, requiring that symptoms be developmentally inappropriate; (5) requiring that symptoms occur in multiple contexts; (6) requiring a substantial discrepancy between beliefs and reality; and (7) a residual category.

Conclusions

Most DSM categories include contextual criteria to eliminate false-positive diagnoses and increase validity of descriptive criteria. Future revisions should systematically evaluate each category's need for contextual criteria.

### Online legal driving behavior monitoring for self-driving vehicles [^d691d6f2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis was performed on key thresholds such asand. For, our goal is to find an optimal function that maximizes the weighted sum of the true positive (non-compliance and judged as non-compliance) number and true negative (compliance and judged as compliance) number, while ensuring a certain false-positive rate, as explained in Method Eqs. (21) and (22). The optimal cost and corresponding false-positive rate and false-negative rate results for different maximum allowable false-positive rates (0% to 30%) are shown in Fig. 7 b, and part of the optimal threshold lineare shown in Fig. 7 a. As the data points are closer to the lower-left corner, the corresponding lane-change maneuvers pose a higher risk. Consequently, to reduce false-negative outcomes under different false-positive tolerances, the threshold line was gradually shifted toward the upper-right corner. It is evident that as the false-positive requirements become more relaxed, the false-negative rate decreases, and the result exhibits a staircase pattern. The maximum cost is 1010.7 with a 24% false-positive rate and the numbers of false-positive and false-negative are 160 and 8. In the next step platform, the false-positive rate will become greater than the false-negative rate, which is not what we expect. Consequently, thethreshold line was selected according to a 24% false-positive rate, as shown in Eq. (1).

### Α-catenin switches between a slip and an asymmetric catch bond with F-actin to cooperatively regulate cell junction fluidity [^0f52b1b7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Data analysis

The analysis of the ultra-fast-force-clamp data was carried out by a custom MATLAB algorithm which detects catenin-actin interactions by identifying changes in the derivative of the position signal i.e. dumbbell velocity which drops to zero upon binding. Limits were imposed to ensure that false events were kept at a maximum of 1% of the total event number. Step detection was performed as in Gardini et al. with small modifications. Steps were detected from velocity changes due to proteins experiencing conformational changes or rapid detachment and reattachment to the filament. In this case, step length (> 5 ms) and absolute amplitude (> 5 nm) thresholds were set to limit detection of false steps due to thermal fluctuations, while step amplitude sign switch was allowed to account for both forward and backward steps. In order to distinguish if the steps were within an interaction or belonged to new interactions, maximum time interval (< 10 ms) and step size (< 75 nm) were set. The average stiffness of the molecule (or molecules) bound to the actin filament during the interactions was evaluated from the position varianceduring the bound events as, whereis the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. Here, we assume that (i) the dumbbell is rigid and (ii) the force applied on the trapped beads is constant, i.e. the stiffness of the traps is negligible under force-clamp. The stiffness of the molecules was evaluated as the average stiffness from the experiments reported in Figs. 1–3 in the range 7–16 pN force and separately computed for the single α-catenin homodimer, the single α-β-catenin heterodimer, and multiple α-β-catenin heterodimers. We expect that the approximation of rigid dumbbell leads to underestimate the α-catenin molecules stiffness, mostly because of the compliance of the links between actin and beads. However, since we previously measured the stiffness of the links between biotinylated actin and neutravidinated beads to range between 2 and 6 pN/nm under similar actin pretensioning, we evaluate the stiffness underestimation to be below 20%.

### Introspective inference counteracts perceptual distortion [^7cfe5523]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Successfully navigating the modern world requires questioning the validity of sensory information — testing whether it conforms to reality rather than simply taking it at face value. In other words, one cannot always believe what one sees. This is apparent in considering "deepfakes", where objective sensory information is deliberately manufactured in such lifelike ways that viewers sometimes believe it is real. This is also the case for hallucinations, where internal distortions drive seemingly veridical percepts that are often falsely believed to be real. The corollary is that to avoid harboring false beliefs, and acting erroneously on their basis, the presence of potentially deceiving sensory information or experiences needs to be met with a healthy degree of skepticism in one's own senses. The ability to perform such "reality testing" — e.g. testing whether subjective, internal sensory experiences reflect actual states of the external world — is characteristically impaired in psychosis. Although perceptual distortions, including hallucinations, are common in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions as well as in some non-clinical groups, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are classically distinguished by an inability to question the reality of distorted percepts, a concept referred to as impaired insight. Put more simply, among the people who experience perceptual distortions, some can recognize them as such and others cannot. The latter case of impaired insight leads to false beliefs and can drive seemingly erratic behaviors, including poor treatment adherence. Alterations in reality testing also have important legal ramifications given their impact on determinations of criminal responsibility. Despite the broad societal implications of reality testing, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this ability are insufficiently understood.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^3afa0e2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Surveillance and Burden Estimation

Program performance will be overestimated in the presence of false-positive diagnosis, as treating patients with a false-positive diagnosis will have no impact on the TB epidemic. As highlighted by Table 1, reported notifications can easily be misleading as an indicator for the success of an expanded screening strategy — an increased number of notifications may simply represent a dramatic increase in the number of false-positive diagnoses.

In addition, those notified and initiating treatment are assumed to have been at risk of dying due to TB. If a substantial proportion of this cohort does not have TB disease (and instead has less serious conditions), observed mortality rates may be artificially low, leading to overestimates of treatment success both on country and global level.

Such unintentional misrepresentations can, when revealed through, for example, prevalence surveys, undermine faith from domestic and international funders of the national TB response.

These issues also affect burden estimation and reporting at the global level. Current TB estimation methods by WHO and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation do not consider false-positive diagnoses, and instead assume that all notified cases represent patients with a true-positive diagnosis. As a consequence, the inclusion of false-positive diagnoses artificially increases official incidence estimates and leads to an underestimation of the gap between incident cases and those notified for treatment.

### Cognitive errors: thinking clearly when it could be child maltreatment [^085b21d3]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Cognitive errors have been studied in a broad array of fields, including medicine. The more that is understood about how the human mind processes complex information, the more it becomes clear that certain situations are particularly susceptible to less than optimal outcomes because of these errors. This article explores how some of the known cognitive errors may influence the diagnosis of child abuse, resulting in both false-negative and false-positive diagnoses. Suggested remedies for these errors are offered.

### Accuracy prompts are a replicable and generalizable approach for reducing the spread of misinformation [^51ae95e0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Furthermore, the similar effect size for political versus COVID-19 headlines suggests that the accuracy prompt effects are operating through a process that is general across content types (such as inattention), rather than through a process that is specific to one type of news or the other. This logic also has implications for the effects of accuracy prompts on true headlines. In the experiments analyzed here, the true headlines were typically fairly ambiguous - see, for example, pre-test dataand accuracy-only conditionsin recent accuracy prompt studies, where only roughly 60% of true headlines were rated as accurate. Thus, although the accuracy prompts had no significant effect on these headlines, we would expect them to significantly increase sharing of more unambiguously true headlines (see item-analyses in Refs. –).

These findings highlight the importance of understanding the nature of the content used in studies on misinformation, as well as the characteristics of the individuals who are being targeted with the intervention. For an accuracy prompt to have an effect on sharing, the individual in question has to be able to recognize, to some extent, that the content in question is seemingly false (for them to decide not to share it) or true (for them to decide to share it). Thus, if a group of participants is targeted who have a very difficult time distinguishing between true and false content, or if misinformation is identified that the majority of a particular group of people believe to be true, then accuracy prompts will not improve sharing discernment. We suggest that studies investigating the efficacy of accuracy prompts take this consideration into account and include a separate condition that explicitly measures the believability of the content that they are employing for individuals who are similar to those that are being tested.

### Poor lie detection related to an under-reliance on statistical cues and overreliance on own behaviour [^46428a1c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incidents of fraud have been escalating. In 2021, 2.8 million Americans lost a total sum of $5.8 billion to fraud — an increase of 70% from the previous year. Most are committed online and include investment fraud, romance scams, false billing and phishing scams. Unfortunately, humans are not great at detecting lies, whether online or offline –. As a consequence, scams lead to significant emotional and financial damage every year.

Why are humans so poor at detecting lies (and thus fraud)? Answering this question is crucial, as identifying the cues that lead to suboptimal lie detection can inform the development of tools to help people detect and avoid scams. Yet, we have no precise understanding of what people are doing wrong. Here, we test the hypothesis that poor lie detection is partially explained by suboptimalities in the cues people use when assessing lies. In particular, relying on uninformative cues and underweighting more informative ones.

To try and understand why people are poor at detecting lies, we first need to consider how people go about detecting lies. Although little is known regarding the first question, a vast literature has focused on the second question, most notably in offline contexts (i.e. in person) –. These studies show people attempt to infer clues from others' facial expressions, eye and body movementsand voice. Findings show these cues are generally not helpful, and even less so online (e.g. in relation to phishing e-mails, online chats, social media) where such cues typically are unavailable.

Suspicion, however, is not only driven by superficial cues such as facial expressions. 'Content cues' are crucial too. For example, people assess the likelihood that a communication is true, given prior knowledge on the topic. For instance, if a prospective date claims to be over 6'4", suspicion may arise, as only 5% or less of the population is of that height. When communication violates expectations due to statistical knowledge, a surprise signal will be triggered that may lead to suspicion. This mechanism is not to be confused with a distinct (but not mutually exclusive) proposal, according to which suspicion is generated based on the base rate of lies. That is, in societies and contexts where dishonesty is more prevalent, people may generally be more suspicious.

### Sense and sensitivity: can an inaccurate test be better than no test at all? [^59383263]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive value

The first dimension of a VDT's accuracy relates to how sensitive it is to the presence of the virus among infected individuals. A VDT is sensitive when it correctly identifies a high proportion of those who are actually infected with the virus. The more sensitive the test, the less likely it is to incorrectly deliver a false-negative result to an individual who is in fact infected.

False-negative results can have significant moral costs. If the VDT is used to confirm a diagnosis, then a false-negative result may contribute to a missed diagnosis and delay in treatment. Furthermore, individuals who believe that they are not infected (on the basis of a negative result) are less likely to engage in behaviours that will reduce viral transmission. If we assume that at least some individuals with false-negative results will be not only infected but also infectious, then low-sensitivity VDTs will likely increase the risk of viral transmission due to the false reassurance they provide.

A second dimension of a VDT's accuracy relates to how specific it is — this dimension assesses the test's true negative rate. A VDT is specific when it only identifies a small proportion of people as being infected when in fact, they are not. The more specific a test is, the less likely it is to deliver such false-positive results.

False-positive results also have moral costs. If the VDT is used to confirm a diagnosis, then a false-positive result may contribute to misdiagnosis. A false-positive result in hospital screening may also lead to the postponement or cancellation of an elective procedure, and at a societal level such results will lead to overestimations of the prevalence of the virus. It may also result in wasteful further investigation or treatment. Finally, given other public health restrictions, a false-positive test may result in individuals having to self-isolate despite not posing a high risk of transmission. VDTs with low specificity may thus lead to the unnecessary infringement of individual liberties.

### False conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^b1aa1042]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We also found evidence consistent with false conflict errors for high-performing physicians. A sub-analysis of the best-performing physicians reveals that their performance deteriorates with AI support. A sub-analysis of the 15 best-performing clinicians matched or exceeded AI accuracy (80.4%), with their initial accuracy averaging 87.3% but dipping to 77.1% once AI was introduced in phase 2 and 81.5% with XAI in phase 3, possibly due to errors from relying on AI when it falsely conflicted with their own correct diagnosis. Trust in AI is not, by definition, better since it increases false conflict errors for the best performers.

Finally, we found that AI, for the lowest-performing clinicians, helped stamp out true conflict errors. For the lowest-performing quartile of clinicians studied by Chanda and colleagues, accuracy improved from 50.3% to 66.6% and 65.9%, respectively, during the three phases of their study. In theory, if these low-performing physicians fully trusted AI, their accuracy could have risen at least to 80.4% by simply eliminating true conflict errors.

Recent studies are beginning to delve deeper into how physicians respond to conflicts with AI. The most common and discussed error occurs when physicians tend to override a correct AI diagnosis in cases of true conflict error. Previous studies found that this arises from distrust in the AI's "black box" logic –. In cases of false conflict errors, however, the physicians tended to express doubt and over-rely upon AI, especially when uncertain about their initial diagnosis. When explanations are added to the AI diagnoses (as XAI), it tends to mitigate true conflict errors but exacerbate false conflict errors. This phenomenon whereby even mere exposure to explanations can induce overreliance on AI has been documented in several studies –. Finally, false confirmation is perhaps the most pernicious; it reinforces trust in AI, while perpetuating clinical errors. These false confirmation errors remind us of the confirmation bias highlighted by Ghassemi and colleagues. This issue is likely present in the study conducted by Chanda and colleagues, though it was not explicitly addressed.

### Estimated incidence and factors associated with risk of elder mistreatment in New York state [^a23d71b8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In the absence of an adequate financial abuse measure at wave 1 validated for use with general population-based older adult samples, the NYSEMPS developed a 5-item financial abuse tool. The tool draws on existing measures, and items were developed using a 2-stage consensus process involving researchers in financial abuse and clinicians. The tool covers scenarios related to stolen or misappropriated money or property; coercion or false pretense resulting in surrendering rights, property, or signing or changing a legal document; impersonation to obtain property or services; and inadequate contributions toward household or basic expenses. The items were piloted in a small group of 10 individuals known to have experienced financial abuse; all pilot participants tested positive. Consistent with recommendations to maximize sensitivity in epidemiological interpersonal violence research, the CTS, Duke OARS, and financial abuse tools assessed EM subtypes with multiple contextually oriented, behaviorally defined items describing specific mistreatment events.

EM incidence was measured dichotomously as the absence vs presence of emotional, physical, sexual, or financial abuse or neglect. Across EM subtype measures, respondents were asked whether they had experienced specific mistreatment behaviors (items) since age 60 years. Affirmative responses initiated a follow-up appraisal question about the level of seriousness (not serious, somewhat serious, or very serious) attached to the mistreatment. Physical, sexual, and financial abuse cases were deemed positive if an item was affirmed regardless of perceived seriousness. In accordance with recent recommendations to enhance EM measurement specificity, emotional abuse cases were deemed positive if the spiteful behavior or insulting or swearing CTS items were rated as very serious or if the threat to hit or throw CTS item was affirmed with any level of seriousness. Similarly, neglect cases were assessed as positive if any of the Duke OARS ADL or IADL unmet needs were appraised by the respondent as somewhat or very serious. Consistent with accepted EM definitions, this study restricted elder abuse or neglect to scenarios occurring in relationships involving an expectation of trust.

### The false-negative phenotype [^5ea91ee5]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Ethical controversies may arise when genome sequencing reveals a genetic variant that is thought to be pathogenic, but the patient has no symptoms. This could be due to variable penetrance or expressivity. It could also result from a misclassification of the gene as pathogenic. In this article, I analyze 2 possibilities when such a situation occurs. The first is straightforward. We could conclude that the sequencing results should be considered a "false-positive" test result. The second is a bit more counterintuitive. In some cases, we could consider the test result to be a true-positive but in way that has not yet led to phenotypic findings. Somewhat playfully, we imagine that, in such cases, we could consider the patient's phenotype to be falsely negative. Sometimes, as odd as it seems, we act is if that is what we believe.

### Practice parameter for child and adolescent forensic evaluations [^23702ba0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Medium credibility.

Child and adolescent forensic evaluations — standards of proof and medical certainty — outline multiple levels of certainty, where the least exacting is "reasonable suspicion", civil cases hinge on "preponderance of the evidence" that can be "51% certain", psychiatric evidence may require "clear and convincing proof", and criminal cases require "beyond a reasonable doubt"; physicians are often asked for opinions with "a reasonable degree of medical certainty", which has been proposed as equivalent to what a physician uses when making a diagnosis and starting treatment, implying that the degree of certainty would depend on the clinical situation.

### Guidelines for psychological practice for people with low-income and economic marginalization: executive summary [^8954d743]. The American Psychologist (2021). High credibility.

Low-income and economic marginalization (LIEM) — idealization bias refers to portraying people who are poor as hard-working underdogs pursuing the American dream, which can misrepresent students from LIEM backgrounds and undermine needs; the bias rests on the false belief that people in poverty do not work hard and those who work hard are not impoverished, frames poverty as a choice that ignores systemic factors, and places expectations on poor people to work harder with an often false promise that effort will transcend economic conditions.

### Poor lie detection related to an under-reliance on statistical cues and overreliance on own behaviour [^7ba530ca]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Comprehension check questions

All participants were asked the following seven comprehension check questions after reading the instructions (correct answers are underlined):
In each trial, you and the other player are presented with an identical set of seven cards. True False
The computer picks one card for you and the other player at random. Which of the below statements is true? The computer picks the same card for you and the other player The computer picks a different card for you and the other player. The computer randomly picked a card for the other participant and randomly picks a card for you. Your card pick is therefore not necessarily the same as the other player's.
Let's say you reported a blue card and the other participant reported red: You win £0.01. The other player wins nothing. The other player wins. You win nothing. You win £0.01. The other player loses. The other player wins. You lose £0.01.
Let's say you and the other participant both reported a blue card. What happens? Each person loses Neither one wins or loses Each person wins
Let's say you reported a red card and the other participant reported blue: You win £0.01. The other player wins nothing. The other player wins. You win nothing. You win £0.01. The other player loses. The other player wins. You lose £0.01.
Let's say you and the other participant both reported a red card. What happens? Each person loses Neither one wins or loses Each person wins
Each trial, you will see another participant's report from a previous study. True False

All questions had to be answered correctly to be allowed to continue the study. Participants had to answer correctly at least at the second attempt. Participants were allowed to review the instructions after a first failed attempt. If they failed again, they were instructed to discontinue the study.

Statistical analyses

To investigate what determines participants' suspicion levels on a trial by trial basis, we used a Bayesian 'model averaging' procedure adapted from Freckleton (2011). We reverse-coded participants' honesty ratings to reflect suspicion ratings and transformed them to be of range 0–1. Then, we defined four cues in three categories that may be associated with suspicion:

### Monitoring, reporting and regulating medicine quality: tensions between theory and practice in tanzania [^450c7f01]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Investigating allegations and sanctioning misconduct

The next stage for a regulator is investigation and, where appropriate, sanctioning those involved in misconduct. Investigating allegations often entails inter-agency collaboration, and interviewees reported many examples of regulators working together to tackle a problem, sometimes involving police and other enforcement agencies. However, inter-agency working is not always straightforward: operational disagreements about the focus and execution of investigations, along with the ever-present risk that information will be leaked ahead of time about an imminent inspection, was often said to hinder the progression of cases.

Like whistleblowing, investigating allegations of irregular or illegal practice can carry personal risks for regulators. One local regulator recalled violent confrontations resulting from 'under-cover work', giving the example of a counterfeit labelling operation he had been investigating and noting that routine inspections could start peacefully but end violently. Another local regulator said bluntly, 'If you are not friendly to them [shopkeepers], you may find your life becoming shorter'. Often working on their own, or in very small teams, these concerns may make regulators more cautious about investigating non-compliance and enforcing regulations.

Ethical dilemmas can arise when carrying out inspections on the ground. In rural areas, where medicine outlets are scarce, there may be serious implications of closing down the only ADDO serving a large population: 'People need medicine. If you close the shop, it is not just the owner who will suffer, the whole village will suffer'. This regional regulator told us that, in such cases, they may decide to work with retailers to help them comply with regulations rather than acting punitively and cutting off access to essential medicines for a whole community: 'So, you don't close the shop; you counsel the man that he has to pay and follow the government regulations'. However, this is not always straightforward:

On the first day you counsel him then you have to become as if furious and close the door. He will tell the reality — I don't have money I will pay [the licensing fee] later but the next day he doesn't come and he doesn't come the day after that so after two weeks you go back again but if he doesn't pay that doesn't mean you close the shop.

### Deep learning for the detection of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules in non-screening chest CT scans [^179d31f7]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Visual assessment of false positives and false negatives

All false negatives (n A = 29, n B = 23) and a random selection of false positives (n A = 25, n B = 25) from the AI system at an operating point of 1 FP/s were visually assessed. The false negatives could be divided into seven categories and the false positives into fourteen categories, as outlined in Fig. 4. For the false negative categories, it is also shown how many nodules missed by the AI model were still detected by the radiologists from the panel for reference purposes. The three most frequent false negatives were juxtapleural nodules (n A = 17, n B = 11; defined as solid nodules located on or within 10 mm of the visceral pleura), juxtavascular nodules (n A = 5, n B = 2, defined as solid nodules that are attached to a vessel), and non-solid nodules (n A = 3, n B = 3). Regarding the false positives, the three most frequent false categories were fibrosis (n A = 2, n B = 4), duplicate nodule detections (n A = 2, n B = 3), and consolidations (n A = 2, n B = 1). Potentially missed solid nodules (n A = 7, n B = 7), perifissural nodules (n A = 2, n B = 3), and micronodules (n A = 1, n B = 4; defined as nodules smaller than 3 mm) were counted as false positives in accordance with our reference standard.

Fig. 4
Frequency distribution of the categories of the false negative and false positive detections of the AI system.

In the internal test set (hospital A), 29 false negative and 25 false positive detections were inspected. In the external test set (hospital B), 23 false negative and 25 false positive detections were inspected. The lowest, median, and highest sensitivity of the radiologists have been indicated for the false negative detections of the AI system.

### Self-enhanced false memory across the life span [^da4a1042]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The role of self in veridical memory has been extensively studied, but what is the role of self in false memory development across the life span? The current study examined the impact of self-reference on associative false memory in children, younger adults, and older adults, and further investigated possible mechanisms concerning how self-reference might affect false memory in different age groups.

Methods

Combining a self-reference manipulation with the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, children, younger adults, and older adults encoded DRM word lists as paired with their own name, another person's name, or a red square. Later their true and false recognition memory as well as recollection and familiarity were measured.

Results

A self-enhanced false memory effect was found in all age groups. That is, participants generated more false memories in the self-reference condition relative to the other-reference and neutral conditions. Furthermore, when examining its underlying memory mechanisms, we found that self-reference mainly increased false recollection in younger adults but facilitated familiarity of critical lures in older adults.

Discussion

Although self-reference increases false memory in both younger and older adults, the underlying mechanisms are different in that older adults have more self-relevant false familiarity while younger adults generate more self-relevant phantom recollection. The current study also has implications for eyewitness reports, suggesting that the self-relevance of memory may be one relevant factor to consider when evaluating potential risk factors of false memory.

### Stopping murder by medicine: introducing the model law on medicine crime [^391e3603]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The problem of criminally substandard and falsified medicines is the dark side of globalization and health. Rising wealth and open borders mean that more people than ever before can access medicines — an overwhelmingly good thing for public health — but wealth and open borders also attract organized criminals, who traffic falsified, substandard, or counterfeit medicines globally, leaving fraud, injury, and even death in their wake. As other articles in this special edition of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene relate, so far the salutary and criminal dimensions of the medicine trade appear inseparable — in some cases with deadly results.

But the relationship does not need to be Janus-faced as this. Today, much of the medicine crime problem exists because the laws themselves are unbalanced: the free trade laws that cause medicines to be globally traded are not matched by criminal laws to prosecute those who knowingly or negligently deal in bad quality medicines. To use a metaphor, free trade laws have opened numerous doors, but without adequate criminal laws, no guards are keeping watch at those doors. Insecurity and danger are the natural consequences of this halting, incomplete version of globalization.

Considering that medicine crime can kill, today's laws are unreasonably weak. For example, in France, possessing a falsified medicine without legitimate reason attracts at most a €75,000 fine and 3 years' imprisonment (and businesses, not able to be imprisoned, will only face fines). If that sounds too little, it far exceeds Norway, where imprisonment is at most 4 months. Worst of all, in the Netherlands, making a substandard medicine is not criminal at all, unless the offender does it twice in 2 years — the first violation is treated as just an administrative problem — and even then the imprisonment is at most 6 months. When supposedly advanced European countries have laws as feeble as this, naturally the poor countries, with less to invest in law enforcement systems, tend to do little or nothing at all.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^9bd19c3e]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Tests of assumptions

Standard meta-analytic pooling assumptions were met for diagnostic odds ratios and both sensitivity and specificity. Since there was a significant correlation between the sensitivities and specificities produced by the samples in each class of risk assessment tools, pooling assumptions for areas under the curve were not met. In addition, because the median base rate of offending within each class of tools varied considerably (violence 32.0%, interquartile range 22.2–46.6%; sexual 16.9%, 7.4–28.2%; criminal 28.4%, 20.7–46.0%), base rate dependent statistics were not pooled (such as the positive and negative predictive values and both the number needed to detain and the number safely discharged), and medians with interquartile ranges were calculated.

PGT-P risks — false assurance and pleiotropy are highlighted: the page states that false assurance arises because PRS are probabilistic and do not capture de novo events, monogenic variants, or environmental risk factors, and that overconfidence could mislead users into believing an embryo is not at risk; it further notes concern that pleiotropy could lead selection against a disease to inadvertently select for another trait, with suggestions that choosing for increased educational attainment may increase risk of bipolar disorder, while advocates counter that many genetically related diseases are positively correlated and selecting against one disease may reduce risk of many diseases.

### Characteristics of physicians excluded from US Medicare and state public insurance programs for fraud, health crimes, or unlawful prescribing of controlled substances [^348a8305]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. First, the cross-sectional study design limits causal inference. However, determining associations between physician characteristics and fraudulent behavior is an essential first step in identifying characteristics that may help to potentially associate which physicians are more or less likely to engage in fraudulent activities. Second, this study only focused on physicians who have been identified as fraudulent. These exclusions typically represent those who have committed egregious acts of fraud, health crime, or substance abuse; since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force has charged more than 4000 defendants who collectively have falsely billed the Medicare program more than $14 billion. The characteristics of those committing lesser acts of fraud may be different than those observed in this research. Third, we have limited data on practice- and patient-specific characteristics that may shed light on why certain physician characteristics were associated with higher exclusion rates. Fourth, we cannot rule out confounding factors owing to unmeasured variables.

### Does the rejection of wrongful life claims rely on a conceptual error? [^155a1a9b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

There are four major arguments raised against wrongful life claims: first, that it is impossible to establish harm in wrongful life claims; second, that wrongful life claims are illogical or incoherent; third, that life is inviolable and sacred no matter the quality; and fourth, that there are no rights and duties towards non-existent persons. In this paper, I will examine and evaluate critically the first two arguments. I will reject these objections against wrongful life claims and demonstrate that they rely on a conceptual error/mistake. In doing so, I will reject the logic of comparing existence with non-existence in wrongful life claims. Instead, I will maintain that recognition of the infant's cause of action and recognition of the infant's harmed condition need not imply any preference for non-existence over existence, and it need not to be so severe as to make life not worth living. I will conclude by briefly giving an account of what seems to me to be the right conception of what it is to be harmed.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^fbd489c8]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Avoid biased documentation — preferred terminology when recording assault reports: When documenting patient statements avoid using pejorative or biased words, such as claims or alleged, because documenting "the patient claims she was assaulted" gives the impression the patient may be either unreliable or is lying, and a health professional would never document "alleged chest pain" or "alleged pregnancy", yet "alleged assault" and "alleged rape" are commonly documented in ED medical records. Alleged gives the impression the history is unproven, and thus may be false; it is more accurate to document "reported assault" or "suspected assault". For potentially abused children, unless the health professional is an expert in physical child abuse (PCA), avoid statements such as "doubt child abuse".

### Nudges in a post-truth world [^3f148e8f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Many of these cues are quite commonsensical. Unsurprisingly, children are sensitive to evidence that the informant is reliable on other matters. Since there is often a correlation between being accurate on one subject matter and another, using cues for accuracy is a good heuristic. Use of this heuristic becomes more sensitive with age: younger children are reluctant to accept any testimony from someone who has been wrong in the past, whereas older children calibrate their trust in ways that are more sensitive to statistical accuracy. Children are also sensitive to evidence of the benevolence of informants, and reluctant to accept testimony from those with a track record of malevolence. This, too, is unsurprising. If sensitivity to the past accuracy of informants provides protection against being deceived by fools, sensitivity to the benevolence of informants provides protection against being duped by knaves who might exploit us for their own ends.

### Wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits in obstetrics and gynecology [^fbe3183f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Developments in preconception and prenatal technologies have led to undeniable advances in how health-care providers screen and treat patients. Despite these advances, at any point errors can occur leading to misdiagnosis or a missed diagnosis. In some instances, the missed information can lead to the birth of a child with health issues where short of the error, the decision to avoid conception or terminate the pregnancy might have been made. When these lapses unfold, there exists the potential for a wrongful birth or wrongful life lawsuit to ensue. While these 2 actions are based on the same set of events, they are distinct legal claims with varying degrees of judicial permissibility. Global legal acceptability of wrongful birth and life lawsuits tends to resemble patterns in the United States. Analyzing prior wrongful birth and wrongful life claims can reveal common trends in events leading to these types of lawsuits, as well as an understanding of their potential outcomes. A familiarity with wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits demonstrates how these cases are unique from other forms of prenatal or birth injury tort lawsuits and can provide insights to common shortcomings in clinical practice. Applying these lessons to clinical practice highlights key approaches towards limiting the risk of certain errors leading to wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits, with the goal of health-care providers offering high quality health care.

### Flipping the conditional: why we are probably wrong about probabilities [^cf7395b2]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

After overcoming his shock, Mlodinow, a theoretical physicist and mathematician, crunched some numbers. Using Centers for Disease Control data, he estimated the pre‐test (prior) probability of HIV infection for a person such as himself — a healthy, heterosexual, non‐intravenous drug‐using, white male, American in 1989 — was 1 in 10 000. Given a prevalence of 1 in 10 000, a true positive result might be expected once in every 10 000 tests, whereas a false positive result might be expected once in every 1000 tests. Thus, false positive results outnumbered true positive results 10 to 1. For these data, the PPV calculated using Bayes' theorem is approximately 0.09 (9%) (Supporting Information). Armed with the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, we can also calculate the PPV from a two‐by‐two table (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Two‐by‐two table showing the outcome from testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when the sensitivity and specificity of the test are both 0.999 (99.9%) and the disease prevalence is 1 in 10 000 (0.0001).

Had Mlodinow been at high risk for HIV, the PPV would have been much higher. For instance, for a pre‐test probability of 1 in 100 (1%), the PPV is around 0.9 (90%) and for a pre‐test probability of 1 in 10 (10%), the PPV is 0.99 (99%). These calculations highlight the importance of the baseline event rate on the post‐test (posterior) probability. When events are very rare, Bayes' theorem yields counterintuitive results.

### Performance of tumour microenvironment deconvolution methods in breast cancer using single-cell simulated bulk mixtures [^0a1602d7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

False positive and false negative predictions across deconvolution methods

In the context of deconvolution, false positive and false negative predictions can lead to severe mischaracterisation of cell compositions within the TME. False positives occur when a method predicts a cell type to be present, while it is absent in the mixture (< 0.1%), and zero false negatives occur when a method predicts a cell type to be absent (< 0.1%), while it is present (Fig. 4a). We used the 2000 cell mixtures (250 per patient) at 50% tumour purity and nine major cell types from the previous tumour purity experiment (Fig. 1b) to determine false positive and false negative prediction rates for each deconvolution method.

Fig. 4
The performance of the nine deconvolution methods assessed by false positive and false negative rates.

### Clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis, treatment, and management of children and adults with central auditory processing disorder [^4eb50e47]. AAA (2010). Medium credibility.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD — test performance concepts and evidence grading are defined, including that the false positive rate is 1 minus the specificity (e.g., 1 − 80% specificity = 20% false positive rate), test efficiency combines specificity and sensitivity as the overall number of true positives and true negatives divided by the total tested, validity reflects whether evidence and theory support intended test score interpretations, and reliability refers to the stability of a test score and is essential to validity. The guideline uses a numerical level-of-evidence scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the strongest level of support and 5 the weakest; although the model rates group studies as superior to individual case studies, case and retrospective studies (classified as level 3 or 4 evidence) can often provide appropriate evidence for an individual profile. Clinicians should take a pragmatic approach to evaluating evidence, and the guideline focuses on four areas: 1) patient history and selection criteria, 2) diagnosis, 3) intervention, and 4) professional issues, education, and training.

### Overconfidence as a cause of diagnostic error in medicine [^959f780f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The great majority of medical diagnoses are made using automatic, efficient cognitive processes, and these diagnoses are correct most of the time. This analytic review concerns the exceptions: the times when these cognitive processes fail and the final diagnosis is missed or wrong. We argue that physicians in general underappreciate the likelihood that their diagnoses are wrong and that this tendency to overconfidence is related to both intrinsic and systemically reinforced factors. We present a comprehensive review of the available literature and current thinking related to these issues. The review covers the incidence and impact of diagnostic error, data on physician overconfidence as a contributing cause of errors, strategies to improve the accuracy of diagnostic decision making, and recommendations for future research.

### "Felony assault should stick: " assaulted EMS responders' frustration and dissatisfaction with the legal system [^406354e9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

4 FACTORS THAT LEAD TO A CHARGE

4.1 Prosecutorial merit

DAs identified numerous factors that contributed to an assault not being charged as a felony. Themes such as the point at which things "fall out" of the prosecutorial process, whether intent can be determined, and the victim's investment in the process, all contribute to whether a charge is filed and the severity of the charge. For example, the amount of evidence to give a case "prosecutorial merit" is considered:

… a significant number of them fall out at the preliminary hearing for the following reason: that municipal court judges are charged by the law with determining one legal question. Is there sufficient evidence to prove a crime was committed and [that] that's the person [who] committed it? And it's by a preponderance of the evidence — more likely than not. What we see is in cases where the crime is premised only on the protected status of the victim… I don't know about the paramedics, but I do know that teachers and the police officers — the municipal court judges don't follow the law the way it's written about protecting the people in the protected class. (DA #1 [emphasis added])

And I've heard them make comments in individual cases that would lead you to believe that their perception is, well, when you take a job like that, you should expect to get hit. Ludicrous. Ludicrous. But municipal court judges in Philadelphia have had this tradition, some more than others, and some in more cases than others, of not only making a legal determination, but they place a value on the case, and they say is this serious enough to go to the Court of Common Pleas for a felony trial". (DA #1 [emphasis added])

One DA described their discretion in interpreting whether an injury is serious enough to warrant a charge and that psychological injury to the victim is not considered at all or on a par with physical injury. The investigators discussed a previous paramedic assault case (prosecuted by the DA's office) in which a medic was hit in the eye socket resulting in a broken orbital bone:

### Poor lie detection related to an under-reliance on statistical cues and overreliance on own behaviour [^4392f13d]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Task procedure

Participants performed the task online through a Vue.js web application hosted via Google Firebase. After giving consent to participate in the study, participants were presented with the main task instructions and answered seven multiple choice comprehension check questions (see below). Next, they completed three practice trials and then proceeded to the cards task.

The task consisted of randomly sampled responses from actual past participants, divided over three blocks of 30 trials each. That is, each participant received a unique set of 90 trials, where every trial could contain a different past participant's response. This was to mimic online fraud scenarios in which individuals need to make veracity judgments in one-shot interactions with people they have never communicated with before. For Experiment 3, we only used two blocks, thus 60 trials in total. On each trial, the participant and the other participant (i.e. the past participant) were presented with a set of seven cards. The participant and the partner saw the same cards. Each card was either red or blue. Each trial consisted of at least one card of either colour. After 0.5 s, one of the displayed cards was randomly highlighted with a yellow border around the card for 1 s. This was the computer's random card pick for the participant. Given the actual random process, the computer could pick a different card to highlight for the participant and the other participant on a given trial. Participants were then asked to report the colour of the card that was picked for them, by clicking on a red or blue card.

### The effect of mental countermeasures on a novel brain-based feedback concealed information test [^2b42619b]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations in the present study. First, the scope of the study was only to examine whether fCIT retains its efficacy for the detection of concealed crime‐related information when mental countermeasures are used. Further studies are needed to determine whether the fCIT is resistant to mental countermeasures when used to detect concealed autobiographical information such as names or dates of birth (e.g. Sai et al.). Second, the present study only examined the effect of one mental countermeasure strategy on the fCIT. It is also necessary to examine whether the fCIT is resistant to other countermeasures, such as performing covert act in response to irrelevants (Rosenfeld et al.) Third, most of the participants in the present study were female. Future investigations should balance the gender distribution of participants and explore whether there is a gender effect on detecting the concealment of information. Fourth, this was the first study to examine the influence of mental countermeasures on the fCIT, representing the early exploration of a new field. More studies are needed to confirm the validity of these findings. Lastly, In real‐life situations, crimes are often committed under great stress and time constraints, whereby the perpetrator may not perceive or encode information related to the crime effectively (Ben‐Shakhar & Nahari; Meijer, Verschuere, Gamer, Merckelbach, & Ben‐Shakhar). Thus, further studies should test the efficiency of the fCIT in field scenarios.

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the use of mental countermeasures impairs the detection efficiency of the recognition‐P300, but has no significant impact on feedback‐related ERPs. The feedback P300 continued to discriminate guilty and innocent participants with AUCs well above chance. These findings indicate the potential of the fCIT to subvert mental countermeasure strategies used in the concealment of important information.

### Pseudohyponatremia revisited: a modern-day pitfall [^7dbcd77b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Factitiously low sodium estimations are a hazard in most modern clinical laboratories. Most modern high-throughput analyzers use indirect ion-selective electrodes to estimate electrolyte concentrations in serum samples. This analysis is preceded by a dilution step of the sample. If the water concentration is altered by the presence of increased lipid or protein, the dilution step and the subsequent calculation of concentration by the analyzer results in a falsely low sodium value. This places patients at risk, particularly if the factitious result is acted upon by the physician. In this short review, we highlight this problem and review the methodology and situations where this artifact can occur and discuss strategies to circumvent this problem.

Medication monitoring and regulation noncompliance — Drug policy monitoring for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) medications is through urine sampling for the detection of β2-agonists or glucocorticoids, and the timing and frequency of testing varies by athletic organization and is often random and multiple times throughout the year. As an example, Toronto Maple Leafs forward Carter Ashton was suspended 20 games without pay, amounting to $169,185, for violating the National Hockey League's drug policy after using a friend's inhaler during an asthma attack. Typically, first-time offenders receive a suspension from training and/or competition and/or a monetary fine, and further offenses can result in indefinite suspension from the professional sport organization.

### Benchmarking integration of single-cell differential expression [^7b6fbc06]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Control of false positives and false discoveries

Kim and colleaguesconducted a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq data for LUAD with over 200 K cells containing various cell types. We used the data for normal epithelial cells in the seven patients with LUAD (stage I) to compare false-positives and false discoveries between DE workflows. The data for each patient were randomly split into two groups with several different ratios (2:8, 3:7, 4:6, and 5:5), and DE analysis was performed with no DE genes included. We repeated this experiment four times, and the numbers of genes with p -value < 0.05 (false-positive) and q -value < 0.05 (false discovery) were compared (Fig. 5a). edgeR_wFisher exhibited the worst false positive controls. edgeR and edgeR_DetRate also showed relatively poor controls of false positives and false discoveries, whereas ZW_edgeR improved the results. The poor false positive control of bulk RNA-seq tools in scRNA-seq DE analysis was also observed in the previous benchmark study for a single batch. Two workflows that used BEC data (scGen_Wilcox and scGen_limmatrend) also exhibited poor false positive control. Other methods showed a reasonable control of false positives and false discoveries.

### Sex offender risk assessment and management [^86bebd17]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Sexual violence is common and can have profound effects on victims compared with other forms of violence. This violence includes unwelcome and forced sexual contact on adults or children. Assessment of individuals who perpetrate sexual violence starts with a comprehensive biopsychosocial evaluation after a finding of guilt. Clinicians should then evaluate risk. Based on this assessment, a risk management plan should be developed, directed at the specific risk of the offender. Management options include external control (eg, incarceration, probation), psychotherapeutic interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and treatment of comorbidity. This organized approach aids in reducing the risk of future sexual violence.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^304b1b52]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric expert witness testimony and bias — A study of neurologic birth injury litigation found that the majority of expert testimony in this controversial area is provided by a group of less than 100 physicians who served in nearly 90% of the sampled trials and consistently for the same side. It seems that a small cadre of physicians provide a disproportionate percentage of expert testimony in cases and that there may be suboptimal expertise and possible bias in testimony. Given the significant outcomes of civil and criminal proceedings in child maltreatment cases, it is important to remain especially vigilant of any emotional bias in the assessment of child maltreatment cases. Secondary to bias and other factors, experts have proffered various unproven theories as valid scientific diagnoses in child maltreatment cases, especially in abusive head trauma cases. When testifying, experts should refrain from "taking one side or the other", and avoid espousing hypotheses that are unsupported by strong, evidence-based medical literature, and the ethics of responsible expert testimony require pediatricians to be objective assessors and conveyers of medical information.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^979c6217]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), ES 2025 guidelines recommend to repeat the test if the patient's initial screen is positive but they are receiving medications such as β-blockers and centrally acting α-2 agonists (clonidine and α-methyldopa) that can lower renin and cause false-positive results. Withdraw these medications for 2 weeks if it is safe and feasible. Consider potential false positives induced by β-blockers when aldosterone is 10–15 ng/dL (277–416 pmol/L) by immunoassay or 7.5–10 ng/dL (208–277 pmol/L) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^ef0ee76b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensation for expert testimony — Appropriate compensation is described as being commensurate with the expertise, time, and effort required for preparing and providing responsible testimony, and written expert witness agreements often include a fee schedule for depositions and in-court testimony, a cancellation policy, out-of-pocket expenses (eg, travel costs, car rental, hotel, food, parking, etc), research, printing, postage and express packages, preparation time, the retaining counsel's fee payment responsibility, and interest for overdue accounts. Guidance notes that asking for excessive compensation may be considered unethical and states it is unethical to charge unreasonable rates or to exaggerate the time required to prepare expert testimony, and that it is also unethical for remuneration to be contingent on the outcome of the case. Common factors in valuing expert testimony include the amount earned if the pediatrician, pediatric medical subspecialist, or pediatric surgical specialist saw patients in the office or performed surgery that day, the difficulty in preparing the case, and the dearth of appropriate experts in a specific field.

### Diagnostic tests: how to estimate the positive predictive value [^7ea4931e]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2015). Low credibility.

When a patient receives a positive test result from a diagnostic test they assume they have the disease. However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations. The reasons for this miscalculation as well as three ways to calculate the PPV are reviewed here.

Table 1
Examples of probability calculations for coin tosses, based on Pascal's triangle

Impressively, even today, Blaise Pascal's simple triangle can accurately predict probabilities for the Baseball World Series. The World Series is played between two teams as "best out of 7" games. If the opposing team won the first game, there are six games remaining. Row 6 in the triangle depicts 64 (2 6) possible outcomes (1-6-15-20-15-6-1). The home team will have to win at least four games to secure the title, whereas the opposing team requires only three more victories. There are 22 (1 + 6 + 15) possibilities for the home team to clinch the title (22/64 or 34.4%), compared to 42 (20-15-6-1) options for the opposing team to win three or more games (42/64 or 65.6%). Thus, by carrying a copy of Pascal's antiquated triangle from 1653 in the pocket, a modern person of the twenty-first century can place a safe bet at the sports bar.

Analysis of OCT-AI failure cases

FPR and FNR are critical metrics for evaluating detection model performance. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a, b, we use a quantitative approach based on conditional false positive rate and conditional false negative rate to reveal inter-anomaly misclassification correlations. 1) Correlation of Conditional False Positive– Target False Negative: For all false-positive eyes of a certain conditional anomaly, calculate the false negative rate of other target anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Specifically, all false-positive cases for each anomaly were input to the model and estimated the false negative rate of other anomalies (e.g. Among all RD false-positive eyes, PVD false negative rate = 18.86%, ERM false negative rate = 15.2%). 2) Correlation of Conditional False Negative – Target False Positive: For all false-negative eyes of a certain conditional anomaly, calculate the false positive rate of other target anomalies (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Specifically, all false-negative cases for each anomaly were input to the model and estimated the false positive rate of other anomalies (e.g. Among all RD false-negative cases, PVD false positive rate = 32.02%, ERM false positive rate = 13.98%).

Analysis revealed that: 1) No false-negative anomalies were occurred in CE false-positive eyes, and the other false-positive anomalies exhibited consistent impact on CE false negative rate; 2) Among all False-Positive eyes, PVD had a large impact on the false negative rate of EZ (31.1%), and PED influenced the false negative rate of macular hole (MH) (30.0%); 3) In the false-negative case of each anomaly, no False Positive CE was observed; 4) In PED False-Negative case, false positive rates of SRF, HE, and CNV reached 74.5%, 64.7%, and 61.9% respectively. These findings indicated that CE exhibits minimal involvement with the misdiagnosis or missed detection of other anomalies, whereas the missed detection of PED serve as a major confounding factor contributing to false positives in the detection of other retinal anomalies.

Why is it important to learn about what people do in their job. Some occupations and industries carry a higher risk of hazards, injuries, or illnesses. Occupationrefers to a person's job or what they do on the job. A few examples are registered nurses, janitors, cashiers, and servers. Industryis the kind of business of the employer or what the employer does. A few examples are general hospitals, elementary schools, clothing manufacturing, and restaurants. Just as each occupation may have hazards, each industry may have different situations that could put an employee at risk for different work-related conditions. Work influences many aspects of life that affect health. These include income, workplace hazards, healthcare access, housing, and more. Knowing a person's occupation and industry can help understand their workplace exposures and work-related stressors.

The AI/AN workforce today Using the NIOSH Employed Labor Force Query System, we viewed data related to occupation and industry among AI/AN workers. ELF provides employed worker population estimates using data from a subset of the Current Population Survey public access data files. The U. S.

### Review of false-positive cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and recommendations for avoiding unnecessary treatment [^bbdff38b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

We reviewed reports of false-positive cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and here propose guidelines for detecting and managing patients with possible false-positive cultures. Mechanisms of false-positive cultures included contamination of clinical devices, clerical errors, and laboratory cross-contamination. False-positive cultures were identified in 13 (93%) of the 14 studies that evaluated ≥ 100 patients; the median false-positive rate was 3.1% (interquartile range, 2.2%-10.5%). Of the 236 patients with false-positive cultures reported in sufficient detail, 158 (67%) were treated, some of whom had toxicity from therapy, as well as unnecessary hospitalizations, tests, and contact investigations. Having a single positive culture was a sensitive but nonspecific criterion for detecting false-positive cultures. False-positive cultures for M. tuberculosis are not rare but are infrequently recognized by laboratory and clinical personnel. Laboratories and tuberculosis control programs should develop procedures to identify patients having only 1 positive culture. Such patients should be further evaluated for the possibility of a false-positive culture.

- reduced skin responsiveness because of prior UV light exposure (sun, tanning bed)

- concomitant immunosuppressive therapies

- methodological testing errors, such as insufficient occlusion, failure to perform delayed readings, and failure to perform photo patch testing.

### AI generates covertly racist decisions about people based on their dialect [^f0d539b3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Criminality analysis

The set-up of the criminality analysis is different from the previous experiments in that we did not compute aggregate association scores between certain tokens (such as trait adjectives) and AAE but instead asked the language models to make discrete decisions for each AAE and SAE text. More specifically, we simulated trials in which the language models were prompted to use AAE or SAE texts as evidence to make a judicial decision. We then aggregated the judicial decisions into summary statistics.

We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, the language models were asked to determine whether a person accused of committing an unspecified crime should be acquitted or convicted. The only evidence provided to the language models was a statement made by the defendant, which was an AAE or SAE text. In the second experiment, the language models were asked to determine whether a person who committed first-degree murder should be sentenced to life or death. Similarly to the first (general conviction) experiment, the only evidence provided to the language models was a statement made by the defendant, which was an AAE or SAE text. Note that the AAE and SAE texts were the same texts as in the other experiments and did not come from a judicial context. Rather than testing how well language models could perform the tasks of predicting acquittal or conviction and life penalty or death penalty (an application of AI that we do not support), we were interested to see to what extent the decisions of the language models, made in the absence of any real evidence, were impacted by dialect. Although providing the language models with extra evidence as well as the AAE and SAE texts would have made the experiments more similar to real trials, it would have confounded the effect that dialect has on its own (the key effect of interest), so we did not consider this alternative set-up here. We focused on convictions and death penalties specifically because these are the two areas of the criminal justice system for which racial disparities have been described in the most robust and indisputable way: African Americans represent about 12% of the adult population of the United States, but they represent 33% of inmatesand more than 41% of people on death row.

### Confirmation bias: why psychiatrists stick to wrong preliminary diagnoses [^e0c2bf73]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic errors can have tremendous consequences because they can result in a fatal chain of wrong decisions. Experts assume that physicians' desire to confirm a preliminary diagnosis while failing to seek contradictory evidence is an important reason for wrong diagnoses. This tendency is called 'confirmation bias'.

Method

To study whether psychiatrists and medical students are prone to confirmation bias and whether confirmation bias leads to poor diagnostic accuracy in psychiatry, we presented an experimental decision task to 75 psychiatrists and 75 medical students.

Results

A total of 13% of psychiatrists and 25% of students showed confirmation bias when searching for new information after having made a preliminary diagnosis. Participants conducting a confirmatory information search were significantly less likely to make the correct diagnosis compared to participants searching in a disconfirmatory or balanced way [multiple logistic regression: odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.53–21.22, p < 0.001; OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.23–8.56, p = 0.02]. Psychiatrists conducting a confirmatory search made a wrong diagnosis in 70% of the cases compared to 27% or 47% for a disconfirmatory or balanced information search (students: 63, 26 and 27%). Participants choosing the wrong diagnosis also prescribed different treatment options compared with participants choosing the correct diagnosis.

Conclusions

Confirmatory information search harbors the risk of wrong diagnostic decisions. Psychiatrists should be aware of confirmation bias and instructed in techniques to reduce bias.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^2154148d]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the predictive validity of tools commonly used to assess the risk of violence, sexual, and criminal behaviour.

Design Systematic review and tabular meta-analysis of replication studies following PRISMA guidelines.

Data sources PsycINFO, Embase, Medline, and United States Criminal Justice Reference Service Abstracts.

Review methods We included replication studies from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 2011 if they provided contingency data for the offending outcome that the tools were designed to predict. We calculated the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, the number needed to detain to prevent one offence, as well as a novel performance indicator — the number safely discharged. We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using metaregression and subgroup analyses.

Results Risk assessments were conducted on 73 samples comprising 24 847 participants from 13 countries, of whom 5879 (23.7%) offended over an average of 49.6 months. When used to predict violent offending, risk assessment tools produced low to moderate positive predictive values (median 41%, interquartile range 27–60%) and higher negative predictive values (91%, 81–95%), and a corresponding median number needed to detain of 2 (2–4) and number safely discharged of 10 (4–18). Instruments designed to predict violent offending performed better than those aimed at predicting sexual or general crime.

Conclusions Although risk assessment tools are widely used in clinical and criminal justice settings, their predictive accuracy varies depending on how they are used. They seem to identify low risk individuals with high levels of accuracy, but their use as sole determinants of detention, sentencing, and release is not supported by the current evidence. Further research is needed to examine their contribution to treatment and management.

Give people meaningful things to do — guidance states that in an emergency, recommended actions may be directed to victims, persons exposed, persons who may be exposed, bystanders, or the general public, and those who do not need to take immediate action may need substitute actions to avoid unintentionally slowing the response. It specifies that simple tasks will give people a sense of control, keep people motivated to stay tuned to what is happening, and prepare people to take action if and when they need to do so. It advises giving a range of actions based on level of concern — a minimum response, a maximum response, and a recommended middle response — described as "must do, should do, could do", with an example for making drinking water safe that includes "boil water for 2 minutes", and states "We recommend boiling water".
