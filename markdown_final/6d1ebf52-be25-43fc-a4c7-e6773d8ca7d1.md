## Question

when to order fecal calprotectin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to order fecal calprotectin, how to interpret the results, and how to act on them across diagnostic and monitoring scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance and assay variability. Next, I will examine specific thresholds and their trade-offs. After that, I need to map indications by scenario: suspected IBD, established IBD monitoring, and special populations. Finally, I should double-check limitations, false positives/negatives, and practical implementation details to ensure safe, guideline-concordant use.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because fecal calprotectin performance is highly dependent on how likely IBD is before testing. In primary care, chronic diarrhea lasting more than 4–6 weeks, abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, or rectal bleeding raise suspicion for IBD, whereas isolated bloating or constipation without alarm features favors functional disease; age under 40 years increases the likelihood of IBD, and in children the prevalence and baseline calprotectin levels differ, which can shift interpretation and thresholds [^114oH5gi] [^111apTMc] [^117S16Pg].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance so I don't overstate what calprotectin can do. Meta-analyses show pooled sensitivity around 0.81–0.88 and specificity around 0.80–0.87 for distinguishing IBD from noninflammatory causes at commonly used cutoffs, with the strongest evidence supporting a 50 μg/g threshold to optimize sensitivity; however, performance varies with pretest probability and assay, and no single cutoff perfectly separates organic from functional disease, so results must be interpreted in context [^114etv6H] [^111pbEFB] [^1142bLzg].

> I need to check assay variability and repeatability before recommending serial use. Different commercial assays are not interchangeable, and there is meaningful within-patient and within-stool variability; therefore, I should use the same assay over time, sample the first morning stool, avoid prolonged room-temperature storage, and repeat borderline or unexpected results rather than making a decision on a single value, especially in the 50–250 μg/g "grey zone" [^112i4Fr9] [^1125aDLn] [^111KS8ut].

> Hold on, I should verify the commonly used thresholds and their trade-offs. A cutoff of 50 μg/g maximizes sensitivity for ruling out IBD, 150 μg/g balances sensitivity and specificity for many clinical decisions, and 250 μg/g improves specificity but lowers sensitivity. In symptomatic remission, lower thresholds such as 50 μg/g may better indicate endoscopic improvement, whereas in moderate-to-severe symptoms, 150 μg/g is often sufficient to rule in active inflammation and guide treatment without immediate endoscopy [^111pbEFB] [^115vxZFw] [^115dKQZi].

> Let me consider the diagnostic pathway in suspected IBD. In patients with chronic diarrhea or compatible symptoms, ordering fecal calprotectin can reduce unnecessary colonoscopies substantially, but I should not delay urgent endoscopy when red flags are present. If calprotectin is normal, the negative predictive value is high enough that IBD is unlikely and observation is reasonable, whereas an elevated result should prompt expedited endoscopic evaluation and stool testing for pathogens before endoscopy to avoid misattribution [^114etv6H] [^112ff4KT] [^113DdxXE].

> Next, I should review established IBD monitoring. In symptomatic remission, a biomarker- and symptom-based strategy is preferred. Fecal calprotectin less than 150 μg/g with normal CRP makes active inflammation unlikely and can obviate routine endoscopy, while persistently elevated biomarkers warrant endoscopic confirmation before escalating therapy. In moderate-to-severe flares, fecal calprotectin greater than 150 μg/g or CRP greater than 5 mg/L supports active inflammation and can justify treatment adjustment without immediate endoscopy, though infection should be excluded first [^113Dhrdg] [^112MSTY4] [^113CB1Bo].

> But wait, what if symptoms are mild and biomarkers are discordant? I should double-check that neither a normal nor an elevated calprotectin alone reliably determines endoscopic activity in mild disease; in this scenario, endoscopic assessment is often the most informative next step, or alternatively, careful symptom tracking with repeat biomarkers in 3–6 months can be considered if the patient prefers to avoid immediate endoscopy [^117J27Db] [^112NVuTv].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In children, baseline calprotectin can be higher, especially under 6 years, so I should interpret results with age-appropriate caution. Nonetheless, marked elevations still strongly suggest IBD, and normal values are reassuring. In postoperative Crohn's disease, very low calprotectin thresholds such as 50 μg/g can help rule out recurrence in low-risk patients on prophylaxis, but in higher-risk settings, endoscopic evaluation remains important. In acute infectious diarrhea, calprotectin is often elevated and cannot distinguish infection from IBD, so it should not be used for etiologic diagnosis in that acute setting [^117S16Pg] [^1157yAJM] [^113DdxXE].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and potential false results so I don't overinterpret a single number. Gastrointestinal infections, NSAIDs, diverticular disease, and some medications can raise calprotectin, and microscopic colitis is a notable exception where calprotectin is often normal despite active disease. Therefore, I need to correlate with symptoms, exclude infection when appropriate, and remember that a normal calprotectin does not absolutely exclude IBD, particularly with patchy or upper GI disease or when sampling is suboptimal [^116qgtRd] [^117S16Pg].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. I should order fecal calprotectin when chronic diarrhea or compatible symptoms persist beyond 4–6 weeks, when differentiating IBD from IBS in the absence of red flags, or when monitoring known IBD where it has previously correlated with endoscopic activity. I should avoid ordering it for acute self-limited diarrhea, as a routine screen in clearly functional presentations, or when red flags mandate direct endoscopy. If the result is elevated, I should confirm with endoscopy when management would change, and if the result is normal but suspicion remains high, I should repeat the test or proceed to endoscopy rather than prematurely closing the case [^111pbEFB] [^117RaWQi] [^113DdxXE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a calprotectin above 250 μg/g "rules in" IBD with high certainty; I should correct that. While higher cutoffs improve specificity, they still carry false positives, and guidelines emphasize that biomarkers inform but do not replace endoscopic assessment when the downstream consequences of misclassification are significant, so I need to ensure that treatment decisions based on elevated calprotectin are balanced against the risk of overtreatment and the patient's preferences [^115dKQZi] [^113SZrXf] [^112i4Fr9].

> Finally, I need to ensure implementation details are consistent. I will specify the same laboratory and assay for serial testing, instruct patients to collect the first morning stool, minimize room-temperature storage, and repeat unexpected or borderline results. If I plan to rely on calprotectin for longitudinal monitoring, I will document its correlation with endoscopic activity early in care to build confidence that future biomarker changes reflect true disease activity rather than assay noise [^1125aDLn] [^111KS8ut] [^112i4Fr9].

Order fecal calprotectin for patients with **chronic diarrhea** (≥ 4 weeks) [^112Td3Ns] or persistent abdominal pain to distinguish IBD from IBS [^117RaWQi], and in those with **suspected IBD** where it reduces unnecessary endoscopies [^112ff4KT]. Use it to **monitor IBD activity** [^115vxZFw], assess treatment response [^111AE3ce], and detect relapse [^116dsxvg]; a level < 50 μg/g suggests remission, while > 150–250 μg/g indicates active inflammation [^115vxZFw] [^114JEFMi]. Do not use for acute diarrhea [^113DdxXE] or to exclude microscopic colitis [^116qgtRd], and interpret results with clinical context, as infections, NSAIDs, and assay variability can elevate levels [^111HCtpu] [^112GBgCb] [^111KS8ut].

## Clinical indications for fecal calprotectin testing

### Diagnostic indications

- **Chronic diarrhea**: Persistent diarrhea ≥ 4 weeks [^111apTMc] to differentiate IBD from IBS [^113w4vLd].
- **Suspected IBD**: Abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, or rectal bleeding [^111apTMc] to screen for IBD and reduce unnecessary endoscopies [^114etv6H].
- **Differentiation of IBD from IBS**: FC is elevated in IBD but typically normal in IBS [^1132s7HV] [^113w4vLd].

---

### Monitoring and management of established IBD

- **Disease activity monitoring**: Track inflammation and guide therapy adjustments [^115vxZFw] [^114JEFMi].
- **Treatment response assessment**: Evaluate response to medical therapy [^111AE3ce] and detect relapse [^116dsxvg].
- **Postoperative monitoring**: Detect recurrence after surgery, especially in Crohn's disease [^1157yAJM] [^1141pXBz].

---

## Clinical scenarios where fecal calprotectin is not recommended

- **Acute infectious diarrhea**: FC is nonspecific and can be elevated in infections; not recommended for acute diarrhea [^113DdxXE].
- **Microscopic colitis**: FC is typically normal and not useful for diagnosis or monitoring [^116qgtRd].
- **Routine screening in asymptomatic individuals**: Not recommended for routine screening without symptoms suggestive of IBD.

---

## Interpretation of fecal calprotectin results

| **Calprotectin level (μg/g)** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| < 50 | Remission or inactive disease | Reassure; routine follow-up |
| 50–150 | Mild inflammation or gray zone | Repeat testing; consider clinical context |
| 150–250 | Moderate inflammation | Refer for endoscopic evaluation |
| > 250 | Severe inflammation | Urgent endoscopy; initiate or adjust therapy |

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Assay variability**: Different assays yield varying results; use the same assay for serial monitoring [^1133XbqD] [^115WnMbE].
- **Non-specific elevation**: Infections, NSAIDs, and other inflammatory conditions can elevate FC [^111HCtpu] [^11764znS].
- **False negatives**: Upper GI or small bowel disease may have normal FC [^117S16Pg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Order fecal calprotectin for chronic diarrhea, suspected IBD, and monitoring established IBD; **avoid in acute infectious diarrhea** and microscopic colitis. Interpret results in clinical context, recognizing assay variability and confounders.

AGA guideline — biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring in ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests the use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over a symptom-based monitoring strategy. For patients in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and/or normal C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP to inform treatment decisions and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. However, in patients in symptomatic remission but with elevated biomarkers, and in patients with moderate to severe symptoms with normal biomarkers, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease to inform treatment decisions. In patients with UC with mild symptoms, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity to inform treatment decisions.

Ulcerative colitis biomarkers — Fecal calprotectin (FC) assay variability and test consistency: FC measurements demonstrate notable intra- and inter-sample variability, with one study reporting 8%–9% variation at lower FC levels compared with 18%–33% at higher levels, and other studies reporting 13% to 114% differences between stool samples from the same patient and 9% to 31% variation across regions of a single stool sample; therefore, fecal calprotectin assays may not be interchangeable and the same assay should be used for serial comparisons, and if results are borderline or unexpected, repeat FC testing or endoscopic evaluation may be required to confirm interpretation.

Mild symptomatic ulcerative colitis with normal biomarkers — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment. In patients with UC with mild symptoms and normal biomarkers of inflammation who prefer to avoid endoscopic assessment or empiric treatment escalation, repeat measurement of biomarkers (in 3–6 mo) may be a reasonable alternative.

Rationale and practical use of biomarkers in CD: The panel noted that patients and providers "should incorporate both test performance and the downstream consequence of FP and FN rates", and "there may be instances when patients and providers may be willing to accept higher (> 5%) FN rates". For implementation, "the guideline panel preferred choosing a single fecal calprotectin cutoff (< 150 μg/g) that is applicable to multiple scenarios", while acknowledging acceptable alternatives such as "cutoff of fecal calprotectin < 250 μg/g in asymptomatic patients with known endoscopic remission". In small bowel–dominant CD, "lower fecal calprotectin thresholds, such as < 150 μg/g or < 50 μg/g, may yield lower FN rates". Evidence for serial use was limited, and "in asymptomatic patients with elevated biomarkers… the panel recommended endoscopic assessment before treatment adjustment to minimize likelihood of overtreatment", though "it may be reasonable… to consider serial monitoring of biomarkers". The panel also stated that "the sensitivity of fecal calprotectin was greater when compared with CRP", while "CRP may be more readily measured and integrated into routine clinical practice".

Fecal calprotectin — certainty of evidence for ruling out or in endoscopic inflammation: In low pretest probability settings, there was low certainty of evidence supporting cutoffs of < 50 µg/g and < 150 µg/g to rule out moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, and very low certainty for < 250 µg/g. In intermediate pretest probability settings, there was very low certainty for using fecal calprotectin to rule out due to unacceptably high false negatives, with the point estimate crossing the false negative (FN) threshold of 5%, and very low certainty for using elevated fecal calprotectin to rule in because of unacceptably high false positives (FP) and inconsistency.

Fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults with chronic diarrhea is addressed as follows: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests the use of either fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin to screen for IBD (Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence). A threshold value of 50 μg/g for fecal calprotectin is recommended to optimize sensitivity for IBD, and threshold values in the range of 4.0–7.25 μg/g for fecal lactoferrin are recommended to optimize sensitivity. For fecal calprotectin using a threshold of 50 μg/g, the pooled sensitivity for IBD was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–0.86) and the pooled specificity was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.92).

5.5.2 Collection of faecal calprotectin samples

There remain practical issues around the use of faecal calprotectin. These include variability between different assays, variability in levels in different stool samples from one patient during 1 day, lack of stability for samples kept at room temperature for more than a few days, and variation in calprotectin levels related to the interval between stools being passed. It is therefore recommended that the first stool passed in the morning is routinely used for sampling, and that this is stored for no more than 3 days at room temperature before analysis.

### Fecal calprotectin: current and future perspectives for inflammatory bowel disease treatment [^116wEt1J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin has been widely studied in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) under clinical and therapeutic settings. It showed a good correlation with clinical, endoscopic, and histologic findings. For these reasons, fecal calprotectin is currently one of the most useful tools in IBD care, both in diagnosis and in clinical management. The development of biologic drugs allowed a deeper control of disease, which sometimes reaches histological healing; this is associated with a reduced risk of relapses and complications. The management of IBD treatment is currently carried out with a treat-to-target approach, and mucosal healing is considered at present to be the optimal therapeutic target, but the future is going through histologic remission. Fecal calprotectin is probably the best marker of mucosal healing, but it is correlated also with histologic remission: moreover, it has been recently studied as a possible therapeutic target in the CALM study. We carried out a comprehensive literature review in order to evaluate the role of fecal calprotectin at present and in the future in the management of IBD therapies.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115dKQZi]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin — diagnostic performance and pretest probability: The evidence synthesis examined 3 diagnostic cutoffs most frequently studied and used in clinical practice (50 μg/g, 150 μg/g, and 250 μg/g), with pooled sensitivity/specificity of 78% (95% CI, 66%–86%) and 57% (95% CI, 40%–72%) for 50 ± 50 μg/g, 71% (95% CI, 62%–75%) and 69% (95% CI, 62%–75%) for 150 ± 50 μg/g, and 67% (95% CI, 53%–78%) and 73% (95% CI, 65%–80%) for 250 ± 50 μg/g. In a low pretest probability scenario (15% prevalence), approximately 3.3%, 4.3%, and 5.5% patients (FN rate) with fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, and < 250 μg/g, respectively, may be misclassified as having endoscopic improvement, whereas elevated values > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, and > 250 μg/g had significantly high rates of being FP (36.6%, 26.4%, and 23%, respectively). In an intermediate pretest probability scenario (50% prevalence), approximately 11%, 14.5%, and 18.5% patients (FN rate) with fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, and < 250 μg/g, respectively, may be misclassified, and elevated values > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, and > 250 μg/g had significantly high FP rates (21.5%, 15.5%, and 13.5%, respectively).

### What calprotectin cut-offs should apply for IBD in general practice? [^113mtvEK]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

It has been shown that much of the cost attributed to IBS arises from the time and resources used to establish the diagnosis and to rule out inflammatory conditions; 50%–75% of the overall costs attributable to IBS arise from the use of invasive endoscopic procedures. Like others, we argue that use of the FC test, at the manufacturer's recommended cut-off of 50 µg/g, is clinically useful and cost-effective, with little risk of an error that would pose serious risks. Indeed, previous work has shown that the routine use of calprotectin to exclude inflammatory changes results in substantial economic savings.

In summary, while we applaud the work of Dhaliwal et al, in confirming the value of FC in the clinical setting where IBD and IBS are the primary concerns, we caution that greater insight is required in the interpretation of such studies, particularly with regard to establishment of the target condition against which test performance characteristics are measured. We also reiterate that FC has high clinical utility in general practice settings to exclude IBD or other inflammatory conditions of the colon, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for this indication, and is also recommended by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and several gastrointestinal (GI) specialty societies for this purpose.

### Utility of faecal calprotectin in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): what cut-offs should we apply? [^1162U6oj]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

A recent systematic reviewand meta-analysishave confirmed the utility of FC as a screening tool to identify patients with gut inflammation. Interestingly in the meta-analysis only 30% of adults had confirmatory endoscopic or histological data to confirm inflammation. Our results demonstrate the utility of FC to distinguish non-organic (IBS) from organic (IBD) disease and provide insight into optimal cut-offs to determine when IBD is in remission.

Applying a cut-off level of 50 μg/g demonstrates acceptable sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between IBS and IBD. This does improve further when a cut-off of 100 μg/g is applied. The systemic review by Waugh et al which informed the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence diagnostics assessment groupsuggests most of the evidence is based on a 50 μg/g cut-off which enables reduction in the number of false negatives and is cost-effective.

Previous smaller studies have shown that FC concentrations correlate with endoscopic findings. Thus, the ability to quantify FC with different severity levels of inflammation enables monitoring using FC to determine treatment response or failure in subjects with active disease who are initiated on new therapy. This may ultimately reduce the need for repeated endoscopic assessments in active colitis. Damms and Bischoff, in 18 patients, have shown that the mean FC level in those with active IBD was 797. Mdel et al, in 25 patients with IBD, suggested a cut-off of 217 μg/g to determine remission of IBD. In this study of 148 individuals, we have shown the optimal cut-off to be 250 μg/g with 90% sensitivity and an AUROC of 0.93. FC levels for those with active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were also broadly similar.

Ulcerative colitis — fecal calprotectin (FCP) cutoffs and misclassification by pretest probability indicate that in an intermediate pretest probability scenario, approximately 21.5%, 15.5%, and 13.5% of patients with fecal calprotectin > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, and > 250 μg/g, respectively, may be misclassified as having moderate to severe endoscopic activity (FP rate), while in a high pretest probability scenario, fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, and < 250 μg/g had FN rates of 11.0%, 14.5%, and 18.5%, respectively; certainty statements report low certainty of evidence supporting the use of fecal calprotectin cutoffs of > 150 μg/g and > 250 μg/g to rule in moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation in a high pretest probability setting, very low certainty for > 50 μg/g in that setting, very low certainty to use any proposed cutoff to rule in at intermediate pretest probability, and very low certainty to use normal fecal calprotectin to rule out at high or intermediate due to unacceptably high FN and inconsistency.

### What is the faecal calprotectin test? [^111A1HPZ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is a protein released by white blood cells involved in inflammation of the bowel.1 It can be detected in faeces using laboratory or point of care tests. Although an elevated calprotectin level indicates inflammation in the bowel, it cannot identify the cause.1 Faecal calprotectin testing is mainly used in distinguishing between 'functional' disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and 'organic' disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, a group of conditions including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that require referral to specialist services. Here we explain the role of faecal calprotectin testing in adults in primary care.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112MSTY4]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Recommendation 2 — In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in symptomatic remission, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, or normal C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity (Conditional recommendation, very low to low certainty of evidence). For those who recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months, fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be preferred over < 150 μg/g to detect endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1), and normal CRP may be less informative; however, if CRP was elevated at the initial flare, normalization may suggest endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1).

### Avoid endoscopy in children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease who have normal calprotectin levels [^113Ew3Ye]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

In children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, adding calprotectin stool testing to the screening strategy has been recommended to distinguish organic from nonorganic disease. In this cohort study with historical controls, we could not confirm that screening with stool calprotectin improves the diagnostic yield (ratio inflammatory bowel disease-positive endoscopies and total number of endoscopies); however, in patients with normal fecal calprotectin levels (< 50 μg/g) endoscopic and histological abnormalities were not seen. We propose to refrain from endoscopy when stool calprotectin levels are normal.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113UTa6z]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds — In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), FC levels < 60 μg/g were predictive of deep remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) with 86% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and FC < 40.5 μg/g predicted histological remission with 41% sensitivity and 100% specificity; thresholds of 200–250 μg/g may predict endoscopic remission in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD). FC values < 50 μg/g may be reassuring for a non-IBD etiology of persistent symptoms, whereas 50–250 μg/g can be challenging to interpret; for mild symptoms, serial FC monitoring at 3- to 6-month intervals may be appropriate, and if a flare is suspected, endoscopy with biopsies or dedicated small-bowel imaging in CD should be considered. CRP has poor sensitivity and up to 15% of patients may fail to mount a CRP response.

Figure 6
Use of faecal calprotectin in primary care.

Faecal calprotectin is generally raised in patients with bloody diarrhoea and patients with this presenting feature will need flexible sigmoidoscopy regardless of the calprotectin result. In acute diarrhoea due to infection, calprotectin is also likely to be raised and will not discriminate between IBD and gastroenteritis, thus stool culture and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are the appropriate diagnostic investigations. While there is limited evidence to support routine repeat testing, an evaluation of the York Faecal Calprotectin Care Pathway found that, in 243 patients with a faecal calprotectin ≥ 100 µg/g after a median of 18 (IQR 14–29) days, repeat testing identified a reduction in 53% of patients, either to < 100 µg/g or, if initially > 250 µg/g, into the 100–250 µg/g range.

Faecal calprotectin is not sensitive enough in the exclusion of advanced colorectal adenoma or colorectal carcinoma, and so in patients with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, or iron-deficiency anaemia, cancer pathway referral should be strongly consideredand calprotectin is not appropriate. In primary care, symptoms of change in bowel habit with rectal bleeding and abnormal haematology in patients under 50 years are strongly predictive of IBD or colorectal cancer, but generally do not discriminate between the two. IBD is significantly more common in younger age groups, so referral will generally be to medical gastroenterologists. However, if there are reasons to suspect malignancy, patients should be referred via a suspected cancer pathway, although both need rapid colonoscopy (figure 6).

Ulcerative colitis biomarkers — false-positive tolerance and cutoffs are detailed, with the panel determining a maximal tolerable false-positive threshold at 5% for symptomatically active disease and noting circumstances where higher false-positive rates may be acceptable depending on downstream consequences. For practical implementation, the panel preferred a single fecal calprotectin cutoff (> 150 μg/g) across scenarios, and in typical flare symptoms reported that an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) had very good performance, at least comparable with fecal tests. The document also notes that stool testing to rule out C difficile and other enteric pathogens may still be required for all symptomatic patients.

### Faecal calprotectin: a marker of inflammation throughout the intestinal tract [^117PxZpJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Only a small proportion of patients with abdominal discomfort have organic disease, but a correct diagnosis can seldom be made by simple clinical examination. Additional diagnostic procedures must be employed, but these are expensive and demanding and carry a certain risk. Assessment of faecal concentrations of the neutrophil granulocyte-derived protein calprotectin can be used as a screening test — an 'ESR of the gut' — to select patients for further examination. The test can be performed on 1–2 g of random stool samples that can be sent to the laboratory by ordinary mail since the protein is remarkably stable in stools. The test has high sensitivities and specificities for gastrointestinal cancers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Faecal calprotectin levels reflect the disease activity in IBD and can be used to monitor the response to treatment and detect relapses.

Moderate to severe symptomatic flare in ulcerative colitis — In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP to rule in active inflammation and inform treatment adjustment and avoid routine endoscopic assessment solely for establishing presence of active disease.

### Inflammatory bowel disease patient perceptions of diagnostic and monitoring tests and procedures [^117TfHnX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

For its part, the stool test ranks among the least ordered test/procedure and few patients refuse this test. This is the test with which patients feel the most comfortable. As with the blood test, concern about the results was low and the results did not generate too many concerns about the illness. Various laboratory tests are used in screening patients with suspected IBD. These tests make it possible to identify IBD patients who are relapsing or at risk of relapse. In the past, laboratory markers were underestimated due to their low specificity. Given that endoscopic assessment is invasive and requires significant resources, identifying biomarkers of an illness' activity becomes an attractive alternative. Fecal biomarkers can serve as surrogate markers of gut inflammation. For example, fecal calprotectin has become a clinical standard to assess IBD activity, predict relapse and monitor response to treatment. A study conducted among adolescents has revealed that, on one hand, they tend not to report all of their symptoms and, on the other hand, they are not embarrassed by the idea of collecting their stool. Thus, the stool test is appropriate and well received by this patient group. Although the study presented here was conducted with an adult population, the findings are consistent with those of the study conducted with adolescents. It indeed appears that the stool test was the test with which patients were the most comfortable and, even though it is the least-often explained by physicians, patients had a very good understanding of the need to undergo this test.

AGA evidence summary — biomarkers in symptomatic ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP reliably suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, obviating routine need for endoscopic assessment (very low to moderate certainty of evidence). In patients with UC who have mild symptoms, fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, and elevated CRP may not suggest moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation (very low certainty of evidence). In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of flare, fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin or normal CRP may suggest lack of inflammation (very low certainty of evidence).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^113cd2Jr]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Biomarkers are used frequently for evaluation and monitoring of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to support practitioners in decisions about the use of biomarkers for the management of CD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to formulate patient-centered clinical questions and review evidence on the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and Endoscopic Healing Index in patients with established CD who were asymptomatic, had symptoms of varying severity, or were in surgically induced remission. Biomarker performance was assessed against the gold standard of endoscopic activity, defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease ≥ 3. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision framework to develop recommendations for use of biomarkers in various settings. Implementation considerations were formulated for each recommendation to inform clinical practice.

Results

The guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In patients with CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone. In patients in symptomatic remission, a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity. However, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In patients with CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity. In patients with CD with moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In patients with CD in surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence. In other postoperative settings, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment for establishing postoperative recurrence.

Conclusions

In patients with CD, fecal calprotectin and serum CRP can inform disease management in both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease. Discordance between symptom assessment and biomarker value may merit endoscopic evaluation for confirmation of status of disease activity.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — diagnostic evaluation of functional gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, a stepwise approach to rule out ongoing inflammatory activity should be followed with measurement of fecal calprotectin, endoscopy with biopsy, and cross-sectional imaging; in those with indeterminate fecal calprotectin levels and mild symptoms, clinicians may consider serial calprotectin monitoring to facilitate anticipatory management. Anatomic abnormalities or structural complications should be considered for obstructive symptoms, and alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic pancreatitis should be considered and evaluated based on predominant symptom patterns.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AGA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider assessing fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, or CRP to rule in active inflammation and inform treatment adjustment and avoid endoscopic assessment solely for establishing the presence of active disease in patients with UC with moderate-to-severe symptoms suggestive of flare.

### Can fecal calprotectin accurately identify histological activity of ulcerative colitis? A meta-analysis [^114GpxV6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The cut-off values of FC ranged from 50 to 172 µg/g in the analysis of histological response. Usually, FC levels less than 50 µg/g indicate normal or remission while FC levels over 200 µg/g indicate abnormality or inflammation. Uncertainty remains in patients who have FC levels of between 50 and 200 µg/g. Raising the cut-off value to 100 µg/g would have little effect (4%) on specificity but much more (14%) on sensitivity for non-inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, we also explored whether raising the cut-off value to over 100 µg/g would get a better outcome. Studies with cut-off values > 100 µg/g had a higher sensitivity than did studies with cut-off values ≤ 100 µg/g (0.77 versus 0.65). Because the threshold effect also explained a small source (37%) of heterogeneity, the specificity decreases as the cut-off value increases. Studies with cut-off values > 100 µg/g had a correspondingly lower, but acceptable, specificity (0.71 versus 0.80). Considering the range of FC cut-off values and the balance between sensitivity and specificity in this study, one should consider 100–200 µg/g for the cut-off value of FC. A higher sensitivity can identify more patients in histological response, which can spare these patients from unnecessary endoscopy and biopsy, but the exact cut-off value should be further decided according to the prevalence of histological activity and different FC assays.

The robustness of the results was assessed in the sensitivity analysis. The summary statistics changed only slightly no matter which study was removed, which suggested that the results were stable and reliable.

This study has several limitations. First, both histological scores and FC assays were inconsistent among studies, which might have increased the risk of bias of the index test and reference standard. Second, blinding is important for diagnostic accuracy, but most studies did not report whether blinding was adopted for the index test and reference standard, thereby increasing the risk of measurement bias. Third, individual patient characteristics (such as age and medication usage), sampling time, and laboratory storage conditions varied among studies. Heterogeneity could not be eliminated completely. Furthermore, the likelihood ratio was small, indicating a small change in the probability of the pretest rather than a large change. Thus, FC should be interpreted carefully and cannot completely replace endoscopy and biopsy. However, FC is still an acceptable and valuable biomarker for the continuous surveillance of histological activity.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^111J4tUH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an inflammatory marker released mainly from gastrointestinal granulocytes measured in stool samples. FC is noninvasive, economical, simple, and acceptable for patients. Levels of FC have proven reliable for intestinal inflammation, with good clinical sensitivity, and are useful in screening and monitoring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as in the differential diagnosis between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given its advantages, FC represents an attractive biomarker that could be utilized in various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases apart from IBD, and is currently being studied extensively by many research groups with significant amounts of data emerging. In this current review we aim to provide an outline of the utility of FC in distinguishing between IBS and IBD, as well as an up-to-date summary of the available clinical experience concerning FC in various common conditions of the GI tract commonly encountered by gastroenterology practitioners, such as IBS, microscopic colitis, acute gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection, colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, coeliac disease, and other GI conditions.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^116VYJYH]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) monitoring — emphasizes specificity and infection exclusion: CRP may be elevated in systemic inflammatory processes and does not always represent luminal CD activity; fecal calprotectin is more specific for gut inflammation but may be elevated with concomitant gastrointestinal infections, and in patients with CD who have elevated biomarkers and disease-related symptoms, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile and other enteric pathogens is important. For other indications, endoscopic evaluation is warranted for determining the extent and severity of inflammation, dysplasia detection and surveillance, evaluation and endoscopic treatment of stricturing disease, and ruling out cytomegalovirus colitis; biomarkers are not helpful in these situations.

Fecal calprotectin (fCal) thresholds — per-1000 outcomes at intermediate-likelihood (prevalence 50%) and high-likelihood (prevalence 85%) show the following: true positives (TPs) per 1000 were 390 (330–430), 355 (310–390), and 315 (265–390) at 50% prevalence, and 663 (561–731), 603 (527–663), and 536 (451–663) at 85% prevalence; false negatives (FNs) were 110 (70–170), 145 (110–190), and 185 (110–235) at 50%, and 187 (119–289), 247 (187–323), and 314 (187–399) at 85%. TPs would be eligible to undergo treatment adjustment, which may decrease disease-related complications and morbidity, without being subject to risks and invasive testing with endoscopy. FNs may be falsely reassured, undertreated, or mistreated (as not having UC flare), potentially leading to increased disease related complications and morbidity. TNs would be reassured and obviate the need for invasive testing with endoscopy, although they may need to undergo serial assessment of biomarker at periodic intervals. FPs may undergo unnecessary treatment adjustment and have treatment-related complications.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^112GBgCb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, are common symptoms in the general population and prevalent in the primary care setting, but may also be a presentation of various GI organic or functional diseases. Defining the underlying etiology is generally challenging and necessitates complementary diagnostic examinations, including blood tests, imaging, endoscopy and histology. The introduction of noninvasive diagnostic tools into clinical practice has been invaluable in the assessment of various GI symptoms and may ultimately decrease the use of invasive, complicated, expensive and potentially harmful procedures, such as endoscopy. In the last decade new markers have been extensively investigated with the aim of identifying a universal marker that can be introduced into clinical practice for primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. Fecal calprotectin (FC) appears to be the best candidate, as testing for levels of this protein has high accuracy, reproducibility and practicality, the test is easy to perform, and the results are simple to interpret. FC is a protein heterodimer (A100A8/A9) released by granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and epithelial cells during an inflammatory response, with inflammatory cells accumulating in the mucosa. FC is subsequently released in the stool, from where it can be measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it is resistant to metabolic degradation for up to 7 days at room temperature. Roseth et al showed a good correlation between FC and the fecal excretion of indium-111-labeled granulocytes via scintigraphy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several groups have investigated FC concentrations in healthy individuals and a cutoff of 50 μg/g for a positive test has been suggested, although a cutoff of 100 μg/g appears to have better accuracy for an IBD diagnosis, while factors such as type of assay and manufacturers' recommendations should also be considered. Several factors affect FC levels, including acute GI infections, colon adenomas and malignancies, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and age, since children under the age of 5 years have been found to have higher FC concentrations, probably due to higher intestinal permeability.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^112i4Fr9]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA practical application of biomarkers advises that application of all biomarkers in clinical practice should be guided by downstream implications, including risk of consequent treatment decisions (low-risk treatment adjustment vs high-risk treatment adjustment), and that test performance thresholds (acceptable FP and FN rates) may vary for patient–provider teams depending on the decision. Fecal calprotectin assays may not be interchangeable and the same assay should be used for a given patient to compare performance across time; stool sampling can vary with within-day variation, and when results are borderline or unexpected repeat fecal calprotectin testing or endoscopic evaluation for confirmation may be required. Because there are inter-individual differences in biomarker elevation and in a subset of patients biomarkers may correlate poorly with endoscopic activity, overall performance and confidence may be higher when biomarkers have been longitudinally observed to correlate with the patient's endoscopic disease activity during both active disease and remission.

Conclusion

FC has a good diagnostic accuracy for histological response and remission in patients with UC. A cut-off value of 100–200 µg/g is more appropriate to identify patients in histological response and spare patients from unnecessary endoscopy and biopsy. The exact cut-off value should be further decided according to the prevalence of histological activity and different FC assays. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

### Faecal calprotectin for screening of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic meta-analysis [^114etv6H]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications of key findings

We aimed to determine whether faecal calprotectin can serve as a screening test to reduce the number of people undergoing invasive endoscopy. To move from the evidence gathered in this meta-analysis to a recommendation for a screening strategy we used the comprehensive and transparent GRADE approach. Recognising that the diagnostic accuracy of faecal calprotectin is a surrogate for outcomes important to patients is central to this approach. Screening patients by measuring faecal calprotectin levels is of value only if it results in improved outcomes for patients. For this reason we infer the effect of faecal calprotectin screening on patient outcome from the pooled sensitivity and specificity. Key questions are whether the numbers of false negatives (missed cases) and false positives (cases without inflammatory bowel disease who go on to have endoscopy) are acceptable when faecal calprotectin is introduced as a screening test. In the "new" diagnostic pathway patients only with suspected inflammatory bowel disease and an abnormal faecal calprotectin result will be sent urgently for endoscopy (fig 6). Table 3shows the implications of the testing scenarios. In a hypothetical population of 100 adults with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (and an overall mean prevalence of 32%) three patients without the disease would go on to have endoscopy and two patients with the disease would be missed. Faecal calprotectin screening would reduce the number of adults requiring endoscopy by 67%. In a hypothetical population of 100 children and teenagers with suspected inflammatory bowel disease (and an overall mean prevalence of 61%) nine without the disease would go on to have endoscopy, five with the disease would be missed, and faecal calprotectin screening would reduce the number requiring endoscopy by 35%.

Figure 2
Proposed algorithm for the interpretation of faecal calprotectin (CP) concentration. No evidence-based algorithm has been established by controlled clinical trials. This algorithm is based on literature research and clinical experience. Note that faecal CP concentration reflects only one aspect of disease evaluation and should always be interpreted in conjunction with history and clinical and/or endoscopic examination. Panel A: In suspected inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (e.g. GI symptoms such as diarrhoea, bleeding or abdominal pain > 4 weeks), faecal CP and a stool (pathogen) culture should be obtained. Repeated elevated faecal CP concentration (> 40 µg/g) or persistent symptoms require further investigations. Faecal CP is also elevated during gastroenteritis (viral and bacterial), diverticular disease, drug-induced enteropathy and intestinal malignancies. IBS may also present with elevated CP but its probability decreases with higher concentrations (> 150 µg/g). Panel B: In patients with an established diagnosis of IBD, faecal CP supports the diagnosis of active disease or remission. Faecal CP concentration < 150 µg/g usually indicates remission with high accuracy. Elevated faecal CP concentration (> 150 µg/g) raises suspicion for disease activity as elevated CP concentration is associated with increased risk of a clinically apparent disease flare in the following months. Based on the recently published Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-II (STRIDE-II) recommendations values of 150–250 µg/g are considered as grey zone. In symptomatic patients with IBD, other causes for elevated faecal CP should be excluded (such as infection and drug-induced enteropathy) and endoscopy should be performed before switching medical therapy. *In immunocompromised patients, serological testing for cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) may be obtained and history should exclude drug-induced enteropathy associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors, sartans, levodopa and rarely other drugs. Alarm symptoms are defined by unintentional weight loss, night sweat, bloody diarrhoea and/or vomiting indicating upper and/or lower endoscopy.

Consequences of pooled sensitivity and specificity of faecal calprotectin for patient outcome

IBD = inflammatory bowel disease.

*GRADE recommends classifying patient important outcomes on a 9 point scale: 7–9: critical for decision making; 4–6: important but not critical for decision making; and 1–3: of lower importance to patients. 109

The clinical consequences of missing patients with inflammatory bowel disease should be balanced against patients without the disease who go on to have endoscopy. A false negative faecal calprotectin test result would lead to a failure to introduce effective treatment in a timely manner, with the resultant continuation of symptoms. A false positive test result means that people endure an invasive procedure. A considerable proportion of the patients with a false positive test result will, however, prove to have a gastrointestinal condition different from inflammatory bowel disease (table 4) for which endoscopy is inevitable. Complications of endoscopy, related to the invasiveness of the procedure itself (colonic perforation or tear) or to anaesthesia, are also important considerations, although they are rare. Several retrospective studies have reported the incidence of a small perforation after colonoscopy to be in the range 0.032% (1 in 3115 patients) to 0.9% (1 in 111).

Table 4
Causes of abnormal results for faecal calprotectin other than inflammatory bowel disease

We consider faecal calprotectin a useful screening tool for identifying those patients who are most likely to need endoscopy for inflammatory bowel disease. Adding calprotectin testing to the diagnostic pathway, however, also resulted in delayed diagnosis in 6% (2 in 32 patients) of the adults and 8% (5 in 61) of the children and teenagers. Health professionals may be interested in finding ways to ease the pressure on overstretched endoscopy centres with long waiting lists. Increased faecal calprotectin levels may indicate a need for urgent endoscopy, whereas normal calprotectin levels are less likely to be associated with intestinal inflammation and further investigations can be tailored appropriately. The only exception to this rule is the presence of persistent rectal bleeding, which would justify urgency for endoscopy comparable to that for increased levels of faecal calprotectin.

### Compliance with fecal calprotectin testing in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117QzwVd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a highly sensitive biomarker for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Utilization of this assay has been steadily increasing. Adherence levels for FC have, however, yet to be examined in the pediatric IBD setting. We analyzed 100 consecutive patients diagnosed with IBD between 2014 and 2015 at Texas Children's Hospital. Fifty-six percent of patients were men and median age at diagnosis was 13.7 years. Following diagnosis of IBD, 84 patients had a minimum of 1 FC requested, and 95.2% of these patients completed the test at least once. An average of 2 FCs per patient was ordered each year, and the overall compliance was 76.6%. Patients who completed the initial testing with a minimum of 3 consecutive tests were more likely to remain compliant than those who failed to perform the first lab (P < 0.001). Our findings indicate good compliance with FC testing in pediatric patients with IBD.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^115g7h4E]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions and the future for faecal biomarkers in IBD

The outlook for faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in clinical practice appears promising.

Potentially in the future faecal biomarker measurement will be standard prior to first gastrointestinal outpatient clinic visit for those with abdominal pain or diarrhoea. This may allow faster triage and assessment of patients and perhaps the avoidance of unnecessary investigation in those with functional diarrhoea or IBS.

As surrogate markers of mucosal healing in IBD, calprotectin and lactoferrin may allow objective mapping of an individual patient response to treatment and quantify the likelihood of future relapse. If these tests can be used to demonstrate an adequate response to biological therapy, they may aid decisions regarding dose escalation, shortening of dosage interval, switching to an alternative agent or ultimately withdrawal of unnecessary immunosuppression for those in sustained deep remission. Equally future trials may tell us whether consistent suppression or elevation of calprotectin and lactoferrin convey prognostic significance in terms of hospitalisation, the need for surgery and an effect on quality of life.

In summary, faecal biomarkers will never fully replace colonoscopy and radiology which are necessary to obtain tissue samples and investigate the complications of IBD. However, in a society where patient satisfaction, risk minimisation, cost reduction and hospitalisation avoidance are a priority, these non-invasive, inexpensive, reproducible and clinically significant measurements are likely to have a greater role in our future diagnostic and therapeutic pathways.

Key points

▶ Quantification of the faecal biomarkers calprotectin and lactoferrin can provide a non-invasive measure of intestinal inflammation.
▶ The clinical use of faecal biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease includes screening for active mucosal inflammation, longitudinal disease monitoring and predicting the risk of relapse.
▶ In the correct clinical context, faecal biomarkers may avoid the need for invasive radiological or endoscopic investigation and inform treatment decisions.

### Can fecal calprotectin accurately identify histological activity of ulcerative colitis? A meta-analysis [^1157XajB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Selection criteria

The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult patients diagnosed with UC; detailed histological scores described; and the relationship between FC and histological activity of UC assessed. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: histological outcomes not matched with the definition of histological response or histological remission or those using a strict definition for a combined histological score and endoscopic score; lack of, or insufficient, data to calculate true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, or true-negative values; case reports, reviews, and editorials; and fewer than 20 samples. When patient data were reported more than once, only the most recent article with the most information was included.

Data extraction and quality assessment

The titles and abstracts were reviewed by two investigators (XY and SZ) independently. After the eligibility assessment, data were extracted, including the first author, publication year, study design, study region, patient sex, patient age, endoscopic activity, FC assay, median of FC, FC cut-off, interval between fecal sampling and endoscopy, and definition of histological remission or histological response. The absolute number of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative cases was collected or calculated to develop a 2 × 2 contingency table. When multiple cut-off values existed, we selected the pre-specified one or manufacturer's reference first. If there is no pre-specified cut-off value or manufacturer's reference, we select the optimal cut-off value with the highest Youden index.

Two authors (XY and SZ) independently assessed the study quality by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. In an case of discrepancies, we consulted with the senior reviewer (MC) to reach consensus.

For those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), values of > 250μg/g indicate disease activity.
FC values for active IBD are not lower in Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future

FC testing which is non-invasive, can guide clinicians in managing patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Role of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^1132s7HV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein found in both plasma and stool that is markedly elevated in infectious and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We conducted a systematic review of the published literature regarding fecal calprotectin to evaluate its potential as a noninvasive marker of neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. Reference ranges for fecal calprotectin have been established in healthy adults and children, and elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin have been demonstrated in numerous studies of patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin correlates well with histological inflammation as detected by colonoscopy with biopsies and has been shown successfully to predict relapses and detect pouchitis in patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to consistently differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome because it has excellent negative predictive value in ruling out IBD in undiagnosed, symptomatic patients. Fecal calprotectin also may be useful in determining whether clinical symptoms in patients with known IBD are caused by disease flares or noninflammatory complications/underlying irritable bowel syndrome and in providing objective evidence of response to treatment. Although more studies are needed to define fully the role of fecal calprotectin, convincing studies and growing clinical experience point to an expanded role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to stool tests (fecal calprotectin), ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain fecal calprotectin (a cutoff of > 50–100 mcg/g) to differentiate inflammatory from noninflammatory disease of the colon.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^114Ldtnm]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) reviews the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and the Endoscopic Healing Index across asymptomatic patients, those with varying symptom severity, and those in surgically induced remission, and the guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone, and in this setting a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity; however, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity, whereas in moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, while in other postoperative settings biomarkers are insufficient for establishing diagnosis of recurrence.

Fecal calprotectin — cutoffs for ruling out or ruling in endoscopic inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) symptomatic remission: In patients with known endoscopic remission, there was "moderate certainty of evidence supporting the use of fecal calprotectin cutoffs of < 50 μg/g… and low certainty of evidence supporting the use of fecal calprotectin cutoffs of < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g… to rule out endoscopic inflammation", with imprecision noted because "95% CI exceeded the maximal tolerable FN rate of 5%". In patients with unknown endoscopic remission status, certainty was "low for calprotectin < 50 μg/g and very low for cutoffs of < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g… because both the point estimate and 95% CI are higher than FN threshold of 5%". For ruling in disease, "in patients with CD in symptomatic remission… there was very low certainty of evidence supporting the use of any proposed cutoff of elevated fecal calprotectin… due to unacceptably high rates of FP… and inconsistency".

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115vxZFw]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin thresholds in ulcerative colitis are addressed, and the guideline panel felt choosing a single fecal calprotectin cutpoint (< 150 μg/g) is preferable for broad clinical use, while in patients who have recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months a lower fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be more accurate than < 150 μg/g to rule out moderate to severe active inflammation; in children 2 years or younger, a higher threshold may be needed. The panel did not compare different noninvasive biomarkers due to variable cutoffs, and notes that stool-based tests may be more sensitive for intestinal inflammation compared with serum CRP, although CRP has the convenience of being a blood test.

AGA Crohn's disease biomarkers — fecal calprotectin (fCal) thresholds report false positives per 1000 patients tested with 95% CIs for known endoscopic remission (prevalence 20%) versus unknown endoscopic remission status (prevalence 45%). For known endoscopic remission, false positives were 264 (160–392) for fCal < 50 μg/g, 224 (152–312) for fCal < 150 μg/g, and 208 (160–264) for fCal < 250 μg/g; for unknown endoscopic remission status, false positives were 181 (110–269), 154 (104–214), and 143 (110–181), respectively. Pooled accuracy estimates were sensitivity 88% (95% CI, 79%–94%) and specificity 67% (95% CI, 51%–80%) for fCal < 50 μg/g; sensitivity 81% (95% CI, 74%–87%) and specificity 72% (95% CI, 61%–81%) for fCal < 150 μg/g; and sensitivity 76% (95% CI, 70%–82%) and specificity 74% (95% CI, 67%–80%) for fCal < 250 μg/g; the reference test is colonoscopy. The table notes that false positives may prompt unnecessary endoscopy and/or treatment adjustment with potential testing- or treatment-related harms and resource use.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^111S436z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of FC in AGE

AGE is a prevalent clinical presentation in both the adult and pediatric populations in the primary care setting. Generally, these bouts of illness are self-limiting and do not require investigation or specific management. Nonetheless, some clinical scenarios — such as a severe clinical presentation and symptom onset in a hospitalized or immunocompromised patient, amongst others (high-risk patients) — may mandate evaluation, and in such cases it is critical to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections. Stool culture is considered the mainstay for diagnosing bacterial AGE, but the length of time needed to acquire the results and other practical limitations has led to other diagnostic tools being sought. The role of FC has been investigated in AGE and yielded some promising results. Shastry et al conducted a large prospective, multicenter study of 2383 patients who presented with AGE, with the aim of determining a correlation between bacterial AGE (diagnosed by stool culture) and FC levels. The results were impressive, with sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 87%, respectively, for FC levels in diagnosing bacterial infections. These results have also been confirmed in adult populations, where FC levels were found to be higher during a bacterial infection and were correlated with disease severity. However, the role of FC in the management of AGE is limited by the acute and self-limited nature of these conditions and more research is needed to better address the utility of FC in identifying bacterial infection in high-risk patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112ir1zP]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Recommendation 4 — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For mild symptoms such as slight increase in stool frequency and/or infrequent rectal bleeding, proceeding directly with endoscopic assessment rather than testing biomarkers may be reasonable, and for those who prefer to avoid endoscopy or empiric escalation, repeat biomarker measurement (in 3–6 months) may be a reasonable alternative.

### Utility of fecal calprotectin in evaluation of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in primary care [^117XKWpD]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) is a marker of intestinal inflammation. Data are limited on utility of routine FC testing in pediatric primary care. Participants 0 to 18 years old who had an FC test in the years 2010–2014 were retrospectively identified. Those with less than a year of follow-up or a prior diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were excluded. In all, 84% (689/822) had normal FC; no participant with normal FC was diagnosed with IBD in the subsequent 12 months. Also, 16% (133/822) had elevated FC, and 31% of those (42/133) were diagnosed with IBD. FC values for IBD and non-IBD groups were 1084 µg/g (interquartile range [IQR] = 514.4–2000) and 27.05 µg/g (IQR = 15.6–62.6; P < .001), respectively. Abdominal pain was the primary indication. In this cohort, sensitivity of FC for IBD is 100%, and specificity is 88%. The FC test can be an excellent tool in the primary care setting to exclude IBD and avoid unnecessary referrals and colonoscopies.

Fecal leukocytes, lactoferrin, and calprotectin in acute diarrhea — Recommendation 20 states "Fecal leukocyte examination and stool lactoferrin detection should not be used to establish the cause of acute infectious diarrhea (strong, moderate)". It also states, "There are insufficient data available to make a recommendation on the use of fecal calprotectin measurement in people with acute infectious diarrhea". Supporting evidence indicates fecal leukocyte examination "performs poorly to establish the infectious cause of diarrhea", with morphology that "degrades in feces during transport and processing" and intermittent, uneven distribution limiting sensitivity; lactoferrin is a surrogate marker but "is also present in noninfectious IBD, resulting in decreased specificity".

AGA guideline — scope, biomarkers evaluated, and knowledge gaps in UC management: The guideline panel made 7 conditional recommendations and focused on serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin as biomarkers of disease activity in established UC with symptomatic remission or active symptoms. The panel identified the use of a biomarker-based monitoring strategy over an endoscopy-based monitoring strategy as a knowledge gap. In conclusions, the guideline states that in patients with UC, noninvasive biomarkers, including fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum CRP can inform disease monitoring and management.

### Calprotectin… [^113tnvtC]. Wikipedia (2010). Low credibility.

The proteins exist as homodimers but preferentially exist as S100A8/A9 heterodimers or heterotetramers with antimicrobial, proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties. In the presence of calcium, calprotectin is capable of sequestering the transition metals iron, manganese and zinc via chelation. This metal sequestration affords the complex antimicrobial properties. Calprotectin is the only known antimicrobial manganese sequestration protein complex. Calprotectin comprises as much as 60% of the soluble protein content of the cytosol of a neutrophil, and it is secreted by an unknown mechanism during inflammation. Faecal calprotectin has been used to detect intestinal inflammation and can serve as a biomarker for inflammatory bowel diseases. Blood-based calprotectin is used in diagnostics of multiple inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases, like arthritis, and severe infections including sepsis.

Metal binding Calprotectin has a high affinity for calcium, zinc, iron, and manganese. Each of S100A8 and S100A9 contain two EF-hand type Ca²⁺ binding sites, and calprotectin is able to bind a total of four calcium ions per dimer or eight calcium ions per tetramer. Calcium binding induces a conformational change in the complex that improves its affinity for transition metals, and promotes tetramer formation. A maximum of two transition metal ions may bind to each calprotectin S100A8-S100A9 dimer. A calprotectin dimer can bind only one manganese or iron ion with high affinity, and it can do this only in the presence of calcium. Zinc can bind at two sites within the calprotectin dimer, and this can occur in the absence of calcium. Calcium, however, improves calprotectin's affinity for zinc.

While calprotectin metal binding occurs at the interface of S100A9 and S100A8 monomers, the independent monomers have some capacity for zinc binding, and may contribute to zinc homeostasis within mammals. The first of the two calprotectin metal binding sites consists of a His₃Asp motif, with S100A8 contributing two histidine ligands, and S100A9 contributing a histidine and an aspartic acid ligand. The second site can coordinate metals through a tetra-histidine or a hexa-histidine binding motif. Inflammatory disease Calprotectin constitutes up to 60% of soluble protein content in the cytosol of neutrophil granulocytes, and it can be found at a lower concentration in monocytes, macrophages, and squamous epithelial cells. Calprotectin enters into pus and abscess fluid during neutrophil cell death, along with other antimicrobial proteins. Mammalian cells secrete calprotectin during the inflammatory response.

Circulating activated platelets and platelet-leukocyte aggregates are increased in acute and chronic sterile thrombo-inflammatory diseases. Plasma calprotectin is elevated in persons with metabolic syndrome, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation. Calprotectin is secreted in the mouth during inflammation of the gingiva and during oral candidiasis infection. People who have mutations in the calprotectin gene appear susceptible to serious gum infections. Manganese sequestration by calprotectin is likely important during lung inflammation. The exact mechanism by which S100A8 and S100A9 is secreted by mammalian cells during inflammation remains unknown. In lung autopsies from patients with inflammation caused by COVID-19, heterodimeric S100A8/A9 is mainly detected in neutrophils and deposited on vessel walls. Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha is the receptor for S100A8/A9 on platelets.

### Can fecal calprotectin better stratify Crohn's disease activity index? [^112XVAUW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) activity index (CDAI) is still widely used for monitoring clinical activity in CD patients, but is of little value as indicator of persistent inflammation in symptomless patients. Fecal calprotectin levels ≥ 150 µg/g are strongly indicative of endoscopically and/or histologically active disease. Our aim was to study, in a large cohort of CD patients, the relationship between CDAI and fecal calprotectin levels.

Methods

CDAI and fecal calprotectin levels were evaluated in consecutive patients from a CD outpatient clinic.

Results

We enrolled 193 CD patients, of whom 38% with CDAI < 150 had a calprotectin value ≥ 150 µg/g, suggestive of active disease. A logistic regression model showed that for CDAI levels between 100 and 150, the estimated logistic probability of calprotectin ≥ 150 µg/g increased progressively to 76%, reaching 94% where disease activity was localized in the colon. With a CDAI cut-off > 120, we found a high diagnostic accuracy of 72%, with 88% specificity and 50% sensitivity (positive predictive value: 76%, negative predictive value: 71%) to identify a calprotectin value ≥ 150 µg/g.

Conclusion

CDAI scores between 100 and 150 display an acceptable ability to quantify the risk of persistent inflammation as expressed by the high calprotectin level.

### Practical guidance on the use of faecal calprotectin [^111RRtnL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gut disorders, and the determination of mucosal disease activity in established cases of IBD remain the cornerstones of disease diagnosis and management. Non-invasive, accurate biomarkers of gut inflammation are needed due to the variability of symptoms, the inaccuracies of currently available blood markers and the cost and invasive nature of endoscopy. Numerous biomarkers have been used and/or considered with some in current use. This article reviews the current evidence base around the indications for using biomarkers and their limitations, with a particular focus on faecal calprotectin.

### Can 2 different fecal calprotectin assays be used interchangeably in IBD treatment? [^1133XbqD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fecal Calprotectin (FC) levels can be used as a surrogate marker for disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Calprotectin is released into the intestinal lumen from the neutrophils in the mucosa during inflammation, and measuring the levels of FC thus reflects intestinal inflammation. Not only can FC levels be used to discriminate between IBD and functional gastrointestinal disorders in patients with chronic abdominal pain, these measurements also have a prominent place in today's clinical care of patients with IBD; FC is used to discriminate between active and quiescent IBD, and has a higher accuracy than other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

Despite its widespread use, there is currently no consensus on the optimal cutoff value for discriminating active disease from remission in patients with IBD. This lack of consensus is partly caused by questions about the variability between different assays used to measure FC. Several studies have demonstrated varying accuracies when comparing different FC assays head-to-head,–but these studies mainly focused on discriminating between healthy controls and patients with IBD.

As in practice patients frequently switch between different laboratories where different assays are used, we need to know whether different assays classify disease activity in the same way in order to correctly monitor the disease activity of our patients with IBD. This study aimed to answer the following research question: "Can two different FC assays be used interchangeably in IBD monitoring?" Our primary outcome was the agreement between the 2 assays, as assessed with the weighted κ.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin monitoring in asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and practical guide [^116dsxvg]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), "monitoring" involves repeated testing aimed at early recognition of disease exacerbation. We aimed to determine the usefulness of repeated fecal calprotectin (FC) measurements to predict IBD relapses by a systematic literature review.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to April 2016. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies that followed patients with IBD in remission at baseline and had at least 2 consecutive FC measurements with a test interval of 2 weeks to 6 months. Methodological assessment was based on the second Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist.

Results

A total of 1719 articles were identified; 193 were retrieved for full text review. Six studies met eligibility for inclusion. The time interval between FC tests varied between 1 and 3 months. Asymptomatic patients with IBD who had repeated FC measurements above the study's cutoff level had a 53% to 83% probability of developing disease relapse within the next 2 to 3 months. Patients with repeated normal FC values had a 67% to 94% probability to remain in remission in the next 2 to 3 months. The ideal FC cutoff for monitoring could not be identified because of the limited number studies meeting inclusion criteria and heterogeneity between selected studies.

Conclusions

Two consecutively elevated FC values are highly associated with disease relapse, indicating a consideration to proactively optimize IBD therapy plans. More prospective data are necessary to assess whether FC monitoring improves health outcomes.

### Faecal calprotectin for screening of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic meta-analysis [^111apTMc]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is on the increase in both adults and children. The disorder includes two major forms of chronic intestinal inflammation: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Suspicion is raised in patients with persistent (≥ 4 weeks) or recurrent (≥ 2 episodes in six months) abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Additionally, rectal bleeding, weight loss, or anaemia increase the probability of the condition. Pathognomonic signs or symptoms do not exist. Endoscopic evaluation with histopathological sampling are generally considered indispensable in the investigation of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. Many patients consider endoscopy and the required bowel preparation to be uncomfortable. In a relatively large proportion of people with suspected inflammatory bowel disease the results of endoscopy will be negative. A third of adults with bleeding related symptoms have no abnormalities on endoscopy, and this proportion increases to half with non-bleeding symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Identification of low risk patients would reduce the number of unnecessary invasive endoscopic procedures. Conversely, doctors would like to be able to identify those with a sufficiently high likelihood of inflammatory bowel disease to justify urgency for endoscopy.

Use of a simple, non-invasive, and cheap screening test to make a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease would help to reach these goals. Determination of calprotectin levels in stools could be a good screening method. Calprotectin is a major protein found in the cytosol of inflammatory cells. The protein is stable in stool samples for up to seven days at room temperature and one sample of less than 5 g is sufficient for a reliable measurement. These qualities allow for stool sample collection at home and potential delays in transport to the laboratory.

Since 2000, faecal calprotectin has been evaluated in numerous diagnostic studies in both adult and paediatric populations. Many of these studies included healthy people on one side of the patient spectrum and patients with known inflammatory bowel disease on the other. Both extremes give cause to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy relative to the practical situation, where screening is necessary because it is difficult to clinically distinguish between those who do and those who do not need urgent endoscopy. The doctor is then left with little guidance about the usefulness of faecal calprotectin as a screening test. We carried out a meta-analysis to evaluate whether adding faecal calprotectin testing to the investigation of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease reduced the number of unnecessary endoscopies.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — biomarker thresholds to rule out active inflammation in CD in symptomatic remission: in patients with established CD in symptomatic remission with recent confirmation of endoscopic remission (within 3 mo prior, without change in therapy and clinical status) and unknown endoscopic remission status, the PICO evaluates fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and EHI cutoffs to accurately rule out active inflammation. The intervention thresholds are fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g, < 150 μg/g, or < 250 μg/g, normal CRP (< 5 mg/L), and EHI < 20, compared against fecal calprotectin > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, or > 250 μg/g, elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L), and EHI > 20. Outcomes are framed as beneficial detection of endoscopic inflammation with TP rate and TN rate, and harms including FN rate (false reassurance that inflammation has resolved, leading to increased risk of flares due to undertreatment) and FP rate (excess endoscopic procedures to rule out inflammation).

5.5.1.1 Faecal calprotectin in the assessment of disease activity in known IBD

Statement 112. We suggest that, in IBD patients where it is unclear if symptoms are due to ongoing inflammation or other non-inflammatory causes (such as bile acid malabsorption, functional bowel disorder or short bowel), faecal calprotectin measurement may be used to provide evidence of mucosal inflammation (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Faecal calprotectin is a useful surrogate marker of inflammatory activity in IBD. It correlates well with endoscopic inflammation in UCand in Crohn's disease. If it is unclear whether new symptoms represent a relapse or other causes, particularly in Crohn's disease, then calprotectin is useful to confirm active inflammation and can be a non-invasive alternative to flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. If relapsing disease is clinically obvious, then measurement is not necessary.

A recent meta-analysis including data for 2822 IBD patients and 298 controls found that a calprotectin cut-off of 50 µg/g had the best sensitivity (90.6%) to detect endoscopically active disease, with specificity performing best (78.2%) at levels > 100 µg/g. A separate meta-analysis has shown that a threshold of 250 µg/g provides better specificity of 82% than thresholds of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g (specificity of 66% and 60%, respectively) in differentiating active IBD from remission. However, a faecal calprotectin of 250 µg/g had a relatively lower sensitivity of 80% compared with a sensitivity of 84% and 92% at cut-offs of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g, respectively.

Fecal calprotectin (fCal) cutoffs — patients with symptomatically active Crohn's disease and mild symptoms — report per‑1000 patients tested (95% CI) at thresholds fCal > 50 μg/g, fCal > 150 μg/g, and fCal > 250 μg/g with a prevalence of 65%. True positives were 572 (514–611), 527 (481–566), and 494 (455–533); false negatives were 78 (39–136), 123 (84–169), and 156 (117–195); true negatives were 235 (179–280), 252 (214–284), and 259 (235–280); and false positives were 115 (70–171), 98 (66–136), and 91 (70–115). GRADE certainty of evidence is LOW b, c for fCal > 50 μg/g and VERY LOW b, c, d for fCal > 150 μg/g and fCal > 250 μg/g.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^116HUHBa]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — Recommendation 6 for Crohn's disease (CD): In patients with mild symptoms and elevated biomarkers (fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, CRP > 5 mg/L), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment; this is a conditional recommendation with very low certainty in evidence. An implementation consideration states that lack of normalization or persistently elevated biomarkers after initial treatment likely suggests active inflammation and may warrant treatment adjustment without need for endoscopic or radiologic evaluation.

### Faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: meta-analysis [^1142bLzg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is the standard medical procedure to identify inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Noninvasive measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration may replace colonoscopy in this indication. The study aimed to assess efficacy of faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of IBD in patients with symptoms suggestive of such diagnosis. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies was performed. Cochrane, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched until December 2018. Inclusion criteria comprised experimental and observational studies, adults with gastrointestinal symptoms, calprotectin as index and colonoscopy as reference test, presence of data on/enabling the calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters. For each study, sensitivity and specificity of faecal calprotectin were analysed as bivariate data. Nineteen studies were identified. The total number of patients was 5032. Calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.882 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.827–0.921] and 0.799 (95% CI, 0.693–0.875), respectively. Following faecal calprotectin incorporation in the diagnostic work-up of 100 people with suspected IBD, 18 non-IBD patients will have a colonoscopy performed and one patient with the disease will not be referred for this examination. Faecal calprotectin concentration measurement is a useful screening test to rule out IBD, at the same time reducing the need for colonoscopy by 66.7%.

Fecal calprotectin — pooled diagnostic accuracy for ruling out postoperative endoscopic recurrence in Crohn's disease shows sensitivity/specificity at cutoffs of < 50 μg/g: sensitivity, 86% (95% CI, 75%–93%); specificity, 50% (95% CI, 34%–66%) (11 studies); < 150 μg/g: sensitivity, 64% (95% CI, 51%–75%); specificity, 71% (95% CI, 63%–77%) (6 studies); and < 250 μg/g: sensitivity, 52% (95% CI, 40%–64%); specificity, 79% (66%–88%) (6 studies). Certainty of evidence statements indicate moderate certainty for using < 50 μg/g and < 150 μg/g to rule out recurrence in a low pretest probability scenario, low certainty for < 250 μg/g in the low scenario, low certainty for < 50 μg/g and very low certainty for < 150 μg/g and < 250 μg/g in intermediate/high scenarios, and very low certainty for using > 50 μg/g, > 150 μg/g, or > 250 μg/g to rule in recurrence due to unacceptably high FP rates; > 250 μg/g performed slightly better but was still rated low certainty because the 95% CI exceeded the maximal tolerable FP rate of 5%.

Ulcerative colitis fecal calprotectin assay variability — Fecal calprotectin assays may not be interchangeable and the same assay should be used for a given patient to compare results over time; because there can be substantial within-stool and within-day variations of fecal calprotectin measurements from a single patient, confidence in any single measurement may be limited, and if there is uncertainty of results (such as borderline or unexpected results), repeat fecal calprotectin testing or endoscopic evaluation for confirmation may be required.

Other guidelines on noninvasive biomarkers in ulcerative colitis — The American College of Gastroenterology Society guideline published in 2019 suggested fecal calprotectin as a surrogate for endoscopy when endoscopy is not feasible or available. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization and the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology guidelines recognized that asymptomatic patients with elevated biomarkers of inflammation, mainly fecal calprotectin and CRP, may suggest imminent flare and recommended endoscopic or radiologic evaluation. In patients with clinical response to medical therapy, the guidelines recommend evaluating for mucosal healing via either endoscopy or fecal calprotectin, and none of these guidelines discussed specific cutoffs or downstream implications for decision making.

Faecal calprotectin

One of the biggest advances in screening of patients for potential IBD has been the rapid expansion of faecal calprotectin (FCp) testing. This dimer, formed of two protein subunits (S100A8 and S100A9), is released by immune cells, particularly neutrophils, into the intestinal lumen and can be measured in stool. While it is a relatively stable biomarker, it will begin to degrade after days, and measurements may be falsely low if stool is not stored at low temperatures. Normal levels are described at < 50 mcg/g, although there is a spectrum of normal, impacted by age, diet and time of day. Particular care must be taken in interpreting results from younger children (aged < 6), who have inherently higher FCp values (up to 500 mcg/g in some cases) due to immune maturation of the intestine. Typically, children with IBD will have values in the high 100s, or 1000s, but rarely some patients will have low, or even normal FCp measurements, likely to be reflective of isolated upper gastrointestinal inflammation, limited small bowel disease or sampling error.

As availability of FCp has increased, so has the false positive referral rate to gastroenterology. Many illnesses or medications can cause a raised FCp, particularly acute gastrointestinal infection which can result in significantly elevated levels. FCp should not be measured during acute or short-term diarrhoea or blood stool (< 14 days) and should always be accompanied by a stool bacterial and viral screen. Medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions including coeliac disease or graft versus host disease, and benign paediatric polyps, can also lead to typically more modest increases in FCp. Repeating an FCp if the initial result was mildly increased can help stratify the urgency of referral to specialist care, although if red flag symptoms are present a referral should not be delayed.

FCp is also routinely used as a measure of response to therapy and to monitor flares in patients with known IBD. Increasingly remote measures, including point-of-care and postal FCp, are providing reliable, flexible and patient-friendly monitoring that can guide treatment and ensure symptoms correlate with inflammation being present.
