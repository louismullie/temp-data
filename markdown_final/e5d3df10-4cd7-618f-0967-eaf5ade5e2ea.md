## Question

Colonic ileus causes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of colonic ileus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining colonic ileus and distinguishing it from mechanical obstruction. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic domains. Next, I will examine postoperative causes, followed by non-surgical causes such as metabolic, infectious, neurologic, and medication-related factors. After that, I should review rare mechanical mimics like gallstone ileus and volvulus. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchical framework and highlight high-yield clinical implications and exceptions that can mislead diagnosis, making sure I verify each claim against the best available sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate entities. Colonic ileus is best understood as an adynamic, functional impairment of colonic motility that can mimic mechanical obstruction radiographically but lacks a fixed blockage; it is a form of paralytic ileus localized to the colon and carries a risk of cecal perforation if unrecognized, particularly when the cecum dilates beyond about 9–12 cm, so I need to keep that red flag in mind [^111GgSjM] [^116GvXAR].

> Next, I should review the major etiologic buckets. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I separate neurogenic, inflammatory, pharmacologic, metabolic, infectious, and structural contributors. The literature consistently frames postoperative ileus as multifactorial with neurogenic, inflammatory, and pharmacologic mechanisms, and this triad maps neatly onto colonic ileus as well, with additional non-surgical drivers such as electrolyte disturbances, systemic illness, and drugs like opioids and anticholinergics, so I will organize causes into surgical/postoperative, non-surgical systemic, medication-induced, and rare mechanical mimics that can present similarly but are not true adynamic ileus [^114CcRJ6] [^112Ptw9E] [^1151bNNn].

> I will now examine postoperative causes, since these are the most common and mechanistically well described. Wait, let me verify the biphasic model: the early phase is neurogenic with sympathetic activation inhibiting motility, and the delayed phase is inflammatory with leukocyte infiltration of the muscularis and impaired neuromuscular function; opioids compound this by directly inhibiting propulsion, which is why multimodal opioid-sparing strategies and peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonists are emphasized in enhanced recovery pathways [^114CcRJ6] [^112Ptw9E] [^115ENUjh]. I should double-check the magnitude: major abdominal surgery typically produces 4–5 days of dysmotility without targeted measures, and colorectal surgery carries a 10–25% risk of prolonged postoperative ileus, with higher risk after open surgery, ileocolic anastomoses, and right-sided resections, which aligns with meta-analytic data and large cohort studies [^112Ptw9E] [^1134JXXj] [^116oSGm2] [^116hxwEf].

> Let me consider non-surgical systemic causes next. Electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and calcium abnormalities, impair myoelectric activity and are classic reversible contributors; endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism and diabetes can slow transit; and critical illness with SIRS or sepsis drives a systemic inflammatory milieu that suppresses colonic motility, which I should remember when evaluating ICU patients with colonic distension [^1151bNNn] [^114KryeE]. But wait, what if the patient has COVID-19? Severe COVID-19 has been repeatedly associated with paralytic ileus, likely via endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis affecting the bowel, so I need to ask about recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in the right clinical context [^111Kh8jX] [^111bVR9E].

> I need to check medication-induced causes carefully. Opioids are a major driver across perioperative and chronic settings, acting on mu-receptors to slow transit and contribute to opioid-induced constipation and ileus; anticholinergics, tricyclics, calcium channel blockers, and dopamine agonists can similarly blunt motility; and although I initially thought benzodiazepines were a classic cause, wait, I should verify — most data emphasize opioids, anticholinergics, and agents that increase sympathetic tone rather than benzodiazepines per se, so I should correct that assumption and keep the focus on opioids and anticholinergics as the principal culprits [^116M2wv3] [^115HTz6y] [^114KryeE].

> Now, infectious etiologies deserve separate attention. Fulminant Clostridioides difficile colitis can present with ileus and even toxic megacolon, and importantly, diarrhea may cease as motility fails, so a lack of diarrhea does not exclude severe disease; in ileus, intraluminal therapy with vancomycin enemas is recommended alongside oral therapy when the colon is not reachable, and I should confirm that both IDSA/SHEA and WSES endorse rectal vancomycin in this scenario [^1143h3SD] [^114GNxFW] [^1113RTyc]. Hold on, I should verify dosing: 500 mg in 100 mL saline every 6 hours as a retention enema is the standard regimen when ileus limits oral delivery [^1143h3SD].

> Next, I should review rare mechanical mimics that can be confused with colonic ileus. Gallstone ileus, including colonic gallstone ileus (gallstone coleus), typically occurs in older adults with a cholecystocolonic fistula and stone impaction in the sigmoid colon, often at a stricture; endoscopic lithotripsy can be attempted in select centers, but surgery remains common due to recurrence and fistula issues, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion when plain films show pneumobilia with obstruction [^115Lu3cS] [^114C9bWh]. Volvulus of the sigmoid or cecum causes a mechanical obstruction with characteristic radiographic findings and is a surgical emergency when ischemia is suspected, so I should confirm that my "colonic ileus" is not actually volvulus before labeling it functional [^111GMWYH] [^116cbCmv].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical framework to guide bedside thinking. Primary drivers include postoperative neurogenic and inflammatory mechanisms with opioid effects, followed by systemic metabolic derangements and critical illness, then medication-induced hypomotility, and finally infectious triggers such as C. difficile; rare structural mimics like gallstone ileus and volvulus must be excluded because they require different management. I should double-check that this hierarchy aligns with the mechanistic and epidemiologic data, which it does, noting again the biphasic model and the disproportionate impact of colorectal surgery and opioids on duration and severity [^114CcRJ6] [^112Ptw9E] [^1134JXXj].

> I will now examine clinical implications and exceptions that can mislead diagnosis. Colonic ileus can radiographically resemble obstruction, so serial exams, contrast studies, or CT may be needed to distinguish functional from mechanical causes; cecal diameter greater than about 9–12 cm risks perforation and should trigger decompression strategies, and I should remember that severe C. difficile may present with ileus and minimal diarrhea, so I must not anchor on diarrhea as a prerequisite for testing [^111GgSjM] [^116GvXAR] [^1143h3SD]. Hold on, I should verify that right-sided colectomy and ileocolic anastomoses carry higher prolonged ileus risk, which is supported by meta-analysis and large cohort data, reinforcing the need for early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, and opioid minimization in these patients [^116oSGm2] [^116hxwEf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management touchpoints are explicit. Address reversible causes such as electrolytes, stop offending drugs when feasible, implement ERAS elements including early feeding and gum chewing, consider neostigmine for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or refractory colonic ileus, and use rectal vancomycin for severe C. difficile with ileus; reserve surgery for complications or when a mechanical cause is confirmed, and escalate to decompression if cecal size increases or the patient deteriorates, documenting the rationale at each step [^116EXMwB] [^114yUd9s] [^116GvXAR] [^1143h3SD] [^116cbCmv].

---

Colonic ileus is most often due to **postoperative adynamic ileus** [^112Ptw9E] from surgical trauma, anesthesia, and opioids [^116M2wv3], with risk rising in open surgery, right-sided colectomy, and ileocolic anastomosis [^116oSGm2] [^116hxwEf]. Other common causes include **electrolyte disturbances** (notably hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and calcium imbalance) [^1151bNNn], medications (opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers), and systemic illness such as sepsis, trauma, or pancreatitis [^1151bNNn] [^114KryeE]. Less frequent causes include mechanical obstruction (volvulus, hernia, gallstone ileus) [^111GMWYH] [^115Lu3cS], ischemia, and neurologic disorders (Parkinson's, spinal cord injury) [^1151bNNn]. Management centers on correcting reversible causes, supportive care, and selective use of neostigmine or endoscopic decompression when indicated [^116GvXAR] [^116cbCmv].

---

## Postoperative causes

Postoperative ileus is the **most common cause of colonic ileus**, reflecting transient impairment of coordinated bowel activity after surgery [^112Ptw9E]. Key factors include:

- **Surgical trauma**: Manipulation of the bowel during surgery activates inhibitory neural reflexes and triggers a sterile inflammatory response in the intestinal muscularis, impairing motility [^114CcRJ6] [^112KvyHM].

- **Anesthesia and analgesia**: General anesthesia and opioids suppress gastrointestinal motility via direct effects on the enteric nervous system and opioid receptors [^116M2wv3] [^115HTz6y].

- **Open surgery and right-sided colectomy**: Open procedures and right-sided resections, particularly with ileocolic anastomosis, carry a higher risk of prolonged ileus than laparoscopic or left-sided procedures [^116oSGm2] [^116hxwEf].

---

## Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances

Electrolyte imbalances are **classically associated with colonic ileus**, especially:

- **Hypokalemia**: Reduces smooth muscle excitability and colonic transit [^notfound].

- **Hypomagnesemia and calcium imbalance**: Alter neuromuscular function and motility [^notfound].

- **Metabolic disturbances**: Hypothyroidism, diabetes, and uremia impair gastrointestinal motility [^114KryeE].

---

## Medications

Several drug classes **impair colonic motility**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Opioids | Morphine, oxycodone | - Activate μ-opioid receptors <br/> - Suppress propulsion [^116M2wv3] [^115HTz6y] |
| Anticholinergics | Atropine, scopolamine | - Block acetylcholine <br/> - Reduce smooth muscle contractility [^notfound] |
| Calcium channel blockers | Verapamil, diltiazem | Inhibit calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction [^notfound] |
| Antidepressants | Tricyclics, SSRIs | Alter autonomic tone and serotonin signaling [^notfound] |

---

## Systemic illnesses and infections

Systemic conditions can **cause colonic ileus** via inflammation, ischemia, or autonomic dysregulation:

- **Sepsis and trauma**: Systemic inflammation and cytokine release suppress motility [^notfound].

- **Acute pancreatitis**: Inflammatory mediators and peritoneal irritation cause paralytic ileus [^116jd6iY].

- **COVID-19**: Severe cases can cause paralytic ileus via microvascular ischemia and inflammation [^111Kh8jX] [^111bVR9E].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Fulminant colitis with ileus is a recognized complication [^1143h3SD] [^1148H5Qh].

---

## Mechanical obstruction and ischemia

Although colonic ileus is functional, **mechanical causes can mimic or exacerbate it**:

- **Volvulus**: Sigmoid or cecal volvulus causes obstruction and secondary ileus [^111GMWYH].

- **Hernias and adhesions**: Can cause partial obstruction with secondary ileus [^notfound].

- **Gallstone ileus**: Impacted gallstone in the colon can cause obstruction and ileus [^115Lu3cS].

- **Ischemia**: Colonic ischemia from vascular compromise causes motility failure [^notfound].

---

## Neurologic and neuromuscular disorders

Neurologic conditions can **impair colonic motility** through autonomic dysfunction or direct enteric neuropathy:

- **Parkinson's disease**: Autonomic dysfunction and enteric neuropathy cause severe constipation and ileus [^notfound].

- **Spinal cord injury**: Loss of autonomic control impairs colonic transit [^notfound].

- **Hirschsprung's disease**: Congenital aganglionosis causing functional obstruction [^notfound].

---

## Summary of causes

Colonic ileus arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of surgical, metabolic, pharmacologic, infectious, mechanical, and neurologic factors. The most common are postoperative adynamic ileus, electrolyte disturbances, and medication effects, with management focused on correcting reversible causes, supportive care, and selective use of pharmacologic or endoscopic interventions [^112Ptw9E] [^116GvXAR] [^116cbCmv].

### Pathogenesis and clinical and economic consequences of postoperative ileus [^116UQ4dv]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus is a preventable disease with surprising economic consequences. Understanding the triad of dysmotility in conjunction with an enhanced recovery program improves patient outcome, decreases length of stay in hospital, and lowers the cost. Alvimopan and other investigational promotility medications can help attain these goals. Surgeons should avoid labeling all postoperative abdominal distention as ileus, which not only prevents timely diagnosis and treatment of early postoperative small bowel obstruction or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction but also increases patient morbidity and mortality.

### Management of colonic emergencies [^116VbuMY]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The etiology of colonic emergencies includes a wide-ranging and diverse set of pathologic conditions. Fortunately, for the surgeon treating a patient with one of these emergencies, the surgical management of these various causes is limited to choosing among proximal diversion, segmental colectomy with or without proximal diversion, or a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy (or rarely, an ileorectal anastomosis). The nuanced complexity in these situations usually revolves around the nonsurgical and/or endoscopic options and deciding when to proceed to the operating room.

### Postoperative ileus: a review [^111ujv1s]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperatively, some patients experience a prolonged inhibition of coordinated bowel activity, which causes accumulation of secretions and gas, resulting in nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and pain. This prolonged inhibition can take days or weeks to resolve and often is referred to as postoperative paralytic ileus lasting more than three days after surgery. This article reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options of postoperative ileus.

Methods

The relevant literature from 1965 to 2003 was identified and reviewed using MEDLINE database of the U.S. Medical Library of Medicine. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included in this review.

Results

The pathophysiology of postoperative ileus is multifactorial. The duration of postoperative ileus correlates with the degree of surgical trauma and is most extensive after colonic surgery. However, postoperative ileus can develop after all types of surgery including extraperitoneal surgery. A variety of treatment options have been used to decrease the duration of postoperative ileus. However, it is difficult to compare these studies because of small sample sizes and differences in operations performed, anesthesia protocols provided both intraoperatively and postoperatively, patient comorbidities, and in the measured end points, such as the time to the presence of bowel sounds, flatus, or bowel movements, tolerance of solid food, or discharge from the hospital. However, despite these drawbacks, some conclusions can be made.

Conclusions

Paralytic postoperative ileus continues to be a significant problem after abdominal and other types of surgery. The etiology is multifactorial and is best treated with a combination of different approaches. Currently, the important factors that could effect the duration and recovery from postoperative ileus include limitation of narcotic use by substituting alternative medications such as nonsteroidals and placing a thoracic epidural with local anesthetic when possible. The selective use of nasogastric decompression and correction of electrolyte imbalances also are important factors to consider.

### Review of the pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus [^115HhGsQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Investigations in the pathophysiology and treatment of postoperative ileus continue to evolve. Bowel rest is no longer a mandatory component of postoperative recovery. Tolerance of enteral nutrition and normalization of the abdominal examination are more accurate indications of the resolution of postoperative ileus than passage of flatus or first bowel movement. A multimodal "fast track" recovery approach incorporated into a clinical pathway provides a more rapid return of intestinal function and shortened hospital stay in patients undergoing major, uncomplicated gastrointestinal surgery.

### Risk factors for prolonged postoperative ileus in colorectal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134JXXj]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) represents a frequent complication following colorectal surgery, affecting approximately 10–15% of these patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the perioperative risk factors for PPOI development in colorectal surgery.

Methods

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO, and LILACS databases were searched, without language or time restrictions, from inception until December 2018. The keywords used were: Ileus, colon, colorectal, sigmoid, rectal, postoperative, postoperatory, surgery, risk, factors. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Jadad scale were used for bias assessment, while the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for quality assessment of evidence on outcome levels.

Results

Of the 64 studies included, 42 were evaluated in the meta-analysis, comprising 29,736 patients (51.84% males; mean age 62 years), of whom 2844 (9.56%) developed PPOI. Significant risk factors for PPOI development were: male sex (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.25–1.63), age (MD 3.17; 95% CI 1.63–4.71), cardiac comorbidities (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.19–2.00), previous abdominal surgery (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.19, 1.75), laparotomy (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.77–3.44), and ostomy creation (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.04–1.98). Included studies evidenced a moderate heterogeneity. The quality of evidence was regarded as very low-moderate according to the GRADE approach.

Conclusions

Multiple factors, including demographic characteristics, past medical history, and surgical approach, may increase the risk of developing PPOI in colorectal surgery patients. The awareness of these will allow a more accurate assessment of PPOI risk in order to take measures to decrease its impact on this population.

### Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea… [^115rHkjt]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Histological section of colon infected with Clostridium difficile colitis. Diffuse epithelial necrosis with development of an overlying pseudomembrane containing cellular debris, leukocytes, fibrin, and mucin is seen. Vessels in the lamina propria are engorged and an inflammatory polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate is present throughout the mucosal surface. Abdominal plain radiograph showing ileus and mucosal thickening due to Clostridium difficile disease. Abdominal computerized axial tomography findings of an individual with Clostridium difficile colitis. Thickened wall of the descending colon is seen on the left side. Gross appearance of colon with multiple foci of Clostridium difficile–associated pseudomembranes with characteristic adherent yellow plaques that vary in diameter from 2 to 10 mm and can coalesce to cover large areas of the mucosa.

The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrhea to severe debilitating disease, with high fever, severe abdominal pain, paralytic ileus, colonic dilation, or even perforation. The most sensitive and specific test available for diagnosis of C difficile infection is a tissue culture assay for the cytotoxicity of toxin B. The clinical presentation of CDAD is variable and includes diarrhea, colitis without pseudomembranes, pseudomembranous colitis, and fulminant colitis. Some individuals with toxigenic strains in stool remain totally asymptomatic. 31 Mild to moderate CDAD is usually accompanied by lower abdominal cramping pain but no systemic symptoms or physical findings. 22 Moderate or severe colitis usually presents with profuse diarrhea, abdominal distention with pain, and, in some cases, occult colonic bleeding. Also, systemic symptoms such as fever, nausea, anorexia, and malaise are usually present.

22 A minority of patients have disease primarily in the cecum and right colon, presenting with marked leukocytosis and abdominal pain but little or no diarrhea. Fulminant colitis develops in approximately 1% to 3% of patients, with ileus, toxic megacolon, perforation, and death. 20 Clinicians should be aware that the development of these life-threatening complications may be accompanied by a decrease in diarrhea due to loss of colonic muscular tone and ileus. In one study, such an approach cured all 22 patients who had had multiple previous relapses. 95.

### Prolonged postoperative ileus following right-versus left-sided colectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oSGm2]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) is a common complication following colonic surgery, and is associated with longer hospital stay, greater risk of complications and substantial cost for patients and hospitals. Some reports have recently suggested that gastrointestinal (GI) recovery varies based on the side of resection (i.e., right-sided vs. left-sided colectomy). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare GI recovery by resection side.

Methods

The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched for articles reporting GI recovery outcomes in adults undergoing elective right- versus left-sided colectomy (excluding with ileostomy) of any surgical approach. The primary outcome was PPOI, and secondary outcomes included time to first passage of flatus, stool and tolerance of solid diet, and postoperative complications. Subgroup analyses of laparoscopic procedures and cohorts without inflammatory bowel disease and sensitivity analysis of adjusted multivariate results were also performed.

Results

Nine studies were identified, of which seven were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 29 068 colectomies (14 581 right-sided; 14 487 left-sided). PPOI was heterogeneously defined and was significantly more likely following right-sided compared to left-sided colectomy regardless of the surgical approach (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.32–2.39; P < 0.01; I² = 51%), as well as on subgroup analyses and adjusted multivariate meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes were reported in only a few small studies; hence meta-analysis did not produce reliable results.

Conclusion

Based on heterogeneous definitions, consistently higher rates of PPOI were observed following right- versus left-sided colectomy. These differences are currently unexplained and highlight the need for further research into the pathophysiology of ileus.

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^116M2wv3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Postoperative ileus and opioids — opioids are a mainstay of pain relief after abdominal surgery, and they inhibit gastrointestinal and colonic motility; postoperative ileus is a complex disorder with contributing factors including surgical stress, secretion of inflammatory mediators and endogenous opioids in the gastrointestinal tract, and changes in hormone levels and electrolyte and fluid balance.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^112Ptw9E]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

Ileus prevention — early postoperative feeding after elective colorectal surgery: Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of early feeding within 24 hours versus later commencement evaluated 17 RCTs and found a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99), with control group mean length of stay ranging from 6 to 24 days.

### Endogenous endotoxin participates in causing a panenteric inflammatory ileus after colonic surgery [^112KvyHM]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate muscularis inflammation and endogenous endotoxin as causes of postoperative ileus.

Background

Postoperative inflammatory ileus of the colon is associated with a significant delay in gastrointestinal transit. We investigated whether these changes are caused by the downstream obstructive barrier of the surgically altered colon or by small intestinal muscularis inflammation itself. Furthermore, we evaluated the mechanistic role of gut derived endotoxin in the development of postoperative intestinal dysfunction.

Methods

Rats underwent surgical manipulation of the colon. Isolated gastrointestinal transit was analyzed in animals with ileostomy. The perioperative emigration of intracolonic particles was investigated by colonic luminal injection of fluorescently labeled LPS and microspheres. Mediator mRNA induction was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Muscularis leukocytic infiltrates were characterized. In vitro circular muscle contractility was assessed in a standard organ bath.

Results

Ileostomy rats presented with a significant delay in small intestinal transit after colonic manipulation. This was associated with leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory mediator mRNA induction within the small intestinal muscularis. Colonic manipulation caused the transference of intracolonic LPS and microspheres into the intestinal muscularis. Postoperative in vitro small intestinal circular muscle contractility was impaired by 42% compared with controls. Gut decontamination and TLR-4 deletion significantly alleviated the small intestinal muscularis inflammation and prevented intestinal muscle dysfunction.

Conclusions

Selective colonic manipulation initiates a distant inflammatory response in the small intestinal muscularis that contributes to postoperative ileus. The data provide evidence that gut-derived bacterial products are mechanistically involved in the initiation of this remote inflammatory cascade.

### Effect of prucalopride to improve time to gut function recovery following elective colorectal surgery: randomized clinical trial [^112WiwLW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delayed return of gut motility after surgery, or postoperative ileus, is a predominant cause of delayed discharge after elective colorectal surgery. When delayed gut motility persists for 4 or more days after operation, this is called prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI). PPOI is one of the most common complications after major colorectal surgery. PPOI occurs in around 10–25 per cent of patients who undergo elective colonic or rectal surgery, and leads to significant patient morbidity and increased healthcare costs. More than 50 per cent of patients who develop PPOI develop a further complication, and patients with PPOI spend twice as long in hospital. The inpatient economic burden of PPOI is estimated to be an additional €7880 per patient affected with ileus, or €1.4 billion per year in the USA alone.

One of the key problems with delayed return to normal gut motility, and PPOI, is that there are few effective treatments, or preventative measures to reduce its burden. Postoperative ileus affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, meaning that prokinetics which only selectively target the colon or stomach, for example, are unlikely to be effective. Recent evidence suggests that the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus is mediated by an initial neurologically mediated phase and then a delayed inflammatory response to surgery in the gut, and that this inflammatory response can be diminished by drugs that potentiate vagal nerve activity. The inflammatory phase is thought to contribute to the development and duration of PPOI.

Prucalopride is a serotonin-4-receptor agonist that increases presynaptic acetylcholine release from vagal neurones, improves colonic motility, and is a gastric prokinetic. A recent trial by Gong and colleaguesshowed that administration of prucalopride after elective colorectal surgery improved time to passage of flatus and stool. Recent studies have shown that prucalopride, when given before surgery and continued in the postoperative phase, reduces the inflammatory response associated with surgery, and improves time to tolerance of diet.

The primary aim of this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial was to investigate whether prucalopride administered before operation and continued afterwards improves time to return of postoperative gut motility in patients undergoing elective colorectal resection. The secondary aim was to determine whether prucalopride reduces the incidence of PPOI after elective colorectal surgery.

### Colonic gallstone ileus [^1146aJPw]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Gallstone ileus is a rare aetiology of bowel obstruction and very infrequently occurs in the colon. Typically, colonic gallstone ileus carries a high morbidity and mortality and requires surgery. This case report describes a cholecystocolonic fistula in a patient with ulcerative colitis with resulting colonic gallstone ileus, which was successfully intervened on via an endoscopic approach.

### Modeling postoperative pathologic ileus in mice: a simplified and translational approach [^116p9vRV]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

A simple intestinal manipulation that mimics the surgeon's action causes gastrointestinal dysmotility lasting up to 4 days post‐surgery, leading to a pathogenic postoperative ileus.
The severity of this model is comparable to that observed in clinically relevant human intestinal anastomosis surgery.
This simple manipulation induces inflammation in the muscular layer, a hallmark of postoperative ileus.

### Postoperative ileus-an ongoing conundrum [^1163msgF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus is common and is a major clinical problem. It has been widely studied in patients and in experimental models in laboratory animals. A wide variety of treatments have been tested to prevent or modify the course of this disorder.

Purpose

This review draws together information on animal studies of ileus with studies on human patients. It summarizes some of the conceptual advances made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie paralytic ileus. The treatments that have been tested in human subjects (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and their efficacy are summarized and graded consistent with current clinical guidelines. The review is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of ileus, but rather a general understanding of the major clinical problems associated with it, how animal models have been useful to elucidate key mechanisms and, finally, some perspectives from both scientists and clinicians as to how we may move forward with this debilitating yet common condition.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^1172M3qC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Postoperative interventions — ileus prevention — Patients should be offered a regular diet immediately after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Across randomized studies, meta‑analyses, and observational studies, early (< 24 h) feeding accelerated GI recovery and decreased the hospital length of stay, with decreased mortality (OR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18–0.93); one randomized trial in open surgery reported no significant differences in outcomes, several studies showed benefits specifically in laparoscopic surgery within an enhanced recovery program, and providers should note that with early oral feeding the risk of vomiting increases.

### Colonic gallstone ileus: the rolling stones [^113GRz7A]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis accounting for 1–4% of cases of intestinal obstruction with a predominance in the elderly population. Unfortunately, it has an insipid presentation and is associated with significant rates of morbidity and mortality. Controversy arises over the management of gallstone ileus, and while surgery remains the mainstay of treatment, the main point of contention surrounds the extent of surgery. We describe the case of an 85-year-old woman who presented with symptoms and signs of large bowel obstruction. Radiological evaluation revealed a 5cm×3.5cm gallstone impacted in the sigmoid colon. A laparoscopic-assisted enterolithotomy alone relieved the obstruction with minimal surgical insult and allowed for a swift and uneventful recovery. Our case emphasises the need for a high index of suspicion for the condition as well as highlighting the advantages of the use of laparoscopic surgery in an emergency setting.

### Risk factors for prolonged ileus following colon surgery [^116hxwEf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged ileus is one of the most common postoperative complications after colorectal surgery. We sought to investigate the predictors of prolonged ileus following elective colon resections procedures.

Methods

The national participant user files of NSQIP databases were utilized to examine the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing elective colon resection during 2012–2013. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate predictors of prolonged ileus. Prolonged ileus was defined as no return of bowel function in 7 days.

Results

We sampled a total of 27,560 patients who underwent colon resections; of these, 3497 (12.7%) patients had prolonged ileus. Patients with ileocolonic anastomosis (ICA) had a significantly higher rate of prolonged ileus compared to patients with colorectal anastomosis (CRA) (15 vs. 11.5%, AOR 1.25, P < 0.01). Prolonged ileus was significantly associated with intra-abdominal infections (13 vs. 2.8%, AOR 2.56, P < 0.01) and anastomotic leakage (12 vs. 2.4%, AOR 2.50, P < 0.01). Factors such as preoperative sepsis (AOR 1.63, P < 0.01), disseminated cancer (AOR 1.24, P = 0.01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AOR 1.27, P = 0.02) were associated with an increased risk of prolonged ileus, whereas oral antibiotic bowel preparation (AOR 0.77, P < 0.01) and laparoscopic surgery (AOR 0.51, P < 0.01) are associated with decreased prolonged ileus risk.

Conclusions

Prolonged ileus is a common condition following colon resection, with an incidence of 12.7%. Among colon surgeries, colectomy with ICA resulted in the highest rate of postoperative prolonged ileus. Prolonged ileus is positively associated with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal infections; thus, a high index of suspicion must be had in all patients with prolonged postoperative ileus.

### Mechanisms of postoperative ileus [^114CcRJ6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus is an iatrogenic condition that follows abdominal surgery. Three main mechanisms are involved in its causation, namely neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms. In the acute postoperative phase, mainly spinal and supraspinal adrenergic and non-adrenergic pathways are activated. Recent studies, however, show that the prolonged phase of postoperative ileus is caused by an enteric molecular inflammatory response and the subsequent recruitment of leucocytes into the muscularis of the intestinal segments manipulated during surgery. This inflammation impairs local neuromuscular function and activates neurogenic inhibitory pathways, inhibiting motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms underlying the recruitment of the inflammatory cells, and their interaction with the intestinal afferent innervation, are discussed. Finally, opioids administered for postoperative pain control also contribute to a large extent to the reduction in propulsive gastrointestinal motility observed after abdominal surgery.

Ileus Prevention

21. Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (ie, within 24 hours of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower GI surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean LOS in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### Gallstone ileus of the sigmoid colon: an extremely rare cause of large bowel obstruction detected by multiplanar CT [^112puhLs]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Gallstone ileus of the sigmoid colon is an important, though extremely rare, cause of large bowel obstruction. The gallstone often enters the large bowel through a fistula formation between the gallbladder and colon, and impacts at a point of narrowing, causing large bowel obstruction. We describe the case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with features of bowel obstruction. Multiplanar abdominal CT demonstrated a cholecystocolonic fistula in exquisite detail. The scan also showed obstruction of the colon due to a large gallstone impacted just proximal to a stricture in the sigmoid. Owing to inflammatory adhesions and a stricture from extensive diverticular disease, the gallstone could not be retrieved. This frail and elderly woman was treated with a loop colostomy to relieve bowel obstruction. The patient made an uneventful recovery.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1151bNNn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Bowel obstruction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality accounting for nearly 30,000 deaths and more than $3 billion per year in direct medical costs; it is responsible for approximately 15% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the USA and ~ 20% of cases needing acute surgical care.

Bowel obstruction etiology is based on a mechanical intrinsic luminal obstruction or extrinsic compression (Table 1). Adynamic ileus and colonic pseudo-obstruction are caused by a lack of enteric propulsion. Colonic pseudo-obstruction and an adynamic ileus can be caused by drugs, trauma, postoperative period, metabolic disturbance, and other different basis.

Table 1
Causes of bowel obstruction in adults

Others*: carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, intussusception, ischemic stenosis, radiation stenosis, postanastomotic stenosis, gallstones, foreign bodies, bezoars

In 90% of cases, small bowel obstruction is caused by adhesions, hernias, and neoplasms. Adhesive small bowel obstruction represents 55–75% of small bowel obstruction cases while hernias and small bowel tumors account for the remainder. Large bowel obstruction is provoked by cancer in about 60% of cases; volvulus and diverticular disease are responsible of other 30%. Other various causes (carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, etc.) account for the remaining 10–15% of bowel obstructions. This review focuses on the management of bowel obstruction excluding duodenal mechanical obstruction to be better included in gastric outlet obstruction entity.

### American society for enhanced recovery and Perioperative Quality Initiative joint consensus statement on postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction within an enhanced recovery pathway for elective colorectal surgery [^1157Z9rf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

The primary driver of length of stay after bowel surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, is the time to return of gastrointestinal (GI) function. Traditionally, delayed GI recovery was thought to be a routine and unavoidable consequence of surgery, but this has been shown to be false in the modern era owing to the proliferation of enhanced recovery protocols. However, impaired GI function is still common after colorectal surgery, and the current literature is ambiguous with regard to the definition of postoperative GI dysfunction (POGD), or what is typically referred to as ileus. This persistent ambiguity has impeded the ability to ascertain the true incidence of the condition and study it properly within a research setting. Furthermore, a rational and standardized approach to prevention and treatment of POGD is needed. The second Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts to review the published literature and provide consensus recommendations on this important topic with the goal to (1) develop a rational definition for POGD that can serve as a framework for clinical and research efforts; (2) critically review the evidence behind current prevention strategies and provide consensus recommendations; and (3) develop rational treatment strategies that take into account the wide spectrum of impaired GI function in the postoperative period.

### Modeling postoperative pathologic ileus in mice: a simplified and translational approach [^112V5AVZ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common iatrogenic condition associated with abdominal surgery, characterized by a prolonged absence of gastrointestinal (GI) transit in response to surgical intervention. Clinically, patients suffering from POI manifest as intolerance to oral intake, abdominal distension, and impaired GI propulsion, without evidence of mechanical obstruction. It is widely accepted that a transient, self‐limiting form of POI represents a normal physiological response to abdominal surgery, typically resolving without significant complications. However, when POI becomes pathologic and prolonged, it contributes to increased patient morbidity, discomfort, and dissatisfaction, leading to extended hospital stays and higher healthcare costs.

The severity and duration of POI are largely determined by the extent of surgical trauma, with intestinal surgery being particularly associated with a high incidence of complications. Notably, patients experiencing POI face a complication rate as high as 60%, with 20% requiring admission to intensive care. Even with the implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, POI continues to pose a significant clinical challenge, particularly in colorectal surgery, where its incidence can reach 20%.

### Clinical and radiological diagnosis of gallstone ileus: a mini review [^114C9bWh]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

There are two, rare subtypes of gallstone ileus, which we will discuss herein: gallstone coleus and Bouveret's syndrome. Gallstone coleus is an extremely rare cause of mechanical large bowel obstruction, with few cases reported in the literature. It may be the result of gallstone erosion into and passage through the small bowel (and thus the ileocecal valve), or by direct erosion into the large bowel. The latter generally involves the transverse colon, which is in close anatomical proximity to the gallbladder. Although gallstone coleus due to transverse colon obstruction has been reported, by far the most common reported site of gallstone impaction is the sigmoid colon, often in association with diverticular disease. Stone impaction in gallstone coleus, as with gallstone ileus, may occur due to sheer size of the obstructing stone, or secondary to pathological narrowing of the bowel lumen due to diverticular strictures, prior pelvic irradiation, or previous surgical intervention.

Bouveret's syndrome is an even rarer type of gallstone-associated gastrointestinal obstruction, which occurs when a gallstone lodges in the duodenum, causing gastric outlet obstruction. These gallstones are typically very large in order to cause obstruction at an anatomically wide part of the gastrointestinal tract. This is estimated to occur in 1–3.5% of gallstone ileus.

### Small intestinal motility [^112v73cs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recently published studies presenting novel and relevant information on small intestinal motility in humans and animals.

Recent Findings

Mechanisms of intestinal dysmotility in patients with pseudoobstruction and colonic inertia are becoming better clarified. The role of enteric flora in health and disease is an important and rapidly evolving area that will no doubt yield significant advances in the evaluation and treatment of many digestive disorders. The role of bacterial overgrowth in irritable bowel syndrome requires further study. The mechanisms underlying postoperative ileus are becoming both better understood and increasingly complex. Peripheral opioid antagonists may represent an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of ileus. Cannabinoids also appear to play a role in ileus and this echoes our rapidly evolving understanding of these compounds in the regulation of motility.

Summary

Small intestinal motility remains an understudied area. Recent publications have shed additional light on myogenic, neural, and hormonal control mechanisms.

### Case report: paralytic ileus: a potential extrapulmonary manifestation of severe COVID-19 [^111Kh8jX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has recently spread worldwide, presenting primarily in the form of pneumonia or other respiratory disease. In addition, gastrointestinal manifestations have increasingly been reported as one of the extrapulmonary features of the virus. We report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection complicated by paralytic ileus. The first patient was a 33-year-old man who was hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilator support and intensive care. He developed large bowel dilatation and perforation of the mid-transverse colon, and underwent laparotomy and colonic resection. Histopathology of the resected bowel specimen showed acute inflammation, necrosis, and hemorrhage, supporting a role for COVID-19-induced micro-thrombosis leading to perforation. The second patient was a 33-year-old man who had severe COVID-19 pneumonia, renal failure, and acute pancreatitis. His hospital course was complicated with paralytic ileus, and he improved with conservative management. Both cases were observed to have elevated liver transaminases, which is consistent with other studies. Several authors have postulated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, the host receptors for COVID-19, that are present on enterocytes in both the small and large bowel might mediate viral entry and resultant inflammation. This is a potential mechanism of paralytic ileus in cases of severe COVID-19 infection. Recognizing paralytic ileus as a possible complication necessitates timely diagnosis and management.

### Gallstone ileus: a review [^115Lu3cS]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Involvement of impaction at the colon

For cases with impaction of the colon, selection of non-surgical treatment may be indicated, but 74% of cases with non-surgical treatment show failure. One reviewindicated that if surgery is selected, one-stage surgery is performed in majority of the cases. The sigmoid colon is the most common impaction site, mainly due to presence of intestinal stenosis caused by diverticulitis. However, some studies reported cases caused by gynaecological diseases and inguinal hernia. In such cases, cholecystocolonic fistula is the most common predicted route. A previous report provided evidence-based recommendation for one-stage surgery in cases of gallstone ileus accompanied by cholecystocolonic fistula. This is supported by the lower natural closure rate of 10% for cholecystocolonic fistula versus the other types of cholecystointestinal fistula and the high risk of retrograde cholecystitis due to reverse flow of faecal fluid from the cholecystocolonic fistula.

### Reducing the burden of postoperative ileus: evaluating and implementing an evidence-based strategy [^114qVDai]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus remains a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Over the last decade, several advances in both medical and surgical therapies have been made to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative ileus. Despite these advances, though, the incidence of ileus remains high. This narrative review focuses on interventions aimed to prevent and treat postoperative ileus while presenting a step-by-step process for implementation of an evidenced-based strategy.

Methods

A literature search was performed using Medline/PubMed, and articles related to postoperative ileus were identified. The bibliographies of all retrieved articles were reviewed to obtain additional articles of relevance.

Results

There are many factors that can influence gastrointestinal recovery that can be categorized as management-, drug-, or surgery-related. While several strategies exist to improve gastrointestinal recovery, few have been shown to reduce length of hospital stay. These strategies are described here, along with a structured approach organized by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations.

Conclusions

Postoperative ileus is associated with a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Strategies such as the development of a multidisciplinary team and the creation of a multimodal protocol are encouraged with continuous quality assurance to assess outcomes at the local level.

Ileus prevention — sham feeding with chewing gum after colorectal surgery: Sham feeding (ie, chewing gum for ≥ 10 min 3–4× daily) after colorectal surgery is safe, results in small improvements in GI recovery, and may be associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials found shorter time to first flatus (WMD −8.81 h; 95% CI, −13.45 to −4.17), shorter time to first bowel movement (WMD −16.43 h; 95% CI, −22.68 to −10.19), and reduced LOS (WMD −0.89 d; 95% CI, −1.72 to −0.07), with postoperative ileus lower in the chewing gum arm (RR 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23–0.73). In another systematic review limited to 10 randomized "high quality" trials, chewing gum was associated with lower postoperative ileus (RR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79) and faster time to first flatus (WMD −0.31 d; 95% CI, −0.36 to −0.26) and bowel movement (WMD −0.47; 95% CI, −0.60 to −0.34) but no difference in LOS; however, subgroup analysis within an ERP reported no longer significant decreases in time to flatus and LOS.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^115Z3JbH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus is a common and distressing complication after intestinal surgery. It presents clinically as impairment of intestinal motility, characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and delayed recovery of defaecatory function. For patients, this increases the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia, venous thromboembolic events, and malnutrition. For healthcare systems, it leads to a substantial economic burden associated with increased medical, nursing, dietitian, and laboratory costs. Accordingly, postoperative ileus is now recognized as a research priority by expert and public stakeholder groups.

Numerous clinical interventions have been evaluated in efforts to prevent postoperative ileus, but few have led to meaningful patient benefit. A key challenge for researchers is the absence of a standardized and agreed framework to describe the effectiveness of new interventions in clinical studies. Common outcomes include the time taken until first passage of flatus/stool, time until tolerance of oral diet, and the return of bowel sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these are sufficiently relevant to patients and healthcare professionals when evaluating new treatments and implementing them in clinical practice.

A solution to this problem is the development of an agreed core outcome set developed through patient–clinician consensus. Core outcome sets provide a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in all studies of a defined clinical condition and are supported by the Core Outcome Measures in Effective Trials (COMET) Initiative. The present report describes the international development and final content of an agreed core outcome set for postoperative ileus relevant to patients undergoing intestinal surgery.

Fulminant Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) — treatment and surgical indications are as follows: For fulminant CDI, vancomycin administered orally is the regimen of choice (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and if ileus is present, vancomycin can also be administered per rectum (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence); the vancomycin dose is 500 mg orally 4 times per day and 500 mg in approximately 100 mL normal saline per rectum every 6 hours as a retention enema, and intravenously administered metronidazole should be administered together with oral or rectal vancomycin, particularly if ileus is present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) with a metronidazole dosage of 500 mg intravenously every 8 hours. Surgical management is necessary for severely ill patients, perform subtotal colectomy with preservation of the rectum (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and diverting loop ileostomy with colonic lavage followed by antegrade vancomycin flushes is an alternative approach that may lead to improved outcomes (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients not responding to vancomycin and metronidazole, intravenously administered tigecycline (loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg 2 times per day) or passive immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (150–400 mg/kg) has been used, but no controlled trials have been performed. A rising WBC count (≥ 25 000) or a rising lactate level (≥ 5 mmol/L) is associated with high mortality and may be helpful in identifying patients whose best hope for survival lies with early surgery; subtotal colectomy is the established surgical procedure for patients with megacolon, colonic perforation, an acute abdomen, or septic shock with associated organ failure.

### Postoperative ileus-immune mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions [^1163ea5B]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a condition marked by a temporary suppression of gastrointestinal motility following abdominal surgery. The mechanism of POI encompasses various factors and is characterized by two phases: the early neurogenic phase involving both adrenergic and non-adrenergic neural pathways; the later immune-mediated phase is characterized by a sterile inflammatory response that lasts several days. Activation of muscularis macrophages triggers a sterile inflammatory process that results in dysfunction of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and a reversible inhibition of gastrointestinal motility.

Purpose

In this minireview, recent insights in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying POI and potential new therapeutic strategies are described.

Ileus prevention — alvimopan for open colorectal surgery: Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. A systematic review up to May 2020 identified 31 studies of alvimopan in colorectal surgery, of which 23 demonstrated a positive effect and 8 reported no effect; of the 6 randomized trials, 4 were positive and 2 showed no effect. Several RCTs and pooled post hoc analyses reported accelerated recovery of GI function with alvimopan 6- and 12-mg doses and a significantly shorter hospital LOS in the alvimopan 12-mg group for patients undergoing open surgery. A Cochrane review of 9 studies found alvimopan better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased GI transit time and constipation and that it was safe and efficacious in decreasing postoperative ileus, but studies were limited to open surgery patients without an ERP in place, and there have been no randomized trials after laparoscopic surgery.

Introduction

Colonic gallstone ileus is a rare adverse event of cholelithiasis. The sigmoid is the most common segment of colonic impaction. The management of colonic gallstone ileus has been primarily surgical in nature. Endoscopic maneuvers, however, have been applied with lower success rates. Endoscope-guided laser lithotripsy has sometimes been applied in ERCP with cholangioscopy as well as Bouveret syndrome, but rarely has it been reported as a modality for impacted colonic gallstones.

This article will review the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus, with emphasis on potential therapeutic targets, and examine the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Proposed mechanisms include actuation of spinal and local sympathetic neural reflexes, inflammatory mediation, and exacerbation by anesthetic or surgical procedures. Some procedures or agents have shown clinical benefit, and these include use of laparoscopic surgery, thoracic epidurals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiate antagonists. Other procedures may be helpful with low risk of adverse effects. These include early feeding and ambulation, laxatives, and possibly neostigmine.

Opioid-related gastrointestinal effects — across esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon — are outlined as follows: opioid receptors densely populate the gastrointestinal tract with symptoms and side effects expected; esophageal dysmotility may manifest with dysphagia and a syndrome indistinguishable from primary achalasia; the stomach can exhibit a marked delay in gastric emptying with postprandial nausea and early satiety; postoperative opioid-induced ileus may ensue, and in the colon, opioid-induced constipation is common; a unique syndrome termed narcotic bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic abdominal pain often accompanied by nausea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable causes; with recognition of these effects, novel drugs have been developed that use this physiology.

### Gastrointestinal electrical stimulation as prevention of postoperative ileus – A blinded randomized controlled porcine trial [^115r3r82]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In this study we aimed to assess the effect of postoperative electrical sigmoid colonic stimulation on length of POI. The study successfully demonstrated a significant improvement in bowel function in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings are very promising and potentially of great clinical importance. If this intervention can be translated into clinical practice, it would be of great benefit for future patients due to a faster recovery, as well as reducing health care costs.

### Neostigmine resolves critical illness-related colonic ileus in intensive care patients with multiple organ failure – a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116NXw22]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Critical illness-related colonic ileus (CIRCI) is characterized by the non-passage of stools in critically ill patients as a result of the absence of prokinetic movements of the colon, while the upper gastrointestinal tract functions properly and mechanical ileus is absent: We investigated whether neostigmine resulted in defecation in patients with CIRCI.

Design

Double-blinded, placebo-controlled prospective study.

Setting

Eighteen-bed intensive care unit.

Patients

Thirty ventilated patients with multiple organ failure with CIRCI for > 3 days.

Intervention

Continuous intravenous administration of neostigmine 0.4–0.8 mg/h over 24 h, or placebo.

Measurements and Results

Time to first defecation and adverse reactions were recorded. Thirty patients were randomized, 24 could be evaluated. The mean prestudy time was 5 days, mean APACHE II score on admission was 23.2, and mean MOF score on the day of the study was 6.4. Of the 13 patients receiving neostigmine, 11 passed stools, whereas none of the placebo-treated patients passed stools (P < 0.001). After 24 h, the non-responders received in a cross-over fashion neostigmine or placebo respectively. Eight out of the 11 neostigmine patients now passed stools (mean 11.4 h), and none of the placebo patients. Overall, in none of the patients did passage of stools occur during placebo infusion, whereas 19 of the 24 neostigmine-treated patients had defecation (79%). No acute serious adverse effects occurred, but three patients had ischemic colonic complications 7–10 days after treatment.

Conclusion

Continuous infusion of 0.4–0.8 mg/h of neostigmine promotes defecation in ICU patients with a colonic ileus without important adverse reactions.

### Opioids in gastroenterology: treating adverse effects and creating therapeutic benefits [^113HyW5c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The use of opioid medications on both an acute and chronic basis is ubiquitous in the United States. As opioid receptors densely populate the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms and side effects can be expected in these patients. In the esophagus, dysmotility may result, manifesting with dysphagia and a syndrome indistinguishable from primary achalasia. In the stomach, a marked delay in gastric emptying may occur with postprandial nausea and early satiety. Postoperatively, particularly with abdominal surgery, opioid-induced ileus may ensue. In the colon, opioid-induced constipation is common. A unique syndrome termed narcotic bowel syndrome is characterized by chronic abdominal pain often accompanied by nausea and vomiting in the absence of other identifiable causes. With the recognition of the important role of opioids on gastrointestinal function, novel drugs have been developed that use this physiology. These medications include peripheral acting opioid agonists to treat opioid-induced constipation and combination agonist and antagonists used for diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. This review summarizes the most recent data in these areas.

### Evaluation and management of intestinal obstruction… [^117PDvxM]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Ongoing dilation of the intestine increases luminal pressures. When luminal pressures exceed venous pressures, loss of venous drainage causes increasing edema and hyperemia of the bowel. This may eventually lead to compromised arterial flow to the bowel, causing ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A closed-loop obstruction, in which a section of bowel is obstructed proximally and distally, may undergo this process rapidly, with few presenting symptoms. Intestinal volvulus, the prototypical closed-loop obstruction, causes torsion of arterial inflow and venous drainage, and is a surgical emergency. In patients with small bowel obstruction, supine views show dilation of multiple loops of small bowel, with a paucity of air in the large bowel. Those with large bowel obstruction may have dilation of the colon, with decompressed small bowel in the setting of a competent ileocecal valve. Upright or lateral decubitus films may show laddering air fluid levels.

These findings, in conjunction with a lack of air and stool in the distal colon and rectum, are highly suggestive of mechanical intestinal obstruction. CT findings in patients with intestinal obstruction include dilated loops of bowel proximal to the site of obstruction, with distally decompressed bowel. The presence of a discrete transition point helps guide operative planning. Absence of contrast material in the rectum is also an important sign of complete obstruction. For this reason, rectal administration of contrast material should be avoided. A C-loop of distended bowel with radial mesenteric vessels with medial conversion is highly suspicious for intestinal volvulus. Thickened intestinal walls and poor flow of contrast material into a section of bowel suggests ischemia, whereas pneumatosis intestinalis, free intra-peritoneal air, and mesenteric fat stranding suggest necrosis and perforation.

Treatment Management of intestinal obstruction is directed at correcting physiologic derangements caused by the obstruction, bowel rest, and removing the source of obstruction. The former is addressed by intravenous fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluid. The use of a bladder catheter to closely monitor urine output is the minimum requirement for gauging the adequacy of resuscitation; other invasive measures, such as arterial canalization or central venous pressure monitoring, can be used as the clinical situation warrants. Antibiotics are used to treat intestinal overgrowth of bacteria and translocation across the bowel wall.

What is PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution?

PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution is a prescription medicine used by adults to clean the colon before a colonoscopy or barium enema X-ray examination. PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution cleans your colon by causing you to have diarrhea (loose stools). Cleaning your colon helps your healthcare provider see the inside of your colon more clearly during your colonoscopy.

It is not known if PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution is safe and effective in children.

Who should not take PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution?

Do not take PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution if your heathcare provider has told you that you have:

a blockage in your bowel (obstruction)
an opening in the wall of your stomach or intestine (bowel perforation)
problems with food and fluid emptying from your stomach (gastric retention)
a very dilated intestine (toxic megacolon)
a problem with food moving too slowly through your intestines (ileus).
an allergy to any of the ingredients in PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution.

### Identification of clinical outcome measures for recovery of gastrointestinal motility in postoperative ileus [^114fo4FW]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify clinical hallmarks associated with recovery of gastrointestinal transit.

Background

Impaired gastrointestinal transit or postoperative ileus largely determines clinical recovery after abdominal surgery. However, validated clinical hallmarks of gastrointestinal recovery to evaluate new treatments and readiness for discharge from the hospital are lacking.

Methods

Gastric emptying and colonic transit were scintigraphically assessed from postoperative day 1 to 3 in 84 patients requiring elective colonic surgery and were compared with clinical parameters. The clinical hallmark that best reflected recovery of gastrointestinal transit was validated using data from a multicenter trial of 320 segmental colectomy patients.

Results

Seven of 84 patients developed a major complication with paralytic ileus characterized by total inhibition of gastrointestinal motility and were excluded from further analysis. In the remaining patients, recovery of colonic transit (defined as geometric center of radioactivity ≥ 2 on day 3), but not gastric emptying, was significantly correlated with clinical recovery (ρ = -0.59, P < 0.001). Conversely, the combined outcome measure of tolerance of solid food and having had defecation (SF + D) (area under the curve = 0.9, SE = 0.04, 95% CI = 0.79–0.95, P < 0.001), but not time to first flatus, best indicated recovery of gastrointestinal transit with a positive predictive value of 93% (95% CI = 78–99). Also in the main clinical trial, multiple regression analysis revealed that SF + D best predicted the duration of hospital stay.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that the time to SF + D best reflects recovery of gastrointestinal transit and therefore should be considered as primary outcome measure in future clinical trials on postoperative ileus.(Netherlands National Trial Register, number NTR1884 and NTR222).

### Case report: paralytic ileus: a potential extrapulmonary manifestation of severe COVID-19 [^117YNANF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a growing body of evidence describing large bowel involvement in COVID-19 infection. Carvalho et al.described a case of SARS-CoV-2 gastrointestinal infection causing acute hemorrhagic colitis with endoscopic findings of coloproctopathy but normal histologic findings. Sattar et al.reported three cases of COVID-19 with colonic findings, including colitis and air in the bowel wall.

However, there are few reports of paralytic ileus in patients with COVID-19. Kaafarani et al.described a series of 141 critically ill patients with COVID-19, where half of the patients developed hypomotility-related complications of variable severity. Only two patients were diagnosed with a colonic paralytic ileus (Ogilvie's syndrome). Similarly, the patient in case 1 had extensive large bowel dilatation and mid-transverse colon perforation. Histopathology of the resected bowel specimen showed fat necrosis, acute inflammation, reactive fibroblastic proliferation, and hemorrhage. However, the mesenteric vessels were patent on imaging, suggesting that the etiology could be SARS-CoV-2–induced micro-thrombosis. It has been hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes vascular endothelial cell inflammation, leading to impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds.

Moreover, Bhayana et al.reported bowel wall abnormalities in 31% of abdominal CT scan images in COVID-19 patients, including pneumatosis and portal venous gas. The patients were found to have bowel infarction due to ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in the arterioles. Our second case had diffuse distension of both small bowel and large bowel but responded well to conservative management. The development of ileus, in this case, may also be explained by electrolyte derangement, as the patient had hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. However, SARS-CoV-2 may cause ileus in an independent mechanism, as alluded previously.

Our cases were both observed to have elevated liver transaminases. In a systematic review, abnormal liver enzyme levels were noted in 15–20% of patients. Studies by Mao et al.and Guan et al.found that patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of abnormal liver function.

### Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction [^116GvXAR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is characterized by clinical and radiological evidence of acute large bowel obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause. The condition usually affects elderly people with underlying co-morbidities, and early recognition and appropriate management are essential to reduce the occurrence of life-threatening complications.

Methods

A part-systematic review was conducted. This was based on key publications focusing on advances in management.

Results and Conclusions

Although acute colonic dilatation has been suggested to result from a functional imbalance in autonomic nerve supply, there is little direct evidence for this. Other aetiologies derived from the evolving field of neurogastroenterology remain underexplored. The rationale of treatment is to achieve prompt and effective colonic decompression. Initial management includes supportive interventions that may be followed by pharmacological therapy. Controlled clinical trials have shown that the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine is an effective treatment with initial response rates of 60–90 per cent; other drugs for use in this area are in evolution. Colonoscopic decompression is successful in approximately 80 per cent of patients, with other minimally invasive strategies continuing to be developed. Surgery has thus become largely limited to those in whom complications occur. A contemporary management algorithm is provided on this basis.

Key Points

Daikenchuto (DKT) has been used to treat constipation and postoperative ileus. This study clarifies the effect of DKT on motor patterns and transits activity in the isolated rat colon.
Daikenchuto induced peristaltic contraction via enteric nervous system in rat colon and increased colonic transit activity.
The propulsive motor effect of DKT may contribute to the improvement of constipation and postoperative ileus in the colon.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^115iKxpE]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2017). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery — alvimopan: Alvimopan is recommended to hasten recovery after open colorectal surgery, although its use in minimally invasive surgery remains less clear, with a grade of recommendation of strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. In open abdominal surgery, several randomized controlled trials and pooled post hoc analyses showed accelerated recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function with alvimopan 6- and 12-mg doses versus placebo and a significantly shorter hospital length of stay in the 12-mg group; one large RCT (n = 911) did not report a significant overall advantage but a post hoc analysis found benefit in patients receiving patient-controlled analgesia. A Cochrane review of 9 studies affirmed that alvimopan was better than placebo in reversing opioid-induced increased GI transit time and constipation and that it was safe and efficacious in treating postoperative ileus, though these studies were in open laparotomy with no ERP in place. For laparoscopic colorectal surgery, results are conflicting: some data showed decreased postoperative ileus without significant decreases in length of stay, a meta-analysis of 5 studies reported a 75% relative risk reduction in postoperative ileus with no impact on length of stay or readmission, other reports found no benefit when used with an ERP, and a case-matched retrospective review > 6000 patients showed no added benefit to patient outcomes with potential cost savings if alvimopan was eliminated, while other retrospective reviews reported cost savings.

American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guideline — large-bowel obstruction (LBO) epidemiology and colonic volvulus definition: In adults, LBO results from mechanical or nonmechanical causes, and the 3 most common mechanical causes include obstructing colon or rectal cancer, diverticular stricture, and colonic volvulus. Colonic volvulus is the twisting of a redundant segment of colon on its mesentery that may lead to luminal occlusion in and proximal to the volvulized segment and compromise of colonic blood supply resulting in ischemia, gangrene, and potentially perforation. Colonic volvulus accounts for 10% to 15% of all large-bowel obstructions in the United States and western Europe, with a slightly higher rate in India, Africa, and the Middle East (the so-called "volvulus belt"). Although volvulus can occur in any redundant colonic segment, it most commonly involves the sigmoid (60%–75% of all cases) and cecum (25%–40% of all cases). Sigmoid volvulus preferentially affects older men in the United States and westernized countries, although younger men are more commonly affected in the volvulus belt.

### Maximizing readmission reduction in colon cancer patients [^113FRQBC]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple studies have identified risk factors for readmission in colon cancer patients. We need to determine which risk factors, when modified, produce the greatest decrease in readmission for patients so that limited resources can be used most effectively by implementing targeted evidence-based performance improvements. We determined the potential impact of various modifiable risk factors on reducing 30-d readmission in colon cancer patients.

Methods

We used a cohort design with the 2012–2020 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data to track colon cancer patients for 30 d following surgery. Colon cancer patients who received colectomies and were discharged alive were included. Readmission (to the same or another hospital) for any reason within 30 d of the resection was the outcome measure. Modifiable risk factors were the use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus open colectomy, mechanical bowel preparation, preoperative antibiotic use, functional status, smoking, complications (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, infections, anastomotic leakage, prolonged postoperative ileus, extensive blood loss, and sepsis), serum albumin, and hematocrit.

Results

111,691 patients with colon cancer were included in the analysis. About half of the patients were male, most were aged 75 or older, and were discharged home. Overall, 11,138 patients (10.0%) were readmitted within 30 d of surgery. In adjusted analysis, the reduction in readmission would be largest by preventing both prolonged ileus and by switching open colectomies to MIS (28.0% relative reduction) followed by preventing anastomotic leaks (6.2% relative reduction). Improving other modifiable risk factors would have a more limited impact.

Conclusions

The focus of readmission reduction should be on preventing prolonged ileus, increasing the use of MIS, and preventing anastomotic leaks.

### Critical analysis of the causes of in-hospital mortality following colorectal resection: a queensland audit of surgical mortality (QASM) registry study [^111AF8TW]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has also found that right hemicolectomy was the most common resection type resulting in in-hospital mortality. This is despite the fact that many surgeons believe it to be less technically demanding than left-sided resections, with anastomotic leak rates of right-sided anastomoses also lower compared to left-sided anastomoses. Our findings are similar to Wilkins et al. who reported that following colorectal cancer resection, right hemicolectomy was the greatest contributor to the number of deaths in the early post-operative period; and that 4.8% of right hemicolectomy patients died within 30 days post-operative compared to 1.9% of left hemicolectomy patients. These findings may be due to prolonged post-operative ileus (POI), which has been described to be highly associated with right-sided colonic resection. Ileo-colic anastomoses have been demonstrated to have a significantly higher rate of prolonged ileus compared to colo-rectal anastomoses, potentially due to bacterial translocation and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth caused by ileo-caecal valve resection. In addition, duodenal manipulation required in right-sided colonic mobilisation may induce a surge of adrenergic neuronal activity which additionally reduces gastric motility and may result in foregut ileus and ultimately aspiration. It may also be that the anastomotic leak rate is higher in right-sided resections but this was not a subject of investigation in this study and our data was not adept to examine this.

The limitation of this study was that although the qualitative surgical narrative allowed for a highly specific cause of death to be identified, confirmation bias could not be avoided as the SCF was written by the surgeon in hindsight. Their determination of the cause of death may have depended on their judgement of the events. Nonetheless in Australia, the cause of death is determined by the primary medical team and unless unexpected, it does not need to be verified by an independent reviewer. Whilst there was no chart review undertaken to verify the SCF, QASM data have previously been described as having a high concordance with medical records.

### Incidence of ileus and associated factors in patients with acute pancreatitis: a nationwide analysis [^114KryeE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of ileus in patients with AP in the US using a large database drawn from the inpatient population. Our analysis revealed the prevalence of ileus in AP to be 3.6%. The association with ileus differed by age group. The elderly population (age > 65 years) was at higher risk of developing ileus compared to the younger population (age < 45). This association may be due to the longer colonic transit time noted in the elderly. Long-standing chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, which are more often seen in the elderly, may also decrease gastrointestinal motility. In addition, many frequently used drugs in this patient population, such as anticholinergics, opioids and antidepressants, are associated with disordered gastrointestinal motility, which could also explain the higher risk of ileus.

Interestingly, females had a 44% lower risk of ileus compared to males, despite existing literature suggesting that females might be at higher risk due to slower colonic motility. Racial differences were also noted in our study. Hispanics were noted to have a lower risk of ileus than Whites and African Americans. Differences were also noted based on the income quartile. Interestingly, the highest risk of developing ileus was noted in patients in the higher-income quartiles compared to the lower-income quartiles. Further research is needed to study the underlying factors responsible for age, sex, race, and income disparities.

Our study found that patients admitted to larger hospitals are at higher risk of developing ileus. Large hospitals often serve as transfer centers for patients with higher acuity from small and medium sized hospitals, which might contribute to the higher incidence of ileus. No differences were noted in the rates of ileus based on the teaching status or the location of the hospital. The risk of ileus also increased with the number of comorbidities. Patients with 3 or more comorbidities had a 54% higher risk than those without comorbidities.

In another systematic review and meta-analysis that only included ten randomized trials that were deemed "high quality", the use of chewing gum was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative ileus (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.79) and faster time to first flatus (WMD − 0.31 days, 95% CI − 0.36 to − 0.26) and bowel movement (WMD − 0.47, 95% CI − 0.60 to − 0.34), but no difference in length of stay. However, the trials included in this meta-analysis suffered from many of the same limitations pertaining to heterogeneity and variable perioperative management strategies that were present in the prior studies. Nonetheless, the overall body of literature suggests that chewing gum may only have a small effect on gastrointestinal recovery without a clear effect on length of stay but is safe and not costly.

There are even some data to support the use of coffee to facilitate gastrointestinal recovery after colorectal surgery. Caffeine and coffee may stimulate the lower gastrointestinal tract and can potentially reduce postoperative ileus. A meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials including 606 patients reported that drinking coffee decreased the time to first bowel movement and toleration of oral intake, but did not reduce time to flatus, overall complications, or length of stay.

Enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery — nasogastric tubes and intra-abdominal drains: The routine use of intra-abdominal drains and nasogastric tubes for colorectal surgery should be avoided. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Nasogastric tubes should not be routinely used and should be reserved for patients with postoperative ileus refractory to more conservative management; RCTs show that patients without nasogastric tubes have no difference in nausea, vomiting, time to return of bowel function, or increased length of stay versus those with tubes and tolerate oral intake 2 days earlier, while tube use is associated with a significantly higher risk of complications, notably pharyngolaryngitis. For intra-abdominal drains, there are no data to support routine use to identify and prophylactically treat anastomotic leaks; available RCTs show no significant difference in mortality, leak, or composite postoperative complications with drainage, and meta-analyses show no added benefit in benign or malignant disease. The location of the anastomosis in relation to the peritoneal reflection does not appear to impact the use of drainage.

### The role of mast cell stabilization in treatment of postoperative ileus: a pilot study [^115TBovv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although postoperative ileus (POI) is considered multifactorial, intestinal inflammation resulting from manipulation-induced mast cell activation is recognized as an important pathophysiological mechanism. Therefore, mast cell stabilization may represent a new therapeutic approach to shortening POI. The aim of this paper was to study the effect of ketotifen, a mast cell stabilizer, on postoperative gastrointestinal transit in patients who underwent abdominal surgery.

Methods

In this pilot study, 60 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for gynecological malignancy with standardized anesthesia were randomized to treatment with ketotifen (4 or 12 mg) or placebo. Patients were treated for 6 days, starting 3 days before surgery. Gastric emptying of liquids, selected as a primary outcome parameter, was measured 24 h after surgery using scintigraphy. Secondary end points were (scintigraphically assessed) colonic transit, represented as geometrical center of activity (segment 1(cecum) to 7(stool)) and clinical parameters.

Results

Gastric retention 1 h after liquid intake was significantly reduced by 12 mg (median 3% (1–7), P = 0.01), but not by 4 mg ketotifen (18% (3–45), P = 0.6) compared with placebo (16% (5–75)). Twenty-four hour colonic transit in placebo was 0.8 (0.0–1.1) vs. 1.2 (0.2–1.4) colon segments in the 12 mg ketotifen group (P = 0.07). Abdominal cramps were significantly relieved in patients treated with 12 mg ketotifen, whereas other clinical parameters were not affected.

Conclusions

Ketotifen significantly improves gastric emptying after abdominal surgery and warrants further exploration of mast cell stabilizers as putative therapy for POI.

### Modeling postoperative pathologic ileus in mice: a simplified and translational approach [^112wLy4U]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Economic analyses highlight the substantial financial burden of POI, with U.S. healthcare expenditures for its management rising from $7.1 billion in 2001 to $12.3 billion in 2011. Direct costs per patient increased by approximately €8233, representing a more than 60% increase per hospitalization. Therefore, the early restoration of postoperative intestinal function is critical not only for improving clinical outcomes and quality of life, particularly in gastrointestinal surgeries, but also for reducing hospital length of stay, increasing hospital bed turnover, and conserving medical resources. Although various strategies have been proposed to mitigate the duration of POI, their efficacy remains limited, and no single treatment has been proven to be definitively superior.

The precise mechanisms underlying POI are not fully understood. Surgical opening of the peritoneal cavity and manipulation of the digestive tract initiate a biphasic response. The initial "neurogenic phase", mediated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, occurs within the first few hours post‐surgery. This is followed by a later, inflammation‐driven phase, beginning 3–4 h postoperatively and persisting for several days, which is believed to be the most clinically relevant. No animal model to date has precisely replicated POI in the context of digestive sutures or anastomoses, procedures that are routinely performed in humans following digestive resections. This development induced by intra‐abdominal surgery was designed to closely replicate the effects of abdominal surgery on the digestive system and to support a standardized method for studying POI in mice. This accurate model will allow us to investigate the underlying mechanisms of POI and evaluate new therapeutic strategies.

### Fecal impaction: a cause of isolated small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs [^116HNefU]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of isolated small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs in patients with colonic fecal impaction and also to elucidate the cause of this finding.

Methods

A computerized search of radiology files revealed 515 patients with colonic fecal impaction on abdominal radiographs. The radiologic reports described isolated small bowel dilatation not related to other known causes of ileus or obstruction in 18 (3.5%) of the 515 patients. The films were reviewed to determine the distribution of fecal impaction and the degree and extent of small bowel dilatation. In 16 cases, medical records were reviewed to determine the clinical presentation, treatment, and course. Finally, follow-up radiographs were reviewed in four cases to determine the response to treatment of the impaction.

Results

All 16 patients with available medical records had abdominal symptoms. The average diameter of the dilated small bowel on abdominal radiographs was 3.7 cm. Fourteen patients (78%) had a diffuse colonic fecal impaction (nine) or a predominantly right-sided fecal impaction (five) that involved the cecum, and the remaining four (22%) had a left-sided colonic fecal impaction. All 12 patients with clinical follow-up had resolution of symptoms and all four with follow-up radiographs had resolution of small bowel dilatation after treatment of the underlying impaction.

Conclusion

Fecal impaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small bowel dilatation on abdominal radiographs, as treatment of the underlying impaction usually produces a dramatic clinical response with resolution of the small bowel dilatation on follow-up radiographs.

### Incidence and risk factors for severity of postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery: a prospective registry data analysis [^115sAii4]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Defining severe postoperative ileus in terms of consequences could help physicians standardize the management of this condition. The recently described classification based on consequences requires further investigation. The aim of this study was to obtain a snapshot of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing colorectal surgery within enhanced recovery programs and to identify factors associated with non-severe and severe postoperative ileus.

Methods

This prospective registry data analysis was conducted in 40 centers in five different countries. A total of 786 patients scheduled for colorectal surgery within enhanced recovery programs were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence rate of postoperative ileus as defined by Vather et al. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients experienced postoperative ileus (15.4%). Non-severe POI occurred in 48 patients (6.1%), and severe postoperative ileus occurred in 73 patients (9.3%). In multivariate analysis, the male gender and intra-abdominal complications were associated with severe postoperative ileus: odd ratio (OR) = 2.03 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–3.59], p = 0.01 and OR = 3.60 [95% CI 1.75–7.40], p < 0.0001, respectively. Conversely, open laparotomy and urinary retention were associated with non-severe POI: OR = 3.03 [95% CI 1.37–6.72], p = 0.006 and OR = 2.70 [95% CI 0.89–8.23], p = 0.08, respectively.

Conclusions

Postoperative ileus occurred in 15% of patients after colorectal surgery within enhanced recovery programs. For 60% of patients, this was considered severe. The physiopathology of these two entities could be different, severe POI being linked to intraabdominal complication, while non-severe POI being linked with risk factors for "primary" POI. The physician should pay attention to male patients having POI after colorectal surgery and look for features evocating intraabdominal complications.

### Gallstone ileus and fatal gallstone coleus: the importance of the second stone [^114VwkNe]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A patient was admitted as an emergency with bowel obstruction. Recent medical history included an episode of gallstone ileus treated surgically by removal of an enteric calculus. On this admission, an obstructing calculus was removed from the descending colon (gallstone coleus) at laparotomy. However, the postoperative course was complicated by sepsis and the patient died. A CT scan on the second admission and cytology results from a liver abscess suggested gallbladder malignancy as the underlying cause of the cholecystoenteric fistula. The technical challenge and increased mortality associated with cholecystoenteric fistula repair supports simple enterolithotomy as the preferred management of gallstone ileus. However, this case supports the need for a systematic search for all enteric stones at laparotomy and consideration of concurrent or interval cholecystectomy and cholecystoenteric fistula repair to prevent recurrent gallstone ileus and determine underlying pathology.

### Randomized controlled trial: neostigmine for intra-abdominal hypertension in acute pancreatitis [^116jd6iY]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common disease of the digestive system. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with persistent organ failure is associated with an increased risk of death. Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as a persistent increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) ≥ 12 mmHg, according to the World Society for Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS). IAH is considered to be an early risk factor in the development of SAP. In a prospective study, IAH was diagnosed in 17% of patients with AP, resulting in a mortality rate of 37%.

The inflammatory state of AP sparks a cascade of pancreatic and visceral edema, acute peripancreatic fluid collections, ascites, gut injury with paralytic ileus and gastric dilatation, leading to elevated IAP. When IAP rises above 20 mmHg, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and organ failure ensue. AP complicated by ACS is associated with a mortality rate of 49%. Although surgical decompression can promptly improve ACS, it causes substantial morbidity. Thus, non-operative strategies for reducing IAH in AP patients are preferred, including nasogastric decompression, promotility agents and percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD), etc. Neostigmine is an anti-cholinesterase drug that can enhance intestinal peristalsis, promoting the passage of flatus and defecation. Treatment with neostigmine effectively induces colonic decompression among those patients with colonic pseudo-obstruction. The WSACS has suggested neostigmine be used for the treatment of established colonic ileus associated with IAH that does not respond to other simple measures. No robust evidence exists, however, on the effects of pharmacological promotility therapy for IAP or outcomes among those with IAH/ACS. Whether neostigmine can effectively reduce IAP and is beneficial in AP is unclear. In addition, confirmation of colonic ileus requires an abdominal X-ray typically in a standing position or computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, likely to be unsuitable for patients with organ failure or hemodynamical instability during the early phase of AP. Paralytic ileus is a common risk factor for IAH in patients with AP. If conventional treatment fails to correct IAH, there may be persistent paralytic ileus contributing to IAH, in which case neostigmine treatment may be beneficial.

This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of neostigmine in reducing IAP in patients with AP and persistent IAH following 24 h of conventional treatment, whether or not colonic pseudo-obstruction was established by X-ray or computerized tomography.

### Pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus in adults and neonates: a review [^1172GrdJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI) is caused by enteric neural dysfunction and inflammatory response to the stress of surgery as well as the effect of anesthetics and opioid pain medications. POI results in prolonged hospital stays, increased medical costs, and diminished enteral nutrition, rendering it a problem worth tackling. Many cellular pathways are implicated in this disease process, creating numerous opportunities for targeted management strategies. There is a gap in the literature in studies exploring neonatal POI pathophysiology and treatment options. It is well known that neonatal immune and enteric nervous systems are immature, and this results in gut physiology which is distinct from adults. Neonates undergoing abdominal surgery face similar surgical stressors and exposure to medications that cause POI in adults. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing adult and neonatal literature on POI pathophysiology and management and explore applications in the neonatal population.

Colonic pseudo-obstruction is often secondary to disturbances in the enteric nervous system and can be difficult to treat definitively. Treatment options primarily focus on conservative measures and medical management with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Surgeons should feel comfortable with endoscopic decompression when necessary. Rarely, acute colonic pseudo-obstruction will require surgery because of impending perforation, and it is imperative that surgeons recognize indications for operative intervention.

### Establishing core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in studies of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction: protocol for a nested methodological study [^114bwQJ8]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal recovery describes the restoration of normal bowel function in patients with bowel disease. This may be prolonged in two common clinical settings: postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction. Improving gastrointestinal recovery is a research priority but researchers are limited by variation in outcome reporting across clinical studies. This protocol describes the development of core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in the contexts of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction.

Method

An international Steering Group consisting of patient and clinician representatives has been established. As overlap between clinical contexts is anticipated, both outcome sets will be co-developed and may be combined to form a common output with disease-specific domains. The development process will comprise three phases, including definition of outcomes relevant to postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction from systematic literature reviews and nominal-group stakeholder discussions; online-facilitated Delphi surveys via international networks; and a consensus meeting to ratify the final output. A nested study will explore if the development of overlapping outcome sets can be rationalized.

Dissemination and Implementation

The final output will be registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative. A multi-faceted, quality improvement campaign for the reporting of gastrointestinal recovery in clinical studies will be launched, targeting international professional and patient groups, charitable organizations and editorial committees. Success will be explored via an updated systematic review of outcomes 5 years after registration of the core outcome set.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the role of endoscopy in the management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and colonic volvulus [^116cbCmv]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline — epidemiology and clinical overview states that colonic volvulus and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) are 2 causes of benign large-bowel obstruction, with colonic volvulus occurring most commonly in the sigmoid colon. Large-bowel obstruction accounts for approximately 25% of all intestinal obstructions. Colonic volvulus is the most common cause of benign mechanical obstruction and accounts for approximately 3.5% of all cases of large-bowel obstruction in the United States and up to 50% in areas such as Africa and the Middle East. For ACPO, the exact pathophysiology is poorly understood, with the prevailing hypothesis being altered regulation of colonic function by the autonomic nervous system resulting in colonic distention in the absence of mechanical blockage. Prompt diagnosis and intervention leads to improved outcomes for both diagnoses, and endoscopy may play a role in the evaluation and management of both entities.

COLONIC VOLVULUS AND PSEUDO‐OBSTRUCTION

Introduction

The term 'volvulus' is used to describe an abnormal twist of the stomach, small intestine or colon. This can lead to impaired blood supply, ischaemia, infarction and/or perforation. Volvulus of any aspect of the GI tract is a general surgical emergency. The most common area of the GI tract to develop volvulus in adults is the colon, with the sigmoid and caecum being particularly at risk. Volvulus leads to between 2% and 15% of all large bowel obstructions in the developed world but the incidence varies greatly across the globe.

The evidence base for volvulus of the colon is poor and there are few evidence‐based recommendations available to guide clinical practice. A similar lack of synthesized evidence is available for pseudo‐obstruction, a functional distention of the colon without an underlying structural blockage. There is an estimated incidence of 100 cases in 100 000 admissions to US hospitals. Pseudo‐obstruction can occur after other non‐GI insults such as burns, cardiac and orthopaedic procedures, intercurrent illnesses or after caesarean section. As such, pseudo‐obstruction, also known as Ogilvie's syndrome, is a common reason for inter‐specialty referrals to the general surgical team.

Previous literature has demonstrated variability in the clinical management of patients with these conditions and there are few UK standards or recommendations. However, there is recently published guidance from the ASCRS.

Colonic volvulus

Question 5.1

Are there any diagnostic clinical features of colonic volvulus?

Recommendation: A combination of abdominal distention, complete/absolute constipation and known risk factors (elderly, frail, comorbidity, constipation and neurological conditions) should alert the clinician to the possibility of a colonic volvulus.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

The clinical presentation of sigmoid and caecal volvulus is that of large bowel obstruction. Abdominal distention, cramping abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea are commonplace. Volvulus appears to be associated with a wide, long mesocolon compared with control patients, rendering a mesenteric twist easier to occur. The specific mechanism by which the twist occurs, however, is unclear. Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal and transverse colonic volvulus is rare.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112sQXCh]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has a number of strengths, including its randomized study design, the use of blinded outcome assessors, and its compliance with the CONSORT checklist, where applicable. However, there are several potential limitations. First, despite being the largest and first multicenter trial of its kind, the sample size was relatively modest, with only 96 patients analyzed. The trial was also terminated early largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, an interim analysis demonstrated superiority for the intervention, and as such, risk for type II error was less relevant. Second, each participating hospital was allowed to use their own site-specific ERP which may have impacted postoperative outcomes. Studies have reported an association between the number of ERP components and risk for postoperative complications. However, it would have been difficult to ask each site to adhere to a uniform ERP, and this was a pragmatic trial. Third, patients who declined study entry represent a possible source of selection bias, as non-participation may not have been at random. Finally, the intervention was limited to patients with residual colon in-situ, and these results are not applicable to patients with history of total proctocolectomy.

Intestinal obstruction in the newborn is a potentially life-threatening complication. The most common causes are meconium plug, meconium ileus, intestinal atresia, intestinal malrotation, and Hirschprung's disease. We present an unusual case of intestinal obstruction caused by torsion of an ovarian cyst. The left fimbria and ovary swirled around the sigmoid colon, causing colonic stricture.

### Successful endoscopic laser lithotripsy in 2 cases of bouveret syndrome and cholecystocolonic fistulae-induced colonic obstruction: a minimally invasive approach [^1156Wzmh]. VideoGIE (2024). Medium credibility.

Although isolated instances of Bouveret syndrome treated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) have been reported, most have yielded unfavorable outcomes. ESWL may be considered when gallstone accessibility is challenging but often necessitates multiple sessions. Presently, no studies definitively determine the most effective endoscopic modality.

In cases in which endoscopic therapy proves unsuccessful, surgery typically becomes the recommended course of action. Surgical intervention, along with cholecystectomy and closure of cholecystoenteric fistulae, is generally reserved for healthy, younger patients in whom the risk of recurrence outweighs the surgical risks. The closure of cholecystoenteric fistulae is frequently considered unnecessary, as spontaneous closure may occur, especially in the absence of residual stones.

Successful endoscopic treatment of colonic gallstone ileus has been documented using mechanical lithotripsy, EHL, and ESWL. As far as our knowledge extends, this is the first case report of successful endoscopic treatment using laser lithotripsy for colonic gallstone ileus.

Within the limitations of the endoscopic procedure for Bouveret syndrome and gallstone ileus is the fact that the equipment may not be readily available in all medical settings. Also, cases are very rare, and the experience that endoscopists have using holmium laser in Bouveret syndrome or gallstone ileus is low. Patients with these pathologies could be referred to centers with endoscopists that are acquainted with the use of holmium laser in digestive procedures and thus centralize the cases and increase the experience of these specialists.

In conclusion, management of Bouveret syndrome and colonic gallstone ileus presents a complex array of treatment options, with endoscopic approaches playing a pivotal role. Notably, the use of holmium laser lithotripsy has demonstrated effectiveness and safety, as evidenced by the limited but promising cases reported in the literature. When successful extraction of the obstructing gallstone is achieved, our recommendation is to consider this as a viable alternative to a mandatory interval cholecystectomy. This approach not only spares patients the risks associated with surgical intervention but also offers a minimally invasive and efficacious means of resolving these challenging conditions. Further research and comprehensive studies are needed to establish laser lithotripsy's long-term outcomes and its place as a preferred treatment option in the management of these rare but serious clinical entities (Video 1, available online at).

### Effect of caffeine on colonic manometry in children [^1111GDX6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

As previously noted, use of caffeinated and decaffeinated products has been shown to decrease postoperative time to bowel movement and postoperative ileus. Our study supports this by showing objective colonic stimulatory results with coffee (DC and CC). A previous review by Nawrot et al discussed multiple small studies on caffeine in the pediatric population ranging from 5 to 21 years of age. Max caffeine doses were 10 mg/kg/day or 400 mg/day. These studies were heterogeneous, but seemed to suggest positive cognitive outcomes, with variation in negative outcomes such as anxiety. Based on adult studies, negative effects were seen most in those with history of panic disorder and doses > 400 mg/day. International data suggest average consumption in pediatric patients in the United States is 1 mg/kg/day, while in other countries it can go up to 3 mg/kg/day. The paper suggests that < 2.5 mg/kg/day should be consumed in pediatrics. At these doses it appears to be safe and could allow for limited use in settings such as postoperative ileus. Additionally, physiological response to drinking coffee (urge to defecate/defecation) may serve as a predictive model to colonic function as only patients with normal colonic studies consistently displayed this response.
