## Question

aspirin use for coronary artery calcifications on ct scan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to decide whether to start aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline risk assessment. Then, I should verify the role of CAC in refining risk and the specific thresholds that change aspirin decisions. Next, I will examine the balance of ischemic benefit versus bleeding harm at different CAC strata. After that, I need to check guideline positions and consensus statements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and highlight special populations and caveats, ensuring I anchor this in shared decision-making and the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk framing. Adults aged 40–75 years being considered for primary prevention should have their 10-year ASCVD risk estimated with the Pooled Cohort Equations and undergo a clinician–patient risk discussion before any pharmacologic therapy, including aspirin, is initiated; CAC is best used selectively when the decision about aspirin remains uncertain after this initial assessment, particularly in borderline or intermediate risk ranges [^116wu7D9] [^113pTD23] [^1135p1LP].

> I need to verify the role of CAC in refining risk and identifying who might benefit from aspirin. CAC directly quantifies calcified coronary plaque burden and is a strong, independent predictor of ASCVD events; importantly, CAC augments risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors and can meaningfully reclassify patients at decision thresholds, which is precisely where aspirin decisions are most ambiguous [^114KprZm] [^1115yHEU] [^1136soUb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the specific CAC thresholds that matter for aspirin. Multiple analyses converge on CAC ≥ 100 as the key inflection point where the estimated ischemic benefit of aspirin begins to outweigh bleeding risk in appropriately selected patients, whereas CAC = 0 generally identifies a group with sufficiently low ischemic risk that aspirin is not favored. CAC ≥ 300 often confers risk comparable to secondary prevention cohorts and strengthens the case for aspirin when bleeding risk is acceptable [^11569cWp] [^112EMGY8] [^1139ACaj] [^113hM9UA].

> Next, I should review the benefit–harm balance by CAC category. In patients with CAC ≥ 100 and low bleeding risk, modeling and cohort data show a favorable net clinical benefit for aspirin, with a lower number needed to treat (NNT) for ASCVD events than number needed to harm (NNH) for major bleeding. Conversely, in those with CAC = 0, the NNT exceeds the NNH, indicating likely net harm from aspirin. At CAC 1–99, the balance is generally unfavorable for aspirin unless other compelling risk enhancers are present, so I should be cautious and individualize here [^11569cWp] [^112EMGY8] [^1139ACaj].

> Wait, let me verify bleeding risk considerations because they can overturn otherwise favorable estimates. High bleeding risk (prior GI bleed, age > 70, chronic kidney disease, anticoagulant use, etc.) shifts the calculus toward harm even at higher CAC scores; in such patients, aspirin should generally be avoided regardless of CAC, and if anticoagulation is already indicated for another reason, dual therapy with aspirin should be avoided in stable chronic coronary disease unless there is a separate compelling indication [^112EMGY8] [^1155h6WH].

> I should confirm guideline alignment to ensure I'm not overextending observational data. The 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guideline allows consideration of low-dose aspirin for select adults 40–70 years at higher ASCVD risk but not at high bleeding risk, and supports using CAC to refine risk discussions; the National Lipid Association recommends aspirin 81 mg when CAC ≥ 100 in the absence of bleeding contraindications; the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography similarly supports aspirin consideration when CAC > 100; the USPSTF advises individualizing aspirin for ages 40–59 with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk and low bleeding risk, with CAC often informing that decision in practice [^116wu7D9] [^111B3Jey] [^114GpmeR] [^1169KHVQ].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases so I don't miss important nuances. In diabetes, CAC retains strong prognostic value and may help identify subgroups where aspirin could be considered, but many such patients already have sufficient baseline risk to warrant intensive risk-factor therapy without needing CAC to justify aspirin. In younger adults, a nonzero CAC can signal high lifetime risk and may prompt earlier preventive therapy, though evidence for routine CAC testing under age 40–45 is limited. In patients with incidental CAC on noncardiac chest CT, moderate or severe calcification generally corresponds to CAC ≥ 100 and should trigger preventive therapy discussions, including aspirin if bleeding risk is low [^114pyRcc] [^116w75ar] [^112LvWAP].

> I will now examine practical implementation details to ensure safe prescribing. If proceeding with aspirin, use low-dose regimens (typically 75–100 mg daily) and confirm no contraindications such as active GI ulcer disease, recent bleeding, or concurrent anticoagulation; document the shared decision-making conversation that weighs modest absolute risk reduction against bleeding risk; and reassess periodically, as changes in bleeding risk or new ischemic events can alter the net benefit over time [^116PgChc] [^1135p1LP].

> But wait, what if the CAC is very high, like ≥ 400–1000? Does that change the threshold or dose? Very high CAC scores track with near-secondary-prevention levels of risk, which strengthens the rationale for aspirin when bleeding risk is acceptable; however, the dose remains low-dose aspirin rather than dual antiplatelet therapy in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome or recent PCI, so I should avoid over-treating with additional antiplatelets in stable patients [^113hM9UA] [^112BjXV8].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise approach and double-check it aligns with evidence. First, calculate 10-year ASCVD risk and assess bleeding risk. Second, if aspirin remains uncertain after risk-enhancing factors are considered, obtain CAC. Third, if CAC ≥ 100 and bleeding risk is low, discuss and offer low-dose aspirin with clear counseling on benefits and harms. If CAC = 0, avoid aspirin and prioritize lifestyle and statin decisions. If CAC 1–99, generally avoid aspirin unless compelling risk enhancers are present. Throughout, use shared decision-making and document the discussion and rationale [^116wu7D9] [^111B3Jey] [^112EMGY8].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that CAC meaningfully refines aspirin decisions in primary prevention: CAC ≥ 100 identifies a subgroup with sufficient atherosclerotic burden that the ischemic benefit of low-dose aspirin likely exceeds bleeding harm when bleeding risk is low, whereas CAC = 0 supports deferring aspirin. This strategy is consistent with contemporary guidelines and observational modeling, though randomized trials specifically testing CAC-guided aspirin allocation are still needed, so individualized, shared decision-making remains essential [^11569cWp] [^112EMGY8] [^116wu7D9].

Aspirin is **not routinely recommended** for primary prevention based solely on coronary artery calcification (CAC) on CT. It may be considered for patients with **CAC ≥ 100** [^111B3Jey] who are at **borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk** (≥ 5% 10-year risk) [^112EMGY8] and have **low bleeding risk** [^114GpmeR], after shared decision-making [^1169KHVQ]. Aspirin is **not recommended** when CAC is 0 or 1–99, or when bleeding risk is elevated [^112EMGY8]. For secondary prevention or for patients with established ASCVD, aspirin is indicated regardless of CAC [^116PgChc].

---

## Evidence supporting aspirin use in patients with coronary calcifications

Several studies and expert consensus statements suggest that aspirin may benefit patients with **elevated CAC scores**, particularly those with **CAC ≥ 100** [^111B3Jey]:

- **MESA study**: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) found that patients with CAC ≥ 100 had a favorable risk-benefit ratio for aspirin use, with a lower number needed to treat (NNT) for cardiovascular events compared to the number needed to harm (NNH) for bleeding events [^11569cWp].

- **Dallas Heart Study**: This study demonstrated that patients with CAC ≥ 100 and low bleeding risk derived net benefit from aspirin therapy, whereas those with CAC = 0 or higher bleeding risk did not benefit [^112EMGY8].

- **SCCT consensus**: The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) recommends considering aspirin therapy for patients with CAC > 100, provided they have low bleeding risk [^114GpmeR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements provide the following **recommendations** regarding aspirin use in patients with coronary calcifications:

| **Guideline/statement** | **Recommendation regarding aspirin use** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2019 Primary Prevention Guidelines | - Low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) may be considered for adults aged 40–70 years at higher ASCVD risk but not at high bleeding risk [^112evdqi] [^116g2K1h] |
| SCCT 2017 Expert Consensus | - Aspirin therapy should be considered for most patients with CAC > 100, provided there are no bleeding contraindications [^114GpmeR] |
| National Lipid Association (NLA) 2020 | - Aspirin 81 mg daily is reasonable for patients with CAC ≥ 100 who are not at high bleeding risk [^111B3Jey] [^1139ACaj] |
| ESC 2024 Chronic Coronary Syndromes Guidelines | - Lifelong aspirin (75–100 mg daily) is recommended for patients with chronic coronary syndromes, including those with significant coronary artery calcifications [^111zMxq7] |

## Risks and benefits of aspirin therapy

Aspirin therapy carries both potential benefits and risks. Benefits include a **reduction in cardiovascular events** (myocardial infarction, stroke) in high-risk patients with elevated CAC scores [^112EMGY8], whereas risks include an **increased risk of major bleeding** (gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke), particularly in patients with higher bleeding risk profiles [^1169KHVQ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

The decision to initiate aspirin therapy in patients with coronary calcifications should be individualized, taking into account the following factors:

- **Age**: Younger patients with elevated CAC scores may benefit more from aspirin therapy, whereas older patients may have higher bleeding risks [^11569cWp].

- **Gender**: Gender-specific differences in cardiovascular risk and bleeding risk should be considered [^116w75ar].

- **Bleeding risk**: Patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, or concurrent anticoagulant therapy have higher bleeding risks and may not benefit from aspirin therapy [^112EMGY8].

- **Overall cardiovascular risk**: Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking) may benefit more from aspirin therapy [^1169KHVQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where aspirin may be beneficial

Aspirin therapy may be particularly beneficial in the following **clinical scenarios**:

- **CAC score ≥ 100**: Patients with moderate to severe coronary calcifications (CAC ≥ 100) [^111B3Jey] and low bleeding risk may benefit from aspirin therapy [^112EMGY8].

- **Intermediate cardiovascular risk**: Patients with intermediate cardiovascular risk (5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk) [^117XA5ie] and elevated CAC scores may benefit from aspirin therapy [^112EMGY8].

- **Secondary prevention**: Patients with established ASCVD or chronic coronary syndromes benefit from aspirin therapy regardless of CAC score [^116PgChc].

---

## Clinical scenarios where aspirin may not be beneficial or may be contraindicated

Aspirin therapy may not be beneficial or may be contraindicated in the following **clinical scenarios**:

- **CAC score = 0**: Patients with no coronary calcifications (CAC = 0) [^116LF3wL] have low cardiovascular risk and may not benefit from aspirin therapy [^11569cWp].

- **High bleeding risk**: Patients with high bleeding risk [^1169KHVQ] (history of gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, concurrent anticoagulant therapy) should not receive aspirin therapy [^112EMGY8].

- **Low cardiovascular risk**: Patients with low cardiovascular risk (< 5% 10-year ASCVD risk) [^notfound] may not benefit from aspirin therapy [^112EMGY8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Aspirin therapy may be beneficial for patients with coronary calcifications, particularly those with **CAC scores ≥ 100** [^111B3Jey] and low bleeding risk [^112EMGY8]. The decision to initiate aspirin therapy should be individualized, considering patient-specific factors such as age, gender, bleeding risk, and overall cardiovascular risk. Shared decision-making between clinicians and patients is essential to balance the potential benefits and risks of aspirin therapy [^1135p1LP].

### Potential implications of coronary artery calcium testing for guiding aspirin use among asymptomatic individuals with diabetes [^114M9gcF]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

It is unclear whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) is effective for risk stratifying patients with diabetes in whom treatment decisions are uncertain.

Research Design and Methods

Of 44,052 asymptomatic individuals referred for CAC testing, we studied 2,384 individuals with diabetes. Subjects were followed for a mean of 5.6 ± 2.6 years for the end point of all-cause mortality.

Results

There were 162 deaths (6.8%) in the population. CAC was a strong predictor of mortality across age-groups (age < 50, 50–59, ≥ 60), sex, and risk factor burden (0 vs. ≥ 1 additional risk factor). In individuals without a clear indication for aspirin per current guidelines, CAC stratified risk, identifying patients above and below the 10% risk threshold of presumed aspirin benefit.

Conclusions

CAC can help risk stratify individuals with diabetes and may aid in selection of patients who may benefit from therapies such as low-dose aspirin for primary prevention.

### Is there a role for coronary artery calcium scoring for management of asymptomatic patients at risk for coronary artery disease? clinical risk scores are not sufficient to define primary prevention treatment strategies among asymptomatic patients [^114yJ9C3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although risk factors have proven to be useful therapeutic targets, they are poor predictors of risk. Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS and even when combined cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging. As clinicians, are we willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization? The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be a careful one because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most, and the least, net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy. When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at the present time, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.

### Coronary artery calcium score as a graded decision tool [^114s9FvF]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

A key lesson from the CAC Consortium was the appreciation for the prognostic value implied by a CAC score of 0. These participants were identified as a population group with favorable all-cause prognosis and stable low 12-year rates of CVD mortality. Thus, CAC scoring can be used as an important decision aid in de-risking patients. Based on the mounting evidence favoring CAC as a risk stratification tool, and particularly a CAC score of 0 as a negative risk factor, Greenland et alhave distilled the current knowledge into an approach for selective use of CAC scoring to guide shared decision-making in the primary prevention of CVD.

Additionally, several studies have looked at the use of CAC to guide aspirin and antihypertensive therapy in primary prevention. Cainzos-Achirica et alexamined 6,470 participants from the MESA registry and determined that among aspirin-naive individuals < 70 years old without high bleeding risk, the NNT with aspirin to prevent 1 CVD event was higher or similar to the number needed to harm across different CVD risk categories. However, subgroups with higher CAC scores of > 100 (especially > 400) showed a much lower NNT compared to number needed to harm, indicating probable net benefit from aspirin use. The authors concluded that CAC scoring could provide improved risk assessment compared to the pooled cohort equations when guiding aspirin allocation in primary prevention.

### Aspirin for primary prevention in patients with elevated coronary artery calcium score: a systematic review of current evidences [^111t6b9J]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2019 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines regarding low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) indicate an increased risk of bleeding without a net benefit. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score could be used to guide aspirin therapy in high-risk patients without an increased risk of bleeding. With this systematic review, we aimed to analyze studies that have investigated the role of CAC in primary prevention with aspirin. A total of 4 relevant studies were identified and the primary outcomes of interest were bleeding events and major adverse cardiac events. The outcomes of interest were stratified into 3 groups based on CAC scoring: 0, 1 to 99, and ≥ 100. A study concluded from 2,191 patients that with a low bleeding risk, CAC ≥ 100, and ASCVD risk ≥ 5% aspirin confers a net benefit, whereas patients with a high bleeding risk would experience a net harm, irrespective of ASCVD risk or CAC. All other studies demonstrated net benefit in patients with CAC ≥ 100 with a clear benefit. CAC scores correspond to calcified plaque in coronary vessels and are associated with graded increase in adverse cardiovascular events. Our review has found that in the absence of a significant bleeding risk, increased ASCVD risk and CAC score corelate with increased benefit from aspirin. A study demonstrated a decrease in the odds of myocardial infarction from 3 to 0.56 in patients on aspirin. The major drawback of aspirin for primary prevention is the bleeding complication. At present, there is no widely validated tool to predict the bleeding risk with aspirin, which creates difficulties in accurately delineating risk. Barring some discrepancy between studies, evidence shows a net harm for the use of aspirin in low ASCVD risk (< 5%), irrespective of CAC score.

### The role of coronary artery calcium in allocating pharmacotherapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: the ABCs of CAC [^113rRmo5]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Determining optimal candidates for the numerous potential pharmacotherapies for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains challenging. Selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is recommended by the 2018 and 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Cholesterol and Primary Prevention Guidelines as a tool for refining cardiovascular disease risk assessment. A growing body of research shows that CAC has potential value in allocation of primary prevention aspirin, determining blood pressure targets and treatment intensity, the intensity of cholesterol management, and use of the more expensive medications for type 2 diabetes. We also review the literature regarding very elevated CAC scores greater than 400 or 1000 and how these scores appear to confer a risk for cardiovascular disease on par with secondary prevention cohorts.

3 ALLOCATION OF ASPIRIN FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION WITH CAC

Despite the highly prevalent use of aspirin for primary prevention of ASCVD historically, new data has called into question the overall benefit of aspirin given the associated increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. In response, the 2019 ACC/AHA Primary Prevention of ASCVD guideline changed the recommendation for low‐dose aspirin from Class I to Class IIb in select adults at elevated ASCVD risk but not elevated bleeding risk.

A 2014 study of 4229 aspirin‐naïve subjects from the MESA cohort investigated the role of CAC in identifying optimal candidates for primary prevention aspirin. Five‐year number needed to treat (NNT) estimates were calculated using a threshold of 18% RR reduction (RRR) in coronary events, and 5‐year number needed to harm (NNH) estimates were calculated using major bleeding risk from prior studies. Individuals with CAC ≥ 100 were determined to have an estimated likely net benefit with aspirin (low NNT, high NNH), while those with CAC of 0 had an estimated net harm. After consideration of these data, the Society of Cardiovascular CT recommended the strong consideration of aspirin in most patients with CAC > 100 who do not have elevated bleeding risk (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Advanced CAC scores identifies a population with very elevated ASCVD risk (equivalent to that in secondary prevention cohorts) who may benefit from aggressive preventive treatments. ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC, coronary artery calcium; SPRINT, Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.

A subsequent 2020 analysis of 3540 MESA participants who were not at elevated bleeding risk was performed after the release of the updated ACC/AHA guidelines, strengthening the prior study's findings by using updated meta‐analysis data and observed bleeding rates to generate NNH. The 5‐year NNT was created from a 12% RRR in ASCVD events, and the 5‐year NNH was created from a 42% RR increase in major bleeding events. Again, CAC ≥ 100 identified subjects who likely would derive a net benefit from aspirin, and subjects with CAC of 0 would likely have net harm, irrespective of the subjects' underlying ASCVD risk.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116UNdVo]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing — statin withholding, reassessment, and exceptions: Caveats state that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a coronary artery calcium score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions, such as cigarette smoking, family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or diabetes mellitus, are present and to reassess coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years; moreover, if CAC scoring is recommended, it should be performed in facilities that have current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation dose. Clinicians should not downclassify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a family history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.

### How to diagnose and manage radiation cardiotoxicity [^113zbmTV]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

How do we manage CV risk in survivors treated with thoracic RT?

This patient had several risk factors for RT cardiotoxicity, including an RT dose > 35 Gy, anthracycline exposure, was 26 years from RT, and had hyperlipidemia. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study CV risk calculator classified her as high risk, with a 10% probability of developing heart failure or CAD by age 50 years. Consensus statements recommend aggressive CV risk factor modification to prevent CV events. However, her atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score of 1% categorized her as very low risk, with the recommendation to not initiate statins. Current CV disease prevention guidelines do not include RT as a risk modifier. Thus, in patients age 30 years or older with high-risk features and an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease score < 7.5%, we extrapolate from the literature on CV risk prediction and often consider coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to refine CV risk assessment and to guide primary prevention statin and aspirin therapy. If CAC = 0, we recommend no statin or aspirin therapy; if CAC = 0 to 99, statins may be considered; and if CAC ≥ 100, we recommend statin and aspirin therapy (Figure 1). Many patients undergo routine noncardiac computed tomography for cancer staging or surveillance. The presence of vascular calcification on these scans can also be used to identify at-risk patients who may benefit from aggressive risk factor modification. In addition, BP should be controlled to a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, and survivors should be screened and treated for diabetes according to established guidelines. All patients should be advised to eat a heart healthy diet and to participate in 150 min/week of moderate to vigorous exercise (Figure 1).

ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CPET = cardiopulmonary exercise testing; CT = computed tomography; CV = cardiovascular; CVD = cardiovascular disease; HbA1C = glycosylated hemoglobin; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging.

Key points

- Traditional CV risk factors increase the risk of radiation cardiotoxicity.
- Monitoring and guideline-based modification of CV risk factors is recommended to reduce radiation cardiotoxicity.

### Significant incidental cardiac disease on thoracic CT: what the general radiologist needs to know [^1119NYdN]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease

Coronary arterial calcification (CAC) is a marker of the burden of coronary artery atherosclerosis but its relationship to plaque instability is less predictable. Coronary arterial calcification can be an early indicator of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic individuals being worked up for surgery or other suspected chest pathology. Coronary artery disease was the most frequent cardiac finding on chest CT in prior studies with the left anterior descending coronary artery being the most frequently involved. The same authors note that the presence of coronary arterial calcification was often not mentioned in chest CT reports. Coronary arterial calcification can be easily seen even on non-ECG gated unenhanced CT. Radiologists interpreting chest CT should not only evaluate the anatomic origin of the coronary arteries but also evaluate for the extent and severity of coronary arterial disease. Patients with coronary arterial calcification have increased risk for cardiac events, including ischemia, arrhythmia, hypotension, myocardial infarction, coronary arterial intervention or surgery, and death. For each standard deviation increase in CAC scores on non-ECG gated CT, the odds ratio for death increased by 50%, when adjusted for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Detection of coronary arterial calcification might enable the patient to undergo primary preventative measures such as dietary changes, exercise, aspirin, or statin treatment. Coronary arterial calcification has a high specificity and negative predictive value. In patients who are undergoing CT prior to surgery, it is important for the surgeon and anesthetist to know about the coronary arterial calcification burden, as the patient may need functional imaging or cardiology consultation first or a different surgical approach or anesthetic plan.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115zqGXp]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) consensus — summary identifies asymptomatic patient populations who may benefit from individualized risk prediction with coronary artery calcium (CAC), including those who prefer CAC testing, have questionable ASCVD risk estimates based on the PCE, or prefer to avoid pharmacotherapy in the absence of CAC; adjunct CAC use is also identified in lung or breast cancer screening populations, evidence supports CAC for refining ASCVD risk and reclassification above PCE with supportive series such as MESA and clinical trials showing improved adherence, and it is the committee's consensus that CAC more accurately predicts ASCVD risk than the PCE and other non-traditional tests, provides an opportunity to modify treatment recommendations, improves adherence to therapies and healthy behaviors, and potentially reduces poor adherence in asymptomatic at-risk patients.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^117JnzZs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs) are defined as a range of clinical presentations or syndromes that arise due to structural and/or functional alterations related to chronic diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation. While chronic coronary diseases are often stable for long periods, they are progressive and may suddenly develop into acute coronary syndromes.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of CCS have been updated based on changing epidemiology, diagnostic and risk prediction strategies, risk classification, and new evidence in the field for CCS, as well as medical therapy landscapes. One of the notable updates to the guidelines concerns the recommendation for low-dose aspirin in patients without prior myocardial infarction or revascularization but with evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This recommendation has been upgraded from class IIb in 2019 to class Ib in 2024.

The key pathological mechanism underlying most epicardial CAD is atherosclerosis, a complex process that develops over many years and even decades before stenosis. The degree of stenosis was traditionally used to assess an individual's cardiovascular (CV) risk and determine whether the patient requires preventive therapy. Obstructive coronary stenoses have typically been defined using visual thresholds of either 50% or 70% stenosis, and stenosis of ≥ 50% is usually an indication for secondary prevention level therapy.

However, increasing evidence demonstrates that both nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, detected by coronary computed tomography angiography, confer an increased long-term risk of major adverse CV events and mortality. In fact, atherosclerotic plaque burden, and not stenosis per se, appears to be the main predictor of CV events over a mid-term time horizon. Atherosclerotic plaque burden can be determined in a number of ways, including coronary computed tomography angiography, the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, and carotid ultrasound. Aspirin is of particular interest since in guidelines it generally remains in the "obstructive CAD" paradigm as opposed to the "plaque burden" paradigm. However, we believe that the quantification of plaque burden can help individualize the allocation of aspirin.

Coronary artery calcification on LDCT — coronary artery calcification assessed on a nongated or lung cancer screening LDCT scan is predictive of increased risk of cardiovascular deaths and major events, and the STR recommends reporting a simple visual assessment of coronary artery calcification on all nongated CT scans; two practical approaches include a simple visual assessment (none, mild, moderate, severe) and a prediction algorithm using known characteristics, but in one study reporting calcification changed aspirin or statin therapy in only 5% of patients; it is reasonable that lung cancer screening CT reports include a simple assessment of coronary artery calcification.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: It is time to start stepping away [^115yQDFN]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

When interpreting these findings, there are some caveats to note. First, the dose of aspirin therapy varied across trials although it is reassuring that in a sensitivity analysis, there was no significant difference in risk of MI or of major bleeding with aspirin ≤ 100 mg/d vs > 100 mg/d. Furthermore, this meta-analysis was based on aggregate data from trials with varied participants, outcomes, and follow-up. Similarly, ASCVD and bleeding risk were based on aggregate-level data, which may not accurately reflect individual-level risk.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings of this analysis have important implications for clinicians. Ultimately, in primary prevention patients — especially those already on statin therapy — the absolute risks of aspirin appear to outweigh the benefits at every level of risk. However, this unfavorable risk-benefit ratio is not reflected in aspirin use in the general population. Indeed, among primary prevention adults aged ≥ 40 years, 23.4% (approximately 29 million individuals) take aspirin for prevention of ASCVD; of these, nearly one-quarter (6.6 million individuals) do so without a clinician's recommendation. Furthermore, nearly half of the people older than 70 years without known ASCVD report taking aspirin for primary prevention. These sobering statistics underscore the widespread prevalence of inappropriate aspirin use.

However, before we stop aspirin in all primary prevention patients, we must consider the increasing number of patients who fall in the "grey zone" between primary and secondary prevention, such as those with subclinical atherosclerosis found on imaging. Several epidemiologic studies indicate that individuals with elevated coronary artery calcification scores may have more favorable risk-benefit ratios with aspirin therapy than those without any calcification. Similarly, observational studies suggest that people with elevated lipoprotein(a) may benefit from aspirin therapy, even in the absence of known ASCVD. However, rigorous, randomized trials of aspirin therapy in these high-risk populations are lacking. Thus, shared decision-making and personalized risk classification are still of utmost importance when deciding about any therapy for ASCVD prevention.

Overall, the analysis by Khan et alprovides added insights into the decreasing role of aspirin therapy in primary prevention, helping to guide our discussions with patients who are understandably confused about whether or not they should take aspirin daily. This study highlights that while decision-making about preventive therapies should be tailored to and made in conjunction with patients, we need to start stepping away from the routine use of aspirin therapy in primary prevention, especially in the modern era of statins.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: an evidence-based guide for primary care physicians [^112NgB7R]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary care physicians often must decide whether statin therapy would be appropriate (in addition to lifestyle modification) for managing asymptomatic individuals with borderline or intermediate risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as assessed on the basis of traditional risk factors. In appropriate subjects, a simple, noninvasive measurement of coronary artery calcium can help clarify risk. Coronary atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, with atherosclerotic plaque formation involving intimal inflammation and repeated cycles of erosion and fibrosis, healing and calcification. Atherosclerotic plaque formation represents the prognostic link between risk factors and future clinical events. The presence of coronary artery calcification is almost exclusively an indication of coronary artery disease, except in certain metabolic conditions. Coronary artery calcification can be detected and quantified in a matter of seconds by noncontrast electrocardiogram-gated low-dose X-ray computed tomography (coronary artery calcium scoring [CACS]). Since the publication of the seminal work by Dr. Arthur Agatston in 1990, a wealth of CACS-based prognostic data has been reported. In addition, recent guidelines from various professional societies conclude that CACS may be considered as a tool for reclassifying risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients otherwise assessed to have intermediate risk, so as to more accurately inform decisions about possible statin therapy in addition to lifestyle modification as primary preventive therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of CACS, from acquisition to interpretation, and summarize the scientific evidence for and the appropriate use of CACS as put forth in current clinical guidelines.

### Predictive values of coronary artery calcium and arterial stiffness for long-term cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^113LHp9Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Contrary to CAVI, the CAC score is more widely used and studies support its use as a screening test to guide treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. As for a process of model selection, our findings support the hypothesis that adding high CAC score (≥ 100) into the model which contained only clinical risk factors could increase the magnitude of MACE risk beyond that obtained from clinical risk factors alone. Similar to the MESA findings, participants with CAC scores ≥ 100 have more than a 4.2‐fold higher risk for a CAD event and 2.8‐fold higher risk for a CVD event compared with those with a CAC score = 0. A CAC score ≥ 100 is also associated strongly, and in a graded fashion, with a 10‐year risk of ASCVD (including stroke) above 7.5%. In the recent 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines on primary prevention of CVD, CAC score was the only noninvasive test recommended to guide statin prescription in intermediate‐risk patients with a CAC score ≥ 100.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is still controversial. Preliminary findings suggest that CAC score may also help guide decisions for initiating (or deferring) antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention. Recently, the MESA researchers suggested that patients with CAC scores ≥ 100 may be a good candidates for aspirin therapy for primary prevention, although the net benefit is expected to be modest. Importantly, in patients with a CAC score of zero, the risk of bleeding appears to be greater than the potential benefit, so aspirin therapy for primary prevention should be avoided. We recently reported that CAC scores are directly related to the risk of a future MI. The preventive effect of antiplatelet therapy was clearly demonstrated in subjects with CAC scores ≥ 100, but again, this benefit was partially offset by an increased risk of bleeding.

### Cardiac computed tomography for personalized management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114pyRcc]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increasing in the United States and worldwide. The individual-level risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in primary prevention populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly heterogeneous. Accurate risk stratification in this group is paramount to optimize the use of preventive therapies. Herein, we review the use of the coronary artery calcium score as a decision aid in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to guide the use of preventive pharmacotherapies, such as aspirin, lipid-lowering mediations, and cardiometabolic agents. The magnitude of expected risk reduction for each of these therapies must be weighed against its cost and potential adverse events. Coronary artery calcium has the potential to improve risk stratification in select individuals beyond clinical and laboratory risk factors, thus providing a more granular assessment of the expected net benefit with each therapy. In patients with diabetes mellitus and stable chest pain, coronary computed tomography angiography increases the sensitivity for coronary artery disease diagnoses compared with functional studies because of the detection of nonobstructive atherosclerosis. Most importantly, this anatomic approach may improve cardiovascular outcomes by increasing the use of evidence-based preventive therapies informed by plaque burden. We therefore provide an updated discussion of the pivotal role of coronary computed tomography angiography in the workup of stable chest pain in patients with diabetes mellitus in the context of recent landmark trials, such as PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), SCOT-HEART trial (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart), and ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches). Finally, we also outline the current role of coronary computed tomography angiography in acute chest pain presentations.

### Use of coronary artery calcium testing to guide aspirin utilization for primary prevention: estimates from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^114wkiSs]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) is only recommended for individuals at high risk for CHD although the majority of CHD events occur in individuals who are at low to intermediate risk.

Methods and Results

To estimate the potential of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to guide aspirin use for primary prevention of CHD, we studied 4229 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who were not on aspirin at baseline and were free of diabetes mellitus. Using data from median 7.6-year follow-up, 5-year number-needed-to-treat estimations were calculated by applying an 18% relative CHD reduction to the observed event rates. This was contrasted to 5-year number-needed-to-harm estimations based on the risk of major bleeding reported in an aspirin meta-analysis. Results were stratified by a 10% 10-year CHD Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Individuals with CAC ≥ 100 had an estimated net benefit with aspirin regardless of their traditional risk status (estimated 5-year number needed to treat of 173 for individuals < 10% FRS and 92 for individuals ≥ 10% FRS, estimated 5-year number needed to harm of 442 for a major bleed). Conversely, individuals with zero CAC had unfavorable estimations (estimated 5-year number needed to treat of 2036 for individuals < 10% FRS and 808 for individuals ≥ 10% FRS, estimated 5-year number needed to harm of 442 for a major bleed). Sex-specific and age-stratified analyses showed similar results.

Conclusions

For the primary prevention of CHD, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis participants with CAC ≥ 100 had favorable risk/benefit estimations for aspirin use while participants with zero CAC were estimated to receive net harm from aspirin.

### Incidental coronary artery calcification in cancer imaging [^113D7F7u]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a leading cause of death among 15 million cancer survivors in the United States today. Mitigating CV risk in this population should be a priority for both oncologists and cardiologists. Most patients with cancer undergo nongated chest computed tomography (NGCCT) imaging for diagnosis, staging, and/or surveillance. Incidental detection of coronary artery calcification (CAC) on NGCCT in oncology patients may present an opportunity to detect and modify CV risk through lifestyle interventions, or pharmacological therapy as appropriate (e.g. use of statin and/or aspirin), especially for those without known atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD). We hypothesize that knowledge of CAC rarely influences preventive practices in the cancer population in clinical practice, and it may constitute a missed opportunity for reducing CV risk.

Five-year survival rates for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) now reach 70% to 90% for small, localized tumors. Because of shared risk factors, adverse CV events are frequently observed among NSCLC survivors. In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the prevalence of CAC on NGCCT performed at diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC, and to determine whether the incidental finding of CAC influenced subsequent prescription of statin and/or aspirin.

Noncontrast NGCCT scans performed across 25 hospitals in 164 patients at diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC were assessed for CAC (Figure 1). The mean age was 68 ± 10 years, 64 (39.0%) were men, and 132 (80.5%) had stage 1 disease. A radiologist and a cardiologist with advanced training in CV imaging independently and blindly reviewed CT images. The readers provided a simple, overall visual assessment of none, mild, moderate, or severe CAC for the entire coronary arterial circulation. A third reader provided consensus in cases of disagreement. CAC was classified as mild if there were only isolated flecks of calcification; severe if there was continuous CAC within one or more coronary artery; and moderate if there was more than mild calcification but less than the description of severe calcification. This overall visual assessment approach to CAC quantification on NGCCT scans was validated by the National Lung Screening Trial investigators who reported good agreement with Agatston scoring, good inter-reader agreement among different radiologists, and that this approach was sufficient for CV risk classification.

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium and long-term risks of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in young adults [^116GfrL1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

CAC Testing in Young Adults

The 2019 ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines recommend CAC scoring for adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10‐year ASCVD risk) and select adults at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk) in cases where risk‐based decisions for initiating statin therapy are uncertain. Specifically, risk can be reclassified upward in cases of CAC > 100 or age/sex/race percentile score ≥ 75, or downward if CAC = 0. However, no percentile scores exist for individuals under the age of 45 years and the guidelines conclude that more data are needed to support use of CAC scoring in the subgroup of patients younger than 45 years. Prior analyses have suggested that CAC testing may be the best option to determine the magnitude of potential benefit from initiating cardiovascular medications, including statins, aspirin, and antihypertensive therapy. We demonstrated a nonnegligible prevalence of CAC in young adults, which was associated with a clear graded increase in the incidence and hazards of CVD events with increasing CAC scores. While these findings suggest that the clinical utility of CAC testing may extend to select younger adults, particularly those with risk factors, future development of age‐sex‐race percentile scores for young adults could be useful for guiding interpretation of CAC scores and subsequent intensity of preventive interventions, as they have been for middle‐ and older‐aged adults.

### Hunting for a coronary artery disease diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with diabetes mellitus: if, how and when [^112C4Qtz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines Recommendations for screening CAD in asymptomatic patients

The 2024 American Diabetes Association Guidelines section of Cardiovascular disease and risk management suggest that routine screening for ACAD is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals, as it does not improve outcomes when ACAD risk factors are properly managed, and consider investigating ACAD if any of the following are present: atypical cardiac symptoms; signs or symptoms of associated vascular disease, including carotid bruits, transient ischemic attack, stroke, claudication, PAD, or electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g. Q waves) Table 2.

Table 2
Guidelines about screening ACAD in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes

Entries in bold correspond to the key information

According to these guidelines, screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals at high risk is not recommended, partly because these individuals should already be receiving intensive medical therapy, which provides benefits similar to those of invasive revascularization. There is also evidence suggesting that silent ischemia may resolve over time, which adds to the controversy surrounding aggressive screening strategies. In prospective studies, coronary artery calcium has been identified as an independent predictor of future ACAD events in individuals with diabetes, and it consistently outperforms both the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk engine and the Framingham Risk Score in predicting risk in this population.

The 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of CV disease in patients with diabetes suggest that in diabetic patients with asymptomatic ASCVD (including documented ACAD confirmed by imaging) and elevated CV risk, the potential benefit of platelet inhibition with aspirin (ASA) may be greater, making it important to tailor therapy to the individual.

The 2024 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for Chronic Coronary Syndromes suggest about screening for ACAD in asymptomatic individuals when coronary artery calcification findings from prior chest CT scans are available. It may be beneficial to use these findings to improve risk stratification and guide the management of modifiable risk factors, (level of evidence IIa class C); CACS could be considered to enhance risk classification at treatment decision thresholds; Total risk estimation using a risk-estimation system such as SCORE is recommended for asymptomatic adults > 40 years of age without evidence of CVD (level of evidence I class C). CACS may be considered to improve risk classification around treatment decision thresholds (level of evidence IIb, class C).

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^112LvWAP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Incidental coronary artery calcium (CAC) on chest CT — The SCCT and the Society of Thoracic Radiology recommend at least qualitative interpretation of CAC on all CT scans of the chest, regardless of indication (Class I recommendation). In patients with incidental findings of CAC on thoracic CT imaging, qualitative indication of severity (mild, moderate, heavy/severe) should be reported, and for those with mild calcification, a dedicated coronary calcium scoring study is useful to aid in clinical decision making. The presence of moderate or severe calcification generally correlates with a CAC score of ≥ 100, a guideline-based indication for statin benefit. In adults found on a chest CT exam not done for coronary calcium scoring to have incidental mild CAC, it may be reasonable to obtain a dedicated CT scan for CAC scoring to guide preventive treatment decision-making (Class IIb, C-LD). In adults found on a chest CT exam to have incidental moderate or severe CAC, initiation of statin therapy without dedicated CAC imaging is reasonable (Class IIa, LOE B-NR).

### Exercise and coronary atherosclerosis: observations, explanations, relevance, and clinical management [^116qrRUV]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment should be individualized depending on the athlete's overall risk for cardiovascular disease. All athletes should be questioned about symptoms of myocardial ischemia, family history of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, and current and previous risk factors. It is important to note that well-trained individuals may present with atypical symptoms of coronary artery disease such as a decline in exercise performance, shortness of breath, or fatigue. Symptomatic athletes should be investigated and managed in the same fashion as the general population. Asymptomatic athletes, including those with high CACS, should be informed that the significance of CAC in middle-aged and older athletes is currently unclear.

In athletes with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 70 mg/dL or ≥ 1.8 mmol/L, and CACS ≥ 100 or ≥ 75 th percentile compared with their age and sex matched, nonathletic peers, statin therapy should be considered after atherosclerotic CVD risk calculation and clinician-patient risk discussion. Risk enhancers such as extensive (noncalcified) atherosclerotic plaque on CCTA or a strong family history for premature CVD support initiating statin therapy. The American guidelines for lipid management favor statin therapy when CACS > 0 if the 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk is ≥ 7.5%. However, this cut point is very sensitive to the scoring system used. Given that the CACS is known in these individuals, the ASTRO-CHARM (Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification) risk calculator can be used, which incorporates CACS and calculates 10-year risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Athletes with CACS ≥ 400 should be advised to commence high-intensity statin therapy and other atherosclerotic risk factors should be strictly managed. Aspirin may be considered for individuals not at increased bleeding risk. Episodic use of aspirin (eg, prerace) has been suggested to prevent exercise-related sudden cardiac arrests, although evidence for this approach is lacking.

### Aspirin in primary prevention: what changed? A critical appraisal of current evidence [^114Ux9Q7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin has been the mainstay of both secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease for half a century. In 2018, 3 trials showed a modest reduction in cardiovascular outcomes that appeared counterbalanced by the risk of clinically significant bleeding. The latest ACC/AHA primary prevention guidelines downgraded their recommendation for aspirin use in primary prevention to that of physician preference. Despite the consistent and robust evidence previously supporting the use of aspirin in cardiovascular disease prevention, little discussion has been given to mechanisms or analytic explanations for this revision of recommendations. In this review, we explore 3 possible mechanisms that may have contributed to the alteration of our perception of aspirin's role in primary prevention. These include changes in the population potentially using aspirin in primary prevention, changes in cardiovascular disease and its presentation, and changes in aspirin itself. Here we present a translational look at knowledge gaps that should be addressed to better guide contemporary aspirin use in primary prevention. In conclusion, based on these considerations, the current recommendations might be improved by recalibration of the cardiovascular risk threshold above which aspirin should be recommended for primary prevention, including the incorporation of newer risk assessment modalities such as calcium scoring. A second enhancement would be developing a bleeding risk calculator to support clinicians' assessment of risk vs benefit. The use of enteric-coated aspirin vs noncoated aspirin should also be reassessed.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score reporting — limitations of the Agatston score and directions: The basis for the Agatston CAC score was created in 1989 using outdated CT scanner technology and has not been updated; assumptions in the Agatston score do not hold to modern scrutiny, with lower calcified density associated with higher risk, more diffuse calcified plaque distribution associated with higher risk, and calcification in the aortic valve and aorta on routine CAC scans substantially improving overall risk prediction but not routinely considered; routine CAC scans can also quantify epicardial, pericardial, and liver fat, and it is likely that a new comprehensive CAC score will be developed.

### Coronary artery calcium score as a graded decision tool [^115Fz2kJ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

These studies provide substantial evidence for the use of CAC as a decision tool to stratify ASCVD risk and identify patients who would benefit from a more aggressive approach to treatment. While the absolute CAC value at which patients are at secondary prevention level risk may vary based on factors such as age, comorbidities, and population studied, the cumulative evidence strongly suggests that patients with CAC > 100 and certainly > 300 should be treated more aggressively, akin to the secondary prevention population.

The question remains as to how we can provide innovative care models aimed at personalized risk stratification. We propose a strategy which utilizes CAC to identify those at greatest risk of ASCVD and guide treatment intensity, as defined by 3 CAC groups: those with CAC > 300, CAC > 100, and CAC 0. There are several important areas of intervention.
1) Treating to lower LDL-cholesterol targets. Both the European Society of Cardiology and the 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Statement recommend lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with established ASCVD at highest risk for recurrent events. Statin therapy remains the first-line treatment for effective LDL-C lowering with multiple additional options available including PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and inclisiran. Those with CAC score > 300 are at secondary prevention level of risk and should be treated aggressively to LDL-C targets of < 55 mg/dL. Ezetimibe and/or bempedoic acid may be warranted in those not achieving these targets with statin monotherapy. For those with CAC > 100, statin therapy should be strongly recommended with a target LDL-C of < 70 mg/dl. In those with CAC 0, lower dose statin therapy can still be considered based on shared decision-making; however, an approach which focuses on lifestyle, diet, and exercise measures is reasonable.
2) Aspirin use. Patients with CAC > 300 and low bleeding risk should be treated with aspirin for primary prevention. In those with CAC > 100 and low bleeding risk, aspirin should be considered. In those with no or mild CAC, aspirin should probably not be used for primary prevention.
3) Better glycemic control and blood pressure control. Patients with CAC > 300 (and possibly > 100) and elevated SBP should be more aggressively treated for a SBP in the range of 120. Stronger consideration should also be given to adding an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in these higher risk patients.
4) Diet, body mass index, and exercise. Patients with and without CAC benefit from lifestyle, dietary, and exercise interventions and this should be addressed at each visit. For those with CAC of 0, a treatment strategy based on these interventions alone is reasonable. When compared with individuals with normal body mass index, patients with CAC > 300 are at greatly elevated risk of coronary heart disease, CVD, and all-cause mortality highlighting the importance of at least consideration of more aggressive weight loss measures in this population. While surgical approach is the only known intervention to reduce CVD risk, there are ongoing trials (SELECT and SURMOUNT-MMO) evaluating the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist medications on CVD risk and mortality.
5) Sleep. Sleep irregularity has been linked to incident CVD. Patients with more irregular sleep timing (> 120 minutes in a week) are more likely to have high CAC burden even after adjusting for CVD risk factors, obstructive sleep apnea, and sleep duration. Encouraging a regular sleep schedule and reducing variability in sleep may be an important modifiable risk factor to reduce CVD risk.

### Coronary artery calcium for personalized allocation of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 2019: the Mesa study (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis) [^11569cWp]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Primary Prevention Guidelines recommended considering low-dose aspirin therapy only among adults 40 to 70 years of age who are at higher atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk but not at high risk of bleeding. However, it remains unclear how these patients are best identified. The present study aimed to assess the value of coronary artery calcium (CAC) for guiding aspirin allocation for primary prevention by using 2019 aspirin meta-analysis data on cardiovascular disease relative risk reduction and bleeding risk.

Methods

The study included 6470 participants from the MESA Study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). ASCVD risk was estimated using the pooled cohort equations, and 3 strata were defined: < 5%, 5% to 20%, and > 20%. All participants underwent CAC scoring at baseline, and CAC scores were stratified as = 0, 1 to 99, ≥ 100, and ≥ 400. A 12% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular disease events was used for the 5-year number needed to treat (NNT 5) calculations, and a 42% relative risk increase in major bleeding events was used for the 5-year number needed to harm (NNH 5) estimations.

Results

Only 5% of MESA participants would qualify for aspirin consideration for primary prevention according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and using > 20% estimated ASCVD risk to define higher risk. Benefit/harm calculations were restricted to aspirin-naive participants < 70 years of age not at high risk of bleeding (n = 3540). The overall NNT 5 with aspirin to prevent 1 cardiovascular disease event was 476 and the NNH 5 was 355. The NNT 5 was also greater than or similar to the NNH 5 among estimated ASCVD risk strata. Conversely, CAC ≥ 100 and CAC ≥ 400 identified subgroups in which NNT 5 was lower than NNH 5. This was true both overall (for CAC ≥ 100, NNT 5 = 140 versus NNH 5 = 518) and within ASCVD risk strata. Also, CAC = 0 identified subgroups in which the NNT 5 was much higher than the NNH 5 (overall, NNT 5 = 1190 versus NNH 5 = 567).

Conclusions

CAC may be superior to the pooled cohort equations to inform the allocation of aspirin in primary prevention. Implementation of current 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommendations together with the use of CAC for further risk assessment may result in a more personalized, safer allocation of aspirin in primary prevention. Confirmation of these findings in experimental settings is needed.

### Coronary artery calcium in 2023: guidelines for LDL-C goals, non-statin therapies, and aspirin use [^111WaHQH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Personalizing risk assessment and treatment decisions for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) rely on pooled cohort equations and increasingly coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. A growing body of evidence supports that elevated CAC scores correspond to progressively elevated ASCVD risk, and that scores of ≥ 100, ≥ 300, and ≥ 1000 denote risk that is equivalent to certain secondary prevention populations. This has led consensus guidelines to incorporate CAC score thresholds for guiding escalation of preventive therapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals, initiation of non-statin lipid lowering medications, and use of low-dose daily aspirin. As data on CAC continues to grow, more decision pathways will incorporate CAC score cutoffs to guide management of blood pressure and cardiometabolic medications. CAC score is also being used to enrich clinical trial study populations for elevated ASCVD risk, and to screen for subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in patients who received chest imaging for other diagnostic purposes.

When the CAC score indicates moderate atherosclerosis (CAC 100–299) or the score is > 75th percentile, lifetime risk and short-term risk are elevated, and more aggressive risk factor modification and statin (+nonstatin) therapy as needed to achieve an LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL should be considered. Aspirin is recommended by numerous guidelines and expert consensus documents when CAC is > 100, as the risk-benefit ratio becomes favorable at that cutpoint. Further, serial monitoring of all risk factors to ensure targets are met is advised, as these patients have a 10-fold increased risk of ASCVD events as compared with those without CAC present (score of zero).

Once the CAC score is 300 or greater, the risk of a myocardial infarction is similar to that of a myocardial infarction survivor, thus high-intensity statin and aspirin therapy should be considered, and other therapies that have been mostly reserved for secondary prevention (eg, GLP1 RA, icosapent ethyl, colchicine) should also be considered as appropriate for the individual. Such patients are considered very high risk and should be targeted with statin and nonstatin therapy as needed to achieve an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL. Scores > 1,000 carry even higher risk, and warrant even greater risk reduction (ie, LDL-C < 55 mg/dL).

The Working Group recognizes that, while evidence for the association of risk of events with CAC is overwhelming, the benefit of preventive therapy based upon CAC severity is not yet fully established. Our goal is to improve implementation of existing guidelines and expert consensus with the proposed staging system and serve as a call to action. Yet CAC staging will only be useful if CAC testing is performed. Most health insurance plans do not cover CAC testing. Importantly, the lack of access to this test exacerbates health disparities in ASCVD risk assessment. Compared with municipalities where CAC testing is available, those without CAC testing have lower socioeconomic status, more non-White residents, and lower life expectancies. A study in Cleveland found that when all costs for CAC scans were eliminated, testing increased among women, Black individuals, and lower income patients with a concomitant improvement in reclassification of statin eligibility, preventive interventions, and risk factor control. We call upon payers and health systems to recognize the utility of CAC testing and reduce barriers to its use so that subclinical coronary disease can be detected and preventive interventions implemented in patients at risk before they suffer irreversible consequences.

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: the key to the primary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1123hLJE]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning (CAC) is the most powerful prognosticator of cardiac risk in the asymptomatic primary prevention population, far exceeding the role of risk factor-based paradigms. The primary utility of risk factors is to identify treatable targets for risk reduction after risk has been determined by CAC. Serial calcium scanning to evaluate progression of calcified plaque is useful for determining the response to treatment. The 2013 cholesterol treatment guidelines understate the value of CAC scanning for atherosclerotic disease risk assessment.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) risk assessment — evidence and guidelines: CAC has been shown to better identify asymptomatic individuals who would benefit from statins, aspirin, ACE inhibitors or the polypill, and patient viewing of the CAC scan has been shown to increase adherence to statin and ASA treatment, to diet and exercise and to improve lipids, BP and weight. Three prospective, population-based outcome trials demonstrated an extremely high net reclassification index of the Framingham Risk Score, ranging from 52% to 66% in the intermediate risk group, and a CAC score of 0 confers a low risk of mortality over a period of 15 years in low to intermediate FRS risk and a 5-year low risk period in high FRS risk. Since treatment of high risk patients with statins improves outcomes and CAC accurately detects high risk patients, the reduction in events could be expected to be as high as 30% based on primary prevention trials. Guideline statements cited on-page include that the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline assigned a class IIb (may be considered) recommendation to CAC for use when the Pooled Cohort Equation risk decision was unclear, the 2016 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines issued a class IIb recommendation for CAC to risk stratify asymptomatic individuals, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk stated that CAC was "likely to be the most useful of the current approaches to improving risk assessment among individuals found to be at intermediate risk after formal risk assessment".

### State of the art: evaluation and medical management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1155h6WH]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin and antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy — nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA) lacks randomized controlled trial data and observational results are mixed; risk–benefit appears to vary by coronary artery calcium (CAC) and bleeding risk, and the decision to prescribe aspirin should be individualized. There are no RCTs examining aspirin in patients with NOCA, and observational studies have reported mixed results. In MESA, among individuals < 70 years without high bleeding risk, higher CAC was linked to greater potential benefit where the number needed to treat for cohorts of CAC ≥ 100 and ≥ 400 AU were greater than the number needed to harm; another cohort estimated net benefit when CAC scores were ≥ 100 AU and 10‑year cardiovascular disease risk score was ≥ 5%, but with elevated bleeding risk aspirin was estimated to result in net harm in all CAC categories. In the CONFIRM registry, baseline aspirin among 1415 patients with NOCA on CCTA was not associated with reductions in all‑cause mortality, recurrent MI, or MACCE over a mean follow‑up of 5.66 years, whereas a prospective cohort of 837 patients with NOCA on CCTA showed an association of aspirin use with lower all‑cause mortality in higher‑risk subsets. Based on current data, the decision to prescribe aspirin in patients with NOCA should be individualized, considering bleeding risk, clinical features, and imaging findings. For alternative agents, clopidogrel may be considered in patients with HR‑NOCA and low bleeding risk, but should be approached with caution; there are no data supporting the use of anticoagulants in NOCA, and whenever an anticoagulant is used for another indication in patients with stable NOCA, antiplatelets should be discontinued.

### Potential implications of coronary artery calcium testing for guiding aspirin use among asymptomatic individuals with diabetes [^114MEmd1]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

It is unclear whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) is effective for risk stratifying patients with diabetes in whom treatment decisions are uncertain.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Of 44,052 asymptomatic individuals referred for CAC testing, we studied 2,384 individuals with diabetes. Subjects were followed for a mean of 5.6 ± 2.6 years for the end point of all-cause mortality.

RESULTS

There were 162 deaths (6.8%) in the population. CAC was a strong predictor of mortality across age-groups (age < 50, 50–59, ≥ 60), sex, and risk factor burden (0 vs. ≥ 1 additional risk factor). In individuals without a clear indication for aspirin per current guidelines, CAC stratified risk, identifying patients above and below the 10% risk threshold of presumed aspirin benefit.

CONCLUSIONS

CAC can help risk stratify individuals with diabetes and may aid in selection of patients who may benefit from therapies such as low-dose aspirin for primary prevention.

Subclinical atherosclerosis as a tool to refine CV stratification

While risk scores and biomarkers reflect a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood of developing CVD, imaging tests for atherosclerosis seek to measure disease directly in its subclinical stage. As such, imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis can integrate all of a patient's risk determinants — ranging from genetic to environmental to modifiable — into a single measure of disease and vulnerability (tissue impact) in the vascular bed of interest. Decades have studies have shown discordance between risk scores and subclinical disease burden, as some patients with no risk factors can have advanced disease, and some patients with multiple risk factors can live to old age without any detectable plaque. Across all risk scores ever tested, adding imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis substantial improve risk discrimination. Imaging tests for subclinical atherosclerosis tend to perform best in lower risk patients with risk modifiers or in intermediate risk patients where treatment decisions remain uncertain. The CAC score, which provides a measure of coronary plaque using non-contrast cardiac-gated CT, is the most researched tool for CV risk stratification and receives a Class IIA recommendation from many guidelines. Beyond its prognostic value, CAC scoring has several practical clinical applications. CAC = 0 is associated with very low short-to-intermediate term risk, and in such cases, it may be reasonable to defer pharmacologic interventions, focusing instead on lifestyle optimization, unless other high-risk features are present. A CAC score between 1 and 99 indicates subclinical atherosclerosis and may justify initiating or intensifying statin therapy in patients with borderline or intermediate estimated risk. Scores between 100 and 299 identify individuals at high risk, for whom guideline-directed therapies, including high-intensity statins, aggressive modifiable risk-factor control, and possibly aspirin in selected cases, should be strongly considered. CAC ≥ 300 reflects a very high-risk profile, akin to patients with established CAD, warranting comprehensive secondary-prevention-level therapy and closer clinical follow-up.

In the 2025 ESC/EAS focused update on dyslipidaemias, an increased CAC score is explicitly recognised as a risk modifier in individuals at moderate cardiovascular risk or those near treatment decision thresholds, helping to improve risk stratification (Class IIa, Level of evidence B).

However, other imaging tools are also effect. Carotid ultrasound, particularly when interpreted as a carotid plaque score, is a strong predictor of risk. Total plaque burden by coronary CTA is also an emerging tool in asymptomatic patients, particularly with new protocols that decrease ionizing radiation and AI-tools that automate volumetric quantification of non-calcified and calcified total coronary plaque burden.

Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) for risk stratification and statin guidance is described as the addition of CACS did not add to overall healthcare costs, primarily by lessening costly testing and therapy in low-risk patients with a CACS of zero; CACS testing has also been shown to influence both patient and physician behavior regarding statin and aspirin usage, and patient's visualization of their CACS images is associated with an improvement in adherence to statin therapy; CACS testing is currently recommended by the 2018 AHA/ACC Multisocietal Cholesterol Management Guidelines to guide statin treatment in individuals at low-intermediate to intermediate risk by conventional stratification (Class IIa, level of evidence B).

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) management principles — The writing committee acknowledges that CCD populations are heterogeneous and that risk of future cardiovascular events is not uniform, so clinicians should prioritize therapies based on a patient's future risk of CVD-related events. Symptom relief and improvement in quality of life (QOL) are extremely important, and after shared decision-making clinicians may, as a first step, recommend therapies that improve symptoms without necessarily improving cardiovascular outcomes. Several domains of CCD care (lifestyle, medical therapy, symptom management, and initial work-up) can be effectively performed by primary care clinicians, and collaboration between primary care and cardiology specialties is emphasized. The committee also notes that asymptomatic patients with significant coronary artery calcium on cardiac computed tomography (CT) or chest CT for noncardiac indications showing extensive coronary artery calcifications without a prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event have a high risk of future ASCVD events; although not addressed by this guideline, aggressive lifestyle management and evidence-based medical therapies to prevent further atherosclerosis and reduce future cardiovascular events remain important considerations, with readers referred to appropriate ACC/AHA guidelines for ASCVD risk reduction.

### Association of coronary artery calcium with long-term, cause-specific mortality among young adults [^116w75ar]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

CAC Testing Among Younger Adults

The recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend CAC scoring for intermediate-risk (10-year CVD risk, ≥ 7.5% to < 20%) individuals who are uncertain about their decision to start statin therapy. Prior analyses have suggested that, for individuals who are uncertain about statin use, CAC testing may be the best option to determine the magnitude of the potential benefit from statin therapy. In addition, CAC scoring has been proposed to help determine an individual's likelihood of benefit from aspirin as well as antihypertensive therapy.

Our data suggest that the clinical utility of CAC testing may extend to select younger adults, mainly those at elevated lifetime risk for CVD and uncertainty regarding treatment decisions. Even for individuals in their 30s, despite their young age, approximately 1 in 5 had CAC. Women were less likely to have CAC; therefore, CAC scoring for young women should be considered cautiously given the low likelihood of a positive finding. However, given the exponential nature of CAC progression, the presumed high lifetime risk of individuals with CAC, and the general safety and inexpensive nature of most preventive medications, considering tailored preventive pharmacotherapy in the context of a clinician-patient risk discussion appears reasonable for young men and women with any CAC.

A CAC score of 0 has been repeatedly shown to be associated with very low risk for CHD and CVD events. For young adults at elevated lifetime risk, a CAC score of 0 does not lessen the importance of heart-healthy lifestyle behaviors, but given that many patients would prefer to avoid preventive medications, the potential for CAC testing to identify patients for whom lifestyle therapies can be favored instead of preventive medications remains an important patient-centered outcome.

We collected data from the attending clinicians 6 weeks after the clinic consultation to ascertain the recommended changes in management and treatment of patients in both allocated groups. Compared with standard care, there were marked differences in the recommendations of how the patients were to be managed and treated following CCTA. However, were these changes implemented, and if so, when? We explored both the implementation and the timing of these changes using national electronic health records and prescribing data. This was a major strength of our study and has not previously been employed in other trials of this type. We were able to determine the exact date of the dispensing of medications to individual patients consequent on the attending clinicians recommendations. We described the inevitable delay consequent on the time taken to undertake the CCTA, the report to be issued, the attending clinician to review and act on the report, the primary care physician to implement the recommendation, and ultimately, for a prescription to be submitted and medication dispensed to the patient. The median time delay from clinic consultation to the dispensing of medications was approximately 50 days for aspirin, statin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapies.

RESULTS

Mean age of the 2,384 study subjects was 58 ± 11 years; 52% were men. A total of 500 participants (21%) were < 50 years old, 863 (36%) were age 50–59, and 1,021 (43%) were at least 60 years old. A total of 535 individuals (22%) had CAC = 0, whereas 779 (33%) and 1,070 (45%) had CAC 1–100 and > 100, respectively. Overall, there were 162 deaths (6.8%). CAC was a strong predictor of mortality in each age-group (expressed in deaths/1,000 person-years with 95% CI): age < 50, CAC 0: 0; CAC 1–100: 7.8 (3.7–16.3); CAC > 100: 18.2 (9.1–36.4); age 50–59, CAC 0: 3.2 (1–10.1); CAC 1–100: 7.3 (3.9–13.5); CAC > 100: 16.6 (11.1–24.7); and age ≥ 60, CAC 0: 9.9 (4.4–22); CAC 1–100: 19.2 (12.5–29.5); CAC > 100: 33.1 (26.7–41).

Notably, all individuals ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 RF had a mortality rate > 10 deaths/1,000 person-years.

Table 1 presents mortality rates by CAC score according to estimated 10-year CVD risk category using criteria from the recent aspirin use guidelines. It is noteworthy that within the low and intermediate risk groups, we observed that individuals with CAC > 100 had a mortality rate of > 10 deaths/1,000 person-years, consistent with a recommendation for aspirin therapy. Additionally, absence of CAC among high-risk individuals translated into a low risk of 6.59 deaths/1,000 person-years.

### Predictive values of coronary artery calcium and arterial stiffness for long-term cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^113X7YD6]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early detection of subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) can guide management to prevent myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular (CV) death. Several ASCVD risk scoring systems (e.g. Framingham and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology [AHA/ACC] risk scores) have been widely used in clinical practice to predict the 10‐year risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. However, these scores often overestimate the risk of future CV events and do not enable better targeting of individual preventive treatment.

In addition to these risk scores, the accuracy of prediction may be improved by using an arterial stiffness measurement calculated from pulse wave velocity (PWV) or the cardio‐ankle vascular index (CAVI), or noninvasive imaging with coronary computed tomography (CT) scan.CAVI is more widely used in clinical practice than PWV as a surrogate of early atherosclerosis and is independent of blood pressure (BP) changes. Multiple studies confirm a strong association between CAVI and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD) detected by coronary CT. Furthermore, CAVI has been shown to enhance traditional risk scores as predictors of CAD and future CV events.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) measured by coronary CT implies the presence of CAD and is associated with increased risk of CV events. In contrast to CT angiography for coronary stenosis, the CAC score provides a reliable, noninvasive index with no use of contrast media while keeping radiation exposure low. Evidence from the multi‐ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) indicates that CAC scoring can significantly improve classification and distinguish patients who are at risk, and help to guide primary prevention. Thus, CAC scoring provides an adjunctive test, enhancing clinical risk prediction, and more accurately classifying individuals with an intermediate to high ASCVD risk or symptomatic patients with stable CAD who might benefit from primary prevention using aspirin or statins.

An association between arterial stiffness measured by CAVI and CAC scores has been demonstrated in two previous small‐size studies in asymptomatic subjectsand in asymptomatic patients with type 1 diabetes. They showed that CAVI has a dose‐dependent association with increased CAC score, and can be valuable in identifying individuals at risk for future CV events. To confirm this relationship in a larger sample size with longer follow‐up, we conducted a study to determine the predictive values of CAC score and arterial stiffness as reflected by CAVI on long‐term cardiovascular (CV) events in both asymptomatic patients with risk factors and symptomatic patients with suspected stable CAD.

Finally, another paper, including 2191 subjects from the Dallas Heart Study cohort (DHS), also estimated that aspirin likely provided a small net benefit for those with matched CAC ≥ 100 with low bleeding risk and an ASCVD risk > 5% per the pooled cohort equation (PCE), and probably net harm (increased major bleeding events) in all individuals with higher bleeding risk.CAC scores correlated with increased major bleeding and ASCVD events over a mean 12.2‐year follow‐up. While prospective data are still lacking, these studies indicate a possible role for selective use of CAC in the guideline recommendations for the allocation of aspirin for primary prevention and confirm the relatively poor test characteristics of risk scores in this domain.

An Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association reviewed the evidence related to the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in clinical practice for adults seen for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for optimal use of this test in adults of various races/ethnicities, ages and multiple domains of primary prevention, including those with a 10-year ASCVD risk < 20%, those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, and those with severe hypercholesterolemia were provided. Recommendations were also made on optimal timing for repeat calcium scoring after an initial test, use of CAC scoring in those taking statins, and its role in informing the clinician patient discussion on the benefit of aspirin and anti-hypertensive drug therapy. Finally, a vision is provided for the future of coronary calcium scoring.

### The identification of calcified coronary plaque is associated with initiation and continuation of pharmacological and lifestyle preventive therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UskP7]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the odds of initiation or continuation of pharmacological and lifestyle preventive therapies in patients with nonzero versus zero coronary artery calcium (CAC) score detected on cardiac computed tomography.

Background

Detection of calcified coronary plaque could serve as a motivational tool for physicians and patients to intensify preventive therapies.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database), Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL (Cochrane central register of controlled trials), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for studies evaluating the association of CAC scores with downstream pharmacological or lifestyle interventions for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) of downstream interventions were obtained using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model.

Results

After a review of 6,256 citations and 54 full-text papers, 6 studies (11,256 participants, mean follow-up time: 1.6 to 6.0 years) were included. Pooled estimates of the odds of aspirin initiation (OR: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 3.8), lipid-lowering medication initiation (OR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.9 to 4.4), blood pressure-lowering medication initiation (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6 to 2.3), lipid-lowering medication continuation (OR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.3), increase in exercise (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4 to 2.4), and dietary change (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.5) were higher in individuals with nonzero CAC versus zero CAC scores, but not for aspirin or blood pressure-lowering medication continuation. When assessed within individual studies, these findings remained significant after adjustment for baseline patient characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that nonzero CAC score, identifying calcified coronary plaque, significantly increases the likelihood of initiation or continuation of pharmacological and lifestyle therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Coronary calcium score and cardiovascular risk [^1136soUb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. On the basis of single-center and multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major cardiovascular outcomes, especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk. This review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

Primary prevention risk assessment — Adults who are 40 to 75 years of age being evaluated for cardiovascular disease prevention should undergo 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimation and have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting on pharmacological therapy; the presence or absence of additional risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium scanning can help guide decisions. A team-based care approach is an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and clinicians should evaluate the social determinants of health that affect individuals to inform treatment decisions.

### Coronary artery calcium score as a graded decision tool [^113hM9UA]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies have aimed to determine the appropriate intensity of treatment for individuals with elevated CAC scores who have not experienced ASCVD events when compared to those who have survived an ASCVD event. In other words, at what level of CAC do adults in the primary prevention setting have a risk comparable to those with prior ASCVD events, and thus warrant more aggressive risk factor reduction (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Important Studies Examining the Use of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring for ASCVD Risk Stratification

AHA = American Heart Association; ASA = aspirin; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CT = computed tomography; CVD = cardiovascular disease; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular events; NNH = number needed to harm; NNT = number needed to treat.

In 2014, Martin et alassessed the role of CAC scoring in guiding statin therapy allocation based on absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in 5,534 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study who were not taking dyslipidemia medications at baseline. Participants were categorized based on their CAC scores (> 0 or ≥ 100) and the presence of lipid abnormalities and the main outcome measure was incident CVD events. Over a median follow-up of 7.6 years, individuals with CAC ≥ 100 had CVD rates similar to secondary prevention populations across the spectrum of dyslipidemia, suggesting that CAC scoring can align statin therapy with absolute CVD risk.

Subsequently, Peng et alexamined the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) seen in patients with CAC scores of 0, 1 to 99, 100 to 399, 400 to 999, and ≥ 1,000 over a mean follow-up period of 13.6 years. Those with CAC ≥ 1,000 had an event rate similar to the average stable treated secondary prevention patient in the FOURIER (Evolocumab and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease) trial. Another study by Dzaye et al analyzed patients from the CAC Consortium who were over 50 years old with a 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5% (n = 20,207). The annualized ASCVD mortality rate among FOURIER participants corresponded to a CAC score of 781 (418–1,467) and a CAC score of 255 (162–394) corresponded to an ASCVD mortality rate equivalent to the lowest risk FOURIER subgroup.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^113yo2YY]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we present a clinically useful method of combining information from the CAC score with pre-test coronary risk estimates. To fully appreciate the utility of this analysis, it may be worthwhile to discuss the example from the Background section further. According to current guidelines, this 60-year-old woman, whose 10-year CHD risk estimate is about 15%, should receive both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, aiming for a goal LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dl. After measuring her CAC score, however, there is a good chance (64%) that our recommendations would change. If her CAC score were zero (47% chance), our estimate of her 10-year CHD risk would be approximately halved (6–9%). Given this information, we would continue to recommend a healthy diet and exercise, but might decide that cholesterol-lowering medication is unnecessary, and that the benefits of aspirin in terms of CHD prevention do not outweigh the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with aspirin use. On the other hand, if her CAC score were over 100 (17% chance), our estimate of her CHD risk would be approximately doubled (25–31% if CAC score = 101–400) or tripled (34–51% if CAC score > 400). In such a case, we would certainly recommend both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering medication and would probably aim for a more aggressive LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl. The probability that her treatment plan would be altered by measurement of her CAC score, therefore, is approximately 64% (the probability that her score is either 0 or > 100 = 47% + 17%), indicating likely usefulness of the test in this situation.

### A pathophysiologic primary prevention review of aspirin administration to prevent cardiovascular thrombosis [^1129sPsS]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease is the leading metabolic cause of mortality in the United States. Among current therapies, low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular thrombosis. However, aspirin also causes major complications (hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding). The American Heart Association recommends that aspirin only be prescribed for "high-risk" individuals. No guidelines are available as to the duration of aspirin therapy.

Methods

A reasonable approach to aspirin administration is to determine the appropriateness of aspirin therapy based on the pathophysiology of coronary artery thrombosis. It suggests that the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score be used as the basis for determining "high risk". This score was shown to accurately predict future cardiovascular events. The greater the CAC score, the greater the extent of coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque and future cardiovascular risk.

Results

A CAC score > 400 places an individual at very-high 10-year risk for an atherosclerotic event. Since aggressive medical therapy initiates stabilization of unstable atherosclerotic plaques within 1 month and reversal within 2 years, this treatment significantly reduces the risk of the individual for a cardiovascular event. Thus, most individuals aged < 75 years with a CAC score of > 400 should receive aspirin therapy for a maximum of 2 years.

Conclusion

Utilization of a CAC score greatly simplifies the decision of whom to treat with aspirin and for what duration. Importantly, focusing on two factors (hemorrhage and plaque stabilization) is easily understood by both the physician and the patient.

CAC = coronary artery calcium; CVD = cardiovascular disease; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; OCT = optical coherence tomography.

### Role of coronary artery calcium testing for risk assessment in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a review [^1115yHEU]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines recommend a few different approaches to the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing as a tool for risk assessment and decision-making regarding drug therapy for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Observations

Coronary artery calcium testing is not recommended for universal screening, particularly in patients at very low or high predicted risk for ASCVD, where its yield and utility for altering clinical decisions are limited. Use of CAC testing appears to be optimal when used in selected patients who are at intermediate or borderline risk of ASCVD as a sequential decision aid after initial quantitative risk assessment and consideration of individual patient risk-enhancing factors (eg, strong family history of premature ASCVD, chronic kidney disease). Although convincing clinical trials have not been completed, observational studies strongly suggest that, in those at intermediate risk, CAC testing can meaningfully reclassify risk and can support improved targeting of drug therapy to patients most likely to benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

This narrative review summarizes the evidence available about the appropriate role of CAC testing for ASCVD risk assessment. Coronary artery calcium testing should be used selectively in patients who are at intermediate risk of ASCVD, when there is persistent uncertainty after performing standard risk assessment using traditional risk factors in a risk score, and after consideration of additional individual risk-enhancing factors. In these situations, the result of the CAC test can be helpful to clarify whether the patient's true risk is high enough to justify initiation of primary prevention medications, such as statins or aspirin.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for risk assessment and prevention: CTA provides a view of plaque extent and nature even without a flow-limiting lesion and has been reported to be better than physiologic testing at parsing future risk; by visualizing calcified and non-calcified plaque it identifies the majority of patients with future events in prospective cohorts and promotes initiation and maintenance of preventive therapy (statins and anti-platelet therapy), which may reduce future hard events without differences in revascularization rates.

### Coronary artery calcification is common on nongated chest computed tomography imaging [^1134EqVe]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcification as assessed by computed tomography (CT) is a validated predictor of cardiovascular risk, whether identified on a dedicated cardiac study or on a routine non-gated chest CT. The prevalence of incidentally detected coronary artery calcification on non-gated chest CT imaging and consistency of reporting have not been well characterized.

Hypothesis

Coronary calcification is present on chest CT in some patients not taking statin therapy and may be under-reported.

Methods

Non-gated chest CT images dated 1/1/2012 to 1/1/2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics and medical history were obtained from charts. Patients with known history of coronary revascularization and/or pacemaker/defibrillator were excluded. Two independent readers with cardiac CT expertise evaluated images for the presence and anatomical distribution of any coronary calcification, blinded to all clinical information including CT reports. Original clinical CT reports were subsequently reviewed.

Results

Coronary calcification was identified in 204/304 (68%) chest CTs. Patients with calcification were older and had more hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and known coronary artery disease. Of patients with calcification, 43% were on aspirin and 62% were on statin medication at the time of CT. Coronary calcification was identified in 69% of reports when present.

Conclusions

A high prevalence of coronary calcification was found in non-gated chest CT scans performed for non-cardiac indications. In one-third, coronary calcification was not mentioned in the clinical report when actually present. In this population of patients with cardiac risk factors, standard reporting of the presence of coronary calcification may provide an opportunity for risk factor modification.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^113rV2a3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to guide aspirin in primary prevention — Using atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score alone, there is no group in which aspirin's benefit outweighs risk; however, among those at low bleeding risk with ≥ 5% 10-year ASCVD risk and CAC scores ≥ 100, aspirin was associated with net benefit, whereas high bleeding risk was associated with net harm regardless of CAC or ASCVD risk. The Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) ASCVD risk score does not appear to identify any group with clear net aspirin benefit, while CAC ≥ 100 identifies a subgroup with benefit exceeding bleeding risk. Recommendation: In patients with CAC ≥ 100, aspirin 81 mg daily is reasonable for those without bleeding-related contraindications (Class IIA, LOE B-NR).

### The interplay of physician awareness and reporting of incidentally found coronary artery calcium on the clinical management of patients who underwent noncontrast chest computed tomography [^1163mQkU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that coronary artery calcium (CAC) incidentally identified on a noncontrast chest computed tomography (NCCT) performed for noncardiac indications has diagnostic and prognostic value. The frequency by which radiologists report incidental CAC and its impact on patient management are unknown. This study included 204 consecutive patients (63 ± 17 years, 59% men) without a history of coronary artery disease referred for an NCCT for noncardiac indications. The presence of CAC was determined by an expert cardiologist and compared with the radiology report. For each patient, the medical record was reviewed for changes in medications. Physicians caring for these patients were surveyed regarding their awareness and the clinical importance of incidental CAC after their patients had been discharged from the hospital. There were 108 of 201 patients (53%) with a CAC score > 0 as determined by an expert reader. The interpreting radiologist reported the presence of CAC in 74 of 108 patients (69%). Of the 74 patients, there was an increase in stain and aspirin prescription of 4% and 5%, respectively. Of the 132 physicians surveyed, 54% of physicians surveyed believed that CAC on an NCCT scan was analogous to the presence of coronary artery disease, 23% were aware that incidental CAC was reported, and only 4% said they would make medical management decisions based on the finding of incidental CAC. In conclusion, incidental CAC is under-reported by the interpreting radiologists and suggests an integral role for a cardiovascular imaging specialist. When incidental CAC is reported, physicians are not cognizant of the meaning and importance of this finding. This lack of knowledge is reflected in the negligible impact reported incidental CAC has on clinical management decisions.

SCCT expert consensus — indications, rescanning intervals, and treatment by CAC strata: CAC testing is considered in asymptomatic individuals without clinical ASCVD who are 40–75 years and in the 5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk group and selectively in the < 5% group (e.g., family history of premature coronary artery disease). For follow-up, repeat CAC scanning at 5 years for 0 CAC and 3–5 years for > 0 CAC when results would alter preventive management. In the 5–20% ASCVD risk group, CAC = 0: statin not recommended; CAC 1–99: moderate intensity statin if < 75th percentile and moderate to high intensity statin if ≥ 75th percentile; CAC 100–299: moderate to high intensity statin + ASA 81 mg; CAC ≥ 300: high-intensity statin + ASA 81 mg.

### Would you recommend aspirin to this patient for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^112evdqi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (> 10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score?; At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not?; and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^117MbuM1]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent publication by our writing group highlighted a novel category within the CV risk continuum — advanced subclinical atherosclerosis. These asymptomatic patients are at a high risk of CV events due to the presence of substantial underlying subclinical atherosclerosis as determined exclusively by their plaque burden. As such, they are best thought of as distinct from traditional primary prevention (where aspirin has a limited role) and secondary prevention (where aspirin is categorically recommended). For example, patients with CAC > 300 have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events equivalent to patients with known obstructive CAD, even without exploration for degree of coronary stenosis.

If patients with asymptomatic coronary stenosis of 50% are considered to have CCS and, therefore, benefit from low-dose aspirin, then should these recommendations also apply to those with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis who have been demonstrated to have similar event rates? We think the answer is yes. We believe that the concepts of advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and asymptomatic CCS overlap, and the recent guideline regarding the management of asymptomatic CCS with low-dose aspirin can be reasonably extended to advanced subclinical atherosclerosis when there are no bleeding risk factors (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Correlation Between Asymptomatic Chronic Coronary Syndrome, Advanced Subclinical Atherosclerosis, and Low-Dose Aspirin

ACS = acute coronary syndrome; ANOCA = angina with no obstructive CAD; CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CAC = coronary artery calcium; CAD = coronary artery disease; CCS = chronic coronary syndrome; CCTA = coronary computed tomography angiography; CPS = carotid plaque ultrasound; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; INOCA = ischemia with no obstructive CAD; LV = left ventricular; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention.

As it is almost never recommended to actively search for obstructive CAD in asymptomatic patients, we propose to consider patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis, determined by any proven method, as having CCS, even if the degree of coronary stenosis has not been evaluated. Moreover, since low-dose aspirin is associated with a risk of bleeding, we recommend weighing the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin therapy and prescribing low-dose aspirin only for patients aged < 70 years who are projected to obtain a clear net clinical benefit from preventive therapy. As such, patients with no detectable atherosclerosis should rarely if ever take aspirin.

### Community-based provision of statin and aspirin after the detection of coronary artery calcium within a community-based screening cohort [^116q9c9E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the association of coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected on a screening exam with subsequent statin and aspirin usage in a healthy male screening cohort.

Background

Whether the presence of CAC, an independent predictor of coronary heart disease outcomes, alters clinical management, such as the use of preventive medications, is unknown.

Methods

Men (n = 1,640) ages 40 to 50 years (mean 42 years) were screened for coronary heart disease risk factors and CAC. The CAC scores and risk factors were reported to patients, and results were made available in the electronic medical record; however, medications were not prescribed or recommended by the study. During up to 6 years of subsequent annual structured telephone follow-up, we observed the community-based initiation and persistence of aspirin and statin therapy.

Results

A progressive increase in the incidence of pharmacotherapy was noted over time such that those with CAC were 3 times more likely to receive a statin (48.5% vs. 15.5%, p < 0.001) and also significantly more likely to receive aspirin (53.0% vs. 32.3%; p < 0.001) than those without CAC. In multivariable models controlling for National Cholesterol Education Program risk variables and baseline medication use, CAC was strongly and independently associated with use of either statin (odds ratio [OR] 3.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66 to 4.69), aspirin (OR 3.05; 95% CI 2.30 to 4.05) or both (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.81 to 10.10).

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort, the presence of coronary calcification was associated with an independent 3-fold greater likelihood of statin and aspirin usage.

### Aspirin to prevent sudden cardiac death in athletes with high coronary artery calcium scores [^111af1x3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

While proficient cardiac resuscitation has improved survival following cardiac arrest during road races in Japan, this accomplishment does not address coronary artery disease as the underlying cause of an increasing frequency of cardiac arrest in middle-aged men during marathons and ironman triathlons in the United States since the year 2000. Based on the high prevalence of subclinical coronary artery disease by cardiac computed tomography in endurance athletes with low conventional cardiac risk-factor profiles, we recommend coronary artery calcium scores as a more reliable and independent predictor of incident cardiac events, including death, as validated among adults aged 30–46 years. Scores of over 100 Agatston units indicate a 10-year cardiac risk of 7.5%, at which additional measures for primary prevention are recommended, including aspirin, as shown conclusively to reduce first myocardial infarctions in same-aged men in a prospective double-blind controlled trial. Targeted screening for subclinical coronary atherosclerosis with coronary artery calcium scores is prudent to guide appropriately dosed aspirin use to mitigate the increasing frequency of sports-related sudden cardiac death due to plaque rupture.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin (81 mg; 75–100 mg) to reduce atherosclerotic events in patients with chronic coronary disease without any indications for OAC therapy.

### Agatston score of the descending aorta is independently associated with coronary events in a low-risk population [^112yQC9a]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In previous reports, carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) has been proposed as a means to detect subclinical atherosclerosis and thus to use c-IMT to improve risk prediction. However, a large meta-analysis showed very limited value of c-IMT over the FRS in predicting coronary events. Interestingly, it has been shown that there is only a weak correlation between c-IMT with aortic calcification on CT, indicating that c-IMT either identifies other pathophysiological processes than TAC or that the stage in which atherosclerosis is detected is different. This report suggests that the assessment of aortic calcification, in combination with coronary calcification, may be a good alternative to c-IMT in predicting coronary events.

Currently, according to European guidelines, CAC should be used in the lower range of pretest probability and mainly in case of doubt about risk category and the associated treatment.US guidelines indicate that cardiovascular risk prediction in asymptomatic patients using coronary calcium scanning should be used in moderate risk patientsand only for low risk patients with a family history of premature CAD. However, in daily practice, CAC is frequently used in low-risk patients as well. In this study, we confirm that the predictive value found in moderate risk patientsalso holds true in a low-risk population. The coronary calcium scoring increases the discriminatory value of the FRS, with addition of DAC leading to a further increase. Since the majority of coronary heart disease occurs especially in those patients at low to intermediate risk, aortic and coronary calcium scoring might guide proper prescription of aspirin for primary prevention of CHD in this population. Naturally, radiation exposure has to be taken into consideration while performing CT calcium scoring in low-risk patients. However, ongoing improvement in CT scanners and advances in radiation dose reductionhave enabled submillisievert cardiac calcium scoring scans, alleviating this concern. It can thus be concluded that the balance might be shifting in low-risk patients as the radiation dose is steadily decreasing, and the prognostic information acquired is increasing through measures such as DAC that are freely available in the acquired images.

These study results were obtained in a relatively small, selected population and should be reproduced. Due to the strict definition of patients free of any form of overt vascular disease, the rates of coronary events during the first 5 years of follow-up are low. Longer follow-up may reveal the use of CT in predicting all major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in low-risk patients. Follow-up CT was not performed routinely, making analysis of the progression of aortic calcification impossible.

Aspirin therapy following CAC scoring — data analysis suggests that the risk of gastrointestinal and other bleeding with aspirin therapy may outweigh its benefits in many patients with CAC < 100 in the absence of other risk factors; therefore aspirin therapy should be considered for most patients with CAC > 100, in the absence of bleeding contraindications.

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium and long-term risks of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in young adults [^114u9diY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple cardiovascular guidelines recommend use of 10‐year absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimates to guide treatment and allocation of preventive therapies. Because these scores rely heavily on patient age, nearly all young adults (younger than 50 years) are estimated to have a low 10‐year ASCVD risk, even those who have nonoptimal risk factors. Consequently, young adults are often not offered or adherent to preventive treatments despite the possibilities of subclinical atherosclerosis and elevated lifetime risk. The need for a clinical decision‐making tool that identifies younger individuals at elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has led to interest in coronary artery calcification (CAC) as a direct marker of coronary artery disease.

The 2019 American College of Cardiology/Americann Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for primary prevention of ASCVD recommend CAC scoring for further risk assessment in borderline to intermediate‐risk individuals — typically middle‐aged adults — in whom management is uncertain. Although most studies of CAC have focused on the yield of testing middle to older‐aged adults, the utility of CAC in younger populations is still not clear. The few studies in young adults examining the relationship between CAC and disease outcomes have been limited by small sample sizes, short duration of follow‐up, or lack of cause‐specific mortality, or were conducted in selected populations with a high prevalence of CVD risk factors. In response to increasing interest in CAC for risk assessment of young adults, we sought to provide data from the Walter Reed Cohort, a relatively healthy, young, low‐risk population, to help further elucidate the potential role of CAC in identification of young adults at elevated risk, so that preventive measures might be employed to alter their atherosclerotic trajectories and long‐term risks for CVD.

### Value of coronary artery calcium scanning in association with the net benefit of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112EMGY8]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) identifies individuals at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Whether it can also identify individuals likely to derive net benefit from aspirin therapy is unclear.

Objective

To examine the association between CAC, bleeding, and ASCVD and explore the net estimated effect of aspirin at different CAC thresholds.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective population-based cohort study of Dallas Heart Study participants, free from ASCVD and not taking aspirin at baseline. Data were analyzed between February 1, 2020, and July 15, 2020.

Exposures

Coronary artery calcium score in the following categories: 0, 1–99, and 100 or higher.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major bleeding and ASCVD events were identified from International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Ninth Revision codes. Meta-analysis-derived aspirin effect estimates were applied to observed ASCVD and bleeding rates to model the net effect of aspirin at different CAC thresholds.

Results

A total of 2191 participants (mean [SD], age 44 [9.1] years, 1247 women [57%], and 1039 black individuals [47%]) had 116 major bleeding and 123 ASCVD events over a median follow-up of 12.2 years. Higher CAC categories (CAC 1–99 and ≥ 100 vs CAC 0) were associated with both ASCVD and bleeding events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.4; HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.3; HR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.8–8.2; P < .001; HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.6–7.9; P < .001), but the association between CAC and bleeding was attenuated after multivariable adjustment. Applying meta-analysis estimates, irrespective of CAC, aspirin use was estimated to result in net harm in individuals at low (< 5%) and intermediate (5%-20%) 10-year ASCVD risk and net benefit in those at high (≥ 20%) ASCVD risk. Among individuals at lower bleeding risk, a CAC score of at least 100 identified individuals who would experience net benefit, but only in those at borderline or higher (≥ 5%) 10-year ASCVD risk. In individuals at higher bleeding risk, there would be net harm from aspirin irrespective of CAC and ASCVD risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

Higher CAC is associated with both ASCVD and bleeding events, with a stronger association with ASCVD. A high CAC score identifies individuals estimated to derive net benefit from primary prevention aspirin therapy from those who would not, but only in the setting of lower bleeding risk and estimated ASCVD risk that is not low.

### Major global coronary artery calcium Guidelines [^114qPkCA]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the framework behind global guidelines of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment, for applications in both the clinical setting and preventive therapy. By comparing similarities and differences in recommendations, this review identifies most notable common features for the application of CAC presented by different cardiovascular societies across the world. Guidelines included from North America are as follows: 1) the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease; and 2) the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for Prevention of Adult Cardiovascular Disease. The authors also included European guidelines: 1) the 2019 European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias; and 2) the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guidelines. In this comparison, the authors also discuss: 1) the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Guidelines on CAC; 2) the Chinese Society of Cardiology Guidelines; and 3) the Japanese Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases. Last, they include statements made by specialty societies including the National Lipid Association, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Utilizing an in-depth review of clinical evidence, these guidelines emphasize the importance of CAC in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. International guidelines all empower a dynamic clinician-patient relationship and advocate for individualized discussions regarding disease management and pharmacotherapy treatment. Some differences in precise coronary artery calcium score intervals, risk cut points, treatment thresholds, and stratifiers of specific patient subgroups do exist. However, international guidelines employ more similarities than differences from both a clinical and functional perspective. Understanding the parallels among international coronary artery calcium guidelines is essential for clinicians to correctly adjudicate personalized statin and aspirin therapy and further medical management.

### Potential implications of coronary artery calcium testing for guiding aspirin use among asymptomatic individuals with diabetes [^111R1U7t]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, CAC has the ability to help risk stratify individuals with diabetes across age-group, sex, and RF burden and may help identify individuals who may benefit from more aggressive therapy, such as low-dose aspirin, for primary prevention. Our study also points to individuals with diabetes who likely will not benefit from CAC testing, namely those ≥ 60 years with additional RF, because their 10-year CVD risk is > 10%. Although our study is informative, definitive recommendations must come from clinical outcomes trials where treatment decisions are driven by CAC-based risk stratification.

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114KprZm]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an international guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30 year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its current role informing personalized shared decision making. Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in current guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate current recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers for its use in routine patient care. Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population, but also of other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and people with severe hypercholesterolemia.

(B) Corresponding mediastinal window demonstrates severe atherosclerotic calcification affecting the left anterior descending artery (red arrow).

CAC was present in 50 (98.0%) of 51 patients with known ASCVD and in 78 (69.0%) of 113 patients without pre-existing ASCVD. Of these 78 patients with CAC and no known ASCVD, CAC was graded as mild in 40 (51.3%), moderate in 24 (30.8%), and severe in 14 (17.9%); 51 (65.4%) were not on aspirin, 48 (61.5%) were not on statin therapy, and 36 (46.2%) were not on either therapy. Medication usage was reviewed again at a median of 198 (172 to 237) days after this index scan. Over this intervening period, among patients with CAC and no known ASCVD, aspirin was initiated in only 4 of 51 (7.8%) aspirin-naive patients and statin therapy was initiated in only 1 of 48 (2.1%) statin-naïve patients. Allergy or intolerance to either therapy was recorded for 3 patients. Aspirin was declined by 1 patient, and concurrent anticoagulation or gastrointestinal bleeding may have precluded aspirin prescription in 3 additional patients. No patients had abnormal liver function tests to deter statin therapy or severe thrombocytopenia to deter aspirin usage.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^114DsTn4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to guide aspirin therapy — In primary prevention, the margin of net benefit of low-dose aspirin is small, and ACC/AHA guidelines assign low-dose aspirin a IIb recommendation in high risk primary prevention patients who are not at high risk of bleeding. In MESA (6470 participants) over a median follow-up of more than 14 years, the Pooled Cohort Equations identified no group with reliable net ASCVD benefit from aspirin because bleeding risk increases as calculated Pooled Cohort Equations risk increases, whereas CAC strongly predicted ASCVD events without a consistent association with bleeding. Modeling indicated that individuals with CAC = 0 are more likely to be harmed than helped by aspirin (NNH > NNT), while those with CAC > 100 are expected to derive net benefit (NNT < NNH). In the Dallas Heart Study (2191 participants) with median follow-up 12.2 years, there were 116 major bleeding events and 123 ASCVD events; applying meta analysis estimates, aspirin therapy was associated with net harm in those with < 20% 10 year ASCVD risk and net benefit in those with ≥ 20% risk.

### Computed tomography for coronary artery calcification scoring: mammogram for the heart [^116LF3wL]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC), identified via low-radiation, non-contrast computed tomography of the heart, quantifies the burden of calcified coronary atherosclerosis. This modality is highly useful for cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification among individuals without known coronary heart disease (CHD), especially for those at intermediate risk. The presence of CAC is associated with up to a 10-fold higher risk of adverse CV events, even after fully adjusting for the standard CV risk factors. In fact, the CAC score is among the strongest clinically available predictors of future risk of adverse CV events among primary prevention patients. Additionally, the absence of CAC in asymptomatic individuals confers a very low risk of CV events. Even in the presence of a benign CV risk factor profile and normal cardiac stress test, a very high CAC score portends a high risk of adverse CV events. On the other hand, a CAC score of zero is associated with a low CHD risk despite significant CV risk factor profiles. CAC scoring is a quick, low-cost screening tool to help risk-stratify patients and identify those likely to benefit from aggressive preventive treatments (such as high-intensity statin therapy, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and aspirin) and to identify those likely who warrant close monitoring. Moreover, individuals with a zero CAC score may be at low enough risk to avoid or defer daily aspirin therapy and pharmacological therapy for cholesterol management, and instead work on therapeutic lifestyle changes. An abnormal CAC score may also lead to better adherence to pharmacological regimens and suggested lifestyle changes.

CTCA and patient management

The patients selected to undergo CTCA do fit the recommendations of clinical guidelines. For the majority of the 5438 patients, a CTCA without additional ICA was sufficient to guide subsequent clinical management. The patients who are the subject of this report and in whom ICA was required to direct further management, fitted the criterium of 'intermediate pretest probability', more precisely 26%, and had a disease prevalence of 43%.

As opposed to the somewhat artificial boundaries of the research environment, assessment of the true clinical performance of CTCA in day-to-day clinical practice, necessitates the inclusion of small vessel segments. A small vessel diameter together with extensive vessel calcifications are the two main predictors of diagnostic inaccuracy on CTCA. Recently published major clinical studies systematically excluded vessels with a diameter smaller than 1.5 or 2 mm. Severely calcified vessels make it impossible to assess the degree of coronary stenosis and most experts would agree on a certain threshold level of calcium above which it is advisable not to proceed with a contrast scan. In our study, we used an CACS ≥ 1000 as exclusion criterion. Within these boundaries of vessel calcification, we performed an 'intention-to-diagnose' analysis, allowing to formulate clinical management on a true patient level. In the clinical situation where an ICA is deemed necessary, the management plan is fundamentally based on these findings. The setup of our study makes it therefore feasible to make a head-to-head comparison of CTCA with ICA and sort out clinical precision of CTCA using the ICA-based strategy as gold standard.

It is important to realise that in patients who qualify for a 'CTCA-first' strategy, the need for subsequent use of ICA and/or revascularisation mounts up to 34% and even 50%, in expert centres. It is therefore reassuring that in our study CTCA correctly identified the majority of patients who end up with medical therapy and/or revascularisation.
