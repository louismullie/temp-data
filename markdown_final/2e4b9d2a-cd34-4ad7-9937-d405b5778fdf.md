## Question

why is dexamethasone used for croup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why dexamethasone is used for croup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of croup and the clinical problem we are treating. Then, I should verify how glucocorticoids like dexamethasone act on that pathophysiology. Next, I'll need to review the clinical trial and meta-analytic evidence for symptom relief, return visits, and hospitalization effects. After that, I should confirm practical dosing and route options, onset of action, and the role of adjuncts such as nebulized epinephrine. Finally, I need to check safety, including HPA axis considerations, and consider special situations such as COVID-19–associated croup before synthesizing a bottom-line recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and why treatment is needed. Croup is an acute viral laryngotracheitis causing subglottic mucosal edema and dynamic upper airway obstruction, classically presenting with a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and variable work of breathing; symptom severity is commonly structured with the Westley Croup Score to guide management decisions, so reducing subglottic edema and airway resistance is the immediate therapeutic goal [^1129CEQc].

> Now, how does dexamethasone address this pathophysiology? Dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, decreases inflammatory cytokine transcription, stabilizes vascular endothelium, and reduces capillary leak, thereby diminishing subglottic edema and improving airway caliber; clinically, its prolonged duration of action permits single-dose treatment to cover the typical illness trajectory in most children, which I should verify against outcomes data rather than pharmacokinetics alone.

> Next, I will examine whether clinical trials actually demonstrate benefit. Glucocorticoids improve validated croup scores within about 2 hours and maintain benefit for at least 24 hours, and they shorten hospital stays by roughly 15 hours in pooled analyses, with serious adverse events uncommon, which supports routine use across severity strata rather than reserving for severe disease only [^1135rg8M] [^1151GBqa]. In a large RCT of 720 children with mild croup, a single oral dose of dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg reduced 7‑day return visits to 7.3% vs 15.3% with placebo and improved parental and child-centered outcomes, confirming clinically meaningful benefits even in mild presentations [^113GhhoP].

> Hold on, I should confirm the practical dosing and route. A single dose of dexamethasone 0.15–0.6 mg/kg is effective, with oral administration preferred when feasible; randomized data show oral and intramuscular dosing provide comparable outcomes, allowing clinicians to choose based on tolerance and access, and low-dose regimens as small as 0.15 mg/kg have demonstrated efficacy in some studies, though 0.6 mg/kg remains widely used in trials and practice [^1171MoHQ] [^113CNA5e] [^113ZXUZF] [^116bTUvz]. Let me verify onset: symptom improvement from steroids begins around 30 minutes and builds thereafter, which aligns with adjunct strategies aimed at bridging that early window while the steroid takes effect [^1179znRM].

> Next, I should review adjunct therapies and whether dexamethasone changes their need. For moderate to severe croup, nebulized epinephrine provides rapid but transient improvement in airway obstruction and is appropriately layered onto dexamethasone, with emerging evidence suggesting that lower-dose l‑epinephrine may be noninferior to conventional dosing for short‑term score reduction; if oral steroids are not tolerated, nebulized budesonide can be considered, though adding budesonide to systemic dexamethasone does not appear to confer additional benefit [^112Qz1cP] [^1171MoHQ] [^116iCXED].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed explicitly. Meta-analytic and RCT data in croup report infrequent serious adverse events with single-dose glucocorticoids, and a small pharmacodynamic study found no reduction in endogenous corticosteroid markers after a single 0.6 mg/kg oral dose, supporting the low short‑term risk profile in otherwise healthy children; by contrast, prolonged or repeated supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure can suppress the HPA axis, so repeated dosing beyond typical single‑dose practice should be judicious and individualized [^1135rg8M] [^1179piCq] [^116QSan5]. I should also double‑check standard pediatric steroid cautions — monitoring for hyperglycemia, infection risk, behavioral changes, and growth effects with repeated or chronic exposure — and keep in mind general adverse reaction profiles from labeling, even though these are far more relevant to multi‑dose or chronic use than to a single croup treatment dose [^1138gffe] [^113Pxyt5].

> But wait, what about situations where one dose seems insufficient? Reports of COVID‑19–associated croup, particularly during Omicron surges, describe more persistent symptoms, heavier reliance on racemic epinephrine, and occasional need for additional steroid dosing or escalated support; still, these observations come primarily from case reports and small cohorts, so I should avoid overgeneralizing and instead use them to justify closer monitoring and a lower threshold for repeat evaluation rather than routine multi‑dose steroids for all [^114a3gpA]. Let me reconsider inpatient practice variation as well — observational data suggest that more than one dexamethasone dose was associated with longer length of stay after adjusting for severity, which cautions against reflexive redosing without a clear clinical indication and trajectory‑based reassessment [^115VWhCb].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Dexamethasone directly targets the inflammatory edema that narrows the pediatric subglottic airway in croup and, in high‑quality trials and meta‑analyses, reliably improves symptoms within hours, reduces return visits, and shortens hospitalization with a favorable short‑term safety profile; a single oral dose of 0.15–0.6 mg/kg, most commonly 0.6 mg/kg, is appropriate for all severities, with nebulized epinephrine added for moderate to severe cases and redosing reserved for atypical or refractory courses after reassessment of severity and alternative diagnoses [^1135rg8M] [^113GhhoP] [^1171MoHQ] [^1135WSUU].

---

Dexamethasone is used for croup because it **rapidly reduces airway inflammation** and edema, improving stridor and respiratory distress within 2–4 hours [^1135rg8M] and lasting 24–72 hours [^1135WSUU]. It is the **first-line therapy** for all severities [^114bcdKK] due to strong evidence that a single dose lowers symptom severity, return visits [^113GhhoP], and hospital admissions, with a favorable safety profile [^1135rg8M]. Typical dosing is 0.15–0.6 mg/kg [^1171MoHQ] (max 8–12 mg) [^113s9t4r] by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes, with oral preferred for ease and equal efficacy [^113CNA5e] [^113ZXUZF].

---

## Pathophysiology of croup and rationale for corticosteroid use

Croup is a viral illness causing **subglottic inflammation** and edema that lead to upper airway obstruction with stridor, a barking cough, and respiratory distress [^114bcdKK]. The inflammatory response is driven by cytokines and other mediators that increase vascular permeability and edema [^1135WSUU]. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone **suppress inflammation** by inhibiting cytokine production, reducing vascular permeability, and decreasing edema, thereby improving airway patency and symptoms [^1151GBqa].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dexamethasone use in croup

Multiple randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews demonstrate that dexamethasone **improves symptoms** and reduces healthcare use in croup [^1151GBqa]:

- **Symptom improvement**: Reduces croup severity within 2–4 hours [^1135rg8M], with effects lasting 24–72 hours [^1135WSUU].
- **Reduced return visits**: Lowers return visits and readmissions [^113GhhoP].
- **Shorter hospital stay**: Decreases length of stay by about 15 hours [^1135rg8M].
- **Lower intubation risk**: Reduces need for intubation and respiratory support [^112vxggw].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

The **standard dose** is 0.15–0.6 mg/kg (max 8–12 mg) administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously [^113CNA5e]; oral dosing is preferred for ease and equivalent efficacy [^113ZXUZF].

| **Route of administration** | **Recommended dose** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral (PO) | 0.15–0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |
| Intramuscular (IM) | 0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |
| Intravenous (IV) | 0.6 mg/kg | 8–12 mg |

---

## Comparison with other corticosteroids

Dexamethasone is preferred over prednisolone and prednisone due to its **longer half-life** (36–72 hours), which allows single-dose therapy, and its greater anti-inflammatory potency [^114bcdKK]. Prednisolone and prednisone have shorter half-lives (12–36 hours) and often require multiple doses, which can reduce adherence and increase adverse effects.

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Dexamethasone has a favorable safety profile in croup; single-dose therapy is associated with **minimal adverse effects**. Common side effects include mild gastrointestinal upset, insomnia, and irritability [^113Pxyt5], and serious adverse events are rare [^1135rg8M].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend dexamethasone as **first-line treatment** for all severities of croup [^1135WSUU], supported by strong evidence of efficacy and safety [^114bcdKK].

---

## Limitations and contraindications

There are **no absolute contraindications** to single-dose dexamethasone in croup. Relative contraindications include known hypersensitivity, active systemic infections, or conditions that may be worsened by corticosteroids; these are uncommon in typical croup care [^1151GBqa].

---

Dexamethasone is the **preferred treatment** for croup because it **rapidly reduces airway inflammation**, improves symptoms, and lowers healthcare use with a strong safety record. Its long half-life and potency enable effective single-dose therapy, making it the standard of care for croup [^114bcdKK].

### Croup: Diagnosis and management [^1135WSUU]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Croup is a common respiratory illness affecting 3% of children six months to three years of age and accounts for 7% of hospitalizations annually for fever and/or acute respiratory illness in children younger than five years. It is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction resulting from swelling of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, leading to inspiratory stridor and a barking cough. Many patients experience low-grade fevers, but fever is not necessary for diagnosis. Less commonly, stridor can be associated with acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and foreign body airway obstruction.

Laboratory studies are seldom needed for the diagnosis of croup. Viral cultures and rapid antigen testing have minimal impact on management and are not routinely recommended. Radiography and laryngoscopy should be reserved for patients in whom alternative diagnoses are suspected. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a single dose of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dexamethasone improves symptoms and reduces return visits and the length of hospitalization in children with croup of any severity. In patients with moderate to severe croup, the addition of nebulized epinephrine improves symptoms and reduces the length of hospitalization.

### Outpatient treatment of moderate croup with dexamethasone: Intramuscular versus oral dosing [^113CNA5e]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of oral (PO) versus intramuscular (IM) dosing of dexamethasone in the outpatient treatment of moderate croup, a condition for which steroid use has been supported by several studies. However, few have specifically addressed the use of oral dexamethasone for outpatient management.

Patients between the ages of 3 months and 12 years with moderate croup — characterized by history or presence of stridor, cyanosis, or retractions — were eligible for enrollment in this single-blind, prospective study. They were randomized to receive a single dose (0.6 mg/kg, maximum 8 mg) of either IM or PO dexamethasone. Parents were subsequently contacted by phone to assess the resolution of symptoms and the need for further evaluation.

The results showed that 277 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 2.1 years. Among them, 139 received IM dexamethasone, and 138 received PO dexamethasone. At phone follow-up, 141 patients (51%) had a total resolution of symptoms, with 75 in the IM group and 66 in the PO group. Eighty patients (29%) returned for further evaluation, including 45 in the IM group and 35 in the PO group. In terms of additional treatment, 23 patients (8%) received either more steroids, racemic epinephrine, or hospital admission, with 11 in the IM group and 12 in the PO group.

The conclusion drawn from this study was that there was no statistically significant difference in the need for subsequent interventions following a single dose of either IM or PO dexamethasone, indicating that a single PO dose of dexamethasone can be effectively and safely used for the outpatient treatment of moderate croup.

For children with croup, do glucocorticoids reduce clinical symptoms, minimize return visits and/or (re)admissions to the hospital, shorten lengths of stay, or reduce the need for additional treatments?

Glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at 2 hours and for at least 24 hours, reduce return visits to care, and shorten hospital stays by about 15 hours. Serious adverse events are infrequent.

### The assessment and management of croup [^112vxggw]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of croup has changed considerably over the last 25 years with the liberalization of the use of systemic corticosteroids for mild to moderate cases. The administration of corticosteroids in croup has reduced the severity of the condition, dramatically decreased the need for endotracheal intubation, shortened the duration of intubation, reduced the length of hospital stays, minimized the necessity for hospital admission, and reduced daycare/preschool absenteeism. It has also improved sleep in milder cases. Despite studies showing the efficacy of nebulized and intramuscular corticosteroids, the use of oral corticosteroids remains the recommended option in most, if not all, cases of croup presenting for medical assessment.

### Viral croup: Diagnosis and a treatment algorithm [^1171MoHQ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2014). Low credibility.

Viral croup is a frequent disease in early childhood. Although it is usually self-limited, it may occasionally become life-threatening. Mild croup is characterized by the presence of stridor without intercostal retractions, whereas moderate-to-severe croup is accompanied by increased work of breathing. A single dose of orally administered dexamethasone (0.15–0.6 mg/kg) is the mainstay of treatment, with the addition of nebulized epinephrine only in cases of moderate-to-severe croup. Nebulized budesonide (2 mg) can be administered alternatively to children who do not tolerate oral dexamethasone. Exposure to cold air or administration of cool mist are treatment interventions for viral croup that are not supported by published evidence, but breathing heliox can potentially reduce the work of breathing related to upper airway obstruction. In summary, corticosteroids may decrease the intensity of viral croup symptoms irrespective of their severity on presentation to the emergency department.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone for pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: Specialists' practice patterns [^111vAvKM]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone has emerged as a viable alternative to prednisone in the treatment of pediatric acute asthma exacerbations, with the potential for improved compliance secondary to decreased frequency of dosing, improved taste, and decreased cost. The objective of this study is to identify whether providers are prescribing dexamethasone for pediatric acute asthma exacerbations. Secondary objectives are to describe variation in practice between different specialties and to identify the commonly used dosing and frequency for dexamethasone.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study with an anonymous, web-based survey (surveymonkey.com). The survey population included all fellowship program directors listed on FRIEDA Online for pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric pulmonology, allergy and immunology, and emergency medicine residency directors through the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors listserv. Program directors were contacted via e-mail up to five times over three months.

- **Results**: Overall, 300 respondents (70% of the program directors) completed the survey. Response rates by specialty varied from 60% to 94%. One-third of providers are using dexamethasone, whereas just more than half of providers (51%) are prescribing a five-day prednisone course. The preferred maximum dose for dexamethasone is 10 mg (45%), with 82% using a dose of 0.6 mg/kg. Pediatric emergency medicine fellowship directors demonstrated a preference for dexamethasone (59%). Prednisone is favored by emergency medicine (56%) and pediatric pulmonology (89%).

### Effect of a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113NWc2S]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The study examined adrenal function tests in patients with COPD during a course of corticosteroid treatment.

- **Adrenal function test**: Figure 1 shows the basal and stimulated cortisol concentrations and the corresponding basal ACTH values for all patients at baseline, before the initiation of steroid therapy, and in the morning of the five clinical visits. Compared to baseline (712 nmol/l, 95% CI: 627–771), median stimulated cortisol measurements were significantly lower on days 2, 14, 16, and 35, with values of 453 (95% CI: 438–529, p = 0.008), 298 (95% CI: 177–461, p = 0.008), 427 (95% CI: 307–579, p = 0.008), and 566 (95% CI: 447–668, p = 0.04), respectively. Additionally, median basal cortisol measurements (439 nmol/l, 95% CI: 320–562) were significantly lower on days 2 and 14, with values of 200 (95% CI: 124–259, p = 0.008) and 112 (95% CI: 58–211, p = 0.007).

Before the initiation of steroid therapy, all patients (100%) exhibited a normal rise of cortisol after the injection of 1 μg ACTH, defined as a stimulated cortisol value > 550 nmol/l. On the first day of steroid treatment, 78% of patients had a blunted peak cortisol response. This percentage increased to 89% after 14 days of steroid treatment. Following corticosteroid withdrawal, 78%, 33%, and 33% of patients had a blunted cortisol response to 1 μg ACTH injection on days 2, 5, and 14, respectively.

Median basal plasma cortisol concentrations (nmol/l) were significantly higher in patients with a normal adrenal response compared to those with a suppressed adrenal response (409, 95% CI: 366–482 vs. 142, IQR: 129–218).

### Prophylactic administration of parenteral steroids for preventing airway complications after extubation in adults: Meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials [^113kXbUz]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: We searched electronic databases including PubMed (1966 to June 2008), CENTRAL (Cochrane Controlled Trials Register; issue 2, 2008), Web of Science (1994 to June 2008), and Embase (1984 to June 2008), adopting the search strategy that combined the terms "(anti-inflammatory agents OR glucocorticoid* OR corticosteroid* OR steroid* OR dexamet* OR hydrocort* OR predniso* OR beclomet* OR methylprednisolone) AND (intubation, intratracheal OR airway obstruction OR laryngeal oedema OR stridor OR extubation)" with the high sensitivity searching filter provided by the Cochrane Library. We identified all clinical trials on steroids and complications after extubation and searched reference lists of review articles and included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. There was no limitation on language, year of publication, or publication status.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Trials were included if they were randomised placebo-controlled trials comparing the prophylactic administration of steroids versus placebo before planned extubation in adults, with adequately reported data on either the occurrence of laryngeal oedema after extubation or the rate of consequent reintubation. After the exclusion of duplicates, TF and GW reviewed the full text of all citations with titles and abstracts that seemed to fit the criteria for inclusion. Citations that were clearly not relevant or were not randomised controlled trials were not reviewed in full. The numbers of citations rejected and the reasons for rejection were tracked.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^113qrGFA]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and a substantial increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours. The panel, including patient representatives, felt that values and preferences likely vary across patients, justifying a weak recommendation.

- **Values and preferences**: For some patients, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be insignificant, especially if they have a higher tolerance to pain or if their symptoms are not severe. Conversely, it may be crucial for patients whose daily activities, such as attending school or performing at work, are impacted; caregivers seeking to reduce children's pain; or patients experiencing severe pain.

The panel believes there is significant variability in the importance placed on pain severity reduction or rapid pain resolution. However, greater reductions in the time to complete pain resolution may lead typical patients to place higher value on these outcomes. Patients who prioritize reducing symptoms, whether due to lower pain tolerance or severe symptoms, are more likely to accept corticosteroid treatment.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects concerns about acceptability, specifically regarding the treatment of a condition that is usually self-limiting.

### Acute bronchiolitis and croup [^113EtPFF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Croup and acute bronchiolitis are common forms of virally induced respiratory disease in infancy and early childhood. There is good evidence that corticosteroids can ameliorate disease severity and alter the natural history of symptoms in patients who have croup, and that temporary symptomatic benefit can be obtained from the use of nebulized adrenaline. The principal weakness when reviewing therapeutic interventions for acute bronchiolitis is the lack of a clear diagnostic test or definition. Evidence suggests that oxygen is the only useful pharmacologic agent for correcting hypoxia.

### Solu-cortef [^1153VMfb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Treatment of acute overdosage is managed through supportive and symptomatic therapy. For cases of chronic overdosage where severe disease necessitates continuous steroid therapy, the dosage of the corticosteroid may be temporarily reduced, or alternate day treatment can be introduced.

### Cromolyn sodium [^115Cbep3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma.

It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma, or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma.

### A randomized trial of a single dose of oral dexamethasone for mild croup [^113GhhoP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). High credibility.

The benefits of dexamethasone treatment for moderate-to-severe croup are well established. However, most children with croup have mild symptoms, and it is unknown whether they would derive the same degree of benefit from dexamethasone treatment as children with more severe disease.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind trial at four pediatric emergency departments in which 720 children with mild croup were randomly assigned to receive one oral dose of either dexamethasone (0.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. The children had mild croup, as defined by a score of ≤ 2 on the croup scoring system of Westley et al. The primary outcome was a return to a medical care provider for croup within seven days after treatment. The secondary outcome was the presence of ongoing symptoms of croup on days 1, 2, and 3 after treatment. Other outcomes included economic costs, hours of sleep lost by the child, and stress on the part of the parent in relation to the child's illness.

- **Results**: Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. Return to medical care was significantly lower in the dexamethasone group (7.3 percent vs. 15.3 percent, P < 0.001). In the dexamethasone group, there was quicker resolution of croup symptoms (P = 0.003), less lost sleep (P < 0.001), and reduced stress on the part of the parent (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: For children with mild croup, dexamethasone is an effective treatment that results in consistent and small but important clinical and economic benefits. Although the long-term effects of this treatment are not known, our data suggests it is a positive treatment option for this condition.

### Endogenous glucocorticoid response to single-dose dexamethasone for croup in children: A pharmacodynamic study [^1179piCq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone is associated with adrenal insufficiency in adults and children with chronic disease. This association has not been studied after single-dose oral dexamethasone, the standard of care for children with croup. We hypothesized that single-dose oral dexamethasone in children with croup is associated with a transient decrease in endogenous glucocorticoids.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, 2-arm, pharmacodynamic study of single-dose oral dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (maximum, 12 mg) in children older than 2 years with croup compared with controls (children with febrile upper respiratory tract infections who did not receive dexamethasone). The primary outcome was the urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratio.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven children were analyzed (22 with croup and 5 with upper respiratory tract infections). Median 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratios before dexamethasone, the following morning, and on days 1, 3, and 7 were 2.8, 2.2, 2.0, 2.8, and 2.6, respectively. Among controls, the median 6β-hydroxycortisol-cortisol ratios at the same time intervals were 1.9, 1.5, 1.8, 2.5, and 1.7, respectively. There were no significant differences in the change from time 0 between groups at any time point. There were no serious adverse events or infectious complications.

- **Conclusions**: Single-dose oral dexamethasone is not associated with decreased endogenous corticosteroid levels in children with croup. Future studies should use criterion standard tests to rule out suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and be powered sufficiently to identify adverse consequences.

### Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Type of oral corticosteroid in mild to moderate croup [^116BYTvd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short-cut review was conducted to establish whether oral dexamethasone is superior to oral prednisolone in improving outcomes in children with mild to moderate croup. A total of 139 papers were found through the reported search. However, none presented evidence to answer the clinical question. It is concluded that no evidence is available to address this question, and further research is needed.

### Steroids and bronchodilators for acute bronchiolitis in the first two years of life: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131C9aj]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Another outstanding problem is the difference in observed effects between inpatient and outpatient populations. Adrenaline shows benefits for outpatients but not for inpatients. This may be attributable to short-term versus long-term response or characteristics of the patients (e.g. responders vs. non-responders) or illness (e.g. timing and severity of infection).

Safety concerns exist about the widespread use of adrenaline and steroids in young children with viral wheezing, particularly with repeated high doses. Our results do not suggest any serious or frequent short-term expected or unexpected harms from any of the studied interventions in infants with bronchiolitis in the absence of comorbidities. However, our safety analysis is based on randomized trials, which often have limited power to detect important differences due to the infrequent occurrence of events. Data from trials and observational studies in croup confirm a favorable short-term safety profile. Long-term problems raised by the use of steroids in prematurity include effects on adrenal function, cardiovascular responses, somatic and lung growth, and neurodevelopment. Evidence is scarce on the effects for short-term use in otherwise healthy term infants, and none of these were studied in included trials.

- **Limitations of existing evidence**: Our strength of evidence assessments provide clarity around the limitations of this body of evidence and direction for future research. Two key factors affected the strength of evidence: potential risk of bias in the included studies and sparseness of data.

### Variation in dexamethasone dosing and use outcomes for inpatient croup [^115VWhCb]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the association between dexamethasone dosing and outcomes for children hospitalized with croup. It is nested within a multisite prospective cohort study of children aged 6 months to 6 years admitted to one of five US children's hospitals between July 2014 and June 2016.

Multivariable linear and logistic mixed-effects regression models were used to examine the association between the number of dexamethasone doses (1 vs. > 1) and outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and 30-day same-cause reuse. All multivariable analyses included a site-specific random effect to account for clustering within the hospital and were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, presenting severity, medical complexity, insurance, caregiver education, and hospital. In cost analyses, LOS was also controlled for.

Among 234 children hospitalized with croup, patient characteristics did not differ by the number of doses. The proportion receiving more than one dose varied by hospital (range 27.9%-57.1%). In adjusted analyses, receiving more than one dose was not associated with same-cause reuse (odds ratio 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26 to 2.95]) but was associated with a 45% longer LOS (relative risk = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.30 to 1.62]). When controlling for LOS, receiving more than one dose was not associated with a differential cost ($-31.2 [95% CI $-424.4 to $362.0]). Additionally, eighty-two children (35%) received dexamethasone before presentation.

In conclusion, the study found significant interhospital variation in dexamethasone dosing and LOS. When controlling for severity on presentation, more than one dexamethasone dose was associated with longer LOS.

### Cromolyn sodium [^1145fWaY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient shows improvement, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma.

It should be borne in mind that prolonged corticosteroid therapy frequently causes an impairment in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and a reduction in the size of the adrenal cortex. A potentially critical degree of impairment or insufficiency may persist asymptomatically for some time, even after gradual discontinuation of adrenocortical steroids. Therefore, if a patient is subjected to significant stress, such as a severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma, or severe illness while being treated or within one year (occasionally up to two years) after corticosteroid treatment has been terminated, consideration should be given to reinstituting corticosteroid therapy. When respiratory function is impaired, as may occur in severe exacerbation of asthma, a temporary increase in the amount of corticosteroids may be required to regain control of the patient's asthma.

### Dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with Covid-19 [^1155bpnJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The RECOVERY (dexamethasone) study was published by the RECOVERY Collaborative Group and colleagues in 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study is related to COVID-19 infection. The trial question was: What is the effect of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19? The study design was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The study population consisted of 6,425 patients (2,338 female, 4,087 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Key exclusion criteria were the unavailability of dexamethasone and the clinical judgment of patients' unsuitability for randomization.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Dexamethasone therapy (n = 2,104)**: Oral or IV dexamethasone for up to 10 days.
	- **No dexamethasone (n = 4,321)**: Standard of care.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in death at 28 days (22.9% vs. 25.7%; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- A significant increase in hospital discharge within 28 days (12% vs. 13%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.17).
	- A significant decrease in invasive mechanical ventilation (5.7% vs. 7.8%; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95).

The conclusion was that in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, dexamethasone therapy was superior to no dexamethasone concerning death at 28 days.

### Croup management in Australia and New Zealand: A PREDICT study of physician practice and clinical practice guidelines [^1121287j]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations with the reported physician management of croup at PREDICT (Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative) sites. These sites served as a baseline for planned randomized controlled trials.

- **Methods**: The study involved a review of CPGs for croup from PREDICT sites and a survey of specialist pediatric emergency physicians concerning croup management. PREDICT sites encompassed eight tertiary pediatric hospitals and three large mixed emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand.

- **Results**: Nine out of the eleven sites had a CPG for croup. The response rate to the survey was 94% (78 out of 83). Adrenaline was recommended for moderate croup in 3% of cases, for severe croup in 52%, and for life-threatening croup in 100%. Steroid therapy recommendations were as follows: for mild croup in 45%, for moderate croup in 97%, for severe croup in 97%, and for life-threatening croup in 96%. The choice of steroid was oral dexamethasone in 60% of cases and oral prednisolone in 38%. For severe croup, 77% used intravenous/intramuscular dexamethasone, 10% used intravenous/intramuscular methylprednisolone, and 8% used nebulized budesonide. The most common dosage regimens were 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone or 1 mg/kg prednisolone. A standard volume dosage regimen for nebulized adrenaline was employed by 54% of respondents, whereas 39% used a weight-based formula. Clinical practice guidelines recommended dosages of 5 mg (11%) or 10 mg (33%) for standard volume dosing. All CPGs using weight-based dosing recommended 0.5 mg/kg, with maximum doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg.

- **Conclusions**: Croup management at PREDICT emergency departments is generally consistent, with a focus on the use of oral steroids and nebulized adrenaline.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: A study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^113a56xC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides critical insights into the distinct clinical and treatment challenges posed by the Omicron variant in pediatric patients with croup. Children with Omicron-related croup were younger, exhibited more severe symptoms, and required intensified therapeutic interventions compared to their non-COVID-19 counterparts. These findings highlight the variant's unique impact on pediatric respiratory conditions, underscoring the importance of early recognition, vigilant monitoring, and tailored management strategies during pandemic surges. Future studies should focus on the long-term outcomes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these observations, paving the way for optimized care protocols and better preparedness for emerging variants.

### Outdoor cold air versus room temperature exposure for croup symptoms: A randomized controlled trial [^1179znRM]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Croup is the most common cause of acute upper airway obstruction in children. The benefits of treating croup with steroids are well established, with an onset of effect 30 minutes after administration. We investigated whether a 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold air might improve mild to moderate croup symptoms before the onset of action of steroids.

- **Methods**: This open-label, single-center, randomized controlled trial enrolled children aged 3 months to 10 years with croup and a Westley Croup Score (WCS) ≥ 2 attending a tertiary pediatric emergency department. Participants were randomized (1:1) to either a 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold (< 10°C) atmospheric air or to indoor ambient room air immediately after triage and administration of a single-dose oral dexamethasone. The primary endpoint was a decrease in WCS ≥ 2 points from baseline at 30 minutes. Analyses were intention to treat.

- **Results**: A total of 118 participants were randomly assigned to be exposed to outdoor cold air (n = 59) or indoor room temperature (n = 59). Twenty-nine of 59 children (49.2%) in the outdoor group and 14 of 59 (23.7%) in the indoor group showed a decrease in WCS ≥ 2 points from baseline at 30 minutes after triage (risk difference 25.4% [95% confidence interval 7.0–43.9], P = 0.007). Patients with moderate croup benefited the most from the intervention at 30 minutes (risk difference 46.1% [20.6–71.5], P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: A 30-minute exposure to outdoor cold air (< 10°C), as an adjunct to oral dexamethasone, is beneficial for reducing the intensity of clinical symptoms in children.

### Comparative effectiveness of dexamethasone versus prednisone in children hospitalized with acute croup [^1162Qooc]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone versus prednisone or prednisolone on hospital resource utilization for children hospitalized with acute croup, a retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Pediatric Health Information System database on children aged 6 months to less than 6 years who were hospitalized with acute croup between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019. Children with a chronic complex condition, those transferred from outside hospitals, and/or those who received direct admission to the ICU were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to compare length of stay (in hours), escalation of care to ICU, and the need for bronchoscopy with exposure to dexamethasone versus prednisone or prednisolone. Additionally, rates of 7-day return to the emergency department and readmissions were compared.

A total of 11,740 hospitalizations met the inclusion criteria; dexamethasone was used in 95.9% of cases, whereas prednisone or prednisolone was used in 4.1%. In the matched cohort (n = 960), the length of stay was not significantly different between the dexamethasone and prednisone or prednisolone groups (21.3 vs. 18.5 hours, P = 0.35). Although bronchoscopy rates did not differ between the two groups, the dexamethasone cohort was more likely to require ICU transfer (P = 0.007). The rates of 7-day emergency department returns (2.3% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.24) and readmissions (3.1% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.37) were low and not statistically different.

Hospital resource utilization did not differ significantly for children receiving dexamethasone or prednisone or prednisolone for acute croup.

### Dexamethasone [^1138gffe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients > 2 years of age) and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients > 1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, such as severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, premised on the assumption that the course of these diseases and their pathophysiology are substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults. Pediatric patients, like adults, should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, such as cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels.

### Croup [^114bcdKK]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Most children who present with an acute onset of a barky cough, stridor, and chest wall indrawing have croup. A careful history and physical examination are the best methods to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out potentially serious alternative disorders such as bacterial tracheitis and other rare causes of upper-airway obstruction. Epinephrine delivered via a nebulizer is effective for the temporary relief of symptoms of airway obstruction. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, and their benefit is seen in children with all levels of severity of croup, including mild cases.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^112aLZvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The greater reliance on nebulized epinephrine suggests a need to address airway inflammation more aggressively in Omicron-related croup cases. This aligns with the findings of Narayanan et al. (2023), who emphasized the elevated use of racemic epinephrine during the Omicron period​. Although ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were not statistically significant between groups, trends indicated a higher proportion of ICU admissions in the Omicron group. This is consistent with global data showing increased ICU utilization during severe cases of Omicron-associated croup. These cases may be driven by a combination of severe airway obstruction and systemic inflammation.

Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in laboratory indices, including WBC, lymphocyte percentages, and CRP levels, between the two groups. This suggests that while clinical severity is higher in Omicron-related croup, systemic inflammatory markers may not reliably differentiate between PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. These results align with findings by Choi et al. (2022), who reported that laboratory indicators alone were insufficient to distinguish Omicron-associated respiratory illnesses. The distinct clinical profile of Omicron-related croup underscores the need for heightened vigilance and a tailored approach to management. Prompt recognition of moderate and severe cases, combined with readiness for escalated treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and corticosteroids, is crucial. These findings also emphasize the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 as a potential ca

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116QSan5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The pathophysiology of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency involves the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This occurs through the inhibition of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. The inhibition of CRH and ACTH by exogenous glucocorticoids mirrors the mechanisms involved in physiological cortisol negative feedback. Prolonged supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often results in decreased responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland. In rodent models, glucocorticoids exhibit pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation, as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells, ultimately leading to adrenal cortex atrophy. Conversely, following glucocorticoid withdrawal, there is resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most cases, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate cortisol levels. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis varies significantly.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily equivalent has the potential to suppress the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy depend on overall exposure, which is determined by factors such as the potency of the glucocorticoid, glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility. Notably, any administration route holds the potential for HPA axis suppression.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: A clinical practice guideline [^115EYNaV]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Although the evidence indicates that the treatment works on average, it did not reduce the severity of pain dramatically and failed to improve several other patient-important outcomes.

- **Infographic and point-of-care formats**: The infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview (GRADE summary of findings) of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids. Estimates of baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of the trials. The infographic also leads to point-of-care formats in the MAGICapp, including consultation decision aids designed to support shared decision-making with patients.

- **Evidence and certainty**: Considering the evidence and its certainty, the panel was confident that corticosteroids increase the chance of complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, reduce the severity of pain, and shorten the time to onset of pain relief (GRADE high to moderate quality evidence). Corticosteroids are unlikely to reduce recurrence or relapse of symptoms or days missed from school or work (GRADE moderate quality evidence). A single dose of corticosteroids is unlikely to cause serious adverse events. The randomized trials did not report any major event attributable to a single dose of corticosteroids (GRADE moderate quality evidence).

- **Observational studies**: The panel also considered evidence from observational studies that used higher doses of steroids. A large retrospective US cohort study of private insurance claims assessed adverse events in 327,452 adults who received an outpatient prescription of corticosteroids. There was a small absolute increase in the rate of sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and fracture.

### Potential health and economic impacts of dexamethasone treatment for patients with COVID-19 [^113xbuRR]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 and is either asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms in most individuals. However, a significant number of individuals, especially among the elderly, develop a more severe form of the disease and require hospital care. A further subset of these patients requires oxygen therapy or ventilatory assistance, creating a high demand for long-term hospital care in intensive care units (ICUs). In the UK, between 6 February and 18 April 2020, the case fatality rate among those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 was more than 26%; this increased to more than 37% in patients who required mechanical ventilation.

An extensive search for potential drugs with which to treat COVID-19 is underway. Dexamethasone has emerged as a standout therapeutic candidate, reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing oxygen and ventilation by 18% and 36%, respectively. Thus, the adoption of a dexamethasone treatment protocol for patients requiring respiratory support could potentially lead to a significant number of lives saved over the course of the pandemic between July and December 2020.

### Viral croup [^116bTUvz]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Viral croup is the most common form of airway obstruction in children six months to six years of age. The frightening nature of croup often prompts parents and caregivers to seek physician consultation. For children with mild croup, symptomatic care and mist therapy may be all that is necessary. Epinephrine has been used for decades to treat more severe cases of croup, but recent meta-analyses have found that glucocorticoid use is associated with shorter hospital stays, improvement in croup scores, and less use of epinephrine. Studies have shown that treatment with 0.6 mg per kg of oral dexamethasone is as effective as intramuscular dexamethasone or 2 mg of nebulized budesonide. Oral dexamethasone in dosages as low as 0.15 mg per kg may also be effective. While more studies are needed to establish guidelines, oral dexamethasone can be used to treat mild to moderate croup with close follow-up and instructions for further care, if needed.

### Prediction model for croup admission need [^111RkjhN]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

This study aims to develop a predictive model to stratify the probability of requiring hospitalization and inpatient respiratory intervention for croup patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Additionally, it seeks to compare the model's performance with that of ED providers.

Retrospective data were collected on croup patients presenting to the EDs of two pediatric and one community hospital from 2019 to 2020. This included demographics, preexisting conditions, and history of croup. Information on ED length of stay, previous dexamethasone administration, time to ED dexamethasone, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, viral testing, and ED revisits was also recorded. Westley croup scores were derived at ED presentation and final disposition. For admitted patients, any respiratory interventions were documented. Admission need was defined as either being admitted and requiring an inpatient intervention or not being admitted with an ED revisit. A prediction model for admission need was developed using L1-penalized logistic regression.

We included 2,951 patients in the study, 68 (2.3%) of whom required admission. The model's predictors were disposition Westley croup scores, number of ED racemic epinephrine doses, previous dexamethasone administration, and history of intubation. The model's sensitivity was 66%, specificity was 91%, positive predictive value was 15%, and negative predictive value was 99%. ED providers' performance showed a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 94%, positive predictive value of 23%, and negative predictive value of 99%.

### Lower mortality risk associated with remdesivir + dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone for the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^117Wv1Xk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Findings from this research suggest that more effort is needed to update guidelines recommending the use of remdesivir + dexamethasone in patients requiring supplemental oxygen according to best practice guidelines for oxygen use, and the strong clinical rationale to avoid dexamethasone monotherapy in all levels of respiratory support, especially in those not receiving supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, these findings reinforce the recent evidence from RWD supporting the use of antiviral treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients across all oxygen levels and the need to update and clarify clinical treatment guidelines. The ambiguities in COVID-19 guidelines may, in part, lead to the underutilization of antiviral treatment in situations where RWD suggests it reduces mortality risk, despite underpowered data earlier in the pandemic (e.g. patients on IMV/ECMO).

In summary, our study highlights that the addition of remdesivir to dexamethasone is associated with a significant survival benefit compared to dexamethasone without remdesivir use. This finding is observed in patients without supplemental oxygen requirements (a group for whom dexamethasone usage is contraindicated unless for a pre-existing condition or for treatment of a non-COVID-19 condition) as well as in patients with hypoxemia across the spectrum of oxygen support requirements, for whom the addition of remdesivir further improves outcomes.

### Efficacy of low-dose nebulized epinephrine as treatment for croup: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^112Qz1cP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Croup treatment usually involves a single dose of systemic dexamethasone combined with nebulized epinephrine. However, the optimal dose of l-epinephrine remains unclear. We examined whether a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was inferior to the conventional dose (0.5 mg/kg) of 1:1000 nebulized l-epinephrine in patients with moderate to severe croup.

This randomized double-blind clinical non-inferiority trial was conducted in three pediatric emergency departments from May 2015 to October 2017. Children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate to severe croup (Westley scale scores 3–11) were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to the conventional dose (0.5 mg/kg; maximum 5 mg) or low dose (0.1 mg/kg; maximum 1 mg) group. All subjects received 0.6 mg/kg dexamethasone. Croup scores and other vital signs were measured before and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after nebulized l-epinephrine administration. The primary outcome was the change in croup score after 30 min.

The final analysis included 84 patients. The groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographic parameters. At 30 min after treatment with nebulized l-epinephrine, the croup scores in both groups were significantly reduced from baseline values (p < 0.05) and did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.42). Neither blood pressure nor heart rate differed between the two groups.

Low-dose 1:1000 l-epinephrine was not inferior in croup score reduction to the conventional dose in patients with moderate to severe croup. Clinical trial No: NCT01664507, KCT0002318.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117KL5Q6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest that in patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered. This is irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

- **Management**: Patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, with suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress, should receive appropriate management.
- **Suggested glucocorticoid regimens**: These are recommended for patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress.

- **Rationale**: Adrenal crisis, also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis, can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids if drug availability suddenly decreases (e.g. missed doses, gastroenteritis). It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Therefore, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over the evaluation for other causes of symptoms consistent with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol to respond appropriately to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery. The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood.

### Budesonide offers no advantage when added to oral dexamethasone in the treatment of croup [^116iCXED]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding inhaled budesonide (2 mg) to oral dexamethasone at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg in children hospitalized with croup. The study was conducted in the observation ward of a tertiary pediatric hospital emergency department. Seventy-two children, with an age range of 3 to 126 months, were hospitalized with croup for the study.

The intervention involved randomizing children to receive either 2 mg of nebulized budesonide or a placebo, with all children receiving a single oral dose of 0.15 mg/kg dexamethasone.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the duration of hospital stay. Secondary measures included croup scores from 0 to 12 hours, use of nebulized epinephrine, duration of croup symptoms, duration of viral symptoms, and return to medical care for croup or other reasons following hospital discharge.

Results indicated that baseline characteristics for the two groups were similar. There was no difference in time to discharge for the two groups or other outcome measures, with a risk ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence intervals of 0.82 and 2.1). The conclusions drawn were that the addition of inhaled budesonide (2 mg) to oral dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) offers no advantage in the treatment of children hospitalized with croup.

### Rationale and design of REGULATE: An observational study protocol for relationship between plasma metabolome and the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115hSMXJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) follows the recommendations of the Guidelines, which makes it easy to standardize, reduces the influence of treatment-related confounding factors, and does not violate ethical principles. Secondly, the first sample collection of this study occurs before the application of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, which can exclude the effect of glucocorticoid therapy on the body's metabolism.

This research plan is innovative in thought and technology. The project closely combines clinical practice and actual needs. At present, there is still a lack of clinical biomarkers to predict the efficacy of COPD systemic glucocorticoids, and during the period of AECOPD, the changes in systemic metabolic pathways and network regulation mechanisms remain unclear. Through this study, it is possible to find new biomarkers that may be used to predict the efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids and help to discover the pathophysiological mechanism of AECOPD from the metabolic level. This study intends to adopt metabonomics methods such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to analyze the profile of metabolic markers and differences between groups in AECOPD, providing a more comprehensive, efficient, and accurate analysis.

In conclusion, this observational study will compare the metabolomic differences in different effects of glucocorticoid treatment in patients with AECOPD and explore the underlying metabolic pathway mechanisms. The results of this study will provide metabolic markers and metabolic regulatory pathways associated with systemic glucocorticoid treatment.

### Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations [^111Yww9g]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1–2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.

- **Methods**: A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. A meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.

- **Results**: Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. The meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting.

- **Conclusions**: The literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children.

Recent studies have concluded that both intramuscular dexamethasone and oral dexamethasone are effective treatments, but there are few data directly comparing the two for moderate-to-severe croup.

- **Objectives**: The authors' primary objective was to determine whether there is a difference in the proportion of children with resolution of symptoms attributable to croup at 24 hours, when treated with oral or intramuscular dexamethasone. Secondarily, the authors sought to estimate whether there is a difference in the proportion of children with resolution of symptoms attributable to croup at 10 days and to estimate the interval to complete resolution of symptoms between these two routes.

- **Methods**: The authors performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial involving children aged 3–84 months with moderate-to-severe croup, presenting to a suburban teaching emergency department (ED). Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had inspiratory stridor or a barky cough and a croup score of 2 or greater after 10–15 minutes of cool mist therapy. The patients were randomized to one of two intervention groups. In both groups, the parents were not present in the treatment room during study drug administration. One group received 0.6 mg/kg of intramuscular dexamethasone and an oral placebo, while the other group received 0.6 mg/kg of oral dexamethasone and direct pressure on their thigh with the hub of a syringe. A nurse placed a Band-Aid on the site.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PdY73]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Corticosteroids significantly increase the proportion of patients with sore throat who will experience complete resolution of pain at both 24 and 48 hours. Fewer than four patients need to be treated to prevent one patient continuing to experience a painful sore throat at 24 hours. Although corticosteroids decreased the mean time to onset of pain relief by 6 hours, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity. All effects were in addition to antibiotic use.

	- We found that the effects of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief were homogenous in severe, exudative, or bacterial pathogen-positive sore throat alone. Our data do not support an effect in mild sore throat because only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline and showed no significant effect. A meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of interactions across different subgroups (such as route of corticosteroid, age, severity) on the outcome of mean time to onset of pain relief.

	- The effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours, which implies that a single dose of corticosteroids may be sufficient. This effect is similar to that seen in croup, where a single dose is generally adequate. Furthermore, the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect.

Study selection

Reviewers independently and in duplicate screened the titles and abstracts of all identified studies using a priori selection criteria. Subsequently, the same reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the full texts of potentially eligible studies. Reviewers resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if needed, by adjudication from a third reviewer.

We included randomized controlled trials that compared corticosteroids with standard care or placebo and enrolled adults and/or children aged 5 and over in emergency departments and primary care settings with a clinical syndrome of sore throat (painful throat, odynophagia, or pharyngitis).

We excluded studies of participants who were admitted to hospitals or were immunocompromised and those with infectious mononucleosis, sore throat after any surgery or intubation (postoperative sore throat), gastroesophageal reflux disease, croup, or peritonsillar abscess. We also excluded studies that enrolled children aged under 5 because they would not be able to provide trustworthy outcome measurements, especially for self-reported pain.

- **Outcomes of interest**: Our outcomes of interest were complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours; mean time to onset of pain relief; mean time to complete resolution of pain; absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours; duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms (such as problems for eating, drinking, swallowing); recurrence/relapse of symptoms; days missed from school or work; need for antibiotics; and rate of adverse events related to treatment. We included any adverse events reported by the studies.

### Pediapred [^113QQMD3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of prednisolone in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (> 2 years of age) and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (> 1 month of age). However, some of these conclusions and other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, such as severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premise that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are substantially similar in both populations.

The adverse effects of prednisolone in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Children who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e. cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may, therefore, be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients.

### Glucocorticoids for croup [^1151GBqa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). High credibility.

Since the initial version of this systematic review in 1997, a number of randomized trials examining the benefit of glucocorticoids have been published, reflecting a continued interest in the use of glucocorticoids to treat patients with croup. The objective of this review was to provide evidence to guide clinicians in their treatment of patients with croup by determining the effectiveness of glucocorticoids and to identify areas of uncertainty for future research.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of glucocorticoids for children with croup.

- **Search strategy**: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2003), and Excerpta Medica/EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003). We also contacted authors of identified croup trials published in the last ten years to inquire about additional published or unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials that examine children with croup and objectively measure the effectiveness of glucocorticoid treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Based on the review of the title and abstract (when available), two researchers identified studies for potential relevance. The complete text was retrieved, and using a priori inclusion criteria, the studies were independently reviewed for relevance by two reviewers. Two observers independently assessed quality. Differences with respect to inclusion status and quality assessment were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted using a structured form by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer.

### Oral betamethasone versus intramuscular dexamethasone for the treatment of mild to moderate viral croup: A prospective, randomized trial [^114a8pfz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Intramuscular dexamethasone is an effective but painful treatment for croup. The effectiveness of betamethasone, an oral, palatable, and equally potent glucocorticoid, has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a single oral dose of betamethasone with intramuscular dexamethasone in the outpatient treatment of mild to moderate croup.

- **Methods**: Children aged 6 months to 6 years presenting to a tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ED) with a modified Westley croup score of 0 to 11 were randomized to receive either 0.6 mg/kg IM dexamethasone or 0.4 mg/kg PO betamethasone. Croup score, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and need for supplemental treatments were recorded at study entry and at 1, 2, and 4 hours after treatment. Follow-up data were collected by daily telephone calls regarding the persistence of symptoms and the need for additional treatment or physician visits up to 7 days after the ED visit.

- **Results**: Each study group contained 26 patients. Despite randomization, the mean baseline croup score was higher in the dexamethasone group (3.6 ± 2.6 vs. 2.0 ± 2.4, P = 0.03). Patients in both groups showed a significant reduction in the croup score after treatment, and there were no significant differences between croup scores at 4 hours (P = 0.18). Similarly, there were no differences between groups in the hospital admission rate, time to resolution of symptoms, need for additional treatments, or number of return ED visits.

- **Conclusion**: There is no difference between oral betamethasone and intramuscular dexamethasone in the treatment effectiveness for mild to moderate croup.

### Crenessity [^115L8y2B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of CRENESSITY was assessed by the least-squares (LS) mean (SEM) percent change from baseline in the total glucocorticoid daily dose while androstenedione was controlled (≤ 120% of baseline or ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]) after 24 weeks. The LS mean percent change from baseline in daily glucocorticoid dose was statistically significantly greater in the CRENESSITY group at -27% compared to -10% in the placebo group, as shown in Table 7.

- **Table 7: Primary change from baseline in glucocorticoid daily dose while maintaining androstenedione control at week 24 in adults with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Study 1)**

CI = confidence interval; LS mean = least-squares mean; SD = standard deviation; SEM = standard error of the mean

* In hydrocortisone equivalents (4x equivalency factor for (methyl)predniso(lo)ne, 60x for dexamethasone) adjusted for body surface area.

At Week 24, there was a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects achieving a reduction to a physiologic glucocorticoid daily dose (≤ 11 mg/m²/day hydrocortisone equivalents) while androstenedione was controlled (≤ 120% of baseline or ≤ ULN) with CRENESSITY compared to placebo (63% vs. 18%, p < 0.0001).

At Week 4, following a treatment period at a stable glucocorticoid dose regimen, the LS mean change from baseline in serum androstenedione in the CRENESSITY group was statistically significantly different at -299 ng/dL compared to the LS mean increase from baseline in the placebo group of 46 ng/dL, as shown in Table 8.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patient: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^115fGBVs]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The increased frequency of moderate and severe symptoms in the Omicron group, as indicated by higher Westley Croup Scores, highlights the variant's potential to intensify upper airway inflammation. Previous studies have reported similar findings, suggesting that Omicron-related croup is associated with more pronounced stridor, respiratory distress, and a longer recovery time compared to croup caused by traditional viruses such as parainfluenza. In line with our findings, Lam et al. in a descriptive study among the pediatric population in Hong Kong found that the COVID-19 incidence among patients with croup was significantly higher in the COVID-19 Omicron group than in the COVID-19 pre-Omicron group.

Hospitalization duration was significantly longer in the Omicron group, which also required more intensive treatments, including nebulized epinephrine and repeat corticosteroid doses. These findings mirror the observations of Scribner et al. (2023), who reported higher rates of prolonged hospital stays and corticosteroid use in Omicron-associated croup. The prolonged inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection may account for these increased treatment demands.

### Pediatric croup with COVID-19 [^112eEvWd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

We describe three previously healthy children, admitted from our emergency department (ED) to our free-standing children's hospital, as the first documented cases of croup as a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All three cases (ages 11 months, 2 years, and 9 years old) presented with non-specific upper-respiratory-tract symptoms that developed into a barky cough with associated stridor at rest and respiratory distress. All were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing from nasopharyngeal samples that were negative for all other pathogens, including the most common etiologies for croup. Each received multiple (≥ 3) doses of nebulized racemic epinephrine with minimal to no improvement shortly after medication.

The children experienced a prolonged period from ED presentation until the resolution of their stridor at rest (13, 19, and 21 hours). Dexamethasone was administered early in their ED treatment, and all were admitted. All three received at least one additional dose of dexamethasone, an atypical treatment occurrence in our hospital, due to each patient's prolonged duration of symptoms. One child required heliox therapy and admission to intensive care. Ultimately, all patients were discharged.

Pathogen testing is usually not indicated in croup, but with "COVID-19 croup", SARS-CoV-2 testing should be considered, given the prognostic significance and prolonged quarantine implications. Our limited experience with this newly described COVID-19 croup condition suggests that cases can present with significant pathology and might not improve as rapidly as those with typical croup.

### Westley score and clinical factors in predicting the outcome of croup in the pediatric emergency department [^1129CEQc]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). High credibility.

The Westley Croup Score is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of croup in pediatric patients. Croup is a common respiratory condition in children that causes swelling of the larynx and trachea, leading to a characteristic "barking" cough. The Westley Croup Score helps clinicians stratify the severity of the disease and guide treatment decisions.

The score is calculated based on five clinical parameters: level of consciousness, cyanosis, stridor, air entry, and retractions. Each parameter is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. This calculator is specifically applicable to pediatric patients presenting with symptoms of croup. It is not suitable for use in adults or in children with other respiratory conditions. It should also not be used in children with known airway abnormalities or those who have ingested a foreign body, as these conditions can mimic the symptoms of croup but require different management strategies.

The Westley Croup Score calculator is designed to assess the severity of croup in clinical settings by evaluating five aspects of a patient's condition and assigning numerical scores to each. This total score helps determine the level of severity of croup and ranges from 0 to 17, with interpretations that aid in guiding treatment decisions. The inputs for the calculator include observations of chest wall retractions, the presence and state of stridor, cyanosis, the level of consciousness, and air entry. Each parameter is evaluated by selecting one.

### Comparative analysis of croup severity and treatment in pediatric patients: a study of COVID-19 positive vs. negative cases during peak Omicron [^114a3gpA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with unique clinical presentations in children, including croup-like symptoms such as barking cough, hoarseness, and respiratory distress. This study aimed to compare the clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics of hospitalized pediatric patients with croup who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 during the Omicron wave.

- **Methods**: A retrospective, descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 111 pediatric patients hospitalized with croup at Bahrami Children's Hospital and the Children's Medical Center in Iran from January 21 to March 20, 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: PCR-positive (Omicron group, n = 30) and PCR-negative (non-Omicron group, n = 81). Data on demographics, clinical severity, laboratory indices, treatments, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed using SPSS version 20.

- **Results**: The mean age of the Omicron group was significantly younger (16.93 ± 24.80 months) compared to the non-Omicron group (32.58 ± 37.26 months; p = 0.049). Symptom severity was higher in the Omicron group, with moderate to severe symptoms observed in 73.4% of patients, compared to 32.1% in the non-Omicron group (p = 0.001). The Omicron group had longer hospital stays (2.59 ± 3.93 vs. 2.11 ± 2.75 days; p = 0.016) and required more nebulized epinephrine (2.47 ± 1.27 vs. 1.77 ± 1.003 days; p = 0.003) and repeat corticosteroid doses (83.3% vs. 38.3%; p = 0.0001). Laboratory findings showed no significant differences between the groups (all p > 0.05).

Conclusion: Children with croup during the Omicron wave exhibited more severe symptoms, were younger on average, and required longer hospital stays and more intensive treatments compared to the non-Omicron group.
