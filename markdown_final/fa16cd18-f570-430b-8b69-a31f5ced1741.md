## Question

Plans for ast 35 and alt 45

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach and manage mildly elevated AST (35 U/L) and ALT (45 U/L) levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret these values against contemporary upper limits of normal and the clinical context. Then, I should verify the injury pattern and the AST:ALT ratio. Next, I will review risk factors and medication exposures to prioritize the differential. After that, I need to outline the initial laboratory workup and imaging. Then, I should consider fibrosis risk stratification with noninvasive tools. Finally, I will define follow-up intervals, thresholds for escalation, and when to refer or biopsy, while double-checking for pitfalls like assay issues and muscle disease mimics.

> Let me first confirm the significance of these numbers. ALT 45 U/L is above the commonly recommended healthy normal of about 29–33 U/L in men and 19–25 U/L in women, and AST 35 U/L is at or just above the healthy normal of about 18–30 U/L, so both values, while "mild", are outside the physiologic range and merit evaluation rather than dismissal, especially given the association of even modest ALT elevations with increased liver-related mortality and diabetes risk in population data [^1139kBWp] [^114L8XjJ] [^112TeHbB].

> Wait, let me verify the injury pattern before jumping ahead. ALT exceeds AST, so this is a hepatocellular pattern rather than cholestatic, and the AST:ALT ratio is about 0.78, which argues against alcoholic liver disease where the ratio is typically > 1.5 and often ≥ 2, though I should not overcall this without confirming alcohol intake and other causes first [^117RYf6K] [^114AMv5F].

> I need to check the clinical context carefully. I should confirm age, sex, BMI, metabolic syndrome features, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, alcohol quantity and pattern, all medications including OTC and herbals, and risk factors for viral hepatitis such as birth year, transfusions, or injection drug use, because NAFLD and alcohol are common and chronic viral hepatitis can present with only mild enzyme elevations. Importantly, normal aminotransferases do not exclude advanced fibrosis, so I must not anchor on the absolute values alone [^112TeHbB] [^114Q45zf] [^117VSnab].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory evaluation. I will order a comprehensive metabolic panel including bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, and INR, a CBC with platelets, hepatitis B surface antigen with core antibody and surface antibody, hepatitis C antibody with reflex RNA if positive, iron studies with transferrin saturation and ferritin to screen for hemochromatosis, and consider autoimmune markers such as ANA, ASMA, and immunoglobulins if risk factors or cholestatic features emerge. I should also add GGT to help confirm hepatic origin of an ALP elevation if present and to support alcohol-related risk assessment, while remembering that GGT alone is nonspecific [^112o4UP2] [^111Zqb9T] [^114e3RAH] [^115wEbB4].

> Hold on, I should verify whether imaging is indicated now. Given mild, persistent hepatocellular injury, an abdominal ultrasound to assess for steatosis, steatohepatitis, focal lesions, and features of portal hypertension is appropriate, and if cholestasis is suspected or ALP is disproportionately elevated, ultrasound is the first step to evaluate for biliary obstruction or intrahepatic cholestatic disease before pursuing PBC/PSC serologies [^112o4UP2] [^116VCtcF].

> Let me consider fibrosis risk stratification next. I should calculate FIB-4 using age, AST, ALT, and platelets, and if indeterminate or high risk, proceed to transient elastography or ELF to better stage fibrosis. Even in patients with normal ALT, FIB-4 performs well to exclude advanced fibrosis, and this stepwise approach aligns with endocrine and hepatology guidance for MASLD/NAFLD risk stratification and referral thresholds [^notfound] [^111LwEQf] [^115yovUs].

> I should double-check the follow-up plan. If initial serologies and imaging are unrevealing and the patient is asymptomatic, repeating liver chemistries in 3–6 months is reasonable, but I need to ensure persistence before escalating; importantly, most incidental abnormalities persist on retesting, so I should avoid reflexively repeating tests without a targeted workup unless there is a high likelihood of a transient cause [^117CYLXn] [^113XoUqa].

> But wait, what if enzymes rise or remain elevated beyond 6 months. If ALT or AST reach or exceed 2 times the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least 3–6 months apart, or if noninvasive fibrosis assessment suggests high risk, I should refer to hepatology and consider liver biopsy to clarify etiology and stage disease, particularly when autoimmune disease, atypical NAFLD/NASH, Wilson disease, or drug-induced injury remain in the differential [^112o4UP2] [^1127L5Xo] [^117CYLXn] [^111LwEQf].

> I need to ensure I am not missing assay or muscle-related confounders. If AST is disproportionately elevated or if there are myalgias or CK elevations, I should consider muscle injury as a source of AST and verify with CK and aldolase; additionally, I should confirm whether the laboratory uses pyridoxal-5'-phosphate–supplemented ALT/AST assays, as nonsupplemented methods can underdetect true elevations in B6 deficiency states, potentially masking liver injury [^111AXKbt] [^117K6y3Z].

> Let me reconsider the alcohol piece. Even if the AST:ALT ratio is not ≥ 2, I should still quantify intake using AUDIT-C and counsel complete abstinence if harmful use is identified, because alcohol-related liver disease is common and early identification changes outcomes. Thresholds of ≥ 210 g/week in men and ≥ 140 g/week in women warrant fibrosis assessment and linkage to alcohol services when dependency is present [^114AMv5F] [^114hRj1D].

> Next, I should review medication management. I will reconcile all prescription, OTC, and herbal agents and stop potential hepatotoxins when feasible, recognizing that many drugs cause mild, reversible transaminase elevations. For example, statins can raise ALT/AST but are generally safe to continue in NAFLD unless there are cholestatic features or symptoms, and specific agents like tolcapone require structured monitoring with discontinuation if ALT/AST exceed 2× ULN or symptoms of liver dysfunction occur [^115HfXj2] [^111QorHt].

> I will now examine lifestyle and metabolic interventions. Weight loss of about 5–10%, improved glycemic control, and regular exercise are foundational in suspected NAFLD/MASLD, and ALT reductions of around 17 U/L have been associated with histologic improvement in some contexts, so I should set measurable goals and arrange follow-up to track both enzymes and metabolic parameters [^112TeHbB] [^113KhuUT].

> Hold on, I should verify thresholds for escalation. If ALT or AST ever exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal, or if there is jaundice, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy, I should treat this as severe hepatocellular injury and pursue urgent evaluation for acute liver failure and potential transplant referral, while also considering drug-induced liver injury and ischemia in the appropriate clinical context [^112o4UP2] [^117Nvcr7].

> In summary, AST 35 U/L and ALT 45 U/L represent mild hepatocellular injury that warrants a structured evaluation: confirm persistence and context, exclude common causes with serologies and ultrasound, risk-stratify fibrosis noninvasively, address alcohol and metabolic risks, and escalate to hepatology referral or biopsy if abnormalities persist or worsen, recognizing that early, methodical evaluation of modest enzyme elevations can prevent missed diagnoses of clinically significant liver disease [^112o4UP2] [^112TeHbB] [^113z2Ems].

For AST 35 U/L and ALT 45 U/L, the priority is to **confirm persistence** and **identify the cause**. Repeat liver chemistries in 3–6 months, then pursue a focused workup if still elevated: review medications and alcohol, check viral hepatitis serologies (HBsAg, anti-HCV), metabolic panel (BMI, glucose, lipids), iron studies, and consider autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA, AMA). If no cause is found, obtain an abdominal ultrasound to assess for steatosis or other pathology [^113z2Ems]. Management is cause-specific: weight loss and metabolic control for NAFLD [^112TeHbB], abstinence for alcohol-related disease [^114hRj1D], and antiviral therapy for chronic viral hepatitis [^113YbCSp]. Most patients with mild, persistent elevations have NAFLD or alcohol-related disease; biopsy is reserved for unresolved cases after 6–12 months of evaluation.

---

## Clinical significance of AST 35 U/L and ALT 45 U/L

Mild elevations are common and often reflect **chronic liver disease**, including NAFLD, chronic viral hepatitis, or alcohol-related liver disease [^117VSnab]. Even mild, persistent elevations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease and liver-related complications [^114L8XjJ] [^111TQ656].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Initial evaluation

During the initial evaluation, obtain a **history and physical examination** to assess alcohol use, medications, metabolic risk factors, and symptoms of liver disease [^1155FJc1]. Repeat liver chemistries in 3–6 months to confirm persistence before extensive workup [^117CYLXn]. Given the mild elevation, this is a borderline abnormality rather than a moderate one; a moderate elevation is typically 2–5× ULN [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Viral hepatitis serologies**: HBsAg, anti-HCV, and consider anti-HBc to assess for HBV exposure [^1139d42c] [^114Q45zf].

- **Metabolic panel**: Fasting glucose, lipid profile, HbA1c to assess for metabolic syndrome and NAFLD [^notfound].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation to screen for hemochromatosis [^1175qH98].

- **Autoimmune markers**: ANA, ASMA, AMA if autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cholangitis is suspected [^113z2Ems].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain an **abdominal ultrasound** to evaluate for steatosis, structural liver disease, or other hepatic pathology [^1127L5Xo].

---

## Common causes of mild AST/ALT elevation

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Metabolic | - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^116mi66H] <br/> - Metabolic syndrome <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Diabetes mellitus |
| Viral hepatitis | - Chronic hepatitis B <br/> - Chronic hepatitis C [^116duopG] |
| Alcohol-related | - Alcohol-related liver disease [^114AMv5F] |
| Medications | - Statins <br/> - Acetaminophen <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Herbal supplements [^1155FJc1] |
| Autoimmune | - Autoimmune hepatitis <br/> - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) <br/> - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [^notfound] |

## Management strategies

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction in overweight/obese patients [^notfound].

- **Dietary changes**: Mediterranean diet, reduced saturated fats, refined carbohydrates [^notfound].

- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week) [^notfound].

- **Alcohol abstinence**: Complete cessation if alcohol-related liver disease is suspected [^114AMv5F].

---

### Medical management

- **Treat underlying conditions**: Optimize glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^114h9YzH] [^111QdqRr].

- **Medication review**: Discontinue or replace hepatotoxic drugs when possible [^112o4UP2].

- **Antiviral therapy**: For chronic hepatitis B or C if indicated [^113YbCSp] [^116duopG].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Schedule periodic monitoring of **liver chemistries** every 3–6 months until stable, then annually [^117CYLXn]. If no cause is identified after 6–12 months, refer to a hepatologist for further evaluation, which may include liver biopsy [^117CYLXn].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and the extent of liver injury. Mild, persistent elevations are associated with an increased risk of **fibrosis progression**, cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, and liver-related mortality [^1114GjWn] [^114L8XjJ]. Early identification and management can significantly improve outcomes.

---

## When to consider liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is considered when the cause remains **unexplained after 6–12 months** of evaluation, when autoimmune or infiltrative disease is suspected, or when noninvasive tests suggest advanced fibrosis [^111LwEQf] [^112o4UP2].

---

AST 35 U/L and ALT 45 U/L represent **mild hepatocellular injury** requiring a structured approach: confirm persistence, identify the cause, and apply targeted management. Most cases reflect NAFLD or alcohol-related disease; biopsy is reserved for unresolved cases.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111LWiQR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis — workup and evaluation outlines monitoring and diagnostic steps: "Monitor pattern of abnormal liver blood tests: AST, ALT, and bilirubin before each infusion and/or consider weekly if grade 1 LFT elevations. No treatment is recommended for grade 1 LFT abnormality". Medication review and metastasis assessment are advised, and "Liver biopsy should be considered if the patient is steroid-refractory or if concern for other differential diagnoses that would alter medical management". For higher grades, "Workup for other causes of elevated liver enzymes… by doing blood work and imaging (ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging). If suspicion for primary autoimmune hepatitis is high, can consider ANA/ASMA/ANCA. If patients with elevated ALKP alone, GGT should be tested. For isolated elevation of transaminases, consider checking CK for other etiologies".

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, overinvestigation and considerably increased costs.

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

An important consideration when evaluating the risk of hepatic fibrosis is that both AST and ALT can be normal even in the setting of cirrhosis, and the utility of the AST:ALT ratio in adults persists even if both values are within the normal reference interval. While it is hard to justify the routine analysis of both AST and ALT together on every liver blood test request, a strategy not supported by the data from the BALLETS study, subsequent testing of AST (or ALT depending which one is undertaken first) to calculate the AST:ALT ratio is clearly desirable. From a patient and cost perspective this is likely to be more cost-effective if performed by 'reflex' on the same sera following the detection of an abnormal ALT or GGT. To date there is no firm evidence that this is a cost-effective approach, although the results of a pilot study of such 'reflex' testing and additional up-front aetiology screen testing from Wales and Scotland are awaited.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1127iCha]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — Asparaginase toxicity management (hepatotoxicity: bilirubin and transaminases) specifies that for direct bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL, continue asparaginase; for direct bilirubin 3.1–5.0 mg/dL, hold asparaginase until < 2.0 mg/dL, then resume; and for direct bilirubin > 5.0, either discontinue asparaginase or hold asparaginase until < 2.0 mg/dL, then resume with consideration for dose reduction and close monitoring. For Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, hold until Grade 1, then resume; for Grade 4 AST or ALT elevation, hold until Grade 1, and if resolution to Grade 1 takes 1 week or less, then resume, otherwise either discontinue or resume with very close monitoring.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115hmwps]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proposed ALT ULN thresholds in screened populations — sex-specific values indicate that these proposed normal ALT values are lower than commonly reported reference ranges and differ by gender; one large study of blood donors with normal viral serologies proposed the ULN for ALT to be 30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women, and an examination of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) databases calculated the 'maximum correct classification' ULN of ALT to be 29 IU/l for men and 22 IU/l for women.

### Axitinib (Inlyta) [^116txMha]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INLYTA as a Single Agent

In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations of all grades occurred in 22% of patients on both arms, with Grade 3/4 events in < 1% of patients on the INLYTA arm. When used as a single agent, monitor ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA.

INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or with Pembrolizumab

INLYTA in combination with avelumab or with pembrolizumab can cause hepatotoxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt or permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab, and administer corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

With the combination of INLYTA and avelumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and increased AST were reported in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively. In patients with ALT ≥ 3 times ULN (Grades 2–4, n = 82), ALT resolved to Grades 0–1 in 92%. Among the 73 patients who were rechallenged with either avelumab (n = 3) or axitinib (n = 25) administered as a single agent or with both (n = 45), recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 times ULN was observed in no patient receiving avelumab, 6 patients receiving INLYTA, and 15 patients receiving both avelumab and INLYTA. Twenty-two (88%) patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 ULN subsequently recovered to Grade 0–1 from the event. Immune-mediated hepatitis was reported in 7% of patients including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity led to permanent discontinuation in 7% and immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of either avelumab or INLYTA in 5% of patients. Thirty-four patients were treated with corticosteroids and one patient was treated with a non-steroidal immunosuppressant. Resolution of hepatitis occurred in 31 of the 35 patients at the time of data cut-off.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^114mwBou]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — diagnosis and initial management are specified as: "Clinical diagnosis of AH is determined in a patient with rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications, with serum total bilirubin > 3 mg/dL; ALT and AST elevated > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but < 400 U/L with the AST/ALT ratio > 1.5; documentation of persistent heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks before onset of symptoms; and exclusion of other liver diseases"; furthermore, "In patients with suspected AH, a transjugular liver biopsy is recommended when the clinical diagnosis is confounded by another liver disease etiology or there is uncertainty on alcohol consumption history", and "Patients with severe AH should preferably be hospitalized for management".

### Trends in indirect liver function marker testing in wales from 2000 to 2017 and their association with age and sex: an observational study [^111DugE7]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Another possible reason for the reduction in AST testing could be due to cost-saving measures. Each additional test carried out costs money, and if it were felt the ALT was sufficient for an initial liver investigation, then the AST would be surplus to requirements. For example, a Swedish study from 1999, which implemented an education programme in primary care, showed that the use of the AST in primary care could be reduced and resulted in significant savings in healthcare costs, and as a result its use fell by 67% in the county of Uppsala in Sweden. A US studyrecommended that roughly US$100 million could be saved annually if the AST was only carried out in tandem with the ALT when the latter exceeded a predetermined limit (35 U/L), and that only a small proportion (0.5%–2.0%) of outpatients with abnormally high liver enzymes would be missed as a result. A similar result was found in a Canadian study. The AST still has value in certain settings however, and there is still no consensus on the optimal use of this test.

Finally, our finding of the dependence between reference limits for ALT and AST and age and sex, confirm that of a recent German study, with a similar population to ours (in terms of age range and including all test data regardless of indication). In this study they analysed over 1.3 million blood samples taken from primary and secondary care locations in northern Germany. The relationship between ALT and age also persisted in a routine health-check subpopulation and to a lesser extent, a healthy subpopulation of their cohort. This phenomenon has been highlighted previously, but 20 years later has still not been incorporated into guidelines or clinical practice. The findings of our study show that the 95th percentile exceeded values of 90 U/L at age 30 and fell to below 50 U/L by age 80. Therefore, the proportion of men categorised as having an elevated ALT is different for different age groups as currently the same ULN is applied at each age.

### Association of histologic disease activity with progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1114GjWn]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Most trials in patients with precirrhotic stages of NAFLD include those with high activity scores because a high level of disease activity is expected to reflect an increased risk of fibrosis progression. The baseline NAS in the present study was higher in patients with fibrosis regression than in those with progression. This apparent paradox most likely reflects the inclusion of patients with advanced fibrosis, which is associated with decreased disease activity; when only those with stage 0 to 2 fibrosis at baseline were considered, a high NAS was associated with greater progression to advanced (stage 3–4) fibrosis.

Some studies have challenged the utility of assessment of histologic markers of activity in NASH. A priori, disease activity may be a factor in fibrosis stage, which reflects how far the disease has progressed to cirrhosis. It is therefore not surprising that studies focused on cirrhosis-related clinical outcomes have demonstrated a stronger association with fibrosis than markers of disease activity. The present study differs from these reports by its use of prespecified, protocol-driven prospective assessment of histologic changes and using changes in fibrosis rather than clinical outcomes as the measured readout of disease progression. The findings suggest a close association between disease activity and changes in disease activity to changes in fibrosis; this association appears to support the use of short-term improvement in disease activity as a surrogate end point estimation of reduced fibrosis progression in clinical trials of drugs that reduce disease activity. The findings further may support the validity of the use of the NAS for this purpose by linking changes in the NAS with changes in fibrosis stage.

Another problem in trial design is how to minimize placebo response. Patients with spontaneous resolution of NASH had lower baseline AST levels; conversely, higher AST levels were associated with a greater risk of progression to advanced fibrosis. Using an AST rather than an ALT threshold level for entry into trials may maximize differences between treatment and control arms.

This study also has potential implications for clinical practice. These data may provide support for current recommendations regarding weight loss as an important therapeutic objective to improve underlying NASH. In the presence of weight gain, particularly accompanied by increasing AST levels, the findings appear to support the need for added attention to the possibility of disease progression in clinical practice. While histologic assessment is the current reference standard for assessment of fibrosis progression, this standard will likely be replaced by noninvasive methods of disease assessment once they are qualified as measures of disease activity and stage. In addition, active smokers had a lower likelihood of fibrosis regression; this finding appears to corroborate the harmful effects of smoking.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — clinical diagnosis and initial management notes that clinical diagnosis is determined by rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications "with serum total bilirubin > 3mg/dL; ALT and AST elevated > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but < 400U/L with the AST/ALT ratio > 1.5"; with "documentation of heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks prior to onset of symptoms; and exclusion of other liver diseases". In suspected AH, "a transjugular liver biopsy is recommended when the clinical diagnosis is confounded by another liver disease etiology or there is uncertainty on alcohol consumption history", and "patients with severe AH should preferably be hospitalized for management".

### Reported awareness and use of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate supplementation in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase assay reagents: a survey by the college of American pathologists clinical chemistry committee [^117K6y3Z]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) assay reagents are available both with and without supplementation with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (P5P; the active form of vitamin B6), a catalytic cofactor required for their enzymatic reactions. Nonsupplemented assays may miss ALT or AST elevations in patients with vitamin B6 deficiency.

Objective —

To assess awareness and adoption of ALT and AST reagents that are supplemented with P5P.

Design —

A 4-question survey about ALT and AST reagent supplementation with P5P was included in the College of American Pathologists General Chemistry and Therapeutic Drugs (C program) proficiency testing 2023 B mailing.

Results —

Overall, 38% (1651 of 4304) of responding laboratories reported using ALT and/or AST reagent supplemented with P5P. P5P supplementation was more common for nonacademic hospital/medical center laboratories (44%; 713 of 1629) relative to other settings. Of the laboratories that reported not using P5P-supplemented reagents, few (5%; 141 of 2611) cited plans to convert in the future. Despite the availability of P5P-supplemented reagents from several major assay manufacturers, the most common stated barrier for adoption was that the laboratory's reagent manufacturer does not provide P5P-supplemented reagents.

Conclusions —

There is a lack of awareness of the existence and benefits of P5P-supplemented ALT and AST reagents. There is a need for ALT and AST assay manufacturers to clarify and standardize the P5P status of ALT and AST reagents.

Severe or massive aminotransferase elevation — initial evaluation and escalation: For aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), stratify into "Severe elevation > 15× ULN" or "Massive elevation ALT > 10,000 U/L". For both branches, perform "History and physical exam", "Discontinue hepatotoxic meds and alcohol", and "Evaluate for signs of acute liver failure", and for massive elevation also "Assess for toxic ingestions, ischemia, and rhabdomyolysis". If "signs of acute liver failure → urgent liver consultation with consideration of referral to a liver transplant center", and if "diagnostic evaluation negative → consideration for diagnostic liver biopsy if medically stable". The pathway advises to "Consider n-acetyl cysteine if any evidence of acetaminophen ingestion".

Figure 3
Alcohol-related liver disease algorithm. In patients in whom alcohol is suspected to be the main injurious factor, the extent of consumption influences early decision-making. For those drinking at harmful levels, ≥ 35 units/week women and ≥ 50 units/week men, an assessment of liver fibrosis is the critical next step. For other patients, administration of the AUDIT C questionnaire alongside brief intervention is recommended initially. For patients who continue to drink at hazardous levels consideration should be given to assessment as for the higher-risk category according to liver fibrosis evaluation. This is particularly important for those with a GGT of > 100 U/L. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to manufacturer and thus should be tailored to the device used. ARFI, acoustic radiation force impulse; ELF, enhanced liver fibrosis; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

The aim of treatment in ARLD is for the patient to stop drinking harmfully, and this usually means complete abstinence. Referral to alcohol services should be undertaken for those patients with alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19, and kept in mind for those patients with an AUDIT score of ≥ 8. Importantly, a liver diagnosis in itself can be a highly effective intervention to change behaviour, and may be all that is required in many cases. However, current provision of such brief interventions in primary care is inconsistent and should be given greater priority.

Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with ARLD with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)

Normal liver blood tests do not rule out advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and so different approaches have been adopted/recommended for the identification of the at-risk patient. The Lancet Commission recommended the use of AUDIT-C as a first-line screening tool in high-risk groups followed by the full 10-item AUDIT to determine when to look for liver disease. The recent NICE guideline (NG50)on cirrhosis recommended a cut-off point of 50 units/week for men and 35 units/week for women, above which Fibroscan/ARFI elastography is recommended to detect cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis. Patients with cirrhosis require screening for oesophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Impact of using a lower ALT ULN on clinical practice — NHANES-based estimates and author stance: Applying the "maximum correct classification" ULN of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 29 IU/l for men and 22 IU/l for women would classify 36% of men and 28% of women as having elevated ALT. In a study of 235 asymptomatic workers, 27% had abnormal liver tests using lower ULN criteria and only six had any liver disease. Given increased liver-related mortality for ALT > 33 IU/l in men and > 25 IU/l in women, the authors state clinicians "should be cautious and concerned" and that "a national effort should be undertaken to standardize ALT levels across all populations".

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^113YbCSp]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B without cirrhosis, HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative — management algorithm states that the decision to initiate antiviral therapy depends on HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with an upper limit of normal for ALT of 35 U/L for males and 25 U/L for females recommended to guide management decisions. Those who meet criteria for immune active chronic hepatitis B are recommended for treatment, whereas those meeting the strict definition of inactive are not recommended for treatment. Indeterminate phases warrant further evaluation for other causes of liver enzyme elevation if ALT > ULN and HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL, or consideration of risks for hepatocellular carcinoma if ALT < 2×ULN and HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL; for those in the indeterminant phase, antiviral therapy is suggested using a shared decision-making approach with regular monitoring recommended for those not on antiviral therapy and reevaluation of the decision at each follow-up visit if treatment has not been initiated.

### Limiting the testing of AST: a diagnostically nonspecific enzyme [^112fbgcP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Annually, millions of pairs of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) tests are ordered. These enzymes are highly correlated, and ALT is far more specific diagnostically than AST. To reduce AST testing, we suggest measuring AST only when ALT exceeds a predetermined limit.

Methods

We derived the proportions of elevated ASTs that would not be measured based on 15 months of paired inpatient and outpatient ALT and AST data.

Results

For inpatients, a 35 U/L ALT limit for initiating AST testing would reduce AST testing by 51%, missing only 3% and 7.5% of ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively. In outpatients, AST testing can be reduced by more than 65%, with fewer missed elevated ASTs (0.5% and 2% of the ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively).

Conclusions

Conservatively, $100 million could be saved annually in the US health care budget by selectively limiting AST testing in just the US outpatient environment.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Liver enzyme elevations inVolunteer infection studies: findings and recommendations [^114Pcpeg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Specific safety provisions for VISs with NCEs are proposed to minimize hepatotoxicity risk in study participants. Based on our analysis and published data, these provisions should be applied to both IBSM and Pf SPZ models. Also, recommendations are made to maximize the opportunity to differentiate between potential DILI and model-related factors (Box 1). For drugs with hepatotoxic potential identified in preclinical species, a careful risk:benefit analysis is required. This might conclude that VISs be avoided or necessitate a modified design, for example, sequential enrolment to ascending doses following safety review.

Exclusion of high-risk participants.

As the liver is involved in malaria, every precaution should be undertaken to exclude participants at greater risk of liver injury. Obtaining a minimum of two baseline samples before malaria inoculation at a 48- to 72-hour interval should identify participants with fluctuating ALT/AST exceeding > 1.25 × ULN. Mild baseline ALT/AST elevations can indicate underlying hepatic stress, for example, caused by NASH or alcoholism. Induced blood-stage malaria study protocols should stipulate that ALT/AST elevations above acceptable values before the inoculum day should not be infected with malaria. After parasite inoculation, pretreatment ALT/AST and bilirubin levels should be obtained and reviewed by the investigator. Alanine aminotransferase/AST may be tested up to 24 hours before planned NCE administration, and if above acceptable limits, standard of care (i.e. a registered antimalarial) can be administered instead of the NCE. If ALT/AST is elevated following inoculation and/or treatment, retesting should be conducted within 24 hours to exclude laboratory errors and reviewed for possible participant-dependent causes.

Enhanced informed consent process.

Healthy participants enrolled in VISs are already informed that asymptomatic transient ALT/AST elevations may occur. Enhanced consent should highlight the potential severity of ALT/AST elevations and the consequences of withholding key information. Where an NCE is to be administered, alcohol, drugs of abuse, and more generally other medication, should be strictly avoided during the study and the follow-up period if possible. Alcohol and drugs of abuse screening tests with immediate reading (breath tests and urine dipstick, respectively) should be performed not just at screening, but at key time points, for example, pre-inoculation or pre-dose. Participants with a positive test should be withdrawn from the study, but will need treatment with a standard antimalarial if already inoculated with malaria.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^116mi66H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### Are simple noninvasive scoring systems for fibrosis reliable in patients with NAFLD and normal ALT levels? [^115yovUs]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and many affected individuals have normal-range alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. There is a need for a robust screening tool to triage individuals with advanced fibrosis for specialist care.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tests in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and normal levels of ALT.

Methods

Patients presenting at a fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included in the study. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio, BARD, FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores were calculated.

Results

A total of 305 patients were included [70 with normal ALT levels (women: ALT ≤ 30 IU/l, men: ALT ≤ 45 IU/l) and 235 with elevated levels]. In total, 24% of patients with normal ALT levels and 17% of those with elevated ALT levels had advanced fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3–4). The FIB-4 performed best in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with normal ALT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86, 82% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 92% negative predictive value). The sensitivity of the AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD fibrosis scores for advanced fibrosis was good in patients with normal ALT levels (94, 94 and 82%, respectively), but the specificity was low (44, 26 and 51%, respectively). The FIB-4 yielded best results in patients with elevated ALT levels. Using the FIB-4, 61% of patients with normal ALT levels and 63% of those with elevated ALT levels could avoid liver biopsy to exclude advanced fibrosis. In contrast, AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD scores would have led to a high proportion of patients with mild disease having to undergo a biopsy.

Conclusion

The FIB-4 yielded good results in patients with normal or elevated ALT levels, reliably excluding advanced fibrosis and reducing the need for liver biopsy.

Wilson disease evaluation — patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT should undergo initial serum ceruloplasmin testing; "Screening should be considered in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels, and consists of serum ceruloplasmin testing (56)". If ceruloplasmin is low, "confirmatory testing should be pursued including 24-h urine copper and/or serum copper levels, slit-lamp eye examination to identify pathognomonic Kayser-Fleischer rings, and possible liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, stage liver fibrosis, and quantify hepatic copper overload to guide management". Molecular testing can be used when needed, as "Molecular genetic analyses for the ATP7B mutation can be pursued in cases of diagnostic uncertainty", and genetic heterogeneity is noted: "Over 32 different mutations of the Wilsons gene have now been identified and unlike hemochromatosis, there is no predominant mutation".

HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) — 2025 CDC updates emphasize expanded indications, urgency of initiation, regimen options, and testing and prevention linkages. Expanded nPEP indications include exposures when the source has consistent viral suppression, when the exposed person has been taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and when exposure occurred due to sexual assault; increased emphasis is placed on "optimal administration within the first 24 hours after exposure". Preferred adult and adolescent regimens are now "bictegravir (BIC)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) OR dolutegravir (DTG) plus tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) OR tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) OR lamivudine (3TC)", with guidance also provided for special populations and for renal or hepatic dysfunction. Laboratory testing updates include using HIV nucleic acid tests (NATs) with antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) tests in certain scenarios, "not delaying nPEP initiation while awaiting laboratory testing", and that follow-up testing of serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) "is not necessary unless baseline tests are abnormal or other specific clinical indications are present". The update also emphasizes "the need for HIV PrEP education for all persons assessed for nPEP, and the need for an nPEP-to-PrEP transition plan when indicated".

FELBATOL® SHOULD NOT BE PRESCRIBED FOR ANYONE WITH A HISTORY OF HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION.

TREATMENT WITH FELBATOL® SHOULD BE INITIATED ONLY IN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ACTIVE LIVER DISEASE AND WITH NORMAL BASELINE SERUM TRANSAMINASES. IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVED THAT PERIODIC SERUM TRANSAMINASE TESTING WILL PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY BUT IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT EARLY DETECTION OF DRUG-INDUCED HEPATIC INJURY ALONG WITH IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF THE SUSPECT DRUG ENHANCES THE LIKELIHOOD FOR RECOVERY. THERE IS NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT DOCUMENTS HOW RAPIDLY PATIENTS CAN PROGRESS FROM NORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TO LIVER FAILURE, BUT OTHER DRUGS KNOWN TO BE HEPATOTOXINS CAN CAUSE LIVER FAILURE RAPIDLY (E.G. FROM NORMAL ENZYMES TO LIVER FAILURE IN 2–4 WEEKS). ACCORDINGLY, MONITORING OF SERUM TRANSAMINASE LEVELS (AST AND ALT) IS RECOMMENDED AT BASELINE AND PERIODICALLY THEREAFTER. WHILE THE MORE FREQUENT THE MONITORING THE GREATER THE CHANCES OF EARLY DETECTION, THE PRECISE SCHEDULE FOR MONITORING IS A MATTER OF CLINICAL JUDGEMENT.

FELBATOL® SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED IF EITHER SERUM AST OR SERUM ALT LEVELS BECOME INCREASED ≥ 2 TIMES THE UPPER LIMIT OF NORMAL, OR IF CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUGGEST LIVER FAILURE (SEE PRECAUTIONS). PATIENTS WHO DEVELOP EVIDENCE OF HEPATOCELLULAR INJURY WHILE ON FELBATOL® AND ARE WITHDRAWN FROM THE DRUG FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE PRESUMED TO BE AT INCREASED RISK FOR LIVER INJURY IF FELBATOL® IS REINTRODUCED. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH PATIENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR RE-TREATMENT.

### Drug disposition protein quantification in matched human jejunum and liver from donors with obesity [^114NWRV4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Although we found significant differences in some liver drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters in our donors compared with those in donors without obesity (from the lower weight control group and published data,), the differences between the groups were markedly smaller than the interindividual variability within each group. This suggests that for most of these proteins obesity plays a minor role in their regulation. The small differences between the groups could be an effect of the 3‐week low‐calorie diet that our donors with obesity underwent prior to biopsy collection. Notably, it has been shown that chronic cholestatic disease recipients (primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis) in liver transplant recipients may affect certain liver protein levels. However, the 17 control donors who underwent planned elective cholecystectomy in our study were otherwise healthy, with no clinical or biochemical signs of cholestatic liver disease. Accordingly, all liver‐related laboratory measures of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin were within the reference ranges (ALT: females < 45 units/litre (U/L), males < 70 U/L; AST: females < 35 and males < 45 U/L; ALP: 35–105 U/L, and albumin: 34–48 g/L). Nevertheless, the observed larger interindividual variability stresses the importance of modeling each patient individually regardless of whether they have obesity or not.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) — Screening should be considered in all patients with abnormal AST/ALT levels and include an iron panel to determine transferrin saturation and serum ferritin; if the transferrin saturation is 45% or higher, or the serum ferritin is elevated, consideration should be given for HFE gene mutation analysis. Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, an elevated ferritin in acute hepatitis likely does not indicate iron overload. The presence of a homozygous C282Y mutation confirms HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis, whereas compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes rarely manifest chronic liver disease from iron overload. In patients with homozygous C282Y or compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D mutations who have elevated AST/ALT levels or ferritin > 1,000 μg/l, or in non-HFE hemochromatosis, liver biopsy should be considered to stage liver fibrosis and quantify hepatic iron overload to guide therapy.

AGA Institute COVID-19 gastrointestinal and liver manifestations — Cholankeril, 2020 (Stanford University Hospitals): In n = 116, survival was 0.9% died, 86.2% discharged, and 4.3% still hospitalized; age was M 50 y (IQR, 35–67), 46.6% females, and disease severity was 71.6% evaluated in ED/clinic only, 20.7% admitted to the medical floor, and 7.8% admitted to ICU. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms present on admission included diarrhea 10.3% (12), nausea and/or vomiting 10.3% (12), and abdominal pain 8.8% (10); 31.9% reported GI symptoms, median duration 1 day (IQR, 0–4), and none had isolated GI symptoms or GI as the initial symptoms. Liver tests showed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (n = 65) M 35 (IQR, 22–58) and, in those with any abnormal LFT, M 64 (IQR, 24–76); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (n = 65) M 32 (IQR, 22–48) and, with abnormal LFT, M 59 (IQR, 22–76); total bilirubin (n = 65) M 0.4 (IQR, 0.3–0.7) and, with abnormal LFT, M 0.5 (IQR, 0.3–0.7). Additionally, 26 patients developed liver enzyme elevation, 22 of whom had normal baseline liver enzymes.

SOAP thrombocytopenia — preeclampsia/HELLP testing and criteria: The optimal frequency of laboratory testing before neuraxial procedure in preeclampsia is unknown, with published recommendations ranging from 6 to ≤ 12 hours, and platelet count changes from > 100,000 × 10⁶ /L to < 100,000 × 10⁶ /L within the 72 hours before delivery are even rarer. HELLP syndrome laboratory values include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 600 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevated more than twice the upper limit of normal, and platelet count < 100,000 × 10⁶ /L; identifying patients can be challenging because up to 15% of afflicted patients lack hypertension. If the clinical scenario is consistent with HELLP syndrome, it may be reasonable to verify platelet count within 6 hours of the planned neuraxial procedure (class IIb and level C-LD).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114e3RAH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — metabolic, alcohol‑related, and genetic evaluations for abnormal liver chemistries include NAFLD screening, alcohol risk thresholds, and targeted tests for hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency. Patients with elevated BMI and metabolic syndrome features with mild ALT elevations should undergo ultrasound screening for NAFLD. Women consuming more than 140 g per week or men consuming more than 210 g per week who present with AST > ALT are considered at risk for alcoholic liver disease and should be counseled for cessation. In the absence of acute hepatitis, test for hereditary hemochromatosis with iron level, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin; perform HFE mutation analysis when transferrin saturation > 45% and/or ferritin is elevated. Evaluate for autoimmune liver disease with ANA, ASMA, and globulin level. Screen for Wilson's disease with serum ceruloplasmin and, if low, confirm with 24‑h urinary copper and slit‑lamp exam for Kayser–Fleischer rings. Screen for alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency with alpha‑1‑antitrypsin phenotype. All cited as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Treatment of patients with hepatitis C and normal serum aminotransferase levels [^116duopG]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Approximately 30% of patients with chronic hepatitis C have normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and another 40% have ALT levels that are less than twice the upper limit of the normal range. Most patients with normal ALT levels have mild degrees of inflammation with mild or no fibrosis, and the rate of disease progression is reduced compared with that in patients with elevated ALT levels. Some patients with normal ALT levels have advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis on liver biopsy. Treatment of patients with normal ALT levels with either interferon monotherapy or interferon/ribavirin combination therapy has shown sustained virological response (SVR) rates that are equivalent to those achieved for patients with elevated ALT levels. Thus, patients with chronic hepatitis C should not be excluded from therapy based on ALT levels alone. The decision to initiate therapy with interferon and ribavirin should be based on a combination of factors independent of ALT levels including amount of fibrosis on liver biopsy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype and viral level, patient age and motivation, and co-morbid illness, and the presence of other complicating conditions.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)

Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C but drinking < 35 units/week (women) and < 50 units/week (men), respectively, should proceed to the full AUDIT questionnaire as detailed in figure 3. If GGT is elevated (> 100 U/L) then consideration should be given to an assessment of liver fibrosis, as for the higher-risk group.

Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

Liver chemistry monitoring and thresholds during TB treatment and ART: Liver chemistry tests (serum ALT at a minimum; AST and bilirubin also should be considered) should be performed before initiation and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment for TB (the same for ART initiation while receiving treatment for TB) (BIII). Beyond 2 months, routine testing every 2 to 3 months is advisable for all children receiving ART, and more frequently if clinically indicated (BIII). For children who develop signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity, treatment should be stopped and evaluation done on an urgent basis and liver enzymes measured (AIII). Mild asymptomatic elevations less than 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] do not require drug discontinuation when other findings are normal (AII). If transaminase levels exceed five times the ULN or three times the ULN with symptoms or signs of hepatotoxicity, all hepatotoxic drugs should be immediately discontinued, whereas with levels three to five times the ULN without symptoms, treatment can cautiously continue with regular (at least weekly) liver chemistry tests and ongoing expert consultation.

### Tolcapone (Tasmar) [^115E85wk]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Tests:

Although a program of frequent laboratory monitoring for evidence of hepatocellular injury is deemed essential, it is not clear that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes will prevent the occurrence of fulminant liver failure. However, it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery. Accordingly, the following liver monitoring program is recommended.

Before starting treatment with TASMAR, the physician should conduct appropriate tests to exclude the presence of liver disease. In patients determined to be appropriate candidates for treatment with TASMAR, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT/ALT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST) levels should be determined at baseline and periodically (i.e. every 2 to 4 weeks) for the first 6 months of therapy. After the first six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant. Although more frequent monitoring increases the chances of early detection, the precise schedule for monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment.

If the dose is increased to 200 mg tid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be conducted every 2 to 4 weeks for the following 6 months of therapy. After six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant.

Discontinue TASMAR if SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST levels exceed 2 times the upper limit of normal or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest the onset of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., persistent nausea, fatigue, lethargy, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, and right upper quadrant tenderness).

Study design and patient selection

From March 2020 to July 2020 275 patients were prospectively included in the Registry of the LMU Klinikum (CORKUM, WHO trial ID DRKS00021225). Inclusion was based on the diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19. The detailed inclusion criteria were: (1) patients and members of the hospital staff with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 or a highly likely SARS-CoV-2 infection based on typical radiological findings, respiratory symptoms, absence of a more likely diagnosis and negative testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus; (2) patients and members of the hospital who have a high risk of more severe COVID-19 due to known comorbidities or treatments, in particular immunosuppression, underlying malignant disease or underlying cardiovascular and/or pulmonary conditions; (3) patients and members of the hospital with initial suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient or their respective legal representatives in case the patient was unable to give informed consent, and from each member of the hospital included in the study. In case informed consent was not obtained, eg, due to fulminant course of disease, data were used in an anonymised and aggregated way only. Patients and the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research. Out of the 275 patients included until July 2020, 235 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasopharyngeal swab specimens in the accredited diagnostic laboratories at the Pettenkofer-Institute, Munich, as previously described. Patients without available baseline liver chemistry results (n = 14) or with underlying chronic liver disease (n = 4) were excluded from the analysis leaving 217 patients for analysis (figure 1). Patient history including gender, age and underlying medical conditions were recorded. Laboratory tests including liver enzymes were performed on admission and repeatedly until discharge. Values at admission as well as respective minimal and peak values were obtained via automated data extraction tools. LFT analysis included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL) and albumin. Further analyses included C reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). In case the patient had been transferred from another hospital, laboratory values from the initial admission were extracted from the patients' files. Endpoints for severe COVID-19 were defined as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), COVID-19-related death and a composite endpoint for severe COVID-19 comprising both ICU admission and COVID-19-related death. In case of missing single liver biochemistry values at the time of admission, we calculated the proportions of patients reaching each endpoint according to the numbers of patients for whom the respective laboratory parameters were available. The Charlson Comorbidity Index which is based on age and comorbidities was calculated.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines — statin safety management: In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients with increased diabetes mellitus risk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is recommended to continue statin therapy, with added emphasis on adherence, net clinical benefit, and the core principles of regular moderate-intensity physical activity, maintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss. In patients treated with statins, it is recommended to measure creatine kinase levels in individuals with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms, objective muscle weakness, and to measure liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase) as well as total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic panel) if there are symptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity. In patients at increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk with chronic, stable liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when appropriately indicated, it is reasonable to use statins after obtaining baseline measurements and determining a schedule of monitoring and safety checks. Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for routine use in patients treated with statins or for the treatment of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and in patients treated with statins, routine measurements of creatine kinase and transaminase levels are not useful.

Nearly 50% of these cases are explained by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of this study was to evaluate, in patients with accidentally detected chronically elevated ALT levels, the prevalence of fibrosis and NASH, and the clinical and biological factors associated with each entity. Retrospectively, 67 patients (mean age, 46.6 ± 12.1 years; 45 males) were included. All patients had a liver biopsy and were hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus seronegative without alcohol, drug, autoimmune or genetically induced liver disease, with ALT > N (the upper limit of normal). NASH was evaluated according to necroinflammatory lesions and fibrosis. Fibrosis was evaluated according to the METAVIR score. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test and the chi-square test. Fibrosis scores were: F0, 37.3%; F1, 32.8%; F2, 26.9%; F3, 1.5%; and F4, 1.5%. NASH was absent in 59.7% and present in 40.3%. Significant differences were observed between F < 2 and F ≥ 2 fibrosis patients for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT and between patients with NASH or without for body mass index. Overall, the risk of F ≥ 2 fibrosis was increased in patients with AST > N, ALT > 2N or AST > N and ALT > 2N. The prevalence of F ≥ 2 fibrosis and NASH in patients with unexplained chronic abnormal ALT are 30% and 40%, respectively. Since the risk of F ≥ 2 fibrosis is significantly increased in patients with AST > N and/or ALT > 2N, liver biopsy should be performed only in patients with AST > N or ALT > 2N.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Inform patients that TRIKAFTA is associated with a serious risk for drug-induced liver injury and that liver injury resulting in liver failure leading to liver transplantation or death have occurred, including in patients without a history of liver disease.

Advise all patients that liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) should be assessed prior to initiating TRIKAFTA and then assessed every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Inform patients with a history of liver disease or liver function test elevations at baseline that more frequent monitoring may be necessary. Instruct patients to interrupt treatment with TRIKAFTA if symptoms of liver injury occur (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites) and to notify their healthcare provider immediately [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

ALT and AST levels and mortality associations — population data: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 18 (AST > 18) was linked to a 3X increase in all cause mortality. Compared with men with AST or ALT ≥ 20 IU/l, those in the 30–39 IU/l group had an 8X (AST) or 9.5X (ALT) relative risk for liver-related death. In a cohort with standardized mortality ratios, values were 0.95 for normal ALT (defined as ULN 45 IU/l for men, 29 IU/l for females), 1.32 for 1–2× ULN, and 1.78 for > 2× ULN. Another study reported ALT 30–39 associated with relative risks of liver mortality 2.9 (2.4–3.5) and 9.5 (7.9–11.5) in men, and 3.8 (1.9–7.7) and 6.6 (1.5–25.6) in women. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) definitions of elevated ALT (30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women) was associated with liver-related mortality (11.2×) and diabetes-related mortality (3.3×), and another analysis found ALT > 43 IU/l for men and > 30 IU/l for women related to coronary heart disease.

2.4	Laboratory Testing and Monitoring to Assess Safety after Initiating TEGSEDI

Monitor platelet count, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinalysis, urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin during treatment with TEGSEDI, and for 8 weeks following discontinuation of treatment.

Platelet Count

Do not initiate TEGSEDI in patients with a platelet count less than 100 x 109/L. Monitor platelet count during the entire course of treatment with Tegsedi and for 8 weeks following discontinuation of treatment. Recommendations for platelet monitoring frequency and TEGSEDI dosing are specified in Table 1. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible, and hold dosing until platelet count is confirmed. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable (e.g., clumped sample) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8].

Renal Monitoring

TEGSEDI should generally not be initiated in patients with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1000 mg/g or higher. Monitor serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinalysis, and UPCR every 2 weeks during treatment with TEGSEDI. Hold TEGSEDI in patients who develop a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m², pending further evaluation of the cause.

If a dose is held, once eGFR increases to ≥ 45 mL/minute/1.73 m², UPCR decreases to below 1000 mg/g, or the underlying cause of the decline in renal function is corrected, weekly dosing may be reinitiated. In the case of UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, perform further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis, as clinically indicated. If acute glomerulonephritis is confirmed, TEGSEDI should be permanently discontinued.

Liver Tests

Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin monthly during treatment with TEGSEDI; monitor monthly for patients who have received a liver transplant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. TEGSEDI should be discontinued in patients suspected of developing liver injury induced by TEGSEDI [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Hepatic: AST/ALT/Alkaline Phosphatase Increase

In the KRYSTAL-1 study, increased ALT and AST were reported as a TRAE in 28% and 25% of patients, respectively. Median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 22 days (IQR 15–26) and 22 days (IQR 15–35), respectively, and median time from onset to resolution was 14 days (IQR 8–22) and 11 days (IQR 6–22), respectively. Treatment-related alkaline phosphatase increase occurred in 12 patients (10%); median time to onset was 25 days (IQR 18–46), and median time from onset to resolution was 12 days (IQR 8–20). Treatment-related increase in ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase led to relatively low rates of dose reductions and interruptions. There were no Hy's Law cases (defined as ALT > 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN] and total bilirubin > 2 times ULN) reported to date in the adagrasib clinical development program.

Mild transaminitis is most commonly asymptomatic, therefore liver enzymes should be monitored regularly during treatment (every month for 3 months if the patient does not experience abnormalities). More frequent monitoring of liver function (including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) is advised for patients with transaminase increases. When transaminases are increased it is important to evaluate other potential contributing factors such as alcohol use, acetaminophen, other medications, and medical conditions. In the case of more significant hepatotoxicity, treatment with glucocorticoids can be considered. Dose modification guidance for hepatic toxicities (per adagrasib clinical study protocols) is shown in Table 5.

### Extensive testing or focused testing of patients with elevated liver enzymes [^113vf1Rq]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Many patients have elevated serum aminotransferases reflecting many underlying conditions, both common and rare. Clinicians generally apply one of two evaluative strategies: testing for all diseases at once (extensive) or just common diseases first (focused).

Methods

We simulated the evaluation of 10,000 adult outpatients with elevated with alanine aminotransferase to compare both testing strategies. Model inputs employed population-based data from the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and Britain (Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies). Patients were followed until a diagnosis was provided or a diagnostic liver biopsy was considered. The primary outcome was US dollars per diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included doctor visits per diagnosis, false-positives per diagnosis and confirmatory liver biopsies ordered.

Results

The extensive testing strategy required the lowest monetary cost, yielding diagnoses for 54% of patients at $448/patient compared to 53% for $502 under the focused strategy. The extensive strategy also required fewer doctor visits (1.35 vs. 1.61 visits/patient). However, the focused strategy generated fewer false-positives (0.1 vs. 0.19/patient) and more biopsies (0.04 vs. 0.08/patient). Focused testing becomes the most cost-effective strategy when accounting for pre-test probabilities and prior evaluations performed. This includes when the respective prevalence of alcoholic, non-alcoholic and drug-induced liver disease exceeds 51.1%, 53.0% and 13.0%. Focused testing is also the most cost-effective strategy in the referral setting where assessments for viral hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have already been performed.

Conclusions

Testing for elevated liver enzymes should be deliberate and focused to account for pre-test probabilities if possible.

Lay Summary

Many patients have elevated liver enzymes reflecting one of many possible liver diseases, some of which are very common and some of which are rare. Tests are widely available for most causes but it is unclear whether clinicians should order them all at once or direct testing based on how likely a given disease may be given the patient's history and physical exam. The tradeoffs of both approaches involve the money spent on testing, number of office visits needed, and false positive results generated. This study shows that if there are no clues available at the time of evaluation, testing all at once saves time and money while causing more false positives. However, if there are strong clues regarding the likelihood of a particular disease, limited testing saves time, money and prevents false positives.

REAL-WORLD EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TAEAT IN ONCOLOGY

Limited information is available on how practicing oncologists manage TAEAT or what criteria are used to predict whether the elevated aminotransferases will progress to more serious DILI. A recent real-world US evaluation of elevated aminotransferases associated with IO therapies found that isolated ALT and AST elevations of ≥ G3 were relatively transient (up to 128 d with median duration ~7 d), with only 5.3% subsequently progressing to elevated bilirubin levels. In this study, oncologists discontinued ICI therapy in 8% of cases, with 92% of patients proceeding with their anticancer treatment. In 37% of cases, ≥ G3 aminotransferase elevations were managed with corticosteroids without interruption of ICI therapy, illustrating decision-making based on risk:benefit assessment. Additional real-world studies are needed to assess current trends in TAEAT management in cancer patients treated with non-IO drugs including drug interruptions/discontinuations, use of corticosteroids, and frequency of liver function assessment. An analysis of 1670 patients in 85 phase 1 oncology studies found similar rates of DILI for patients in immune-based versus targeted therapy trials (5.0% vs. 4.9%); DILI resolved in 96% of patients, with no reports of drug-related liver failure, consistent with TAEAT representing drug adaptation. Nevertheless, additional real-world data and prospective clinical trials in specific oncology populations are needed to identify factors that predict which patients with elevated aminotransferases are likely to progress to more serious liver injury. Additional work is underway to develop best practice guidelines for the assessment of liver chemistries in oncology trials. In particular, consensus is needed regarding the continuation of an oncotherapeutic agent in patients experiencing TAEAT based on individual risk:benefit assessment.

### Combined non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass?-a controlled matched pair study of 34 patients [^113H7aRG]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although all bariatric procedures improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in metabolically sick obese patients, it remains unclear whether different procedures achieve similar effects. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) were compared for their effects on liver function tests (LFT) and glycemic control in a highly selected group of metabolically sick obese patients with both elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a common marker for NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

Thirty-four obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m(2), ALT > 35 U/L, and T2DM were well-matched from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed. Seventeen patients each underwent RYGB and SG, respectively. The effects on LFT and glycemic control were evaluated over 12 months.

Results

Both procedures significantly lowered ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) after 12 months, but SG improved both LFT significantly better than RYGB (ALT 17.8 ± 8.8 vs. 31.1 ± 11.2 U/L, p = 0.003; AST 17.0 ± 8.8 vs. 24.3 ± 7.5 U/L, p = 0.004). In contrast to RYGB, SG normalized elevated ALT levels completely (41 vs. 0%, p = 0.007). Both SG and RYGB improved insulin resistance, glycemic control, and reduced the need of insulin significantly without any difference between the procedures.

Conclusion

SG appears to improve LFT better than RYGB in well-matched obese patients with both elevated ALT and T2DM. This suggests that SG may have a better effect on NAFLD than RYGB with similar effects on glycemic control. The present findings should be verified in randomized controlled trials to obtain further evidence for the decision-making on the most appropriate bariatric procedure for metabolically sick patients.
