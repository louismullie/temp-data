## Question

should i order MRI with contrast when non specific liver lesion was found on CT scan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to order MRI with contrast for a non-specific liver lesion found on CT and, if so, which MRI protocol and contrast agent to choose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including lesion size, liver background, and whether there is known extrahepatic malignancy. Then, I should verify what the major guidelines (ACR, ACG, AASLD, ESMO) recommend for indeterminate liver lesions in these scenarios. Next, I will examine the comparative strengths of MRI versus CT and the role of hepatobiliary versus extracellular contrast agents. Finally, I will consider alternatives like contrast-enhanced ultrasound and outline a practical, stepwise recommendation with contingencies for contraindications and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because management hinges on three variables: lesion size, background liver disease, and presence of extrahepatic malignancy. I need to check whether the lesion is less than 1 cm or 1 cm or larger, whether the patient has cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, and whether there is a history of cancer that metastasizes to the liver, as these factors shift pretest probabilities and dictate the imaging pathway [^111oV6Jn] [^114EwQ6k] [^1173Pf2d].

> Now, I should verify the guideline backbone. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria consistently recommend multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT for indeterminate liver lesions detected on non-contrast or single-phase CT, with the choice tailored to size and clinical context; MRI is generally preferred when available due to higher soft-tissue contrast and lack of radiation, but CT remains acceptable when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable [^111oV6Jn] [^1128Tczq] [^1121Vhp7] [^113FndQE] [^112UTa1m]. The ACG 2024 guideline similarly recommends multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging, preferably MRI or CT, for focal liver lesions of uncertain etiology, emphasizing late arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases for characterization [^114EwQ6k] [^112PXEQo]. For patients at risk for HCC, AASLD directs diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for suspicious nodules, reinforcing the centrality of contrast-enhanced multiphase imaging [^1173Pf2d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm how lesion size influences next steps. For lesions 1 cm or larger, immediate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging is warranted because the diagnostic yield is higher and the management implications are greater. For lesions less than 1 cm, short-interval surveillance or multiphasic imaging is reasonable depending on risk, with many guidelines favoring MRI for its sensitivity to small lesions and avoidance of radiation if surveillance is needed [^111oV6Jn] [^1121Vhp7] [^113FndQE] [^114EwQ6k] [^112bGpeH].

> Next, I should review MRI versus CT performance. MRI generally offers higher sensitivity and comparable specificity to CT for focal liver lesions, particularly for small lesions and in cirrhosis, and avoids ionizing radiation; however, CT is faster, less motion-sensitive, and more widely available, so modality choice should balance diagnostic performance with patient factors and local expertise [^113X9CQD] [^112bGpeH]. Wait, let me verify the HCC data: meta-analytic comparisons show MRI sensitivity around 82% versus 66% for CT with similar specificity, supporting MRI's edge in high-risk populations, though both are guideline-acceptable [^113X9CQD].

> I will now examine contrast agent selection for MRI. Extracellular gadolinium agents are standard for dynamic multiphasic imaging and are fully compatible with LI-RADS assessment of arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout; hepatobiliary agents such as gadoxetate provide additional hepatocyte-phase information that can aid detection and characterization, especially for small lesions and in differentiating focal nodular hyperplasia from adenoma, but they can introduce transient respiratory artifacts and may be less suitable for some dynamic-phase assessments unless protocols are optimized [^113dAWjQ] [^114HcNFd] [^111RsCRf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought hepatobiliary agents might be universally superior; however, I should double-check the evidence: while hepatobiliary agents can increase sensitivity, particularly for small lesions, some comparative studies and consensus statements suggest extracellular agents may perform equivalently or better for LI-RADS-based HCC diagnosis depending on protocol and reader expertise, so there is no single "best" agent for all scenarios; selection should be individualized [^113X9CQD] [^116NTrFJ] [^111mk9Lq].

> Let me consider special populations and pitfalls. In patients with cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, MRI is preferred for its higher sensitivity and ability to depict washout and capsule features critical for noninvasive HCC diagnosis. Conversely, in patients with severe ascites, poor breath-holding, or claustrophobia, CT may be more practical despite radiation exposure, and noncontrast MRI or CEUS can be considered when iodinated or gadolinium contrast is contraindicated [^112bGpeH] [^113Sj73C]. I should confirm that noninvasive HCC criteria apply only in cirrhosis or chronic HBV and require multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging with arterial phase hyperenhancement and washout; in noncirrhotic livers, tissue diagnosis is generally required if malignancy is suspected [^1173Pf2d] [^1163uCdP].

> But wait, what if MRI or CT is inconclusive or contraindicated? Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a valuable problem-solving tool, particularly for differentiating benign from malignant vascular behavior and for characterizing lesions in noncirrhotic livers when CT/MRI are indeterminate; guidelines endorse CEUS in these scenarios and as a first-line option in some noncirrhotic settings, recognizing its real-time dynamics and lack of radiation [^117MWP47] [^116sjipF] [^114mpZCY] [^112awbnL]. I should also note that CEUS can help distinguish HCC from cholangiocarcinoma and assess tumor thrombus when CT/MRI are equivocal, though whole-liver staging still typically requires CT or MRI [^117MWP47].

> Next, I should review the oncologic context. In patients with known or suspected colorectal or other extrahepatic primaries, MRI is recommended to characterize indeterminate liver lesions on CT, especially when metastases are suspected or resectability is being considered, because MRI has higher sensitivity for small metastases and can alter management. ESMO and surgical oncology guidance support MRI in this setting, and combined CT plus MRI can further improve diagnostic confidence in select cases [^111uWKXU] [^1143JGQr] [^112HcVBm]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies broadly beyond colorectal cancer; yes, the principle extends to other primaries where liver metastasis would change treatment planning, with MRI often outperforming CT for subcentimeter disease detection [^114hN37H] [^116tjQcu].

> I need to ensure I address follow-up and biopsy thresholds. For lesions categorized as LI-RADS 3, short-interval surveillance in 3–6 months is advised. For LI-RADS 4, multidisciplinary discussion and either repeat imaging or biopsy is appropriate. For LR-M or when noninvasive criteria are not met in noncirrhotic patients, biopsy should be pursued to secure a diagnosis and enable molecular profiling when relevant [^1163uCdP]. Let me reconsider the role of AFP: while AFP thresholds can trigger diagnostic imaging, they are not diagnostic by themselves and should be integrated with imaging and clinical context rather than used in isolation [^1173Pf2d] [^1129KUf9].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is as follows. Yes, you should order MRI with contrast for a non-specific liver lesion found on CT, with MRI preferred over CT when available because of superior lesion conspicuity, characterization, and avoidance of radiation; use a multiphasic protocol with late arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases, and select an extracellular gadolinium agent as first-line unless there is a compelling reason to use a hepatobiliary agent for problem-solving or adenoma-FNH differentiation in a young patient [^112UTa1m] [^114EwQ6k] [^113dAWjQ]. If MRI is contraindicated, proceed with multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT; if both are contraindicated or inconclusive, consider CEUS as a problem-solver; tailor the urgency to lesion size and clinical risk, and escalate to biopsy when imaging features are indeterminate and malignancy remains a concern [^113X9CQD] [^117MWP47] [^1163uCdP].

---

In most cases, **contrast-enhanced MRI is preferred** for characterizing non-specific liver lesions detected on CT because it provides superior soft-tissue contrast, multiphasic enhancement, and functional sequences (DWI, hepatobiliary phase) that improve diagnostic confidence and reduce the need for biopsy [^114oLK9D] [^112mBbnD]. MRI is especially advantageous for lesions < 1.5 cm, in patients with chronic liver disease or prior malignancy, and when CT is inconclusive or contrast is contraindicated [^114hN37H] [^116NTrFJ] [^1143JGQr]. Use **multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT** if MRI is unavailable, contraindicated, or when rapid results are needed; consider contrast-enhanced ultrasound as a problem-solving tool when CT/MRI are inconclusive or contraindicated [^112bGpeH] [^112gcZpW] [^117MWP47]. Routine non-contrast MRI is not recommended for initial characterization because it lacks the enhancement patterns needed for confident diagnosis [^113c2HMV].

---

## Diagnostic performance of MRI vs CT

MRI provides **superior soft-tissue contrast** and multiphasic enhancement, enabling confident characterization of most liver lesions [^114HcNFd]. MRI's advantages include:

- **Higher sensitivity and specificity**: MRI outperforms CT for small lesions, particularly < 1.5 cm, and for differentiating benign from malignant lesions [^113X9CQD] [^116NTrFJ].

- **Functional imaging**: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hepatobiliary phase imaging improve detection and characterization, especially for small HCC and metastases [^113c2HMV] [^114hN37H].

- **No radiation exposure**: MRI is preferred for younger patients, those requiring serial imaging, or when radiation is a concern [^114EZCow].

CT remains useful when MRI is unavailable, contraindicated, or when rapid results are needed; however, it has **lower sensitivity for small lesions** and exposes patients to ionizing radiation [^116KMGye] [^114EZCow].

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring MRI with contrast

MRI with contrast is **particularly beneficial** in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for mri** |
|-|-|
| Lesion < 1.5 cm | Higher sensitivity and specificity for small lesions [^116NTrFJ] |
| Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis) | Superior detection and characterization of HCC and dysplastic nodules [^116NTrFJ] [^113X9CQD] |
| History of malignancy | Improved detection and characterization of metastases [^notfound] |
| Inconclusive CT findings | MRI provides additional information to clarify diagnosis [^1143JGQr] [^111HVnXW] |
| Contraindications to iodinated contrast (allergy, renal impairment) | Gadolinium-based contrast is generally safer in these settings [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring CT with contrast

CT with contrast may be preferred when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia), or when rapid acquisition is needed in acute settings. However, CT has **lower sensitivity for small lesions** and involves radiation exposure [^112bGpeH] [^114EZCow].

---

## Role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)

CEUS is a **valuable adjunct** when CT/MRI are inconclusive or contraindicated, particularly for characterizing hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [^117MWP47]. CEUS offers real-time imaging without radiation but has limited availability and operator dependence [^117MWP47] [^116NTrFJ] [^113Sj73C].

---

## Risks and contraindications

MRI with gadolinium contrast is **generally safe**, but risks include nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal impairment and rare hypersensitivity reactions. CT with iodinated contrast carries risks of allergic reactions and contrast-induced nephropathy, particularly in patients with renal impairment [^112EvdV6].

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

ACR and ACG recommend **contrast-enhanced MRI** as the preferred modality for characterizing indeterminate liver lesions, particularly in patients with chronic liver disease or prior malignancy [^114E2amH]. AASLD similarly recommends multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT for HCC diagnosis and surveillance [^1173Pf2d].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **MRI with contrast**: Preferred for most indeterminate liver lesions, especially < 1.5 cm, chronic liver disease, prior malignancy, or inconclusive CT [^114oLK9D] [^116NTrFJ] [^114hN37H] [^1143JGQr].

- **CT with contrast**: Consider when MRI is unavailable, contraindicated, or when rapid results are needed [^112bGpeH].

- **CEUS**: Useful adjunct when CT/MRI are inconclusive or contraindicated [^117MWP47].

- **Non-contrast MRI**: Not recommended for initial characterization due to limited diagnostic utility [^113c2HMV].

---

MRI with contrast is the **preferred imaging modality** for characterizing non-specific liver lesions detected on CT because of its superior diagnostic performance, lack of radiation, and functional imaging capabilities. CT with contrast or CEUS may be considered when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated.

Introduction

The advantages of MR imaging in the investigation of the liver are well documented since this examination provides a comprehensive work-up of focal and diffuse liver diseases. Recent state-of-the-art techniques including fast scanning acquisitions and new MR imaging contrast agents enable improvements in detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Therefore, together with appropriate clinical information, in most cases, a definitive diagnosis can be adequately achieved avoiding invasive procedures such as liver biopsy. This is based on the unique properties of MR imaging resulting in a high intrinsic soft tissue contrast between normal liver parenchyma and liver lesions, which can be further enhanced with intravenous administration of non-specific (extracellular) and liver-specific (hepatobiliary) gadolinium-based contrast agents.

Multiphasic dynamic gadolinium-enhanced imaging, which is considered essential in detection and characterization of liver lesions, is routinely obtained by using non-specific intravenous contrast agents that distribute in the extracellular space, both within and outside the vessels, and have imaging dynamics comparable to the extracellular iodinated contrast media used in CT.

The so-called liver-specific (or hepatobiliary) contrast agents (gadobenate dimeglumine, Gd-BOPTA, and gadoxetic acid, Gd-EOB-DTPA), are characterized by a dual behaviour: by exhibiting elimination through both renal and hepatic excretion pathways and thereby possessing both early perfusion information (renal elimination pathway) and, later, hepatocyte-selective information (hepatic excretion pathway) mediated through protein transporters, located in the canalicular or sinusoidal pole of the hepatocytes.

The liver-specific contrast agents are Gd-based compounds and, therefore, shorten the T1 relaxation time that results in an increased signal intensity of the healthy liver parenchyma on T1-weighted images.

The clinical use of liver-specific contrast agents allows the physician to obtain morphologic and vascular-related information, thanks to the dynamic study, as well as functional information, thanks to the hepatocyte-selective phase of enhancement. However, even if a large number of research and review articles on the use of liver-specific contrast agents in different clinical scenarios have already been published, agreement about their clinical indication is still lacking.

To develop a consensus and provide updated recommendations on the best MRI technique and the clinical use of liver-specific contrast agents, the European Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology (ESGAR) recruited a working group of key opinion leaders in the field of liver MR imaging.

MRI has become the most important imaging modality for detecting and characterizing focal liver lesions. The introduction of high-field-strengths, such as 3 Tesla MR imaging, in combination with the parallel imaging technique, has led to significant improvements in spatial and temporal resolution and has established this technique as a valuable asset in daily clinical practice. New techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may improve MR imaging sensitivity and specificity in the diagnostic workup of focal liver lesions. The tailored administration of various nonspecific and liver-specific contrast agents enables clinicians to increase the detection rate and improve the characterization of the different focal liver lesions. This article describes the usefulness of these imaging techniques in detecting and characterizing the most common benign focal liver lesions.

Diagnostic imaging modalities

Ultrasound is the recommended imaging exam for HCC surveillance in high-risk patients due to its cost-effectiveness and repeatability, but it is operator-dependent, can be limited by several patient-related factors such as obesity and ascites, and has limited sensitivity for the detection of small lesions. Either multiphasic CECT or MRI can be performed for lesion characterization. MRI can be acquired with extracellular or hepatobiliary contrast agents, and it should be the preferred imaging modality for HCC diagnosis due to its higher contrast resolution and sensitivity for the detection of small HCC. Recent meta-analysis demonstrated that CT and MRI have similar specificity for the diagnosis of HCC (both above 90% in high-risk patients), but MRI provides a higher sensitivity compared to CT (61–82% vs 48–66%). However, the choice of the diagnostic exam and contrast agent should take into account the local availability, radiologist expertise, and patient characteristics including contraindications to specific modality (for example, radiation exposure in young patients with chronic liver disease for CT, incompatible devices, claustrophobia caused by MRI) or contrast agent. Recent intraindividual studies comparing gadolinium-based contrast agents demonstrated higher diagnostic performances of MRI acquired with extracellular contrast agents compared to the MRI acquired with gadoxetate disodium according to current LI-RADS and EASL criteria for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC.

### Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced CT combined with contrast-enhanced MRI for colorectal liver metastases: a case-control study [^112HcVBm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are a major determinant of prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Their early and accurate detection is essential for appropriate therapeutic planning and improving survival outcomes.

Purpose

To evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting colorectal liver metastases.

Materials and methods

We employed a case-control design to compare patients with histologically confirmed liver metastases against a control group without the condition. A total of 85 patients in each group were selected and retrospectively matched based on relevant factors. All subjects underwent both contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. The diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities was assessed by analysing sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and radiologists' diagnostic confidence. Kappa statistics were used to evaluate inter-observer agreement. All MRI scans were performed using a 3-Tesla (3-T) MRI scanner to ensure high-quality imaging and detailed lesion characterization. And all the scans were reviewed by two radiologists.

Results

The combination of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in sensitivity (90.6% for MRI alone vs. 96.5% for combined modalities) and specificity (95.3% for MRI alone vs. 98.3% for combined modalities). Positive and negative predictive values were similarly enhanced. Radiologists' diagnostic confidence was higher with combined imaging, achieving a 'very high' confidence level in 78.8% of cases compared with 64.7% for MRI alone. The inter-observer agreement reached 'almost perfect' status with the combined approach.

Conclusion

The integration of contrast-enhanced CT with MRI significantly enhanced the diagnostic accuracy for colorectal liver metastases, representing a valuable tool for the preoperative evaluation of patients with CRC.

MRI, CT, and CEUS for HCC diagnosis — performance and use — reports that a recent meta-analysis suggests MRI has higher sensitivity (82% vs. 66%), with similar specificity (92% vs. 91%) than CT for diagnosing HCC, yet both techniques are equally recommended by AASLD. Extracellular and hepatobiliary MRI contrast agents are both equally recommended based on current data, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can be used as a second-line modality in cases where MRI and CT are inconclusive, unavailable, or contraindicated, particularly when tumor biopsy is not feasible.

### When should abdominal magnetic resonance imaging be used? [^114EZCow]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

When assessing the use of an imaging study, historically 2 criteria were used, diagnostic accuracy and cost of the study. However, as the awareness of risk for radiation-induced cancer in the general population increases as a direct result of more computed tomography (CT) studies being performed, reevaluation of the approach to imaging studies is necessary. The new imaging paradigm considers patient safety as an important aspect of assessing the role of an imaging modality. The primary goals of the new imaging paradigm should be diagnostic accuracy and patient safety, with the secondary goal being more affordable cost of study. In formulating a plan for when to use body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one has to consider all of these criteria and should also consider the question of when CT has unmatched diagnostic accuracy. The advantages of the spatial resolution of CT are mainly realized when there is great contrast between what is being looked for and background tissue; examples include small lung nodules and renal calculi. The greater intrinsic soft tissue contrast resolution and greater sensitivity for the presence or absence of intravenous contrast are appreciated in MRI studies, circumstances in which lesions occur within an organ without altering its exterior contour. This is well-shown for liver lesions. Adding patient safety into the equation, MRI should be indicated in exams in which there is no greater difference in diagnostic accuracy between CT and MRI, in patients with greater concern for radiation safety such as pediatric patients, and in cases of multiple or serial exams.

### Characterization of indeterminate liver lesions on CT and MRI with contrast-enhanced ultrasound: what is the evidence? [^117MWP47]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. CT or MRI is most commonly used for characterizing focal hepatic lesions. However, findings on CT and MRI are occasionally indeterminate. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), with its unique characteristics as a purely intravascular contrast agent and real-time evaluation of enhancement, is a useful next step. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for performing CEUS in the assessment of indeterminate hepatic lesions seen on CT and MRI. CONCLUSION. CEUS is a useful problem-solving tool in the evaluation of liver lesions that are indeterminate on CT and MRI. Uses include detection of arterial phase hyperenhancement; differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; determination of benign versus malignant tumor thrombus, benign versus neoplastic cystic hepatic lesions, and hepatocellular adenoma versus focal nodular hyperplasia; and monitoring for recurrence in postablative therapies. CEUS can help establish a confident diagnosis and determine the need for further invasive diagnosis or treatment.

### Consensus report from the 8th international forum for liver magnetic resonance imaging [^111mk9Lq]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Geographical differences exist between guidelines, driven largely by differences in treatment practices. In North America and Europe, the greatest concern is for high specificity. Since patients with a diagnosis of HCC may undergo liver transplantation based on imaging criteria alone, stringent diagnostic criteria are used to avoid false-positive HCC diagnoses. In the European Association for Study of Liver-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC) guidelines, the radiological hallmark for HCC is APHE and portal venous/delayed phase washout. In the 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, MRI with ECCM or gadoxetic acid is concluded to provide higher pooled sensitivity and similar specificity compared with CT. However, the AASLD still recommends diagnostic evaluation of HCC with either multiphasic CT or multiphasic MRI because they assume a similar diagnostic performance. While this statement is strongly endorsed by the AASLD guidelines, the supportive evidence level for CT is relatively low. There are no randomised, controlled trials comparing CT, ECCM-enhanced MRI, and gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI for the diagnosis of HCC in cirrhotic patients.

In contrast to the approach in North America and Europe, in Asia, the primary aim is to maximise the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis. This is justified by the greater use of locoregional ablative therapies in Asia such as percutaneous ethanol injection, RFA, and transarterial chemoembolisation. In the APASL guidelines, gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI is preferred over ECCM-enhanced MRI as a first-line diagnostic test. Hypointensity on HBP imaging can replace washout on ECCM MRI. Typical HCC can be diagnosed by imaging, regardless of its size, by applying the "washin/washout criteria".

A recent meta-analysis concluded that CT and ECCM-based MRI show similar diagnostic performance for detecting HCC, while gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI has the highest overall sensitivity and PPV and may be the optimal single method for diagnosis of HCC. Another meta-analysis concluded that MRI with an ECCM or gadoxetic acid has a significantly higher sensitivity (82% vs. 66%) and lower negative likelihood ratio (0.20 vs. 0.37) versus CT, with no differences between the techniques in specificities and positive likelihood ratios.

### Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113c2HMV]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma imaging modality performance and limitations are outlined: While distinctive HCC features can be observed by multiphasic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI offers additional sequences helpful for diagnosis, including T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging and, with gadoxetate disodium, the ability to distinguish even relatively small and subtle lesions by hepatobiliary phase hypointensity. MRI disadvantages include greater technical complexity, higher susceptibility to artifacts, and less consistent image quality, which may be compromised by difficulty breath-holding, trouble keeping still, or large-volume ascites. Although noncontrast MRI may detect lesions rarely found with CT, it does not reliably permit definitive diagnosis and staging of HCC in most patients, and thus the comparative diagnostic performance of multiphasic CT and MRI in real-life practice remains uncertain. Pretest probability is fundamental: patients with cirrhosis have a high pretest probability of HCC and a low pretest probability of nonmalignant nodules, and in such patients, nodules with hallmark imaging features can be reliably diagnosed as HCC. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing evidence about the comparative performance of multiphasic CT and MRI with extracellular or gadoxetate contrast in diagnosing HCC in patients with underlying cirrhosis.

Incidental benign liver lesions on CT — Benign liver lesions are very common; fortunately, most are not concerning. In low-risk patients (ie, without cirrhosis, liver disease, or a history of cancers that metastasize to the liver), no further workup is needed for lesions < 1.5 cm or with benign features (sharply marginated, homogeneous, < 20 Hounsfield units [HU]). In other scenarios, further imaging with MRI scan or contrast-enhanced CT scan should be considered.

Hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance follow-up — management of nodules lacking complete hallmark features is described as follows: When computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects a nodule with some, but not all, hallmark features, the differential includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-HCC malignancy, and nonmalignant entities. Prior clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommended biopsy for all liver lesions > 1 cm initially detected by surveillance ultrasound and interpreted as indeterminate by diagnostic call-back CT and MRI. The evidence supporting this recommendation was not provided, and due to limitations of biopsy and complexities of working up suspected HCC, alternative strategies such as follow-up or alternative imaging may be preferable in individual cases.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Focal liver lesions — General evaluation and imaging — In an asymptomatic patient without known liver disease and an incidentally detected liver lesion, workup includes a thorough patient history and blood tests with contrast-enhanced imaging (CEUS, MRI, and CT). Inadequately characterized and/or atypical focal liver lesions should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver tumor board. Multiphase postcontrast MRI and CT have shown no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy for focal liver lesions, although MRI confers many advantages. Most solid focal liver lesions in patients with no associated risk factors will be benign, including hemangioma, adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.

### Potential impact and utilization of ultrasound contrast media [^116W4sit]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Advances in non-linear imaging combined with new generations of ultrasound contrast agents have broadened and improved the applications of sonography in general. New guidelines to the use of this novel technique from the European Federation of Societies of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) will support its dissemination in the wider clinical practice. The effective impact of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has been more predominant in liver imaging with respect to detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions. Whilst it is not regarded as competing with contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, there are specific clinical niches where its potential impact and utilization are more likely to be universal.

### Diagnostic certainty in characterizing liver lesions in rectal cancer: abbreviated liver MRI versus CT [^1168y5B8]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing, with rectal cancer accounting for one-third of all cases. Increasingly personalized treatment options are available for rectal cancer, including the move toward a total neoadjuvant approach and the potential for watch and wait after complete response. – Accurate staging for the presence of metastatic disease is crucial to ensure appropriate treatment from the outset, especially as increasingly, patients with small-volume metastatic disease can be treated with a curative approach.

The liver is the commonest site of metastatic disease, and while there has been significant improvement in the treatment of the primary tumor, up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will develop metastatic disease in the liver and liver metastatic disease remains the commonest cause of death in this patient group.

Staging for metastatic disease is routinely undertaken by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). However, up to 40% of patients may require further characterization of the liver with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (on the basis of data from the VALUE trial)with Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI liver imaging having the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of liver metastases. – Other authors have explored the use of unenhanced liver MRIfor the detection of liver metastases, including compared with contrast-enhanced ultrasoundand the use of whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI as an alternative to CT staging.

However, despite this evidence, routine MRI of the liver is not performed for most patients. Instead, many centers operate a pragmatic approach of performing MRI liver with either Doteram or hepatocyte-specific contrast (Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences for patients with indeterminate liver lesions on initial contrast-enhanced CT. This is supported by international guidance, for example, the ESMO practice guidelines recommend liver MRI to "characterize non-typical liver lesions on CT scans or when liver metastases seem resectable or potentially resectable". While this approach allows for accurate characterization of those patients with too small to characterize (TSTC) lesions identified on CT, it leads to a delay in final staging, increased period of uncertainty for patients, and therefore a likely delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment. We report our experience undertaking routine diffusion weighted and T2 MRI sequences of the liver at the time of initial rectal MRI, and the potential for adopting a risk-stratified approach to the use of liver MRI. We looked to compare the incidence of synchronous liver metastases diagnosed by DW-MRI and ceMDCT in patients with MRI-defined high-risk versus low-risk rectal cancer.

### Detection and characterization of benign focal liver lesions with multislice CT [^112ajFgi]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

MDCT is a rapidly evolving technique that significantly improves CT imaging for several indications including depiction of focal benign lesions. Imaging mainly profits from improved longitudinal spatial resolution allowing high-quality non-axial reformations and 3D reconstructions and CT angiography as well as rapid accurate multiphase imaging with short breath-holding periods. This review provides an overview of the current status of MDCT with respect to liver imaging and the implications for characterizing benign focal liver lesions. MDCT currently allows the acquisition of thin slices in daily routine diagnostics providing an improved detection rate of small liver lesions. Whereas large benign focal liver lesions exhibit typical patterns of morphology, attenuation and perfusion, which also may be assessed with single-slice scanners, small lesions remain challenging even with MDCT, since the specific criteria for confident diagnosis become more ambiguous. Here, MR imaging provides more detailed information about tissue components and the availability of liver-specific contrast agents, adding further impact to this technique. With respect to dose considerations, the number of necessary multiphase scans as well as the application of very thin collimation should be strictly checked for each patient undergoing MDCT based on the individual clinical situation and question.

### Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced CT combined with contrast-enhanced MRI for colorectal liver metastases: a case-control study [^1175Snvb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiologists' training and standardization

To ensure consistency in the review process, both radiologists received similar training for diagnosis and followed the same calibration method. They reviewed 20 cases to standardize their assessment of liver metastases. Any discrepancies during the study's image review process were resolved through consensus.

Imaging

Patients first undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan, followed by a contrast-enhanced MRI. In a contrast-enhanced CT scan, an iodine-based contrast agent is used to diagnose diseases by increasing the density contrast between the lesion and surrounding tissues. This contrast agent is not paramagnetic and does not affect tissue relaxation time, so its injection does not interfere with MRI results. In a contrast-enhanced MRI, a gadolinium-based contrast agent is typically used, which helps diagnose diseases by altering tissue relaxation time. Gadolinium has a higher atomic mass than iodine and can significantly affect tissue density differences. As a result, gadolinium injection may influence CT scan results. According to the institution's guidelines, liver and kidney function tests from the past seven days are required before performing a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Additionally, CT scanning is performed first, followed by MRI at least one day later. Both CT and MRI scans are completed during the same hospitalization period.

CT technique

Contrast-enhanced CT scans were acquired using a Philips IQon Spectral CT scanner. CT contrast agent was iopromide (Yovex, 300 mg/ml) according to bodyweight, was injected prior to the examination. The CT imaging protocol was standardized using intelligent contrast agent tracking technology with a threshold of 150 HU for arterial phase scanning, with portal and equilibrium phases scanned at 45 s and 120 s after the arterial phase, respectively. CT scans were set to a slice thickness of 3 mm. The parameters for these sequences were adjusted to precisely characterize liver lesions. For CT imaging, protocols were carefully set to achieve optimal image quality for liver lesion detection. The CT scanner was configured with a collimation setting of 64 × 0.625 mm to ensure high-resolution imaging. The contrast agents were injected at a rate of 3.5 mL/s for CT. CT images were reconstructed using a deep-learning-based True Fidelity algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy. Radiation doses were monitored, with CTDIvol ranging from 10 to 15 mGy and DLP between 300 and 500 mGy·cm, depending on the patient's body habitus.

Staging of colon cancer — CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast or noncontrast CT of the chest and abdominal MRI are recommended for colon cancer staging. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous iodinated and oral contrast is recommended before the elective surgical resection of colon cancer; preoperative CT imaging permits detection of synchronous metastases that may change treatment strategy and alter the operative plan. While the yield of chest CT for colorectal cancer lung metastasis is low (6%–8%), its superiority to chest x-ray and ability to detect indeterminate lesions support its use; if iodine contrast is contraindicated, a PET/CT or noncontrast chest CT with an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are recommended alternatives. Indeterminate liver lesions on CT should generally be further investigated by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging.

Recommendations for the radiological diagnosis of HCC

Non-invasive radiological criteria for the diagnosis of HCC are only applicable in cirrhotic patients (evidence high; recommendation strong).
Non-invasive criteria can only be applied to nodules in a cirrhotic liver measuring 1 cm or more in diameter. Radiological assessment of HCC should be with either multiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI or contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan. A CT or MR scan should be used initially owing to analysis of the whole liver and greater sensitivity compared with contrast-enhanced US (evidence high; recommendation strong).
The non-invasive diagnosis of HCC is based on the identification of the typical hallmarks of HCC on multiphase CT or MR imaging. For lesions > 1 cm in size, these include the combination of hypervascularity in the late arterial phase (arterial phase hyperenhancement) and washout on portal venous and/or delayed phases. Depending on the exact size of a nodule, other hallmarks include threshold growth, and capsule appearance. If these criteria are not present but HCC (or other malignancy) is considered probable, then a liver biopsy should be considered for diagnosis (evidence high; recommendation strong).
The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System classification system may be used to standardise reporting of radiological findings and guide further management (evidence moderate; recommendation moderate).

Recommendations for the pathological assessment of HCC

The pathological diagnosis, grading and subtyping of HCC and its differential diagnosis from high-grade dysplastic hepatocellular nodules should be carried out using appropriate histological and immunohistochemical methods according to the 2019 WHO classification (evidence high; recommendation strong).
The diagnosis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma should be based on the presence of both hepatocellular and cholangiocytic differentiation in routinely stained sections (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
In liver resection and explant specimens, pathological staging of HCC should be carried out according to the 2017 TNM classification (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
Recognition of distinct HCC subgroups with prognostic and predictive implications should be based on morpho-molecular classification (evidence moderate; recommendation moderate).

Recommendations on the use of liver biopsy for the diagnosis of HCC

In cirrhotic patients, lesional biopsy should be considered for the diagnosis of HCC if non-invasive radiological criteria are not fulfilled (evidence high; recommendation strong).
In non-cirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of HCC should be based on pathology (evidence high; recommendation strong).
The diagnosis of HCC should be confirmed by pathology if systemic therapy is being considered (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).

Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma

HCC surveillance with 6-monthly US scan and α-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement should be considered in people with cirrhosis, and certain subgroups of patients with chronic HBV infection (evidence strong, recommendation strong).
The absolute risk of HCC and the potential harms of surveillance should be discussed individually before a person is enrolled in surveillance (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).
Surveillance is not recommended in patients who are not fit for cancer-specific therapy. Examples include those with decompensated cirrhosis (Child B8 or worse) who would not be candidates for liver transplant if HCC was diagnosed, and those with very impaired performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) category 2 or worse) (evidence moderate; recommendation strong).

The accurate diagnosis of a liver mass can usually be established with a thorough history, examination, laboratory inquiry, and imaging. The necessity of a liver biopsy to determine the nature of a liver mass is rarely necessary. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the standard of care for diagnosing liver lesions and high-quality imaging should be performed before performing a biopsy. This article discusses current consensus guidelines for imaging of liver masses, as well as masses found on surveillance imaging. The ability to accurately characterize lesions requires proper use and understanding of the technology and expert interpretation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® liver lesion-initial characterization [^1127eNkH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Incidental liver masses are commonly identified on imaging performed for other indications. Since the prevalence of benign focal liver lesions in adults is high, even in patients with primary malignancy, accurate characterization of incidentally detected lesions is of paramount clinical importance. This document reviews utilization of various imaging modalities for characterization of incidentally detected liver lesions, discussed in the context of several clinical scenarios. For each clinical scenario, a summary of current evidence supporting the use of a given diagnostic modality is reported. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### An algorithmic approach to MR characterization of focal liver lesions in adults without cirrhosis [^112iP2nu]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing both known and incidental liver lesions in the non-cirrhotic liver on MRI can be challenging. The radiologist can often narrow the diagnosis toward a diagnostic category using various sequences. Using an organized framework to guide the reader's differential diagnosis can be helpful. We present a sequential approach to the diagnosis of focal liver lesions, by first assessing background liver parenchymal signal intensity, then comparing the T1-weighted signal intensity of the reference organ(s), followed by comparing the T2-weighted signal intensity characteristics of lesion to fluid/spleen, and finally confirming using additional sequences including dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, hepatobiliary imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, as well as clinical and laboratory testing and additional modalities. Using this stepwise framework can sequentially guide the reader toward a diagnosis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — AASLD diagnostic and biopsy recommendations specify that in the absence of cirrhosis or at-risk chronic HBV infection, the diagnosis of HCC should be confirmed by pathology and that noninvasive imaging criteria have insufficient accuracy in these patient populations; the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC should be based on either dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT. For LI-RADS categories, in patients with an LR-3 observation, AASLD advises repeat cross-sectional imaging in 3–6 months; in patients with an LR-4 observation, AASLD advises multidisciplinary discussion to determine optimal follow-up, including repeat imaging with contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT within 3 months or immediate biopsy; AASLD advises multidisciplinary consideration of biopsies for LR-4 and LR-5 observations to confirm the diagnosis or enable molecular analysis; and biopsy should be performed in patients with an LR-M observation given the risk of mixed tumors and malignant non-HCC tumors.

### Is hepatotropic contrast enhanced MR a more effective method in differential diagnosis of hemangioma than multi-phase CT and unenhanced MR? [^113JrusL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cavernous hemangiomas are the most frequent benign neoplasms of the liver, found in autopsy examinations within 0.4% to 20% of population. Such frequent occurrence of hepatic hemangiomas (HH) rises a need for differential diagnosis between those benign lesions and malignant liver tumors, especially metastases. Many HH show characteristic image in US examination. However, in some cases hemangiomas show a non-specific appearance in baseline B-mode US and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) examinations are applied for further evaluation of observed focal liver lesions. An atypical hemangioma in US usually shows echogenic border, internal echogenic pattern at least partially hypoechogenic, totally hypoechogenic or heterogenic pattern or may contain calcifications or appear as large lesion.

Great technological development concerning both multi-detector computer tomography and hepatocyte-specific contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been observed in recent years.

Computed tomography is a well established procedure of imaging of hepatic hemangiomas. Most hemangiomas show typical enhancement pattern: nodular or globular peripheral enhancement in arterial phase with a progressive fill-in in portal venous and equilibrium phases.

In particular cases the use of magnetic resonance imaging leads to specification of diagnosis based on US and CT findings.

Many studies have been dedicated to differential diagnosis of hemangiomas from malignant tumors. Previous studies showed that the use of hepatocyte-specific contrast agents improves the accuracy and confidence of diagnosis of focal liver lesions, however, to our best knowledge none compared gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) enhanced MRI with unenhanced MR and CT in differentiation of hemangiomas showing atypical US appearance from other focal liver lesions. Any imaging technique used for verification of atypical hemangiomas should be validated.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether assessment by means of MRI of hepatic hemangiomas, showing atypical appearance on gray-scale US, improves with the use of Gd-BOBTA in comparison with contrast-enhanced multiphase CT.

### Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qKKNq]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imaging — overall conclusions and research needs: This systematic review confirms the utility of cross-sectional multiphasic imaging for noninvasive diagnosis of HCCs > 2 cm in size and indicates that available imaging modalities have only modest accuracy below a lesion size of 1 cm; based on limitations of the available evidence, no definitive recommendation can be made for systematic use of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI or extracellular contrast–enhanced MRI over CT. The review highlights the need for rigorously designed comparative studies to compare multiphasic CT versus extracellular contrast–enhanced or gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and to compare gadoxetate-enhanced MRI versus extracellular contrast–enhanced MRI, and it identifies an unanswered question — whether adults with cirrhosis and an indeterminate hepatic nodule are best evaluated by biopsy, repeated imaging, or alternative imaging — because there was a complete lack of applicable studies identified.

### Diagnostic certainty in characterizing liver lesions in rectal cancer: abbreviated liver MRI versus CT [^113nKzwq]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, when the cohort of ceMDCT is divided by those with high- and low-risk rectal cancer, the conversion rate at diagnosis is 12.5% (1/8) in high-risk rectal cancers compared with 0% (0/15) in low-risk cancers. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data to show this. A risk-stratified approach to offering liver MRI may therefore prove a cost-effective model for characterization of liver lesions in this at-risk cohort with a higher rate of liver metastases detected and increased reassurance for indeterminate liver lesions. The consideration of risk-stratified approaches to imaging is timely given the increasing pressures on imaging services.

Staging for liver metastases is routinely undertaken by CT, however, the sensitivity of CT for liver metastases is ~70%. There have been multiple meta-analyses reporting the sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced CT, abbreviated liver MRI based on DW-MRI sequences, and hepatocyte-specific contrast-enhanced MRI, including Wu et al. who reported contrast enhanced MRI and DWI as having equivalent sensitivities for the diagnosis of liver metastases, 0.9 versus 0.87 (p > 0.05), but a combination of DWI-MR and contrast-enhanced MRI combined has the best sensitivity for the diagnosis of liver metastases with a sensitivity of 97%. Zech et al. reported that 39.7% of patients staged with contrast-enhanced CT required further imaging of the liver within the VALUE trial (a cohort of patients with confirmed or suspected liver metastases)and reported that the cost of diagnostic workup was lower when a hepatocyte-specific MRI was used as the initial imaging procedure for the detection of colorectal cancer liver metastases. However, within the UK, the use of routine MRI for the detection of liver metastases is unlikely to be adopted, as fewer MRI scanners and radiologists are available.

### Consensus report from the 10th global forum for liver magnetic resonance imaging: developments in HCC management [^115ASvdz]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions on Eastern and Western perspectives

The differences in approach between Eastern and Western countries are explainable largely by differences in the etiology, prevalence, surveillance methods, and management of HCC.

There are many challenges related to surveillance. The sensitivity of US for early-stage HCC is low, meaning that small, potentially curable HCCs are not identified. Alternative strategies, such as AMRI, could potentially yield improved detection and potential survival.

In diagnosis and management, all guidelines recommend dynamic CT, dynamic MRI using ECCM, or gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI. Guidelines do not recommend one MRI contrast agent over another, with the exception of APASL, which recommends gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI, based on its higher sensitivity (particularly for the detection of small lesions). Recommendations on specific protocols for gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI differ between Eastern and Western guidelines, reflecting differences in their requirements for specificity and sensitivity.

Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI provides additional information beyond HCC diagnosis, for tumor staging and prognostication, and it may have a role in identifying pre-neoplastic lesions. A reported disadvantage with gadoxetic acid is occurrences of respiratory artefacts during dynamic-phase MRI, reported at a frequency of 5–22%. While the causes and risk factors for these artifacts remain unclear, they can be mitigated by a number of optimized techniques, including shortened breath-holding times, multiple arterial phase imaging, and free-breathing acquisition. There is a need for more evidence on the wider applications of gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI in HCC, in particular from clinical trials with multicenter study designs.

Consensus statements

Consensus statement 1: Gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI is useful for the diagnosis, staging, and therapy planning of HCC (78/80 (98%) agreement).

Consensus statement 2: There are regional differences in HCC diagnostic and staging systems based on population studied, available resources, and management guidelines (81/83 (98%) agreement).

Consensus statement 3: Related to the context of use and disease prevalence, Eastern diagnostic criteria favor sensitivity compared with Western diagnostic criteria that favor specificity (77/86 (90%) agreement).

Consensus statement 4: Standardized language should be used to define the adequacy of image quality for HCC diagnosis and surveillance (79/83 (95%) agreement).

Consensus statement 5: Further research is needed to establish the role of alternative surveillance strategies (including AMRI) and stratify the risk of HCC development to guide optimal surveillance strategy (77/82 (94%) agreement).

Patients with an elevation in AFP

In the absence of an abnormality on US, the magnitude of elevation in AFP or the rate of increase in this biomarker that should trigger further investigation for HCC has not been defined. An elevation of AFP to > 200 ng/mL has a specificity approaching 100% but sensitivity less than 40%. The specificity for AFP values < 100 ng/mL is significantly lower, even if in clinical practice this level of elevation commonly triggers further imaging studies, as does a persistent increase.

HCC, in the right clinical context, can be diagnosed by imaging characteristics alone. Imaging or non-invasive criteria are restricted to patients with underlying cirrhosis. On contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, either CT or MRI, the characteristic features of HCC are hyperenhancement of the lesion in the arterial phase of contrast enhancement, with washout or hypoattenuation within the lesion in the portal venous and/or delayed-phase postcontrast enhancement. In addition, there may also be enhancement of a capsule involving the lesion. Thoracic and pelvic CT complete staging when the diagnosis of HCC has been made.

While the classic imaging characteristics of HCC have been well reported, these characteristics occur less frequently in HCC that are < 2 cm in diameter. A definitive diagnosis of HCC cannot be made by non-invasive criteria in lesions < 1 cm in size. If non-invasive criteria for diagnosis are not fulfilled, lesional biopsy is required.

### Diagnostic imaging of hepatic lesions in adults [^114oLK9D]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current modality of choice for characterization of liver masses incidentally detected on imaging. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) performed in the portal phase is the mainstay for the screening of liver metastases. Characterization of a liver mass by CT and MRI primarily relies on the dynamic contrast-enhancement characteristics of the mass in multiple phases. Noninvasive MRI and CT imaging characteristics of benign and malignant liver masses, coupled with relevant clinical information, allow reliable characterization of most liver lesions. Some cases may have nonspecific or overlapping features that may present a diagnostic dilemma.

### Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced CT combined with contrast-enhanced MRI for colorectal liver metastases: a case-control study [^112SZ3FZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health issue and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Liver metastasis is common in CRC, impacting prognosis and treatment options. Accurate detection and characterization of liver metastases are crucial for optimal treatment planning, which may include surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy, and targeted therapies.

Traditionally, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has been the primary imaging modality for detecting colorectal liver metastases due to its accessibility and high resolution. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly with liver-specific contrast agents, has gained prominence for its superior contrast resolution, allowing better detection of small or ambiguous lesions.

The complexity of hepatic metastases presents challenges in oncologic imaging. While solitary lesions are less common, the liver's extensive vascular network facilitates the spread of neoplastic cells from primary malignancies. The portal venous system plays a crucial role in this dissemination, transporting neoplastic emboli from abdominal organs.

This unique physiological environment promotes the growth of metastatic cells within hepatic sinusoidal spaces. underscoring the liver's status as a common secondary site for various cancers.

Early and accurate detection of liver metastases is essential for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic planning in CRC patients. Surgical intervention can significantly enhance survival rates, highlighting the importance of precise preoperative imaging. Discrepancies between preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings can negatively impact patient care.

Despite advancements in imaging technology, individual methods may still be insufficient for accurate staging. Integrating multiple imaging techniques can address these limitations and enhance diagnostic accuracy. A systematic review by Floriani et al. (2010), demonstrated that MRI with gadolinium-based contrast agents exhibits superior sensitivity compared to CT for detecting small hepatic lesions. Moreover, recent studies, have shown that combining diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI significantly improves diagnostic performance compared to CT and PET/CT.

While previous studies have evaluated the performance of CT and MRI independently, our study is among the first to systematically assess their combined use in clinical practice. This research aims to leverage the strengths of both modalities, enhancing lesion detectability and diagnostic confidence, particularly in inconclusive cases. Given the evolving landscape of CRC management, this study seeks to compare the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, evaluate the benefits of a multimodal approach, and determine whether it can significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic confidence in assessing hepatic metastatic burden in CRC patients.

Discussion

MRI demonstrated statistical significance in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value compared to CT. MRI scans exhibited higher image quality, enhancing radiologist confidence in diagnostic accuracy. With 'Almost Perfect' inter-observer agreement levels, MRI surpassed the 'Substantial' agreement observed with CT scans, outperforming CT in detecting lesions of all sizes, particularly those smaller than 1 cm.

These findings are pivotal for advancing oncologic imaging and patient care. MRI's higher sensitivity in identifying metastatic lesions enables earlier detection, potentially improving the effectiveness of subsequent interventions and reducing unnecessary tests, anxiety, and healthcare costs for patients. Additionally, the study's outcomes could inform clinical guidelines, advocating for MRI as the preferred imaging modality for evaluating colorectal cancer metastases to the liver, ultimately improving survival rates and quality of life through more personalized treatments.

Our results align with previous studies highlighting MRI's superior performance over CT in detecting colorectal liver metastases. Floriani et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of various imaging modalities for diagnosing liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Their findings indicated that MRI, particularly when enhanced with contrast agents, consistently outperforms CT, especially in the detection of small lesions, which is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. In line with this, Vilgrain et al. (2016) emphasized the value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in improving detection rates of small lesions compared to conventional techniques. Their meta-analysis confirmed DWI MRI's superior sensitivity and specificity, especially for liver metastases smaller than 1 cm.

In a study by Qiu et al. 66 colorectal cancer patients underwent CT and MRI scans analyzed independently by two radiologists using different protocols, including CE-CT alone and CE-CT with NE-MRI or CE-MRI. Their results indicated that the CE-CT and NE-MRI protocol significantly improved hepatic lesion detection rates, particularly for lesions under 10 mm. Similarly, Ozaki et al. examined 87 patients using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and CE-CT, evaluating abbreviated MRI protocols against standard MRI and combined approaches. Their findings showed that abbreviated MRI protocols achieved diagnostic accuracy comparable to standard MRI.

### The fate of indeterminate liver lesions: what proportion are precursors of hepatocellular carcinoma? [^111EWYNZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver cancer incidence is increasing worldwide, now representing the fifth commonest cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% of primary liver cancers and 80–90% of HCCs occur in individuals with underlying cirrhosis, with viral hepatitis B and C infection and alcohol related liver disease (ArLD) being the most common aetiologies. A number of studies have demonstrated that the incidence of HCC in cirrhotic patients is around 1.5% per year or greater, regardless of the underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) aetiology. Therefore, both European and American guidelines now recommend six-monthly screening ultrasound scans (USS) to be performed in all cirrhotic patients in order to facilitate early HCC diagnosis. When a suspicious lesion is revealed by the screening USS, a second level of imaging, either a computed tomography (CT) or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, should be carried out. Although non-invasive criteria for the diagnosis of HCC have been formulated for both these techniques, MRI has been found to have a higher specificity and sensitivity when compared to CT, particularly when it comes to small lesions, and there have been advancements in diagnostic accuracy using MRI imaging, for example with the use of hepatospecific contrast media. Lesions, however, do not always demonstrate the characteristic radiological features of HCC (arterial enhancement, and venous phase washout and / or delayed phase washout), or of any other known liver lesions, and such lesions are therefore classified as indeterminate. These indeterminate lesions are commonly seen in clinical practice, usually in cirrhotic patients, posing a diagnostic and prognostic dilemma for clinicians. Whilst guidelines are more explicit regarding management of lesions of 1 cm or more in size, including consideration of biopsy, optimal management of smaller lesions remains unclear.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111RsCRf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal liver lesions imaging — modality performance and MRI contrast agent selection: Studies suggest that up to 95% of focal liver lesions detected on grayscale ultrasound can be diagnosed with proper contrast-enhanced imaging without the need for biopsy. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 97.8%, 83.9%, and 82.2% for benign lesion characterization. A review of literature has shown no statistically significant difference between CT and MRI in diagnosis of focal liver lesions, and the lack of ionizing radiation makes MRI a more attractive study for younger individuals without risk factors when ongoing surveillance imaging is required. A frequent clinical dilemma is understanding whether to order an MRI with extracellular vs hepatobiliary contrast agent; because hepatobiliary agents are partially excreted by the biliary system, lesions with biliary pathology (focal nodular hyperplasia [FNH]) will be hyperintense on hepatobiliary phase imaging, whereas most other lesions will be hypointense. Therefore, in a young patient with no known risk factors for malignancy, MRI with hepatobiliary agent contrast allows for diagnosis of FNH vs adenoma, and follow-up thereafter can be with extracellular or hepatobiliary contrast agent. In other clinical scenarios where FNH may not be a consideration, there is no consensus on use of extracellular vs hepatobiliary contrast agent as first line for liver imaging diagnosis, and based on expert opinion, extracellular contrast agent is favored because hepatobiliary agent–induced respiratory motion (acute transient dyspnea) and lack of adequate dynamic-phase enhancement are limitations of hepatobiliary agents.

Focal liver lesions — initial diagnostic approach for incidental lesions without known liver disease emphasizes that workup includes a thorough patient history, blood tests, and contrast-enhanced imaging (CEUS, MRI, CT). Inadequately characterized and/or atypical focal liver lesions should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver tumor board. Multiphasic postcontrast MRI and CT have shown no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy for focal liver lesions, although MRI confers many advantages. In patients with an FLL of uncertain etiology, we recommend multiphasic contrast–enhanced imaging, preferably MRI or CT performed with late arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases (strong recommendation, low level of evidence).

### Imaging for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Sj73C]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imaging — patient factors and contraindications may guide modality choice: Ascites can introduce severe artifacts on MRI, especially at 3 tesla; such patients may be better off with CT, and if MRI is pursued, 1.5T scanning should be considered. Poor breath-holders may be better off with CT, although robust free-breathing sequences are under development but are not yet widely available. Gadoxetate disodium uptake tends to be reduced in decompensated liver disease and, in severe iron overload, the agent's ability to enhance the liver and characterize lesions may be compromised; in such patients, extracellular contrast agent MRI or CT may be preferable. When CT or MRI contrast agents are contraindicated, refused, or intravenous access is inadequate, noncontrast MRI may be best, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound is another option, though this modality has only recently been approved in the United States and the requisite expertise is not yet widespread.

For these patients, the guidelines "recommend evaluation using multiphasic abdominal contrast-enhanced CT or MRI" to assess enhancement characteristics, lesion extent/number, vascular anatomy, and extrahepatic disease. "Gadolinium contrast is preferred for MRI" because hepatobiliary agents such as gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid are not currently included in AASLD or LI-RADS interpretation. MRI quality depends on patient compliance with breath-holding. LI-RADS criteria apply only to those with cirrhosis, and biopsy may be necessary without a liver disease history.

### AASLD practice guidance on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [^1129KUf9]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD HCC surveillance recall — ultrasound and AFP triggers state that US-2 can be safely observed with repeat short-interval surveillance using ultrasound and AFP in 3–6 months for lesions < 1 cm, and if the liver lesion remains stable on two or more follow-up ultrasound exams the patient can return to semiannual surveillance. Visualization limitations (LI-RADS visualization scores B or C) may be observed in ~20% of patients, and severe visualization limitations (LI-RADS visualization score C) are associated with lower sensitivity and may warrant other surveillance strategies, such as MRI. Patients with a new or enlarging solid liver lesion ≥ 1 cm on ultrasound (US-3) and those with elevated AFP independent of ultrasound results have a high risk of HCC and should undergo diagnostic imaging with multiphase CT or contrast-enhanced MRI. An AFP cutoff of 20 ng/ml provides a sensitivity of ~60% and specificity of ~90% and is the most common threshold for HCC surveillance, and patients with rising AFP on two consecutive tests or doubling of AFP levels may also warrant diagnostic imaging. For markedly elevated AFP (e.g. AFP ≥ 200 ng/ml) without a liver mass on diagnostic abdominal imaging, repeat abdominal imaging with an alternative modality and dedicated imaging of the chest and pelvis may be considered.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: can we differentiate? [^111SuXxb]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Several non-neoplastic abnormalities may simulate malignant disease and differential diagnosis may be difficult by imaging alone. However, the imaging characteristics and enhancement pattern of the lesion with the assessment of vascular involvement may be very helpful. Co-involvement of the spleen should raise the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process, as should discrete cystic foci in a solid lesion. Multimodality imaging in relevant cases may also be extremely useful by delineating the different imaging aspects of the same lesion. Besides all these parameters, patient demographics, clinical symptoms, and signs such as fever, laboratory data, tumor markers, short-term changes of imaging findings, and imaging findings of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) should all be taken into account for correct diagnosis. Close communication with the referring physician is another important point to be considered. It should be borne in mind that many unusual infectious and non-infectious inflammatory lesions may be sampled for diagnosis with imaging guidance and that this approach is safe in experienced hands and should be liberally used as a tool for early diagnosis.

### Clinical value of MRI liver-specific contrast agents: a tailored examination for a confident non-invasive diagnosis of focal liver lesions [^112mBbnD]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Screening of the liver for hepatic lesion detection and characterization is usually performed with either ultrasound or CT. However, both techniques are suboptimal for liver lesion characterization and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has emerged as the preferred radiological investigation. In addition to unenhanced MR imaging techniques, contrast-enhanced MR imaging can demonstrate tissue-specific physiological information, thereby facilitating liver lesion characterization. Currently, the classes of contrast agents available for MR imaging of the liver include non-tissue-specific extracellular gadolinium chelates and tissue-specific hepatobiliary or reticuloendothelial agents. In this review, we describe the MR features of the more common focal hepatic lesions, as well as appropriate imaging protocols. A special emphasis is placed on the clinical use of non-specific and liver-specific contrast agents for differentiation of focal liver lesions. This may aid in the accurate diagnostic workup of patients in order to avoid invasive procedures, such as biopsy, for lesion characterization. A diagnostic strategy that considers the clinical situation is also presented.

### Clinical benefits of MRI-guided freehand biopsy of small focal liver lesions in comparison to CT guidance [^112LSgsf]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Image-guided biopsy of focal liver lesions (FLL) is fundamental for an accurate diagnosis and treatment strategy, particularly in case of suspicious malignancy or known primary tumor with suspected recurrence or metastasis. Although the developments in diagnostic imaging in the use of multislice computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with liver-specific contrast medium provide a high sensitivity regarding the differentiation of FLL, additional histopathological evaluation is often obligatory. Emphasized by increasing evidence of prognostic and therapeutic information obtained from histopathological and comprehensive genomic profiling, this allows identifying patients who may benefit most from targeted therapies.

Ultrasound (US) and CT are the most commonly used modalities for liver biopsy, although both have certain clinical limitations: US guidance may be difficult due to a restricted sonic window. In the use of CT guidance, lesion conspicuity in the non-enhanced phase may be limited, and contrast agents improve lesion visualization only for a short interval of time. MRI guidance has been successfully established as an alternative for image-guided biopsy in different anatomical organs; however, due to restricted patient access in conventional MRI systems, high costs of specialized interventional MRI systems, and longer procedure times, it is not widely used yet. Nevertheless, MRI guidance offers some relevant advantages such as the non-ionizing nature of this approach, the excellent soft tissue contrast and high resolution, and the multiplanar capabilities allowing various access routes. A few studies have described clinical success rates of approximately 90% of MRI-guided biopsies. Additionally, it has been reported that in the use of CT guidance, up to 45% of small hepatic lesions were inadequately visualized with consecutive sampling errors and false-negative biopsies. In contrast, using MRI guidance and liver-specific contrast agent, accurate visualization of small hepatic lesions can be exploited. To date, there is a lack of studies providing a direct comparison of both guidance modalities (MRI and CT).

In this trial, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of real-time liver biopsy in small FLL < 20 mm with respect to clinical success and complication rates by comparing a prospectively collected MRI-guided with a retrospectively collected CT-guided cohort, in general, and by propensity score matching (PSM).

### Imaging approach for evaluation of focal liver lesions [^11199dwZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Focal liver lesions are common in the general population. Radiology (imaging) plays a pivotal role for the diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and follow-up of focal liver lesions. To maximize lesion detection and characterization, imaging needs to be performed with appropriate equipment by using protocols carefully designed on the basis of the underlying clinical context. In addition, the decision of an imaging modality cannot be based on the diagnostic accuracy of an imaging test solely but must also consider patient safety and cost-effectiveness.

For metastatic evaluation, PET/CT may be considered after formal pancreatic CT protocol in patients with high-risk and is not a substitute for high-quality, contrast-enhanced CT, while pancreas protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast can be a helpful adjunct to CT, particularly for CT-indeterminate liver lesions or when suspected pancreatic tumors are not visible on CT or in cases of contrast allergy.

### Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis… [^1117ikJ9]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

Contrast administration Abdominal imaging is associated with many potential uses for the different phases of contrast CT. The majority of abdominal and pelvic CT's can be performed using a single-phase, but the evaluation of some tumor types, the urinary collecting system, and trauma patients among others, may be best performed with multiple phases. Contrast enhanced CT examinations can be acquired at a variety of specific time points after intravenous contrast injection. The timing should be chosen specifically to optimize contrast distribution within the solid organ parenchyma in question. In cases of suspected bowel leak or perforation, gastrointestinal fistula, interloop abscess or other fluid collection, oncologic staging and surveillance, and CT colonography, oral positive contrast is useful in delineating the lesions.

1% dilute barium solution can be administered orally for bowel preparation for CT scan of the abdomen. Unenhanced CT Non-contrast CT scans Figure 1a and 1b are of limited use for the differentiation of soft tissue structures. However, materials like blood, calcium, bone, and pulmonary parenchyma are highly visible and can usually be adequately assessed with non-contrast CT. For example, in the abdomen and pelvis, there are several indications for non-contrast imaging. These include: evaluation of renal calculi; assessment for gross intra-abdominal hemorrhage; and post-endostent volume measurements. In addition, non-contrast images are often obtained in conjunction with contrast enhanced images in evaluating potential renal transplant donors and in the evaluation of the pancreas.

Of note, dual-energy CT and the development of virtual "non-contrast" images may ultimately obviate the combination scans. Additionally, CT angiography examinations performed for pathologies like aneurysms and dissection are frequently performed in conjunction with non-contrast imaging. The non-contrast images facilitate the differentiation of active extravasation or acute bleeding from vascular calcifications. Portal venous phase The most common technique is to perform portal venous phase imaging in the abdomen and pelvis. This results in near optimal contrast opacification of the majority of the solid abdominal organs and it is used for a wide variety of indications: nonspecific abdominal pain; hernia; infection; masses; and in most follow-up examinations.

As a general rule, this single phase is adequate unless there is a specific clinical indication that has been shown to benefit from other phases. Delayed phase Delayed phase imaging encompasses scanning at a variety of different times following contrast administration, and depends on the pathology in question. Typical delayed imaging times range from a few minutes to up to 15 minutes or longer. The most common indications for delayed phase imaging are evaluation of the kidneys, collecting system and specific kidney, liver, and adrenal tumors. However, it should be stressed that the addition of late arterial phase images is only indicated if one of these tumors is suspected, or if there is a need for further characterization of a hepatic mass, since the large majority of patients will not benefit from the addition of this phase.

Contrast-enhanced CT or gadolinium-enhanced MRI

Studies and meta-analyses have compared the performance of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Most have shown a trend towards greater sensitivity of MRI over CT. However, the differences in pooled diagnostic performance are insufficient to definitively recommend one modality over the other. Compared with CT, MRI has the advantages of providing more detailed evaluation of the nodule and background liver tissue characteristics, and absence of exposure to ionising radiation. However, MRI also has important disadvantages, including greater cost, higher technical complexity, longer scan times, increased tendency to artefact, and less consistent image quality due to patient factors such as difficulty with breath-holding or large volume ascites. MRI also has a larger number of contraindications. CT is more readily available and faster, less likely to provoke claustrophobia and less degraded by artefact, but has the disadvantage of exposing patients to radiation. Both imaging modalities require intravenous access and contrast agents, the use of which may be problematic in patients with renal impairment or allergy to contrast agent.

The choice between multiphasic MRI and CT will be influenced by institutional practice and patient factors. For example, in the encephalopathic patient with large volume ascites, CT images may be less degraded by artefact. In a thin cooperative patient, MRI is likely to provide the best nodule characterisation.

Use of MRI hepatobiliary contrast agents

Hepatobiliary contrast agents are gadolinium-based agents combined with a ligand that precipitates uptake of the compound into a functioning hepatocyte via the OATP-3 enzyme pathway; the compound is then excreted into the biliary tree. The compound is not taken up by non-functioning hepatocytes or malignant cells, leading to a low signal within an HCC lesion compared with background liver when imaged in the liver-specific phase of contrast enhancement. Studies suggest that the use of hepatobiliary contrast improves the sensitivity of MRI compared with CT especially when detecting small lesions. However, there is still controversy about the use of these agents because of the pseudo-washout effect; this is where the transitional phase agent is misinterpreted as washout. This has led to the LI-Rads recommendation that if these agents are being used, only the portal venous phase of enhancement is used to assess washout. These agents have also been associated with increased respiratory artefact in the dynamic phase.

### 2017 version of LI-RADS for CT and MR imaging: an update [^114CP1wi]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a reporting system created for the standardized interpretation of liver imaging findings in patients who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This system was developed with the cooperative and ongoing efforts of an American College of Radiology-supported committee of diagnostic radiologists with expertise in liver imaging and valuable input from hepatobiliary surgeons, hepatologists, hepatopathologists, and interventional radiologists. In this article, the 2017 version of LI-RADS for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is reviewed. Specific topics include the appropriate population for application of LI-RADS; technical recommendations for image optimization, including definitions of dynamic enhancement phases; diagnostic and treatment response categories; definitions of major and ancillary imaging features; criteria for distinguishing definite HCC from a malignancy that might be non-HCC; management options following LI-RADS categorization; and reporting. © RSNA, 2017.

AASLD hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance recall algorithm — surveillance using ultrasound (US) plus alpha fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months proceeds as follows: Vis score A with no lesion on US and AFP normal leads to repeat US; Vis score B or lesion < 1 cm on US and AFP normal prompts follow-up ultrasound in 3–6 months; Vis score C (with no lesion or lesion < 1 cm on US) directs to screening contrast-enhanced MRI or multi-phasic CT, and repeat ultrasound can be considered for some patients; and if there is a lesion ≥ 1 cm on US, or AFP ≥ 20 ng/mL, or AFP increasing, the pathway directs to diagnostic contrast-enhanced multi-phasic MRI or CT. After diagnostic imaging, the pathway includes branches for no liver lesion but significantly elevated AFP, which directs to an alternative CT/MRI imaging modality +/− chest and pelvic CT, and for a liver lesion, which directs to the diagnostic CT/MRI LI-RADS figure; when no liver lesion and low AFP level are present, the pathway returns to US surveillance.

### Contrast agents for MR imaging of the liver [^1175ArTf]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Imaging of the liver is performed most often to detect and characterize focal liver lesions. MR imaging has been the method of choice to assess focal liver lesions accurately. Nonspecific intravenous contrast agents have been used for routine abdominal MR imaging protocols including liver imaging. Over the last 10 to 15 years new contrast agents have been developed that combine the excellent contrast resolution of MR imaging with improved tissue specificity. This article reviews various contrast agents that are in clinical use for liver MR imaging and discusses their potential clinical role.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected liver Metastases [^116e8DGs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Liver metastases are the most common malignant liver tumors. The accurate and early detection and characterization of liver lesions is the key to successful treatment strategies. Increasingly, surgical resection in combination with chemotherapy is effective in significantly improving survival if all metastases are successfully resected. MRI and multiphase CT are the primary imaging modalities in the assessment of liver metastasis, with the relative preference toward multiphase CT or MRI depending upon the clinical setting (ie, surveillance or presurgical planning). The optimization of imaging parameters is a vital factor in the success of either modality. PET/CT, intraoperative ultrasound are used to supplement CT and MRI. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Randomized multicentre trial of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI versus conventional MRI or CT in the staging of colorectal cancer liver metastases [^116KMGye]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world. Approximately 50 per cent of patients with colorectal cancer either have or will develop liver metastases at some stage of their disease. In patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, imaging of the liver is standard practice to exclude synchronous hepatic metastases. For follow-up after colorectal resection, guidelinessuggest the use of hepatic imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) at specified intervals, at the discretion of the surgeon or in the case of rising serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. The presence of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) is an important prognostic factor and changes the management of patients with colorectal cancer dramatically. Liver resection can be performed in about 15 per cent of patients, with overall 5-year survival rates in the range of 35–58 per cent. Although the surgical strategy in patients planned for surgery is devised before operation based on radiological imaging, surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is still regarded as the standard in establishing the extent of hepatic disease–. Deviations from the preoperative surgical plan as a result of additional intraoperative findings are undesirable, from both a patient and a logistical perspective. In patients with suspected CRCLM, imaging is used to detect liver lesions and characterize them to make the differential diagnosis between metastases, other malignant lesions or benign lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be more sensitive than CT for the detection of liver lesions (especially for lesions smaller than 10 mm in size), and is now regarded as the superior technique for characterization. Hepatobiliary contrast agents such as gadoxetic acid (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetate) can further increase the detection rate–. However, no controlled trials exist comparing gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with MRI with extracellular contrast medium (ECCM-MRI) and contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) for hepatic staging (including detection and correct characterization of liver lesions) in patients with suspected CRCLM. In the setting of hepatic imaging, MRI is still widely regarded as a problem-solving modality in case of equivocal findings on CT or ultrasound imaging, rather than a first-line imaging modality. However, depending on the number of unclear cases, this might result in an overall increased number of imaging procedures for patients as well as suboptimal use of resources.

### MRI contrast agent… [^112EvdV6]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

MRI contrast agents are contrast agents used to improve the visibility of internal body structures in magnetic resonance imaging. The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium-based contrast agents. Such MRI contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration. Due to safety concerns, these products carry a Black Box Warning in the US. Water protons in different tissues have different T1 values, which is one of the main sources of contrast in MR images. A contrast agent usually shortens, but in some instances increases, the value of T1 of nearby water protons thereby altering the contrast in the image. MRI contrast agents may be administered by injection into the blood stream or orally, depending on the subject of interest. Oral administration is well suited to gastrointestinal tract scans, while intravascular administration proves more useful for most other scans.

MRI contrast agents can be classified by their: Gadolinium Gadolinium containing MRI contrast agents are the most commonly used for enhancement of vessels in MR angiography or for brain tumor enhancement associated with the degradation of the blood–brain barrier. Over 450 million doses have been administered worldwide from 1988 to 2017. For large vessels such as the aorta and its branches, the dose can be as low as
0. 1 mmol/kg of body mass. Higher concentrations are often used for finer vasculature. At much higher concentration, there is more T2 shortening effect of gadolinium, causing gadolinium brightness to be less than surrounding body tissues. However at such concentration, it will cause greater toxicity to bodily tissues. Gd³+ chelates are hydrophilic and do not readily cross the intact blood–brain barrier.

Thus, they are useful in enhancing lesions and tumors where the blood–brain barrier is compromised and the Gd leaks out. In the rest of the body, the Gd³+ initially remains in the circulation but then distributes into the interstitial space or is eliminated by the kidneys. Available gadolinium-based contrast agents): Hepatobiliary agents
- gadoxetic acid is used as a hepatobiliary agent as 50% is taken up and excreted by the liver and 50% by the kidneys. Safety The use of Gd³⁺ chelates in persons with acute or chronic kidney disease can cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare but severe systemic disease resembling scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma. It may occur months after contrast injection.

Patients with severely deteriorated kidney function are more at risk for NSF, with dialysis patients being more at risk than patients with mild chronic kidney disease. NSF can be caused by linear and macrocyclic gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents, although macrocyclic ionic compounds have been found the least likely to release the Gd³+. In the United States, the research has led the FDA to revise its class warnings for gadolinium-based contrast media. It is advised that the use of gadolinium-based media should be based on careful consideration of the retention characteristics of the contrast, with extra care being taken in patients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant, and paediatric patients, and patients with inflammatory conditions. They also advise minimizing repeated GBCA imaging studies when possible, particularly closely spaced MRI studies, but not avoiding or deferring necessary GBCA MRI scans.

### Ultrasonography of liver tumors… [^115gVMjq]. Wikipedia (2017). Low credibility.

The substrate on which the tumor condition develops and the developing context are also added. Particular attention should be paid to the analysis of the circulatory bed. Microcirculation investigation allows for discrimination between benign and malignant tumors. It may have a heterogeneous structure in case of intratumoral hemorrhage. Doppler examination shows no circulatory signal. CEUS exploration is quite ambiguous and cannot always establish a differential diagnosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, during the arterial phase there is a centripetal and inhomogeneous enhancement. Hepatocellular carcinoma It is the most common liver malignancy. It develops secondary to cirrhosis therefore, ultrasound examination every 6 months combined with alpha fetoprotein determination is an effective method for early detection and treatment monitoring for this type of tumor.

Clinically, HCC overlaps with advanced liver cirrhosis in addition to accelerated weight loss in the recent past and lack of appetite. Cholangiocarcinoma It develops on non cirrhotic liver. 2D ultrasound appearance is uncharacteristic – solid mass with heterogeneous structure, poorly delineated, often with peripheral location and weak Doppler circulation signal. CEUS examination reveals a moderate enhancement of the tumor periphery during arterial phase followed by wash-out during portal venous phase and hypoechoic appearance during late phase. Generally, metastases have non-characteristic Doppler vascular pattern, with few exceptions. Cyst-adenocarcinoma metastases due to semifluid content may have a transonic appearance. When increasing, they can result in central necrosis.

CEUS examination is a real breakthrough for detection and characterization of liver metastases. to the experience of the examiner. To this the risk of confusion between hypervascular metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma and hemangioma and the confusion between hypovascular metastases and small liver cysts is added. Routine use of CEUS examination to detect liver metastases is recommended when conventional US examination is not. conclusive, when precise information on some injuries is necessary in conjunction with contrast CT/MRI and to assess the effectiveness of treatment when using an antiangiogenic therapy for hypervascular metastases. The method cannot replace CT/MRI examinations which have well established indications in oncology. parenchymal hyperemia. During venous and sinusoidal phase the pattern is hypoechoic, and the central fluid is contrast enhanced. CEUS examination is useful because it confirms the clinical suspicion of abscess.

In addition, it allows for an accurate measurement of the collection size and an indication regarding its topography inside the liver. CEUS exploration is indicated when a nodule is different against the general pattern of restructured liver either by different echogenity or by a different size than the majority of nodules. During the arterial phase, the signal is weak or absent. During the portal venous and late phase, the appearance is persistently isoechoic. Generally, RN is not distinct from the surrounding parenchyma. CEUS examination is useful to exclude an active lesion at the moment of exploration but does not have absolute prognostic value; therefore the patient should be periodically examined at short intervals. Correlation with clinical status and AFP measurements is required. B-mode ultrasonography is unable to distinguish between regenerative nodules and borderline lesions such as dysplastic nodules and even early HCC.

### Focal liver lesion detection and characterization with GD-EOB-DTPA [^1153XT7C]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Superior soft-tissue contrast affords magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) some advantages compared to computed tomography (CT) in both detection and characterization of focal liver lesions. Because of its relatively recently introduction into clinical practice, a growing number of articles in the literature have demonstrated the usefulness of the hepatobiliary-specific MRI contrast agent gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in liver imaging. The purpose of this review is to demonstrate the typical enhancement patterns of the most common liver lesions using Gd-EOB-DTPA in daily clinical scenarios and briefly describe its mechanism of action. Radiologists interpreting liver MRI studies with this agent must be familiar with the appearance of focal lesions in the hepatocyte phase to avoid misinterpretation.

### Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced CT combined with contrast-enhanced MRI for colorectal liver metastases: a case-control study [^112HyXN6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sivesgaard et al. studied 76 colorectal cancer patients undergoing FDG-PET/CT, CE-CT, and MRI before treatment. They utilized a dual-reader system for image interpretation, assessing sensitivity, specificity, and AUC_ROC values. Cantwell et al. analyzed imaging data from 33 patients using low-radiation NE-PET/CT, CE-PET/CT, and liver MRI. They found that while MRI's performance was comparable to CE-PET/CT, it excelled in lesion characterization based on superior AUC values.

While CE-CT is effective for detailed visualization of the liver's vascular structure, it may struggle with small nodules and differentiating benign from malignant lesions due to variations in hepatic blood flow. This presents diagnostic challenges in accurately classifying conditions like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both CT and MRI can occasionally struggle to characterize indeterminate hepatic lesions, highlighting the need for enhanced imaging strategies and additional diagnostic criteria to improve overall diagnostic accuracy.

Studies indicate that MRI, using liver-specific contrast agents, performs better than CT in detecting liver metastases. However, in clinical practice, due to the higher costs and limited availability of MRI, CT is often used as the primary staging tool, while MRI is reserved for cases where CT results are inconclusive or for more precise surgical planning. Regarding the combined use of CT and MRI, studies show that this approach can enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, due to additional costs and increased time requirements, it is generally recommended for complex cases or situations where the results of a single modality are insufficient.

Our findings suggest that integrating contrast-enhanced CT with MRI offers a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Unlike prior studies that focused on a single imaging technique, our research highlights the clinical advantage of a multimodal approach, which can be particularly beneficial for patients with borderline respectable liver metastases. Also our results indicate that combining contrast-enhanced CT and MRI improves diagnostic accuracy, this approach should be tailored to clinical needs. In cases where a single modality provides conclusive findings, additional imaging may not be necessary. However, in patients with inconclusive findings or those being considered for curative-intent surgery, complementary imaging can be highly valuable.

### Consensus report of the fifth international forum for liver MRI [^11512afm]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This article reviews topics discussed during the Fifth International Forum for Liver MRI (with a focus on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI), which was held in Munich, Germany, in September 2011.

Conclusion

Growing evidence shows that gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing liver tumors. Hepatobiliary phase imaging adds new information for the characterization of borderline lesions. However, there is a need to develop standardized criteria for interpretation of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in patients with cirrhosis or other risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Diagnostic certainty in characterizing liver lesions in rectal cancer: abbreviated liver MRI versus CT [^116isa73]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

In total, ten patients (10%) were lost to follow-up within 12 months of diagnosis, for the majority because care was presumed to have been moved to another center (due to the nature of regionalized bowel cancer screening within the UK, patients can choose to have their treatments at another center), however, this does not impact upon the primary endpoint, which looked at baseline staging and diagnostic certainty. The spread of patients lost to follow-up matches that of the whole cohort and those with 12 months of follow-up and therefore does not introduce additional bias.

As this study describes single-center experience of using abbreviated MRI in a clinical setting, patients without a malignant or indeterminate liver lesion(s) on abbreviated MRI did not receive further liver imaging at baseline, and thus, without contemporaneous gold standard liver imaging in all patients at baseline, meaningful sensitivity and specificity calculations for abbreviated MRI and contrast-enhanced CT could not be made. There is no reason to assume sensitivity and specificity would be different in our study to the published meta-analyses (described above), but it could not be reliably formally assessed.

We chose to report lesions on a per-patient rather than per-lesion basis. This was a conscious decision, as the presence of one metastatic or indeterminate lesion would change the patient pathway and thus our data represent the dilemma faced by tumor boards weekly. Detailed scoring of the imaging appearances and size of the liver lesions was not made beyond their classification as malignant, indeterminate/TSTC, or benign by abbreviated liver MRI or contrast-enhanced CT, as the aim of this study was to determine the added clinical benefit of abbreviated liver MRI, but this would be a useful piece of work for the future. Similarly, interobserver variability was not assessed in this study but has been shown to be excellent in other studies.

Finally, we considered only the staging of the liver at baseline. Further work is needed to determine how risk stratification of the primary tumor determines the risk of metachronous liver metastases and if and when abbreviated liver MRI surveillance should be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Incidentally discovered solid hepatic mass — When a solid hepatic mass is incidentally discovered in a patient with no known risk factors, appropriate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) should be the first step in management and is often a sufficient test for diagnosis and subtyping of hepatic adenomas. Biopsy should be performed when a hepatic adenoma has an uncharacteristic appearance on imaging or change in imaging features that are concerning for malignant transformation.

### Consensus report from the 8th international forum for liver magnetic resonance imaging [^1129vfL5]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Consensus statement 18

The minimum protocol in the non-cirrhotic oncological patient (pre- and post-treatment) consists of:
T1W in-phase and out-of-phase
Pre- and post-contrast contrast-enhanced dynamic evaluation
T2W and DWI acquisition
HBP at 10–15 min
Optional additional sequences can be used for specific clinical situations or according to institutional preference
Notes: In biliary-related diseases, perform T2 (and DWI) and MR cholangiography before contrast administration. Prospective studies are needed to see if the HBP alone may suffice in the follow-up setting [70/85 (82.4%) agreement]

An additional protocol suggestion to use gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI when finding an incidental lesion in a healthy patient did not reach overall consensus (> 50% agreement) and is not included among the consensus statements.

New sequences for dynamic imaging — current clinical value

There are current limitations to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of liver lesions, including (1) the requirement for an AP and PVP that show an arterial phase–enhancing lesion and washout compatible with HCC and (2) the need for spatial resolution sufficient to detect 1–2-cm tumours combined with temporal resolution sufficient to visualise contrast dynamics within a single breath hold. Additional factors when using gadoxetic acid are an injection rate 1 cc/s related to a smaller injection volume and a lower total gadolinium dose (usually 0.025 mmol Gd/kg BW) compared with other ECCM, no prior timing run, and concerns over respiratory motion-related artefacts.

Solutions to these limitations are being developed. One solution is faster imaging, during a single breath hold, achieved by (1) parallel imaging, through undersampling of the κ-space, and use of receiver coils that provide spatial information to unwrap the image; and (2) view-sharing, utilising keyhole imaging techniques, e.g. TRICKS (time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics) and TWIST (time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories), to provide more frequent sampling of the centre of the κ-space compared with the periphery. In one study using gadoxetic acid, Pietryga et al used a high parallel acceleration factor to perform multiple APs in one breath hold. The technique recovered most APs that would otherwise have been compromised by transient motion.
