## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains why keystone species have profound effects on the structure and composition of ecological communities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of a keystone species and whether abundance is the key determinant. Then, I should verify the classic ecological mechanism by which keystones exert their influence, especially the role of top-down control and competitive exclusion. Next, I will examine counterexamples and exceptions to ensure the mechanism is generalizable. Finally, I will evaluate each answer choice against the evidence and select the best fit, correcting any misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Keystone species are native taxa whose impact on community structure and function is disproportionately large relative to their abundance; importantly, they are not necessarily abundant, and their effects can be measured by presence-impact rather than abundance-impact, meaning their addition or removal changes the community even when they are rare or low in biomass [^117VWQWu].

> Wait, let me verify the classic mechanism. The canonical example is keystone predation, where a predator preferentially consumes a dominant competitor, thereby preventing competitive exclusion and maintaining species diversity. This is precisely the mechanism described by Paine and reinforced by modern frameworks that distinguish presence-impact from abundance-impact, showing that keystones can reshape communities via top-down control even when rare [^117VWQWu] [^117H6APm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abundance. I initially thought keystones might be abundant because their effects are large, but that would be a mistake. The keystone concept explicitly emphasizes disproportionate influence relative to abundance, and many keystones are low-abundance taxa whose removal triggers cascading changes, including microbial keystones in the gut and rare bacterial taxa that shape narrow functional capacities in aquatic systems [^116MWwPM] [^113jFE2S].

> I need to check whether the mechanism generalizes beyond predators. Yes, keystone effects also arise from ecosystem engineering and mutualisms. For example, elephants and burrowing rodents engineer habitats that create niches for other species, and disruption of seed-dispersal mutualisms can shift plant community composition, illustrating that keystones can modulate community structure via habitat modification and mutualistic interactions as well as predation [^111kuPaN] [^11782MfX].

> Let me consider each option carefully. Option A claims keystones are more abundant, which contradicts the core definition that their impact is disproportionate to abundance, so I should reject A. Option B claims keystones reduce diversity by eliminating food resources, but the classic mechanism increases diversity by preventing competitive exclusion, so B is backwards. Options C and D equate keystoneness with size or aggression, which are not defining traits and are not supported by theory or data, so I should eliminate them. Option E is biologically nonsensical, and F is too absolute and unsupported. Option G is too vague and could describe foundation species rather than keystones. Option H overstates exclusivity and is not supported. Option J conflates impact with resource consumption, which is not the defining feature of keystones [^117VWQWu] [^116MWwPM].

> I should double-check that Option I captures the mechanism correctly. Option I states that keystones can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction, which aligns with keystone predation and top-down control that maintains coexistence and diversity, and is consistent with the presence-impact framework used to identify keystones in contemporary studies [^117VWQWu] [^117H6APm].

> But wait, what if the question is testing a different angle, like food-web foundation or adaptability? Let me reconsider. While keystones can be foundational in some contexts, "provide the foundation for food webs" is imprecise and could imply basal productivity rather than keystone regulation; similarly, adaptability is not a defining feature of keystones, and no evidence supports that only keystones adapt to change, reinforcing that Option I remains the most accurate and specific choice [^116MWwPM].

> Final answer: I. can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction. This matches the keystone predation mechanism and the broader principle that keystones exert disproportionate presence-impact on community structure and composition, often via top-down control that preserves diversity [^117VWQWu] [^116MWwPM].

---

The correct answer is **I. can prevent superior competitors from driving inferior competitors to local extinction**. Keystone species exert disproportionate effects on community structure by **regulating competition** — often via predation, herbivory, or ecosystem engineering — thereby maintaining species diversity and preventing dominance by a single competitor [^117VWQWu] [^111kuPaN]. This is distinct from simply being abundant, large, or aggressive, and it explains why their removal can cause **cascading community collapse** [^1125Hxx2].

---

## Ecological mechanisms of keystone species

Keystone species influence communities through several **key mechanisms**:

- **Predation and herbivory**: By preying on dominant competitors, keystone predators prevent competitive exclusion and maintain species diversity. A classic example is the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, which preys on mussels, preventing them from monopolizing space and allowing other species to persist [^notfound].

- **Ecosystem engineering**: Some keystone species physically modify the environment, creating habitats or altering resource availability. For instance, beavers build dams that create wetlands, supporting diverse aquatic and terrestrial species [^notfound].

- **Mutualistic interactions**: Keystone mutualists, such as certain pollinators or seed dispersers, facilitate the persistence of multiple species by enabling reproduction and dispersal [^11782MfX].

---

## Disproportionate impact on community structure

Keystone species have effects **disproportionate to their abundance**, meaning even rare species can critically shape community composition. Their removal often triggers cascading effects, including loss of species diversity, altered trophic interactions, and ecosystem dysfunction [^1125Hxx2]. For example, the removal of wolves from Yellowstone National Park led to overpopulation of elk, overgrazing, and subsequent decline in vegetation and other species, illustrating the profound impact of keystone predators on ecosystem structure [^notfound].

---

## Role in maintaining biodiversity

Keystone species maintain biodiversity by **preventing competitive exclusion** and promoting coexistence among species. By regulating dominant competitors, they allow inferior competitors to persist, thereby enhancing species richness and community stability [^111N143Z]. This regulatory role is essential for maintaining the functional integrity of ecosystems and their resilience to disturbances [^112nir7a].

## Examples of keystone species and their effects

| **Keystone species** | **Ecosystem** | **Impact on community structure** |
|-|-|-|
| Sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) | Intertidal rocky shores | Prevents mussel dominance, maintains species diversity [^notfound] |
| Gray wolf (Canis lupus) | Yellowstone National Park | Controls elk populations, prevents overgrazing, maintains vegetation diversity [^notfound] |
| Beavers (Castor spp.) | Freshwater ecosystems | Creates wetlands, enhances habitat heterogeneity, supports diverse species [^notfound] |
| Fig trees (Ficus spp.) | Tropical forests | Provides critical food resources, supports diverse frugivores and predators [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

Keystone species profoundly affect ecological communities by **preventing competitive exclusion** and maintaining biodiversity. Their disproportionate impact on community structure and ecosystem functioning underscores their ecological significance and the need for their conservation [^112nir7a].

### Nutritional and host environments determine community ecology and keystone species in a synthetic gut bacterial community [^116i9kEi]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Intestinal microbial communities are of key importance for their mammalian host. A current challenge in microbiome research is to understand the functional relevance of particular community configurations or "signatures", associated with health and disease states. Gut microbial community composition is influenced by a variety of abiotic and biotic factors, including temperature, pH, diet, host immune defenses, metabolites, and microbe-microbe interactions –. Interactions among individual bacteria can be cooperative, neutral, or exploitative, involving, e.g. nutrient degradation, exchange of metabolites, and production of inhibitory compounds. Overall, this results in a complex trophic bacterial network. Several studies identified specific bacteria to be of key importance for the overall structure of intestinal trophic networks. The keystone species concept, initially developed for animal ecologyand later adapted to microbial ecology, refers to taxa that take on a crucial role in the ecosystem. Microbial keystone taxa are described as highly connected taxa, and when lacking, result in changes in microbiome composition and/or function at a particular space or time. These taxa often, but not always, have an over-proportional influence in the community, relative to their abundance. In the context of the mammalian gut microbiome, species providing important metabolic functions such as degrading starch or polysaccharides – or producing short-chain fatty acids, as well as species being associated with anti-inflammatory responses, restoring dysbiosis and promoting gut health, have been termed keystones. Due to their important role in the ecosystem, identifying and targeting such keystone taxa may open new entry points for microbiome-targeted therapies. However, given the complexity of the gastrointestinal ecosystem as well as the inter-individual differences between gut microbial communities, the generality and universal applicability of the keystone species concept in the context of the gut microbiome remains elusive.

### Top-down identification of keystone taxa in the microbiome [^115Mqerd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Keystone taxa in ecological communities are native taxa that play an especially important role in the stability of their ecosystem. However, we still lack an effective framework for identifying these taxa from the available high-throughput sequencing without the notoriously difficult step of reconstructing the detailed network of inter-specific interactions. In addition, while most microbial interaction models assume pair-wise relationships, it is yet unclear whether pair-wise interactions dominate the system, or whether higher-order interactions are relevant. Here we propose a top-down identification framework, which detects keystones by their total influence on the rest of the taxa. Our method does not assume a priori knowledge of pairwise interactions or any specific underlying dynamics and is appropriate to both perturbation experiments and metagenomic cross-sectional surveys. When applied to real high-throughput sequencing of the human gastrointestinal microbiome, we detect a set of candidate keystones and find that they are often part of a keystone module - multiple candidate keystone species with correlated occurrence. The keystone analysis of single-time-point cross-sectional data is also later verified by the evaluation of two-time-points longitudinal sampling. Our framework represents a necessary advancement towards the reliable identification of these key players of complex, real-world microbial communities.

### Top-down identification of keystone taxa in the microbiome [^117VWQWu]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The concept of keystone taxa (species), which was first introduced in 1969 by Paine, generally refers to native species that play an especially important role in the stability of their ecosystem. Since then, identifying keystones has become an elemental component in analyzing ecosystems in order to understand their vulnerabilities and maintain sustainability. Keystone species could also be potentially used in modulation experiments, as main drivers of an existing system to an alternative, more desirable, steady state. An exact ecological definition of keystone species has been a subject of a long-standing debate, and has been continually developed over the years.

One well-accepted definition for keystone species was given by Power et al. There, the authors introduced the term 'community importance', which evaluates the effect of a species on traits of the ecosystem, such as productivity, nutrient cycling, species richness, or the abundance of one or more functional groups of species or of dominant species. Community importance was defined in one of two ways. The first was the abundance-to-trait relationship, which tests how much the relative abundance of a species affects the trait in question. The second was the presence-to-trait relationship, which tests how the removal of a species entirely from the system affects the trait. A species with unusually large community importance, either by its abundance-to-trait relationship or presence-to-trait, is considered to be a keystone species. We refer to these definitions as 'abundance-impact' and 'presence-impact', respectively (see Table 1).

Discussion

Due to recent advances in metagenomic sequencing, researchers have been able to study and characterize microbial communities under countless conditions and scenarios. Many of those studies also include a keystone identification step, since they are considered as main drivers of the ecological dynamics of the community. It is therefore vital for us to define what keystone species is in exact terms, and also have our detection protocols coincide with our definition. In this work we show how to calculate the presence-impact from perturbation experiments, and propose three alternative definitions for EPI from cross-sectional data to detect keystone candidates, all in a top-down manner without any network reconstruction.

These definitions are not mere semantics. Characterizing precisely the presence-impact of a species is important for practical reasons: Current real microbial perturbation experiments (on human subjects or other environments) mainly rely on either introducing new species to the community or eliminating them. Directly controlling the abundance of specific species in a community is, at present, not feasible. The information on the species' presence-impact can be directly applied when designing such perturbations. on the one hand, perturbations, such as probiotics, that include keystone taxa should be treated with caution since they may lead to dramatic changes in the microbial community. On the other hand, keystone taxa may be used as the main drivers when steering the microbiome to a desired alternative state.

An interesting question is how the presence-impact of a species is related to its abundance impact. Assuming that we have a well-accepted definition of the influence of a species on a system, we can think about two different types of how the influence of a species depends on its abundance. In one case, the influence of a species grows with its abundance, i.e. 'abundance-impact'. In another case, the influence of a species is mainly dependent on its presence, but remains constant for different abundances, i.e. 'presence-impact' (as schematically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 11). For example, the influence of a species that consumes common resources is expected to be dependent upon its abundance. In another example, a pathogen may indirectly affect the community by triggering a response of the immune system in a threshold-like manner, while above the triggering threshold, the influence remains the same. The EPI measure for cross-sectional data captures both effects, while a complimentary working definition of an abundance impact is required to distinguish between them.

Table 1
Glossary of often-used terms throughout the manuscript

Both ways define the 'keystoneness' of a species through an ideal experimental setup in which its abundance, or presence, is controlled and altered directly. Such experiments are indeed the only direct way of identifying a species as a keystone, since they can capture all the complex, and unexpected consequences arising from non-linear and often indirect interactions. It should be noted that, in contrast to presence-impact experiments, abundance-impact perturbation might be practically impossible in real-world experiments.

Recent data-driven research of microbial communities provides new opportunities for finding keystone species, but also poses new challenges. One major challenge stems from the fact that studies of natural microbial communities, such as environmental or human-associated microbiomes, commonly do not involve controlled perturbation experiments, due to both technical and/or ethical reasons. Instead, they are usually studied through large-scale cross-sectional metagenomic surveys. These surveys are typically rich in data, composed of hundreds of metagenomic samples which contain thousands of species. Without perturbation experiments, the research is focused on identifying candidate keystones, by estimating the species impact from the cross-sectional data alone.

### Nutritional and host environments determine community ecology and keystone species in a synthetic gut bacterial community [^114j94Wq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

A challenging task to understand health and disease-related microbiome signatures is to move beyond descriptive community-level profiling towards disentangling microbial interaction networks. Using a synthetic gut bacterial community, we aimed to study the role of individual members in community assembly, identify putative keystone species and test their influence across different environments. Single-species dropout experiments reveal that bacterial strain relationships strongly vary not only in different regions of the murine gut, but also across several standard culture media. Mechanisms involved in environment-dependent keystone functions in vitro include exclusive access to polysaccharides as well as bacteriocin production. Further, Bacteroides caecimuris and Blautia coccoides are found to play keystone roles in gnotobiotic mice by impacting community composition, the metabolic landscape and inflammatory responses. In summary, the presented study highlights the strong interdependency between bacterial community ecology and the biotic and abiotic environment. These results question the concept of universally valid keystone species in the gastrointestinal ecosystem and underline the context-dependency of both, keystone functions and bacterial interaction networks.

Presence-impact in simulations

We start with a simple demonstration of the presence-impact definition, I i, on simulated GLV perturbation experiments with designated strength-based and structure-based keystones (see Methods). As shown in Fig 2, the presence-impacts of the designated strength-based and structure-based keystones are significantly larger than those of the non-keystone species (see Methods for the statistical tests used). This demonstrates that the underlying dynamics of the ecological community are manifested in the presence-impact as measured from the resulted abundance profile. Note that we define the presence-impact through the abundance change of the other species. This has three main advantages, compared with a previous definition which considers the number of extinct species: (i) The impact of a keystone species considers not only its negative influence on other species that may lead to their extinction but also the positive influence that increase their abundance. (ii) There is no need to set an extinction threshold when calculating the impact from perturbation experiments. (iii) The measured impact is found to be closely related to the underlying dynamical structure (see Supplementary Fig. 3).

In some cases, the effect of a keystone species can be captured using dimensional reduction techniques, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. Yet, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, when the samples represent relative abundances, large variations between the samples can be caused by the variance of a high-abundant species which does not necessarily interact with the other species either directly or indirectly (see Supplementary Fig. 6. In contrast, the EPI of a particular species is calculated over the re-normalized abundance profiles excluding that species (3), such that the spurious correlations due to the compositionality of the data are removed. Second, the aim of the PCA/PCoA methods is to preserve the global structure of the data and thus may miss the local effect of the presence/absence of a species. By local effects, we mean that the presence/absence effect is measured between communities with similar compositions. Such local effects are conceptually analogous to perturbation experiments where a single species is introduced to a community to measure how it affects that same community.

Focusing on the local effects is important due to two characteristics of real microbial communities. The species-species interactions may be context-dependent, i.e. the same species may have different effects in different microbial communities –. In addition, microbial interactions are inherently non-linear, and in fact, it has been recently shown that straightforward correlation analysis of pair-wise interactions from cross-sectional abundance information carries only limited information on the real underlying interactions. The PCA/PCoA methods are not designed to account for context-dependent and non-linear interactions.

The EPI measures D 1 potentially circumvents this difficulty as it does not assume the samples are divided into two distinct groups, separated along a single dimension, but rather takes into account more complex effects, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 1 b, c. The Q is designed to be even more sensitive to non-linear effects, as it compares only neighboring samples when evaluating the effect of the species, methodologically similar to the t-SNE method. When analyzing real-world data, it is important to utilize all the methods in our arsenal to ensure robust statistical conclusions, and the EPI measure helps us enforce the validity of keystone identification protocols.

### Mortality causes universal changes in microbial community composition [^1125Hxx2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Ecological communities are defined by their structure, which includes species composition, diversity, and interactions. All such properties are sensitive to the abiotic environment, which influences both the growth of individual species and the interactions between them. The structure of multispecies communities can thus vary in complex ways across environmental gradients –. A major challenge is therefore to predict how a changing environment affects competition outcomes and alters community structure. In particular, environmental deterioration can radically change community structure. Instances of such deterioration include antibiotic use on gut microbiota, ocean warming in reef communities, overfishing in marine ecosystems, and habitat loss in human-modified landscapes. Such disturbances can affect community structure in several ways, such as allowing for the spread of invasive species, causing biodiversity loss and mass extinction, or altering the interactions between the remaining community members. For example, a stable ecosystem can be greatly disrupted by the removal of a single keystone species, potentially affecting species with which it does not directly interact –.

A common form of environmental deterioration is increased mortality, which can be implemented in the laboratory in a simple way. In fact, the standard method of cultivating and coculturing bacteria involves periodic dilution into fresh media, a process that necessarily discards cells from the population. The magnitude of the dilution factor determines the fraction of cells discarded and therefore the added mortality rate, making environmental harshness easy to tune experimentally.

The choice of dilution factor often receives little attention, yet theoretical models predict that an increased mortality rate experienced equally by all species in the community can have dramatic effects on community composition. In particular, it is predicted that such a global mortality rate will favor the faster-growing species in pairwise coculture, potentially reversing outcomes from dominance of the slow grower to dominance of the fast grower, as mortality increases. Indeed, there is some experimental support for such reversals in chemostat experiments with microbial species with different growth rates –. A less-explored prediction is that if a high mortality rate causes a competitive reversal, the coculture will also result in either coexistence or bistability (where the winner depends on the starting fraction) at some range of intermediate mortality –. Missing from the literature is a systematic study that probes both of these predictions with an array of pairwise coculture experiments across a range of dilution rates. In addition, little is known about how mortality will alter the composition of multispecies communities.

### On the structure of species-function participation in multilayer ecological networks [^117FmBVd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Subsequently, unfolding the species-function matrix allowed us to propose a measure of species keystoneness, specifically based on the fact that the ecosystem harbors different types of ecological interactions and that different species (i) participate in, and (ii) indirectly connect different ecological functions. Observe that the traditional definition of a keystone species – — species disproportionately important for community functioning, regardless of their abundance — is deliberately vague as it relies on the multifaceted concept of "community functioning", and thus allows for different mathematizations depending on the particular facet of the community. In this sense, here we have focused on the concomitant effect of considering at the same time different ecological functions, and have accordingly extended the concept of keystone species to a multifunctional one, that takes into account two topological properties: (i) the species participation in different ecological functions and (ii) how well the species indirectly connect different ecological functions. The resulting scores and their rankings (Figs. 3 d and. 4 c) are indeed in good agreement with each other (Supplementary Fig. 8 further confirms that species abundance is not a confounding factor in these rankings). Additionally, an extinction analysis performed on the resource-function matrix (Fig. 4 d and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7) shows that a larger-than-random effect is observed on secondary extinctions when removing species or perturbing functions in the order prescribed by these rankings. This is our interpretation of the "disproportional importance for community functioning" of a keystone actor and justifies that our species rankings can be interpreted as such.

In the Na Redona islet, these rankings indicate that plant species contribute heterogeneously to multiple ecosystem functions, i.e. they multitask. Interestingly, the first six species in the rankings, i.e. those with the highest keystone scores, are all woody shrubs. Within that set, the first two species Withania frutescens and Lavatera maritima are indeed multifunctionally keystone (having a score significantly larger than a null model). The rest, except for Ephedra fragilis, are all herbaceous. Now, herbs such as Chenopodium murale and Heliotropium europaeum, with keystone scores significantly smaller than a null model, appear to play a minor role in connecting different functions. Their presence suggests that these species have a very concrete role — e.g. are probably important for very particular ecological functions.

### On the structure of species-function participation in multilayer ecological networks [^1175x2Qt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Understanding how biotic interactions shape ecosystems and impact their functioning, resilience and biodiversity has been a sustained research priority in ecology. Yet, traditional assessments of ecological complexity typically focus on species-species interactions that mediate a particular function (e.g., pollination), overlooking both the synergistic effect that multiple functions might develop as well as the resulting species-function participation patterns that emerge in ecosystems that harbor multiple ecological functions. Here we propose a mathematical framework that integrates various types of biotic interactions observed between different species. Its application to recently collected data of an islet ecosystem-reporting 1537 interactions between 691 plants, animals and fungi across six different functions (pollination, herbivory, seed dispersal, decomposition, nutrient uptake, and fungal pathogenicity)-unveils a non-random, nested structure in the way plant species participate across different functions. The framework further allows us to identify a ranking of species and functions, where woody shrubs and fungal decomposition emerge as keystone actors whose removal have a larger-than-random effect on secondary extinctions. The dual insight-from species and functional perspectives-offered by the framework opens the door to a richer quantification of ecosystem complexity and to better calibrate the influence of multifunctionality on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.

### Few keystone plant genera support the majority of lepidoptera species [^114NdTvd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Functional food webs are essential for the successful conservation of ecological communities, and in terrestrial systems, food webs are built on a foundation of coevolved interactions between plants and their consumers. Here, we collate published data on host plant ranges and associated host plant-Lepidoptera interactions from across the contiguous United States and demonstrate that among ecosystems, distributions of plant-herbivore interactions are consistently skewed, with a small percentage of plant genera supporting the majority of Lepidoptera. Plant identities critical for retaining interaction diversity are similar and independent of geography. Given the importance of Lepidoptera to food webs and ecosystem function, efficient and effective restoration of degraded landscapes depends on the inclusion of such 'keystone' plants.

Results

As mentioned above, the presence-impact of a species can only be definitively determined using removal/addition perturbation experiments, while analysis of cross-sectional data can indirectly estimate the species' impact. Following the methodology presented in refs. we introduce a presence-impact measure that can be applied to both perturbation experiments and cross-sectional data. The presence-impact I i of species i is determined by the change of the abundance profile of all other species in its local community associated with reversing its presence state, i.e. removing the species if it was present, or introducing it into the system if it was absent (See Fig. 1 a and Methods). Likewise, if a species has a strong presence-impact, as measured using perturbation experiments, its presence/absence pattern in naturally assembled communities is also expected to be associated with community-wise differences in the abundance profiles of the other species. This empirical association, which we term Empirical Presence-abundance Interrelation (EPI), can be detected from cross-sectional data to identify candidate keystone species. Specifically, for a given species i, we propose three different definitions of its EPI:andwhich are based on the distances between the relative abundance profiles and Q i which is based on the modularity concept from network science (see Fig. 1 b–d and Methods). The main definitions used in this manuscript are summarized in Table 1 and a list of the mathematical symbols is presented in Supplementary Table 1. Note the distinction here between candidate keystones and actual keystone taxa. Since the EPI is measured only on cross-sectional data, it can not distinguish between correlation and causation effects. In other words, a taxon can have a large EPI value if it affects the other taxa disproportionately, or if it is affected disproportionately by other species. To disentangle this correlation from causation effects, perturbation experiments are required, where the actual presence-impact can be directly measured. The EPI proposes which species of interest will be leading candidates for further perturbation experiments.

### Few keystone plant genera support the majority of lepidoptera species [^114eHxXW]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The pattern that has emerged from our host plant analyses is suggestive and inspires new research questions, including: (1) Is the diversity and abundance of insectivores in higher trophic levels that is predicted by Lepidoptera host plant records actually a function of the presence and abundance of keystone plant genera? (2) Does the pattern we observed in North America host records occur on other continents? (3) Do keystone plants occur within herbivorous insect taxa other than Lepidoptera? (4) How much keystone plant biomass is required to drive local food webs?

Several factors might contribute to the skewed Lepidoptera productivity exhibited by keystone genera including genus size, geologic age, phylogenetic isolation, geographic distribution, relative apparency in the landscape, and mode of chemical defense –. Regardless of their genesis, however, the implications of keystone genera for conservation and restoration are profound wherever plants are managed in North America or, if they prove to be a general phenomenon, globally. Landscapes that do not include keystone genera may produce on average half the number of species of Lepidoptera which is likely to result in lower and more erratic caterpillar abundance and thus impede the conservation of ecologically and culturally important insectivores such as birds. For example, in our dataset, 138 native woody genera and 860 native herbaceous genera are currently not known to support any Lepidoptera diversity in the United States at all. Although future sampling will undoubtedly yield previously undocumented interactions in many of these plant genera, particularly for rare or uncommon Lepidoptera or plant species, they are unlikely to be numerous enough to substantially change patterns of distribution we report here. The recognition of the role of keystone genera in local food webs should discourage the profligate use of introduced plants as well as unproductive native plants in reforestation, agroforestry, urban forestry, horticultural landscaping, land reclamation, natural area buffers, pollinator habitats, and carbon offset plantings without regard to their ability to function within novel ecosystems.

### On the structure of species-function participation in multilayer ecological networks [^116KMStN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Interestingly, ecosystem's functioning could be probed from other perspectives as well, not only a species-centric one. As advanced at the beginning, one could focus on how entangled species and functions are — i.e. how different species participate in interactions cataloged as different ecological functions–, resulting in "species-function" networks. Such representation would allow to quantify the importance that different (i) species and (ii) functions have. Analysis of point (i) inquires whether there are species that are disproportionally participating and connecting more functions. This would enrich the polyhedric concept of keystone species – — traditionally defined as those species disproportionately important for community functioning, regardless of their abundance — but considering here the concomitant participation of species in different functions — and their role in connecting them — as the measures under analysis. Analysis of (ii) would inform a similar analysis but conceived here in the context of functions rather than species, inquiring whether, even if all ecological functions are important, their roles and impact as ecosystem connectors are similar or not, and whether there exists a core of ecological functions that play a salient role. This species-function perspective opens up further questions: first, the ecosystem could be modeled as an entangled web of functions, (e.g. herbivory interfering pollination, feedback loops between pollination and seed dispersal, etc.), effectively resulting in function-function networks where links between two functions are based on, e.g. whether there are species that participate in both functions. Understanding how ecological functions relate to one another within a single ecosystem would provide a functional perspective of important questions, such as the role of indirect effects, or the ecosystem's resilience against function perturbations. Second, a similar question could be raised now from the species-centric viewpoint, inquiring how species would relate to each other based on the functions they share. In a nutshell, ecosystems are inherently multidimensional complex systems, and inspection of different properties require representing the ecosystem in different ways. Leveraging multilayer network theory to implement the species-function perspective described above, along with the outlined analysis, constitutes what we call Challenge 2 and is the second motivation of this paper.

Simulating keystone species

In our simulations, we create two different types of keystone species (see Fig. 2). 'Interaction-strength-based keystones' are created in structurally homogeneous (ER) interaction networks by boosting the strength of the out-going interactions of selected species. Alternatively, 'Structure-based keystones', are naturally created in heterogeneous (BA) interaction networks where a few species have much more interactions compared with all other species. We explain them both in detail below.

Interaction-strength-based keystones

We start by creating an interaction matrix A that represents an ER model with edges density p ER, in which each species interacts with a characteristic number p ER (N − 1) of other species. Then, we enhance the strength of the out-going interactions a j i of species i, by multiplying them with a positive constant K i, whereare the new interactions strengths after the boosting procedure. These new interactions are then used in Eq. (1) to simulate the dynamics. The value of K i can be chosen manually to introduce a designated keystone species or can be randomly sampled from a long-tailed distribution (e.g. log-normal distribution), which generates a few highly influential species whilst most other species have low interaction strength.

Structure-based keystones

Following ref. to create Structure-based keystones, we use the BA model which generates a network with heterogeneous degree distribution. The model generates a network of N nodes, based on n 0 pre-selected seed nodes. The seed nodes form a fully connected network, and the remaining N − n 0 nodes are sequentially connected to the n < n 0 existing nodes in the network, with probability p i proportional to the degree d i of each node i. A directionality parameter d is also added to the process of reconstructing scale-free networks for the numerical simulations, which partially negates the independence between the out-going and in-going interactions. The scale-free degree distribution in the network naturally creates keystones, i.e. nodes with a comparably large number of interactions, and are usually part of the seed nodes (see Supplementary Fig. 3). MATLAB script used to generate directed BA networks is presented in Supplementary Information.

### Top-down identification of keystone taxa in the microbiome [^116B2f41]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In order to study the relation between the underlying dynamics and cross-sectional data we first simulate cohorts of cross-sectional data with a single designated strength-based keystone and measure the EPI of all the species (Fig. 3). In this ideal case, all three above-mentioned EPI measures (D 1, D 2, and Q) successfully mark the designated species as a clear keystone candidate, as its EPI values are significantly larger compared with the rest of the species. This can be seen in the PCoA space where the samples are distinctly divided into two groups, depending on whether the keystone species is present or absent (Fig. 3 b, e), while the high modularity of the keystone species is evident by the fact that there are only a few samples of different groups that are connected with an edge (Fig. 3 h).

### Late quaternary biotic homogenization of north American mammalian faunas [^112nir7a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The global-scale ecological impacts of humans have accelerated over the last several thousand years –. Human-driven climate changes and exploitation of natural resources, as well as increasing globalization and urbanization linked to rapid population growth, are now altering landscapes to such a degree that few pristine ecosystems remain. Consequences of these anthropogenic stressors include widespread extirpation of species, population declines, geographic range shifts and expansions, significant ecological downgrading, and an impending wave of global extinctions. At the local scale, however, meta-analyses reveal no net decreases in species richness –, while regional studies document biotic homogenization (i.e. increased similarity in the composition of species among ecological communities, also referred to as reduced β diversity) for several extant groups including birds, fishes, mammals. and plants, in terrestrial and aquatic settings over the past one hundred years.

Biotic homogenization can result from increased species coexistenc, driven by factors including, but not limited to, range expansions, human-mediated species translocation, and agricultural landscape modification (linked to decreased landscape heterogeneity, increased patch size, and the intentional or unintentional spread of generalist, competitively dominant native or non-native species). It can also result from the extinction or extirpation of endemics, which similarly reduces the uniqueness of spatially separated species assemblages, (Supplementary Fig. 1). Ongoing biotic homogenization is a conservation concern because range-expanding and introduced species, as well as those that are displaced or at risk of extinction, may be clustered in particular functional groups (i.e.g.roupings based on the roles they play in ecosystems). For example, extant mammal species at risk of extinction are commonly large-bodied carnivores. Such non-random biodiversity loss could lead to profound modifications in the nature of biotic interactions (e.g. trophic interactions), altering the ways in which materials and energy flow through ecosystems, reducing their resilience to ongoing and future perturbation. In particular, the replacement of keystone species — those whose impacts on interactions and the environment are outsized with respect to their relative abundance — by species whose impacts are proportional to their relative abundance, has broad implications for associated biota (e.g. through the loss of certain ecosystem engineering processes)that can include reduction in ecosystem functioning and production of ecosystem services.

### On the structure of species-function participation in multilayer ecological networks [^116F57Ge]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The finding that woody shrubs are those more strongly involved in different functions might be attributed to the longer lifespan of such species compared to herbs, which allows them to link to a wider array of species in each type of interaction. However, more in-depth studies are needed to unveil the exact mechanism of such multitasking. Interactions between plants and fungi (especially saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi) were found to play a salient role. Microbial decomposers, together with plants and herbivorous insects, are also important drivers of ecosystem functioning in grasslands, where a positive association has been documented between richness or abundance and multiple ecosystem services.

We have also introduced the concept of keystone function — that, to the best of our knowledge, had gone unnoticed to date. This concept emerges naturally thanks to the species-function duality observed in the resource-function matrix. Operationally, in this work we called a function keystone when (i) the scores based on their participation by different plant species (Fig. 3 c) and the scores based on their role indirectly connecting species (Fig. 5 c) were in agreement and larger than the 90th percentile scores of suitable null models (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 6), and when (ii) the effect of perturbing functions on secondary species extinction in the order prescribed by these scores were (statistically significantly) larger-than-random (Fig. 5 d and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7). We propose that this new concept aligns with approaching the ecosystem through a function-centric lens, rather than a traditional species-centric (e.g. phytocentric) one. Indeed, just as robustness and resilience in the face of a disturbance is usually calculated at the species level, it is also possible to assess such responses of the ecosystem at the functional level: the response of the ecosystem to some disturbances may overall affect entire functions. For instance, non-native herbivores can disrupt chemically-mediated interactions between plants and herbivores, pollinators, predators, and parasites that respond to herbivore-induced plant volatile cues. Because there is a wide variety of interactions involving native organisms that a single non-native could potentially impact, defining and identifying key ecological functions is a crucial first step toward better understanding their role in ecosystem development, balance, functioning, and resilience.

### Top-down identification of keystone taxa in the microbiome [^111byNpQ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Next, we conduct systematic experiments in order to test the statistical relationship between the presence-impact, as measured from perturbation experiments, and the EPI, as measured from cross-sectional data (Supplementary Fig. 3). We define ecological dynamics with either strength-based or structure-based keystones, simulate cohorts of M samples with N species, and perform perturbation experiments for each of the species. We then test the correlation between the three EPI measures (, and Q i) and the presence-impact I i, for all i = 1,… N. To ensure a wide range of impact values in the case of the strength-based keystones, the boosting parameter, K i, was taken from a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 0.5 and σ = 1. The range of values of the presence-impact in the structure-based case is due to the natural scale-free degree distribution of the network. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, significant correlations are evident between each of the EPI measures and the experimental presence-impact I. Notably, the modularity measure Q had the largest significant correlation amongst the EPI measures.

In Supplementary Fig. 6 the abundance value. In other words, while a PCA plot might show a large difference between samples based on large variability in the relative abundance values of species, even when interactions are not present, the EPI measure removes the test species from the data before calculating its impact is less sensitive to such variations.

In Supplementary Fig. 7 we show how the D 1 EPI measure is used to identify keystone species in the Stable Marriage model of ecological dynamics. In this model, the species abundance is determined by preference lists, not an underlying interaction network, so detecting species using a reconstruction of the correlation network makes little sense. When the preference lists are correlated, the system is frustrated and keystone species with higher-than-average EPI values are prominent.

### Replicating community dynamics reveals how initial composition shapes the functional outcomes of bacterial communities [^11519yf9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this ecosystem, we identified two tipping points that determined the primary outcome (convergence to the attractors) using the summed relative abundances of two core sets of ASVs. These two simple thresholds predicted the outcome for many communities, although we note that the conditions imposed by these thresholds were not necessary (some communities converged that did not exceed the threshold) but they were almost sufficient (very few communities exceeding the threshold did not converge to the correspondent attractor). Moreover, having relative abundances above both thresholds seemed to be necessary to observe divergent trajectories. Therefore, we found necessary starting conditions affecting the predictability of the experiment. In addition, we suggest that some exceptions likely stem from ASVs beyond the core set. For example, some ASVs appeared to be repressed in communities associated with trajectories converging to Class 1 because their abundances were dramatically reduced by the end of the experiment, likely due to selection in the early stages of the experiment or in their native environment. This apparent repression was paralleled by a set of ASVs that increased from low relative abundances and that appeared to be co-selected with the Class 1 core set. These observations suggest a richer mechanistic process that appears to be orchestrated through the coordinated dynamics of sets of taxa, rather than by individual keystone activities. Therefore, our results emphasise the importance of looking for levels of organisation between the community- and the 'species'-level to fully understand the dynamics of complex microbial communities.

Analysis of cross-sectional data

Similarly, a species is said to be a candidate keystone when its EPI value is significantly larger than the rest of the species. Indeed for simulated keystones, the high EPI value of the designated keystones is apparent for all three proposed measures (Fig. 3) compared with the values of the non-keystone species.

Unlike the ideal perturbation experiments, special considerations must be taken into account when calculating the EPI of species from high-throughput sequencing, mainly due to certain biases that stem from differences in the relative frequency of the species (i.e. the percent of samples where the species is present). For example, by definition, it is impossible to calculate the EPI of a species that is present in all the samples of a cohort, since we can not compare them to the case where it is absent (in these cases we expect to only be able to calculate the empirical abundance-to-community impact, which is beyond the scope of this work). Furthermore, the EPI may be affected by the frequency of the species of interest, a bias that is mainly apparent when it is either present or absent in only a small fraction of the samples. Supplementary Fig. 1 demonstrates this bias on a test case of simulated cross-sectional data with no inter-species interactions. To avoid this issue, when dealing with real-world data, we limited the analysis only to species with a sufficient number of present and absent samples (see "Human microbiome data filtering and analysis").

Human microbiome data filtering and analysis

We analyzed real high-throughput sequencing of the human gut from the HMP. Samples represent the abundances of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing (variable regions V3 to V5), of M = 107 healthy human subjects. We consider individual OTUs as "species". The samples went through the following filtering process. We first filtered out any OTUs not present in any of the samples. We then ordered the OTUs according to their mean abundance and kept only the top N = 1000 OTUs with the top mean abundance. The abundances of the remaining OTUs in each profile were normalized to one. Finally, the presence-impact was calculated only for OTUs with a relative frequency between 0.25 and 0.75, which ensures maximal statistical power and avoids extreme cases with very high or very low frequencies that are prone to high bias in D 1 and D 2 measures (see Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Warming and cooling catalyse widespread temporal turnover in biodiversity [^1161vbry]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Turnover in species composition through time is a dominant form of biodiversity change, which has profound effects on the functioning of ecological communities 1–4. Turnover rates differ markedly among communities 4, but the drivers of this variation across taxa and realms remain unknown. Here we analyse 42,225 time series of species composition from marine, terrestrial and freshwater assemblages, and show that temporal rates of turnover were consistently faster in locations that experienced faster temperature change, including both warming and cooling. In addition, assemblages with limited access to microclimate refugia or that faced stronger human impacts on land were especially responsive to temperature change, with up to 48% of species replaced per decade. These results reveal a widespread signal of vulnerability to continuing climate change and highlight which ecological communities are most sensitive, raising concerns about ecosystem integrity as climate change and other human impacts accelerate.

### Population structure determines functional differences among species and ecosystem processes [^111YAYYU]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Linking the structure of communities to ecosystem functioning has been a perennial challenge in ecology. Studies on ecosystem function are traditionally focused on changes in species composition. However, this species-centric approach neglects the often dramatic changes in the ecology of organisms during their development, thereby limiting our ability to link the structure of populations and communities to the functioning of natural ecosystems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the impact of organisms on community structure and ecosystem processes often differ more among developmental stages within a species than between species, contrary to current assumptions. Importantly, we show that functional differences between species vary depending on the specific demographic structure of predators. One important implication is that changes in the demography of populations can strongly alter the functional composition of communities and change ecosystem processes long before any species are extirpated from communities.

### Diverse interactions and ecosystem engineering can stabilize community assembly [^111kuPaN]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Diverse interactions occur not only between species but indirectly through the effects that species have on the abiotic environment –. Elephants root out large saplings and small trees, enabling the formation and maintenance of grasslands, and creating habitat for smaller vertebrates. Burrowing rodents such as gophers and African mole rats create shelter and promote primary production by aerating the soil, salmon, and aquatic invertebrates create freshwater habitats by changing stream morphology, and leaf-cutter ants alter microclimates, influencing seedling survival and plant growth. These examples illustrate ecosystem engineering, where the engineering organism alters the environment on timescales longer than its own. Engineers are widely acknowledged to have impacts on both small and large spatial scales, and likely serve as important keystone species in many habitats.

Ecosystem engineering not only impacts communities on ecological timescales, but has profoundly shaped the evolution of life on Earth. For example, the emergence of multicellular cyanobacteria fundamentally altered the atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event of the Proterozoic roughly 2.5 Byrs BP, paving the way for the biological invasion of terrestrial habitats. In the oceans it is thought that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein biogenesis of aquatic photoautotrophs drove the nitrogen:phosphorous ratio (the Redfield Ratio) to ca. 16:1 matching that of plankton, illustrating that engineering clades can have much larger, sometimes global-scale effects.

Calculating presence-impact in perturbation experiments

The presence-impact of species i in a local community (sample) k is defined as follows. We denote the abundance profile of a particular sample k with S k, in which species i can be initially present or absent, while after a perturbation where species i was added/removed, the abundance profile is denoted as. We label the pre-perturbation abundance profile of all the species except species i as, and the post-perturbation abundance profile, excluding species i, as. Bothandare re-normalized to 1, to remove the mathematical relations between species i and the rest of the species that are the result of the compositionality nature of the data, i.e.and similarly for. We then calculate the community-specific presence-impact, as the distance betweenand, where the 〈⋅〉 symbol represents a distance function between the two samples, e.g. Bray–Curtis (BC) or root Jensen-Shannon divergence. The distancerepresents the influence of the presence of species i on the abundance profile of the rest of the species for the local community k.

The presence-impact of species i is then the average ofover a cohort of different communities. The presence-impact of species i, I i, is defined as the averagewhere M is the number of samples. A high value of I i indicates that there is a large general difference between the abundance profiles associated with adding/removing species i. The presence-impact I i is a direct way of measuring the effect of removing/adding a species from the system which is suitable for both numerical and real-world experiments. Note that our definition is different from the one used in ref. A MATLAB script for calculating I, in the case of GLV dynamics, is presented in the Supplementary Information.

Identification of candidate keystones from cross-sectional data

Consider a cohort of M samples, with abundance profiles S k, k = 1, …, M which were either generated from GLV dynamics or are the result of real-world surveys. To calculate the EPI of species i, we divide the samples into two subsets, subset G i which includes all samples where species i is present, and subsetwhich includes all samples where species i is absent. Then, we test the level of separation between the two subsets based on the abundance profiles that include all species excluding species i. We have devised three alternative methods to measure this separation (see Fig. 1).

### Community-level signatures of ecological succession in natural bacterial communities [^114yLt8o]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbial communities inhabiting natural environments are unmanageably complex. It is therefore difficult to establish causal relationships between community composition, environmental conditions and ecosystem functions (such as rates of biogeochemical cycles) because of the large number of factors influencing these relationships. There is great interest in developing methods that reduce this complexity in order to understand whether there are predictable changes in community composition across space and time, and whether those differences alter microbe-associated ecosystem functioning. The most common approach has been to search for physical (e.g. disturbance) and chemical (e.g. pH) features that correlate with community structure and function. This approach has often been successful in identifying some major differences among bacterial communities associated with different habitatsand some of the edaphic correlates. However, even if significant correlations between environmental variables and microbial functioning are found, we are still far from understanding the underlying biological mechanisms explaining these relationships. For instance, adding variables such as biomass or diversity to models in which environmental variables are good predictors of function do not strongly improve model predictions, suggesting that there is a need for variables that increase the accuracy of biological processes.

The development of a more mechanistic picture is hindered for several reasons, such as difficulties in identifying the relative role of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping microbial communities –, and the pervasiveness of functional redundancy, and of priority effects. In addition, it is often difficult to identify which functions to assess. Microbes inhabitating a host sometimes have a substantial impact on host performance, for example, turning a healthy into a diseased host. Such extreme impacts of individual taxa make it relatively simple to infer a direct link between community composition and function. In open, natural environments (e.g. soil, lakes, oceans), the impact of individual taxa on ecosystem functions is often minor and generalisations may depend on subjective choices of which functions to measure.

An important step forward comes from manipulative experiments in natural environments, which have identified variables such as pH, salinity, sources of energy, the number of speciesand environmental complexityas key players in the relationship between bacterial community structure and functioning. Improved control can be obtained by domesticating communities surveyed from natural environments by growing them in a synthetic (albeit complex) environment, and quantifying their functioning under such controlled conditions. With these experiments, it becomes possible to directly test the hypothesis that more similar communities have more similar functions without the confounding influence of extrinsic environmental conditions.

Longitudinal EPI

The HMP data provides a unique opportunity to verify the results of the EPI, whilst eliminating issues of confounding factors, emanating from the possible heterogeneity of the different subjects. The process is based on comparing samples from the same subject, at two different time points. We denote the sample of subject h of the first collection as S h, I and of the second collection as S h, II. For each species i = 1… N, we check if the presence state of species i is different between the first and second collections, i.e. if species i is present in the first collection and absent in the second collection, or vice versa. If the present state is indeed reversed, we defineandas the abundance profiles of subject h at the first and second collection times, respectively, excluding species i and re-normalized to 1, i.e.

Then, for species i, and for subject h, the longitudinal EPIis the distance between the re-normalized first and second collections,

The process is then repeated for all h = 1… H subjects to get the total longitudinal EPI

We avoid low prevalent species with a high bias towards the longitudinal EPI by filtering out from the analysis species for which the measure was based on 10 or fewer subjects, i.e. at least in 11 subjects the presence state of the species was reversed between the first and second collections.

Analysis of perturbation experiments

The process of identifying keystones through the use of presence-impact must include a simple, but necessary, statistical step. Analogously to the use of community importance from ref. a species is said to be a keystone when its presence-impact is significantly large compared with the rest of the species. Therefore, when calculating the presence-impact for a given experiment, we also need to calculate the presence-impact of all other species individually and compare them to each other. We then consider a species to be a keystone species if its impact is larger than two standard deviations from the mean impact of all species. We demonstrate it in Fig. 2 where the impact of an artificial strength-based keystone, and structure-based keystone, are indeed much larger than their peers (blue and black arrows in Fig. 2 b, d, respectively).

Final remarks

While applied in an ecological context, this framework is conceptually general and can be easily extended to characterize e.g. the interplay between resources and functions in other complex systems. For instance, it can be applied to genetics, where our resource-function mapping resembles a classical genotype-phenotype map, illustrating how genes interact to give rise to phenotypes in various animals. Similarly, in economic systems, this interplay can shed light on how goods are traded among countries across different economic sectors. Going back to the ecological case, the resource-function matrix (and its projections Φ and Π) unveils the duality of plant species and functions (phyto vs function-centric perspectives), where the concept of (multifunctional) keystone species and the concept of (multispecies) keystone functions naturally emerge as two (interconnected) sides of the same coin. The former refers to species that play key roles in connecting functions in a multifunctional system -with possible impact on e.g. network stability-. In contrast, the latter refers to the different roles functions play in keeping species coexistence in an ecosystem. Our initial assessment in the Na Redona dataset shows that a drastic perturbation of keystone species, propagate into functions (via secondary "function extinctions") more than expected at random, and the opposite is true when perturbing keystone functions. While further work is needed to refine these results (e.g. perturbing species gradually instead of abruptly would be interesting to assess the impact of losing pollinators on fruit production), our findings indicate that both concepts (species and functions) are indeed intertwined, potentially feeding back into each other. For instance, in the context of climate change, it is not uncommon to witness drastic and sustained temperature increases over large geographic regions. If such exogenous perturbations induce, e.g. phenological mismatches between flowering plants and insect pollinator visits, then the complete pollination function might be threatened before any of the species are themselves threatened, i.e. perturbation takes place initially at the function level. It can then propagate with potential cascading effects for both species and other functions, as prescribed by the resource-function matrix P. Conversely, the decline or extinction of a seed disperser (initially at the animal species level) may trigger declines or plant extinctions, which in turn cascade to affect species involved in other functions, such as underground fungi. Furthermore, the extinction of a keystone plant species can also influence other species' interactions, either by causing interaction rewiring or by modifying interaction strengths –. Such cascading effects across interaction types become particularly problematic in double-mutualistic interactions, i.e. when the same animal acts, for example, as pollinator and seed disperser of the same plant species. Yet, not only the disruption of mutualistic interactions but also of antagonistic interactions could derive functional losses, e.g. the loss of top predators may indirectly affect ecosystem productivity and metabolism. However, few studies still exist on how human activities can alter ecosystem multifunctionality, both directly on ecosystems and indirectly through the loss of multifunctional biodiversity. Moreover, how organisms at different trophic levels interact to influence ecosystem multifunctionality in the presence of multiple concurrent anthropogenic drivers remains largely unexplored. Thus, we hope our framework offers a promising approach for evaluating the relative vulnerability of ecosystem functions to anthropogenic stressors. As we delve deeper into understanding ecosystems, the integration of temporal, spatial, and dynamical features within this framework, coupled with its application to ecological data from other environments, also emerges as exciting avenues for future research.

### Multiple plant diversity components drive consumer communities across ecosystems [^112E9G2i]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our study shows for two contrasting ecosystems that functional and structural diversity of the plant communities strongly contribute to explaining the positive relationships between plant species richness and the plot-level species richness of invertebrate consumers across trophic levels. The relative importance of plant functional and plant structural diversity differed across trophic levels and between ecosystems. Yet, many strong associations between plant diversity and arthropod species richness were consistently found to operate via relationships with arthropod abundances. These findings have important implications for attempts to develop a more detailed understanding of biodiversity relationships and the impact of global environmental change across trophic levels, and they highlight important avenues for the future of biodiversity research.

First, our results indicate that structural diversity metrics of plant communities are highly relevant mediators of plant diversity effects on arthropod diversity and that they strongly contribute to a mechanistic explanation of these effects. Recently, researchers have started to address the mechanisms underlying previously observed effects of plant species richness on higher trophic levels by testing for the potential role of plant functional diversity and composition. However, structural diversity as an additional mediator of plant diversity effects on consumer diversity has received much less attention. This is despite the well-known fact that plant structure significantly affects herbivores, predators, and parasitoids by modifying environmental conditions and habitat space – and that plant species richness can influence the physical structure of plant communities.

Associations with plant structural diversity were particularly pronounced for forest arthropods. This might be explained by the size and longevity of trees compared to grassland plants. Trees function as keystone structures that ensure long-term habitat continuity for associated arthropods, while mowing of grasslands (two times per year in our grassland study system) leads to seasonal changes in vegetation structure (with consequences for arthropod community composition, as reflected by differences in the frequency and identity of dominant arthropod taxa; see Methods). Moreover, the large size of the trees compared to grassland plants results in spatially more extensive microclimatic gradients from light-exposed upper canopy parts to shaded interiors of the canopy. These differences might explain why the resulting relationships with plot-level arthropod species richness were more important than differences in leaf functional characteristics in the forest system.

### Abundance determines the functional role of bacterial phylotypes in complex communities [^113jFE2S]. Nature Microbiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Bacterial communities are essential for the functioning of the Earth's ecosystems 1. A key challenge is to quantify the functional roles of bacterial taxa in nature to understand how the properties of ecosystems change over time or under different environmental conditions 2. Such knowledge could be used, for example, to understand how bacteria modulate biogeochemical cycles 3, and to engineer bacterial communities to optimize desirable functional processes 4. Communities of bacteria are, however, extraordinarily complex with hundreds of interacting taxa in every gram of soil and every millilitre of pond water 5. Little is known about how the tangled interactions within natural bacterial communities mediate ecosystem functioning, but high levels of bacterial diversity have led to the assumption that many taxa are functionally redundant 6. Here, we pinpoint the bacterial taxa associated with keystone functional roles, and show that rare and common bacteria are implicated in fundamentally different types of ecosystem functioning. By growing hundreds of bacterial communities collected from a natural aquatic environment (rainwater-filled tree holes) under the same environmental conditions, we show that negative statistical interactions among abundant phylotypes drive variation in broad functional measures (respiration, metabolic potential, cell yield), whereas positive interactions between rare phylotypes influence narrow functional measures (the capacity of the communities to degrade specific substrates). The results alter our understanding of bacterial ecology by demonstrating that unique components of complex communities are associated with different types of ecosystem functioning.

### Functional group diversity increases with modularity in complex food webs [^116QnBfQ]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The last two decades of ecological research have revealed consistent relationships between structure and function in ecological communities, and have demonstrated that species richness is important to understanding how ecosystems function. In recent times, there has been a growing interest in functional traits and functional groups versus species, mainly because functional group diversity is more meaningful than species diversity and it is associated with greater long-term stability. Food-web approaches consider both species diversity and the fluxes of energy and materials between species through their interactions, thus providing a natural framework for understanding species' ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences the number and the distribution of functional groups in ecological communities. Despite this, the vast majority of studies consider parameters such as species richness and study a single trophic level. However, it is increasingly clear that we need to consider the interactions between species and include more than one trophic level in our studies, because these will have a profound effect on our ability to conserve, restore or manage ecosystems. This involves looking at how species interactions are organized (network structure), how they contribute to functional group diversity and how species from different functional groups affect each other, as these will interact indirectly via shared host plants, prey species or natural enemies.

Another dimension often overlooked in studies linking community structure and functional group diversity is space, that is, how does spatial variation in community structure affect the number of functional groups? Ecological communities are assembled according to processes that operate over a large range of spatial and temporal scales, including the historical sequence of colonization and extinction events, environmental filtering, local species interactions and phylogeny. These assembly processes determine a community's extant structure, that is, the species present in a local community, which in turn shape the structure of species interactions. At larger, metacommunity spatial scales, local communities can differ in their species composition and, as shown by empirical studies incorporating spatial variability, this spatial segregation of taxa can influence food web topology. The central challenge thus consists of determining which aspects of diversity and food-web structure are related to functional group diversity. Whereas the literature on the effects of species richness is vast, little is known about how changes in the structure of species interactions affect functional group diversity. As many network properties systematically vary with the size and complexity of biological communities, we expect spatial changes in food web structure to be common, and that these will be likely to result in spatial heterogeneity in the number and distribution of functional groups. Understanding these patterns is critical in determining relationships between network structure and functional group diversity in complex communities.

### Growth tradeoffs produce complex microbial communities on a single limiting resource [^115VgzjP]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The relationship between the dynamics of a community and its constituent pairwise interactions is a fundamental problem in ecology. Higher-order ecological effects beyond pairwise interactions may be key to complex ecosystems, but mechanisms to produce these effects remain poorly understood. Here we model microbial growth and competition to show that higher-order effects can arise from variation in multiple microbial growth traits, such as lag times and growth rates, on a single limiting resource with no other interactions. These effects produce a range of ecological phenomena: an unlimited number of strains can exhibit multistability and neutral coexistence, potentially with a single keystone strain; strains that coexist in pairs do not coexist all together; and a strain that wins all pairwise competitions can go extinct in a mixed competition. Since variation in multiple growth traits is ubiquitous in microbial populations, our results indicate these higher-order effects may also be widespread, especially in laboratory ecology and evolution experiments.

### Consequences of a biological invasion reveal the importance of mutualism for plant communities [^11782MfX]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Seed-dispersal mutualisms have a fundamental role in regenerating natural communities. Interest in the importance of seed dispersal to plant communities has been heightened by worldwide declines in animal dispersers. One view, the 'keystone mutualist hypothesis', predicts that these human-caused losses will trigger a cascade of linked extinctions throughout the community. Implicitly, this view holds that mutualisms, such as seed dispersal, are crucial ecological interactions that maintain the structure and diversity of natural communities. Although many studies suggest the importance of mutualism, empirical evidence for community-level impacts of mutualists has remained anecdotal, and the central role of mutualism, relative to other species interactions, has long been debated in the theoretical literature. Here I report the community-level consequences of a biological invasion that disrupts important seed-dispersal mutualisms. I show that invasion of South African shrublands by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) leads to a shift in composition of the plant community, owing to a disproportionate reduction in the densities of large-seeded plants. This study suggests that the preservation of mutualistic interactions may be essential for maintaining natural communities.

### The keystone-pathogen hypothesis [^116dGc3d]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the human microbiome in health and disease. However, for the most part the mechanisms by which the microbiome mediates disease, or protection from it, remain poorly understood. The keystone-pathogen hypothesis holds that certain low-abundance microbial pathogens can orchestrate inflammatory disease by remodelling a normally benign microbiota into a dysbiotic one. In this Opinion article, we critically assess the available literature that supports this hypothesis, which may provide a novel conceptual basis for the development of targeted diagnostics and treatments for complex dysbiotic diseases.

### High-throughput characterization of bacterial responses to complex mixtures of chemical pollutants [^1145qASf]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

The results have implications for the responses of natural bacterial communities, and their associated ecosystem processes, to chemical mixtures. We found that the growth of a mixed culture of strains both was less impacted by the addition of multiple chemicals and showed many fewer interactions than expected from the growth of the strains in monoculture. When chemicals inhibit part of the community, compensation by resistant taxa may rescue important functions, such that growth is maintained. However, while the growth of microbial communities may be resilient to multiple stressors in a broad sense, interactions may still be impactful in natural communities. In particular, keystone taxa can have a disproportionate impact on community structure and function. At a single strain level, we found highly variable responses to the chemical mixtures. If unique interactions lead to the loss of keystone species, this could have comparatively large effects on community functioning and stability. In communities, biotic interactions among species may also affect stressor responses –. In particular, differing levels of competition and facilitation can drive variation in the responses of communities to stress. Hence, there is a need for future work to build upon these results by focusing on whole microbial communities, as these are more representative of how chemical stress is encountered in the environment. Community-level data may require different frameworks and definitions of stressor interactions than those used in population-level studies such as ours. For example, an interaction type not explicitly tested here is dominance, where the combined response of stressors may be explained by the effect of one stressor alone. At a population level, dominance may be considered a special case of antagonism (that is, if one stressor blocks the action of another); however, at a community level dominance may occur due to species interactions or compensation by tolerant species.

### Heterogeneity within and among co-occurring foundation species increases biodiversity [^117MpMdt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Habitat heterogeneity is considered a primary causal driver underpinning patterns of diversity, yet the universal role of heterogeneity in structuring biodiversity is unclear due to a lack of coordinated experiments testing its effects across geographic scales and habitat types. Furthermore, key species interactions that can enhance heterogeneity, such as facilitation cascades of foundation species, have been largely overlooked in general biodiversity models. Here, we performed 22 geographically distributed experiments in different ecosystems and biogeographical regions to assess the extent to which variation in biodiversity is explained by three axes of habitat heterogeneity: the amount of habitat, its morphological complexity, and capacity to provide ecological resources (e.g. food) within and between co-occurring foundation species. We show that positive and additive effects across the three axes of heterogeneity are common, providing a compelling mechanistic insight into the universal importance of habitat heterogeneity in promoting biodiversity via cascades of facilitative interactions. Because many aspects of habitat heterogeneity can be controlled through restoration and management interventions, our findings are directly relevant to biodiversity conservation.

### Effects of climate and environmental heterogeneity on the phylogenetic structure of regional angiosperm floras worldwide [^115hHgf2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The species composition of biological communities in any given geographic area is a result of the interaction of ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic processes. The extent to which each of these processes has contributed to community assembly varies among regions. Biological interactions such as competition and symbioses may play a role in community assembly at a local scale, but at a large spatial scale, evolutionary processes, dispersal, and environmental filtering are thought to play a major role in determining the species composition in an area, whereby species that cannot survive and reproduce in the physical environment of the area are excluded. Because species differ in their niches, it is a truism that niches must be conserved on phylogenies, at least to some extent. In other words, the ability of a species to persist in a particular set of ecological conditions is constrained by its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e. the tendency of species to retain ancestral ecological requirements, is thought to influence which species from a regional species pool can persist in a particular environment.

### Predator-induced collapse of niche structure and species coexistence [^115JeKkP]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Biological invasions are both a pressing environmental challenge and an opportunity to investigate fundamental ecological processes, such as the role of top predators in regulating biodiversity and food-web structure. In whole-ecosystem manipulations of small Caribbean islands on which brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) were the native top predator, we experimentally staged invasions by competitors (green anoles, Anolis smaragdinus) and/or new top predators (curly-tailed lizards, Leiocephalus carinatus). We show that curly-tailed lizards destabilized the coexistence of competing prey species, contrary to the classic idea of keystone predation. Fear-driven avoidance of predators collapsed the spatial and dietary niche structure that otherwise stabilized coexistence, which intensified interspecific competition within predator-free refuges and contributed to the extinction of green-anole populations on two islands. Moreover, whereas adding either green anoles or curly-tailed lizards lengthened food chains on the islands, adding both species reversed this effect-in part because the apex predators were trophic omnivores. Our results underscore the importance of top-down control in ecological communities, but show that its outcomes depend on prey behaviour, spatial structure, and omnivory. Diversity-enhancing effects of top predators cannot be assumed, and non-consumptive effects of predation risk may be a widespread constraint on species coexistence.

### Top-down identification of keystone taxa in the microbiome [^115pZWiY]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Longitudinal EPI

When calculating the EPI from cross-sectional data, two possible issues may arise. First, the empirical association observed for a given species may be due to confounding factors attributed to inter-personal heterogeneity in the analyzed population, such as genetics, life-style, or nutritional variability. Second, while our original definition of the presence-impact of a species considers the magnitude of the transition of its microbial community following perturbation experiments, the EPI is measured across different subjects for which a direct transition may not be induced by that species. To address these issues, we analyze the presence-impact using an alternative approach from two-time-points longitudinal data and compare it with the results from cross-sectional data (see Fig. 5 a). The longitudinal EPI, measures the dissimilarity between two samples from the same body site collected from the same subject, k, with a time interval, where the presence state of species i is different between the two samples. This is then averaged across all subjects to get a single value L i (see Methods). Figure 5 b shows the relationship between the empirical and longitudinal EPI. The two measures are significantly correlated (Pearson coefficient of r = 0.38 with p < 10 −17). Specifically, there is a significant agreement between the sets of candidate keystones from the two measures, with 11 shared candidates (p < 10 −11 using the Fisher test). Furthermore, after a shuffling process that preserves both the relative frequencies of the species and the number of observed species in each sample, the presence-impact shows no agreement between the EPI and the longitudinal EPI (see Supplementary Fig. 5). The general agreement between the EPI and the longitudinal EPI, which is less prone to the above-mentioned issues, further supports that the presence-impact of a species can be captured from the analysis of cross-sectional data.

### Ecosystem consequences of species richness and composition in pond food webs [^116jfoTD]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Resolving current concerns about the role of biodiversity on ecosystems calls for understanding the separate roles of changes in species numbers and of composition. Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.

### Diverse interactions and ecosystem engineering can stabilize community assembly [^112v31hL]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

To unravel nature's secrets we must simplify its abundant complexities and idiosyncrasies. The layers of natural history giving rise to an ecological community can be distilled — among many forms — into a network, where nodes represent species and links represent interactions between them. Networks are generally constructed for one type of interaction, such as food webs capturing predation – or pollination networks capturing a specific mutualistic interaction, and continue to lead to significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the dynamical consequences of community structure –. This perspective has also been used to shed light on the generative processes driving the assembly of complex ecological communities.

To what extent assembly leaves its fingerprint on the structure and function of ecological communities is a source of considerable debate –. There is strong evidence that functional traits constrain assembly –, while differences in species' trophic niche, coupled with early establishment of fast/slow energy channels, appear to significantly impact long-term community dynamics. There has been growing interest in understanding the combined role of trophic and mutualistic interactions in driving assembly, where the establishment of species from a source pool – and the plasticity of species interactions – constrain colonization and extinction dynamics. While recent interest in "multilayer networks" comprising multiple interaction types (multitype interactions) may provide additional insight into these processes, there is not yet a well-defined theory for the assembly of communities that incorporates multitype interactions, as well as both biotic and abiotic components from which functioning ecosystems are composed (cf. ref.).

### Context-dependent dynamics lead to the assembly of functionally distinct microbial communities [^115C21mC]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Microbes profoundly shape our ecosystems, yet we still lack a clear understanding of the processes driving community assembly and related ecosystem functioning. Community assembly is difficult to predict, because the dynamics of any particular species can be dependent on the community context; niches are created or destroyed through biotic interactions with other members of an assembling community –. Microbial communities are complex, with many species and different kinds of interactions among species. For example, microbes can facilitate other species' growth via excretion of metabolic waste products –, or actively interfere with their growth through the production of antimicrobial compounds. Microbes can also engage in strong cooperative interactions, whereby energy transducing metabolic interactions are coupled across species. This diversity of interactions creates many potential contexts for species dynamics, implying that the behavior of one species is dependent on the background of interactions. Stochastic changes in the biotic context — for example, priority effects and random colonization or extinction events — can have long-lasting consequences for community structure. As a result, microbial communities can reach different compositional states due to variation in biotic context in addition to variation in abiotic environmental conditions such as weather events or resource pulses. These history-dependent effects are collectively called "historical contingencies" –.

The extent to which historical contingency leads to alternative community states, remains an active subject of debate. In a strongly selective environment, historical contingencies may not matter and communities converge to the same compositional and functional outcomes. For example, bacterial communities from widely different sources converged reproducibly in single-carbon source synthetic media. Beyond microbes, Mediterranean plant communities in environments with frequent fires were formed by related groups of species that share key traits. In contrast, other studies have found that historical contingency leads to different community compositions and functions, for example: priority effects led to large differences in ecosystem function for wood-decaying fungiand productivity of grassland plants. A third, and perhaps largest, set of studies has found convergence in terms of function but not species (or phylogenetic) composition, for example: grassland plants, the stratified layers of a hypersaline microbial mat, microbial communities colonizing the surface of seaweed, and the bacteria and archaea living in bromeliad tanks.

### The importance of niches for the maintenance of species diversity [^111N143Z]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating species' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rare — the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity.

### Synthetic microbial communities [^116iXzA8]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

The challenges of understanding natural communities

Recent years have seen a surge in the analysis of microbial communities thanks to the development and cost-reduction in sequencing technologies. The continuing application of these has led to the characterisation of species diversity in different natural communities from the oceans to the human gut. Despite this rapid increase in available metagenomic datasets, however, there are still significant limitations in answering the fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions surrounding natural microbial communities. In particular, we still lack a clear understanding of the molecular and ecological bases of community-level functions, and the potential trade-offs in the extent, stability and robustness of such functions and other community properties (e.g. diversity, structure, size).

While even the simplest of the natural microbial communities characterised to date contain tens to more than thousands of species, it is usually not possible to experimentally verify which species in such characterisations are actively part of the community, or are performing key functions. The assembly of natural microbial communities might also depend on dispersal of potential seed organisms, as well as on environmental selection and species sorting, the effects of which would be difficult to control or characterise. Further, the influence of each of such drivers on the composition of a community can vary according to the ecosystem and temporal scale of observation. For example, open systems like wastewater treatment plants are found to be dominated by near random colonisation effects, while more enclosed systems like the gut of higher animals seem to lead to a more stable community over time after an initial period of community assembly. The known limitations in detecting rare species with sequencing approaches create a further challenge in dissecting the relation between species composition and community function and dynamics.

### On the structure of species-function participation in multilayer ecological networks [^116Vtgg6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the Na Redona islet, our results indicate that fungi-led interactions are more widespread. More specifically, saprophytic-type interactions exhibit a disproportionate prevalence, and decomposition emerges as the only keystone function, in both rankings (Figs. 3 c and 5 c). While such a result should be confirmed for other ecosystems, at this point, we can comment that this is in agreement with a relatively recent shift in the interest and relevance of underground -in contrast to above-ground- interactions within ecosystem functioning. On the other hand, in our database seed dispersal is found to have a significantly low score. In hindsight, this specific result can be related to the fact that Na Redona is an islet with a shortage of plants with fleshy fruits, and in this sense, in other ecosystems where the abundance of fleshy fruits is higher, the score of seed dispersal might be larger.

In any case, understanding the origin for the presence of actors with disproportionally (and statistically significant) low keystone scores — such as the case of seed dispersal in Na Redona — and why species or functions with apparently weaker connecting roles are still observed in the ecosystem is reminiscent of similar questions on the rare biosphere: low-abundance microbial populations that in turn display specific and sometimes unique ecology and serve as a broad reservoir of ecological resiliency.

Observe that finding (statistically significant) heterogeneous keystone scores both for plant species and functions essentially means that there are some plant species and functions (those considered keystone) for which the number of observed indirect connections to other species and functions is enhanced with respect to a null model. Interestingly, previous works have found that indirect effects between species are more likely to predominate in nested networks, and impacts species fitness. In our context, our findings open the door to (i) relate the structure of indirect species-species relations (Π) to e.g. biodiversity maintenance, but also (ii) investigate the impact of indirect function-function relations (Φ) on similar ecological questions.

### Effects of biodiversity on the functioning of trophic groups and ecosystems [^111Ft9z6]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Over the past decade, accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted an increasing number of studies to reduce species diversity experimentally and examine how this alters the efficiency by which communities capture resources and convert those into biomass. So far, the generality of patterns and processes observed in individual studies have been the subjects of considerable debate. Here we present a formal meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally manipulated species diversity to examine how it affects the functioning of numerous trophic groups in multiple types of ecosystem. We show that the average effect of decreasing species richness is to decrease the abundance or biomass of the focal trophic group, leading to less complete depletion of resources used by that group. At the same time, analyses reveal that the standing stock of, and resource depletion by, the most species-rich polyculture tends to be no different from that of the single most productive species used in an experiment. Of the known mechanisms that might explain these trends, results are most consistent with what is called the 'sampling effect', which occurs when diverse communities are more likely to contain and become dominated by the most productive species. Whether this mechanism is widespread in natural communities is currently controversial. Patterns we report are remarkably consistent for four different trophic groups (producers, herbivores, detritivores and predators) and two major ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial). Collectively, our analyses suggest that the average species loss does indeed affect the functioning of a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems, but the magnitude of these effects is ultimately determined by the identity of species that are going extinct.

### Synthesizing microbial biodiversity [^114ZrERw]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The diversity of microbial ecosystems is linked to crucial ecological processes and functions. Despite its significance, the ecological mechanisms responsible for the initiation and maintenance of microbiome diversity are still not fully understood. The primary challenge lies in the difficulty of isolating, monitoring, and manipulating the complex and interrelated ecological processes that modulate the diversity of microbial communities in their natural habitats. Synthetic ecology experiments provide a suitable alternative for investigating the mechanisms behind microbial biodiversity in controlled laboratory settings, as the environment can be systematically and modularly manipulated by adding and removing components. This enables the testing of hypotheses and the advancement of predictive theories. In this review, we present an overview of recent progress toward achieving this goal.

### Role of priority effects in the early-life assembly of the gut microbiota [^114Sdsqm]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Understanding how microbial communities develop is essential for predicting and directing their future states. Ecological theory suggests that community development is often influenced by priority effects, in which the order and timing of species arrival determine how species affect one another. Priority effects can have long-lasting consequences, particularly if species arrival history varies during the early stage of community development, but their importance to the human gut microbiota and host health remains largely unknown. Here, we explore how priority effects might influence microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract during early childhood and how the strength of priority effects can be estimated from the composition of the microbial species pool. We also discuss factors that alter microbial transmission, such as delivery mode, diet and parenting behaviours such as breastfeeding, which can influence the likelihood of priority effects. An improved knowledge of priority effects has the potential to inform microorganism-based therapies, such as prebiotics and probiotics, which are aimed at guiding the microbiota towards a healthy state.

### Identifying a common backbone of interactions underlying food webs from different ecosystems [^116PBiRy]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The structure of ecological networks — the way interactions are distributed among consumers and resources — has been shown to vary in space and time. Known drivers of this variation are that species composition is affected by environmental conditions, dispersal limitations, and historical contingencies –. Ecological interactions also vary over time and from one location to another in accordance with local changes in species abundances and traits, as well as due to other intrinsic processes producing ongoing extinctions in the absence of perturbations. The nature of environmental variability in different habitats might also shape ecological networks in different ways. For instance, communities experiencing high seasonality, such as stream and lake food webs, present a strong latitudinal gradient in the number of prey and predators per species. Moreover, the effects of disturbances like invasive species and habitat fragmentation can introduce additional variability that can also lead to changes in network structure –. Differences in the sampling methods can also lead to changes in the data collected, with some techniques making it hard to observe weak links in particular.

Despite this observed variability, many types of ecological networks also showcase a variety of common structural properties across environments. For food webs, examples include relatively short food chainsand a roughly constant fraction of top, intermediate, and basal species. The observation of these common structural properties might suggest the existence of general rules driving or constraining the assembly of all ecological communities –. Some such rules are thought to be the result of energetic or metabolic constraints in the way individual organisms process energy and materials, which could translate into some of the scaling relations observed across ecosystems. Aspects of network structure have also been linked to ecosystems' robustness to species extinctions, persistence –, and dynamical stability, which has led to some arguing that stability and feasibility are additional constraints shaping these ecological communities.

Notably, the aforementioned structural variability and commonality observed across environments need not be incompatible, though they are often treated as such. Indeed, one heretofore unexplored idea that could reconcile these two perspectives is the existence of a common "backbone of interactions" underlying all ecological communities. Conceptually, this backbone would constitute a set of connected species within every network that play similar ecological roles and that also interact with each other in a similar manner. Extrinsic and intrinsic differences, like environmental variability or variation between local species pools, would then introduce idiosyncrasies in realized community assembly and add noise to and around the backbone.

### Priority effects in microbiome assembly [^112cMGFg]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the widespread measurement of microbiome composition across systems and over the course of microbiome assembly. Despite substantial progress in understanding the deterministic drivers of community composition, the role of historical contingency remains poorly understood. The establishment of new species in a community can depend on the order and/or timing of their arrival, a phenomenon known as a priority effect. Here, we review the mechanisms of priority effects and evidence for their importance in microbial communities inhabiting a range of environments, including the mammalian gut, the plant phyllosphere and rhizosphere, soil, freshwaters and oceans. We describe approaches for the direct testing and prediction of priority effects in complex microbial communities and illustrate these with re-analysis of publicly available plant and animal microbiome datasets. Finally, we discuss the shared principles that emerge across study systems, focusing on eco-evolutionary dynamics and the importance of scale. Overall, we argue that predicting when and how current community state impacts the success of newly arriving microbial taxa is crucial for the management of microbiomes to sustain ecological function and host health. We conclude by discussing outstanding conceptual and practical challenges that are faced when measuring priority effects in microbiomes.

### Deterministic processes vary during community assembly for ecologically dissimilar taxa [^1151gzNA]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The continuum hypothesis states that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of ecological communities. However, the contextual dependency of these processes remains an open question that imposes strong limitations on predictions of community responses to environmental change. Here we measure community and habitat turnover across multiple vertical soil horizons at 183 sites across Scotland for bacteria and fungi, both dominant and functionally vital components of all soils but which differ substantially in their growth habit and dispersal capability. We find that habitat turnover is the primary driver of bacterial community turnover in general, although its importance decreases with increasing isolation and disturbance. Fungal communities, however, exhibit a highly stochastic assembly process, both neutral and non-neutral in nature, largely independent of disturbance. These findings suggest that increased focus on dispersal limitation and biotic interactions are necessary to manage and conserve the key ecosystem services provided by these assemblages.

### The stability of multitrophic communities under habitat loss [^1129BQcy]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Our study aligns with recent efforts to assess changes in ecological communities beyond species extinctions. By controlling the number of species, we were able to disentangle the effect that HL has on community structure from its effect on community composition. HL not only reduces the abundance of species, but may also lead to changes in several aspects of the structure and stability of communities prior to extinctions. Our work relates with research exploring changes in local diversity following global change, currently under a heated debate. We suggest that, irrespective of a positive, negative or neutral change in local diversity, the type of HL changes the structure and dynamics of ecological communities in very different, contrasting ways. Finally, our findings suggest that conservation efforts focusing on alleviating the effects of loss of natural habitats would benefit from (i) including several aspects of community structure and stability, in addition to species persistence, into assessment and management plans, and (ii) integrating the type of HL into conservation planning, as it can strongly determine the response of communities.

### Context-dependent dynamics lead to the assembly of functionally distinct microbial communities [^111GUCZk]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Our conceptual model for the assembly dynamics of microcosms suggests that when in the same in vitro environment, non-metabolically active species are quickly pruned, and after only one transfer the final diversity of the community is determined. This result implies that historical contingencies influence richness levels, even after communities equilibrate to a common environment. Despite biotic differences in richness and composition across microcosms we observe universal ASV extinction dynamics, as predicted by recent theory. However, ASVs persisting within the microcosms are largely influenced by microcosm context, suggesting significant effects of biotic interactions or ecosystem engineering. Therefore, long-lasting effects of early conditions and biota lead to strong differences in final community composition and ecosystem function. The environmental conditions of our experiment supported multiple functional outcomes, which may have shifted the selective balance to species interactions, therefore increasing the possible community states. Our experiment was necessarily run in the laboratory, but it used wild communities as the starting point and suggests potential implications for a natural system. Stochastic events during colonization of the pitchers of carnivorous pitcher plants may have lasting impacts on the ability of the pitcher microbiome to degrade insect prey and to release nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, to the common pitcher pool in a plant-accessible form.

Our model system based on pitcher plant bacterial communities can be used to address other questions in microbial ecology. For example: the role of dispersal in community assembly; how coalescence events (the mixing of stable communities) lead to different compositions; how invasions alter community structure and function; and how evolution acts on individuals within communities to change interactions over time. Our microcosms are less complex than most natural systems because species that did not grow within the current environment were pruned during transfers, but are more complex than almost all experimental laboratory communities. The ability to culture key community members provides the opportunity for building synthetic communities that retain interactions among species previously established in nature.

### Connecting microbial community assembly and function [^114jHjpV]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbial ecology is moving away from purely descriptive analyses to experiments that can determine the underlying mechanisms driving changes in community assembly and function. More species-rich microbial communities generally have higher functional capabilities depending on if there is positive selection of certain species or complementarity among different species. When building synthetic communities or laboratory enrichment cultures, there are specific choices that can increase the number of species able to coexist. Higher resource complexity or the addition of physical niches are two of the many factors leading to greater biodiversity and associated increases in functional capabilities. We can use principles from community ecology and knowledge of microbial physiology to generate improved microbiomes for use in medicine, agriculture, or environmental management.

### Emergence of structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks [^1162JNgy]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have generally evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition and latitude; specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species. Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network structure on the basis of community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached minimal consensus. Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks, although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the community. Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks.

### Heterogeneity within and among co-occurring foundation species increases biodiversity [^115VPaMe]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Habitat-associated heterogeneity has been identified as a universal driver of biodiversity because heterogeneous environments are thought to have more resources, refugia and niche spaces. This study of geographically distributed factorial field experiments found that the extent to which facilitation cascades promote animal abundances, taxonomic richness and differences in community structure increases with the magnitude by which secondary FS enhance heterogeneity over that provided by the primary FS alone. In general, we found positive and additive effects of habitat amount, function and morphology (i.e. with only a few significant simple-to-interpret interactions) suggesting that secondary FS enhance biodiversity not only by increasing the amount of habitat space over that which was provided by primary FS alone, but also by providing protective microhabitats and other resources as living organisms, such as food for consumers and detritus.

There was strong support for our hypothesis that morphological differences between primary and secondary FS control the strength of facilitation cascades, as predicted by the results of a few case studies that compared facilitation cascades with different secondary FS. Here, morphological heterogeneity was assessed by ranking primary and secondary FS as simple, intermediate, or complex shapes, a common approach in traditional form-functional ecology –. There also was strong support for our second hypothesis that living secondary FS, which can provide more resources (i.e. functions) to animals, create stronger facilitation cascades than non-living secondary FS. Living secondary FS likely promoted biodiversity because they are edible and produce detritus, thereby supporting both consumer and decomposer-based communities, and by modifying local conditions through metabolic process including gas exchange and excretion. Nevertheless, even mimics of secondary FS had positive effects on biodiversity, highlighting the universal importance of habitat space in affecting biodiversity. A combination of reduction in environmental stress (e.g. moisture retention beneath secondary FS in intertidal habitats) and the provision of predation refugia (e.g. in the interstitial spaces of secondary FS) likely explains facilitation by non-living secondary FS. Future experimental studies should therefore explicitly test how effect sizes in facilitation cascades vary along stress and predation pressure gradients.

### Predicting the effect of habitat modification on networks of interacting species [^113AcA9f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

A pressing challenge for ecologists is predicting how human-driven environmental changes will affect the complex pattern of interactions among species in a community. Weighted networks are an important tool for studying changes in interspecific interactions because they record interaction frequencies in addition to presence or absence at a field site. Here we show that changes in weighted network structure following habitat modification are, in principle, predictable. Our approach combines field data with mathematical models: the models separate changes in relative species abundance from changes in interaction preferences (which describe how interaction frequencies deviate from random encounters). The models with the best predictive ability compared to data requirement are those that capture systematic changes in interaction preferences between different habitat types. Our results suggest a viable approach for predicting the consequences of rapid environmental change for the structure of complex ecological networks, even in the absence of detailed, system-specific empirical data. In a changing world, the ability to predict the impact of environmental change on ecological communities is essential. Here, the authors show that by separating species abundances from interaction preferences, they can predict the effects of habitat modification on the structure of weighted species interaction networks, even with limited data.

### Mechanistic prediction of community composition across resource conditions and species richness [^111SpdFi]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Predicting species coexistence and community assembly is a central goal in ecology. Traditional methods, based on the effect of one species on another (e.g. Lotka-Volterra competition model), are sensitive to environmental context. This is because they ignore the fundamental processes that can be applied across environments. While mechanistic approaches offer promise, empirical tests remain rare. Here, we integrate a mechanistic consumer-resource model with the growth of 12 phytoplankton species in monoculture over a range of nitrate, ammonium or phosphorous concentrations. We find that the mechanistic approach accurately predicts the composition of 960 communities across species richness and resource conditions. We confirm by simulations, species competing for substitutable resources (nitrate vs. ammonium) exhibit greater diversity than those competing for essential resources (nitrate vs. phosphorus), especially when initial species richness is high. This is because, in competition for essential resources, each species is likely to consume less of the resource that is more limiting to its growth, which violates the mechanistic rule of coexistence that states that each species must consume more of the resource that more limit it. Our study highlights the power of the mechanistic approach in understanding and predicting species loss across environments and, ultimately, mitigating its pace.

### Local adaptation of a bacterium is as important as its presence in structuring a natural microbial community [^112tjYer]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Community structure changes in response to environmental perturbation because some species perform better under the novel conditions than others. In parallel with recent theory, there is a growing body of empirical work that suggests contemporaneous evolution (evolution occurring on the same time scale as ecological changes) may contribute to these changes in community composition. Studies using simplified laboratory communities of microbial organismsshow that contemporaneous evolution can affect interactions within- and between-trophic levels, and historical effects of microevolution have been shown to affect subsequent community structure in more complex settings.

A number of studies have attempted to determine the relative impact of contemporaneous evolution versus ecological variables on community structure. For example, local adaptation of Daphnia magna was found to be as important as the presence of predatory fish in driving the structure of zooplankton communities in mesocosms. However, while this work provides important information on the relative importance of specific environmental variables and adaptation to these variables, a more general way to estimate importance of local adaptation is to measure its effect relative to the presence of the evolving species per se.

### Community-level signatures of ecological succession in natural bacterial communities [^114fx21b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A central goal in microbial ecology is to simplify the extraordinary biodiversity that inhabits natural environments into ecologically coherent units. We profiled (16S rRNA sequencing) > 700 semi-aquatic bacterial communities while measuring their functional capacity when grown in laboratory conditions. This approach allowed us to investigate the relationship between composition and function excluding confounding environmental factors. Simulated data allowed us to reject the hypothesis that stochastic processes were responsible for community assembly, suggesting that niche effects prevailed. Consistent with this idea we identified six distinct community classes that contained samples collected from distant locations. Structural equation models showed there was a functional signature associated with each community class. We obtained a more mechanistic understanding of the classes using metagenomic predictions (PiCRUST). This approach allowed us to show that the classes contained distinct genetic repertoires reflecting community-level ecological strategies. The ecological strategies resemble the classical distinction between r- and K-strategists, suggesting that bacterial community assembly may be explained by simple ecological mechanisms.

### Ecosystem decay exacerbates biodiversity loss with habitat loss [^1125HSHq]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene 1,2, exactly how this loss manifests-and at which scales-remains a central debate 3–6. The 'passive sampling' hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat 7,8, whereas the 'ecosystem decay' hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone 9,10. Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments-when controlled for sampling effort-contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.

### Context-dependent dynamics lead to the assembly of functionally distinct microbial communities [^115Vz39e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Niche construction through interspecific interactions can condition future community states on past ones. However, the extent to which such history dependency can steer communities towards functionally different states remains a subject of active debate. Using bacterial communities collected from wild pitchers of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, we test the effects of history on composition and function across communities assembled in synthetic pitcher plant microcosms. We find that the diversity of assembled communities is determined by the diversity of the system at early, pre-assembly stages. Species composition is also contingent on early community states, not only because of differences in the species pool, but also because the same species have different dynamics in different community contexts. Importantly, compositional differences are proportional to differences in function, as profiles of resource use are strongly correlated with composition, despite convergence in respiration rates. Early differences in community structure can thus propagate to mature communities, conditioning their functional repertoire.

### Heterogeneity within and among co-occurring foundation species increases biodiversity [^115eERUd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To this point we have discussed axes of heterogeneity individually, but it is a major goal in ecology to understand how multiple factors act together to affect biodiversity –. For example, interacting factors can be non-additive and near-impossible to predict from single factor tests resulting in inadequate projections of future biodiversity. In contrast to most studies on heterogeneity vs. biodiversity, or facilitation cascades. our factorial approach allowed us to test for such interaction effects. Importantly, synergism occurred between the amount and morphology of habitat of secondary FS (in all biodiversity responses), and between the amount and function of secondary FS (in abundances and richness responses), highlighting how the effects of high amounts of secondary FS are stronger when secondary FS are more convoluted or provide more functions (Fig. 2). These results suggest that limiting facilitation thresholds exist along some heterogeneity axes, but that the thresholds can be exceeded when secondary FS become abundant. Results of our global mechanistic experiments support many observational studies documenting positive relationships between heterogeneity and biodiversity but contrast a few studies that have shown unimodal or negative relationships for individual taxa or trophic groups. Unimodal and negative relationships have been explained by specific combinations of habitat compositions and configurations, and animal niche-breadth and dispersal traits. We probably found positive relationships because our heterogeneity tests were based on short binary treatments (instead of long continuous gradients), dispersal is less limiting in small-scale facilitation cascade experiments where animals often move between primary and secondary FS, and taxa were grouped into one-dimensional community abundance and taxonomic richness values so that strong and common species-specific positive relationships overshadow minor weak or infrequent negative relationships. Our factorial, experimental approach also allowed us to rank the axes of habitat-heterogeneity in order of importance (here based on sums of squares). Thus, for abundances and taxonomic richness, function was most important followed by ∆morphology × amount (the third most important factor varied between tests), whereas the rankings for community structure was ∆morphology followed by amount and function (consistent between tests). Perhaps this difference reflects that the two former responses are simple univariate metrics whereas the latter incorporates all species-specific data in multidimensional space. To our knowledge this is the first facilitation cascade study that has explicitly ranked different forms of habitat-associated heterogeneity, although a few case studies have previously suggested that the strength of facilitation cascades can be modified by the presence of tertiary FS, habitat types, and densities of FS. Altogether, this work highlights that the strength of facilitation cascades can be highly response- and context-dependentas is the case for trophic cascades.

### Towards a general theory of biodiversity [^112x3tES]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The study of patterns in living diversity is driven by the desire to find the universal rules that underlie the organization of ecosystems. The relative abundance distribution, which characterizes the total number and abundance of species in a community, is arguably the most fundamental measure in ecology. Considerable effort has been expended in striving for a general theory that can explain the form of the distribution. Despite this, a mechanistic understanding of the form in terms of physiological and environmental parameters remains elusive. Recently, it has been proposed that space plays a central role in generating the patterns of diversity. Here we show that an understanding of the observed form of the relative abundance distribution requires a consideration of how individuals pack in time. We present a framework for studying the dynamics of communities which generalizes the prevailing species-based approach to one based on individuals that are characterized by their physiological traits. The observed form of the abundance distribution and its dependence on richness and disturbance are reproduced, and can be understood in terms of the trade-off between time to reproduction and fecundity.

### Multi-habitat landscapes are more diverse and stable with improved function [^112kx17S]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conservation, restoration and land management are increasingly implemented at landscape scales 1,2. However, because species interaction data are typically habitat- and/or guild-specific, exactly how those interactions connect habitats and affect the stability and function of communities at landscape scales remains poorly understood. We combine multi-guild species interaction data (plant-pollinator and three plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities, collected from landscapes with one, two or three habitats), a field experiment and a modelling approach to show that multi-habitat landscapes support higher species and interaction evenness, more complementary species interactions and more consistent robustness to species loss. These emergent network properties drive improved pollination success in landscapes with more habitats and are not explained by simply summing component habitat webs. Linking landscape composition, through community structure, to ecosystem function, highlights mechanisms by which several contiguous habitats can support landscape-scale ecosystem services.

### Mutualist and pathogen traits interact to affect plant community structure in a spatially explicit model [^11134P9f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Empirical studies show that plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) can generate negative density dependent (NDD) recruitment capable of maintaining plant community diversity at landscape scales. However, the observation that common plants often exhibit relatively weaker NDD than rare plants at local scales is difficult to reconcile with the maintenance of overall plant diversity. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model that tracks the community dynamics of microbial mutualists, pathogens, and their plant hosts. We find that net PSF effects vary as a function of both host abundance and key microbial traits (e.g., host affinity) in ways that are compatible with both common plants exhibiting relatively weaker local NDD, while promoting overall species diversity. The model generates a series of testable predictions linking key microbial traits and the relative abundance of host species, to the strength and scale of PSF and overall plant community diversity.

### Replicating community dynamics reveals how initial composition shapes the functional outcomes of bacterial communities [^1164UL5D]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

These observations and ideas make two, apparently contradictory, predictions. The first idea predicts convergent community trajectories under standardised environmental conditions. If bacterial communities contain high levels of diversity, natural selection would be expected to rapidly and reproducibly sort the best-adapted taxa, resulting in a single taxonomic and functional outcome. This idea is supported by studies showing a predictable simplification and convergence of communities in standardised conditions. Under this scenario, community composition seems to go hand-in-hand with community-level functioning, and therefore it may be possible to accurately predict functioning without a detailed knowledge of the mechanistic details underlying microbial dynamics, as illustrated by the functional landscape approach. The second idea predicts divergent community trajectories, generating a rugged compositional landscape that may or may not reproducibly achieve specified functions. This idea is further supported by observations and theory showing that alternative community states arise across many study systems, perhaps facilitated by flexible decision-making in bacterial resource acquisition. Alternative compositional states could have a range of consequences for ecosystem functioning if the taxa making up the alternative compositional states have different metabolic repertoires; a result that may have been overlooked due to the species-poor communities explored in previous studies (typically lower than 20, see e.g.). However, alternative compositional states could have the same functionality if many bacteria have overlapping functional capacities (redundancy), resulting in the same ecological niches being filled. This has been implied by studies that have shown taxonomic divergence but functional convergence. Finally, more complex relationships are also plausible; for example, high-order interactions may dominate the relationship between composition and functioning.

### Non-additive microbial community responses to environmental complexity [^112MDBjJ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Environmental composition is a major, though poorly understood, determinant of microbiome dynamics. Here we ask whether general principles govern how microbial community growth yield and diversity scale with an increasing number of environmental molecules. By assembling hundreds of synthetic consortia in vitro, we find that growth yield can remain constant or increase in a non-additive manner with environmental complexity. Conversely, taxonomic diversity is often much lower than expected. To better understand these deviations, we formulate metrics for epistatic interactions between environments and use them to compare our results to communities simulated with experimentally-parametrized consumer resource models. We find that key metabolic and ecological factors, including species similarity, degree of specialization, and metabolic interactions, modulate the observed non-additivity and govern the response of communities to combinations of resource pools. Our results demonstrate that environmental complexity alone is not sufficient for maintaining community diversity, and provide practical guidance for designing and controlling microbial ecosystems.

### Taxonomic and functional diversity change is scale dependent [^1141LwrN]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biodiversity and its many functions are undergoing rapid changes worldwide, with multifarious potential consequences for human well-being. An appropriate measurement of this change is key to detecting the signature of anthropogenic impacts, evaluating the implications of biodiversity loss to humans, and informing monitoring and conservation programs. Nevertheless, evidence of local biodiversity change often remains complex and contradictory. For example, recent studies, albeit contested, claimed a lack of systematic local biodiversity loss across multiple taxa, regions, and realms. Notably, that work, pooled data from locations differing up to eight orders of magnitude in area. Despite the suggestion that spatial scale may influence evidence of biodiversity change, to date, a quantitative assessment of these issues is lacking (but see refs. –).

Taxonomic diversity (species richness (TD)) remains the main measure of biodiversity despite the recognition that it does not account for the many different ecological functions, of species comprising communities and may thus not account for the implications of biodiversity change for the functioning of ecosystems and their services for humans. Losses or gains of some species might have much greater functional implications for ecosystems than those of othersand differently affect assemblage functional diversity. Acknowledging species' functional attributes is seen as vital for understanding the processes responsible for the spatial and temporal dynamics of species occurrence and community assembly –, and is increasingly considered crucial for conservation prioritization. Few studies, however, have placed functional diversity (FD) change in a scale-dependent context.

Here, we use uniquely suited, detection-corrected, and near-continental data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) from a nearly 50-year period, and extended to extinctions at the global scale, to demonstrate a pervasive scale and metric dependence of taxonomic and functional diversity change. We find that TD and FD increased at all but the global scale, though change in TD exceeded change in FD toward large scales, suggesting strong trait redundancy at those scales. Patterns of change in functional diversity varied strongly among diet and foraging guilds, raising concerns about the loss of critical ecosystem functions. Our results indicate that scale-explicit framework should be adopted in monitoring, policy, and conservation to account for the pervasive effect that scale has on perceived biodiversity change.

### Species traits and landscape structure can drive scale-dependent propagation of effects in ecosystems [^115ubCBp]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Species can directly and indirectly affect others across communities and habitats, yet the spatial scale over which such effects spread remains unclear. This uncertainty arises partly because the species traits and landscape structures allowing indirect effects to propagate may differ across scales. Here, we use a topological network metric, communicability, to explore the factors controlling spatial propagation of effects in a large-scale plant-frugivore network projected across the territory of Aotearoa New Zealand. We show that generalism, species prevalence, and morphological traits are important predictors of species' capacity to propagate effects, but their importance differed across scales. Furthermore, native bird species (but not exotics) show a positive relationship between body size and their potential to propagate effects. Habitat composition is the most important landscape factor in our study, generating hotspots of effect propagation around forested areas, whereas landscapes containing a variety of habitats act as a buffer against propagation. Overall, our results indicate that species displaying specific sets of traits, including ubiquity, interaction generalism, and a combination of large body size and native status, are the most likely to propagate large-scale ecological impacts in the plant-frugivore communities studied, yet landscape properties may moderate this spread.

### Community-level signatures of ecological succession in natural bacterial communities [^115SdkJ1]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Previous work using this data set showed that rare taxa influenced narrow functions (degradation of specific substrates), whereas abundant taxa influenced broad functions (overall community productivity). Here, we aim to illuminate the mechanistic basis of this relationship. The large data set allow us to study natural variation in bacterial community composition through the top–down categorisation of communities into classes. We then link the classes with bacterial functioning, analysing a set of community-level functional profiles obtained from laboratory assays of the same communities, and investigating whether the classes differed in their functional capacity. Instead of focusing on each function individually, we investigate how the functional profiles varied across the community classes. We then use metagenomic information to understand whether similar compositions and functions are translated into different classes of genetic repertoires.

We find significant differences in the genetic repertoires and functional measurements among classes, which we interpret in the context of changing environmental conditions. We address whether differences in the communities are owing to the historical processes at the different geographic locations, or if they are rather more influenced by contingent local conditions. These factors are often difficult to resolvebut may both be important owing to the high temporal variability in these systems, as observed in compost ecosystems. Interestingly, interpreting the signatures found in the functional measurements and in the genetic repertoires lead us to hypothesise the existence of community-level ecological strategies, reflecting an ecological succession driven by local environmental dynamics of the tree-holes. These ecological strategies resemble the classical distinction between r– and K–strategists described for single species.

### Quantifying microbial interactions: concepts, caveats, and applications [^1175h5W3]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbial communities are fundamental to every ecosystem on Earth and hold great potential for biotechnological applications. However, their complex nature hampers our ability to study and understand them. A common strategy to tackle this complexity is to abstract the community into a network of interactions between its members - a phenomenological description that captures the overall effects of various chemical and physical mechanisms that underpin these relationships. This approach has proven useful for numerous applications in microbial ecology, including predicting community dynamics and stability and understanding community assembly and evolution. However, care is required in quantifying and interpreting interactions. Here, we clarify the concept of an interaction and discuss when interaction measurements are useful despite their context-dependent nature. Furthermore, we categorize different approaches for quantifying interactions, highlighting the research objectives each approach is best suited for.

### Diverse interactions and ecosystem engineering can stabilize community assembly [^117Kxwmx]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The distribution of trophic levels changes shape over the course of assembly. Early in assembly, we observe a skewed pyramidal structure, where most species feed from the base of the food web. At steady state, we observe that intermediate trophic levels dominate, with frequencies taking on an hourglass structure (purple bars, Fig. 2 c). Compellingly, the trophic richness pyramids that we observe at steady state follow closely the hourglass distribution observed for empirical food webs and are less top-heavy than those produced by static food web models.

Structure and dynamics of mutualisms

Nested interactions, where specialist interactions are subsets of generalist interactions, are a distinguishing feature of mutualistic networks. Nestedness has been shown to maximize the structural stability of mutualistic networks, emerge naturally via adaptive foraging behaviors, and neutral processes, and promote the influence of indirect effects on coevolutionary dynamics. While models and experiments of trophic networks suggest that compartmentalization confers greater stabilizing properties, interaction asymmetry among species may promote nestedness in both trophicand mutualistic systems. Processes that operate on different temporal and spatial scales may have a significant influence on these observations. For example, over evolutionary time, coevolution and speciation may degrade nested structures in favor of modularity, and there is some evidence from Pleistocene food webs that geographic insularity may reinforce this process.

Does the assembly of ecological networks favor nestedness when mutualistic interactions are frequent? In the absence of mutualisms, the trade-offs in our model preclude high levels of nestedness because we assume that generalists are at a competitive disadvantage when they share the same resources with a specialist consumer. Yet, we find that as we increase the frequency of service interactions (holding constant trophic interaction frequency; see Supplementary Note 2), the assembled community at steady state becomes more nested (Fig. 3 a). More service interactions increase a species' competition strength, lowering its primary extinction risk. Participation in a mutualism thus delivers a fitness advantage to the species receiving the service, compensating for the lower competitive strength of generalists and allowing generalists to share subsets of resources with specialists, promoting nestedness. However, increases in mutualisms also increase inter-species dependencies, which raises the potential risk associated with losing mutualistic partners. While this shifting landscape of extinction risks lowers the steady state species richness of highly mutualistic communities, we do not observe a direct relationship between nestedness and richness (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Local adaptation of a bacterium is as important as its presence in structuring a natural microbial community [^1165fDgP]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Local adaptation of a species can affect community composition, yet the importance of local adaptation compared with species presence per se is unknown. Here we determine how a compost bacterial community exposed to elevated temperature changes over 2 months as a result of the presence of a focal bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, that had been pre-adapted or not to the compost for 48 days. The effect of local adaptation on community composition is as great as the effect of species presence per se, with these results robust to the presence of an additional strong selection pressure: an SBW25-specific virus. These findings suggest that evolution occurring over ecological time scales can be a key driver of the structure of natural microbial communities, particularly in situations where some species have an evolutionary head start following large perturbations, such as exposure to antibiotics or crop planting and harvesting.

### Regional influences on community structure across the tropical-temperate divide [^113P1wkW]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our analyses of the different motifs reveal a consistent pattern of partition between temperate and tropical climates. Our conclusions draw on the combined assessment of geographical, compositional, and phylogenetic axes of diversity and comparisons of the model fits for different values of K. As has been discussed widely in the population genetics literature, we do not consider that there is a best value of K for any one of these axes nor that values of K with lower support are biologically meaningless, especially because significance is tested against an unclear sampling distribution. Rather, additional partitions are of value in assessing the hierarchy of contributions of biotas to realms and communities.

Across many environmental gradients, including within the Himalaya, community taxonomic composition appears to vary more or less continuously, both across elevation and geography (e.g. Supplementary Fig. 6). Based on observations such as these, Ricklefsargued that continuous turnover implies communities are artificial constructs, whose structure is heavily impacted by dispersal from elsewhere. Results presented here imply a more integrated local community than may be inferred from species lists. First, common species are shared over parts of the gradient, overlapping with common species that are present in other communities, thereby generating a network that can be partitioned into well-supported motifs. For example, most communities contain a common species of sunbird, which occupies a well-defined ecological niche. Most communities also contain one to several small warblers, occupying a different but again well-defined niche. Thus functional similarity of communities extends across the entire gradient. Turnover of species along the elevational gradient is not coincidental across the two groups, but in both cases different species are found above and below the freezing line. Second, if dispersal strongly affects community structure, then communities associated with more than one geographical motif should show elevated species numbers and phylogenetic diversity with respect to communities associated with just one geographical motif. We found no support for this (Supplementary Fig. 11). Species richness varies idiosyncratically both within and between motifs. Phylogenetic diversity monotonically declines with elevation, reflecting the increasing dominance of a single suborder, the oscines (order Passeriformes), which are thought to have become established from 35 million years onwards in association with a cooling climate. Communities with tropical affinities are sourced by older lineages, and this overwhelms any potential effect of mixing on phylogenetic diversity.

### Confronting the coral reef crisis [^1126FwAn]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

The worldwide decline of coral reefs calls for an urgent reassessment of current management practices. Confronting large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of management efforts based on an improved understanding of the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience. Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.

### Predator richness increases the effect of prey diversity on prey yield [^114jPfBT]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships are generally attributed to two mechanisms: complementarity and selection. These mechanisms have been primarily examined using plant communities, whereas bacterial communities remain largely unexplored. Moreover, it remains uncertain how predation by single or multiple predators affects these mechanisms. Here using 465 bacterial microcosms, we show that multiple predation by protists results in positive bacterial diversity effects on bacterial yields (colony-forming units) possibly due to an increased complementarity and evenness among bacterial species. By mathematically partitioning the biodiversity effects, we demonstrate that competitive interactions in diverse communities are reduced and the growth of subdominant species is enhanced. We envisage that, including diversity gradients at other trophic levels, in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research is a key to understanding and managing ecosystem processes. Such level of manipulation can be achieved best in microbial model systems, which are powerful tools for fundamental hypothesis-driven experiments and the investigation of general ecological theories.

### A function-based typology for earth's ecosystems [^116KYc4E]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Workshop participants initially agreed that three hierarchical levels for ecosystem function and three levels for biotic composition could be sufficient to represent global variation across the whole biosphere. Participants developed the concepts of these levels into formal definitions (Supplementary Table 3.1), which were reviewed and refined during the development process.

To ensure conceptual consistency of the typology and its units throughout the biosphere (principle 3), we drew from community assembly theory to develop a generic model of ecosystem assembly. The traditional community assembly model incorporates three types of filters (dispersal, the abiotic environment and biotic interactions) that determine which biota from a larger pool of potential colonists can occupy and persist in an area. We extended this model to ecosystems by: (1) defining three groups of abiotic filters (resources, ambient environment and disturbance regimes) and two groups of biotic filters (biotic interactions and human activity); (2) incorporating evolutionary processes that shape characteristic biotic properties of ecosystems over time; (3) defining the outcomes of filtering and evolution in terms of all ecosystem properties including both ecosystem-level functions and species-level traits, rather than only in terms of species traits and composition; and (4) incorporating interactions and feedbacks among filters and selection agents and ecosystem properties to elucidate hypotheses about processes that influence temporal and spatial variability in the properties of ecosystems and their component biota. In community assembly, only a small number of filters are likely to be important in any given habitat. In keeping with this proposition, we used the generic model to identify biological and physical features that distinguish functionally different groups of ecosystems from one another by focusing on different ecological drivers that come to the fore in structuring their assembly and shaping their properties.

### Multiple plant diversity components drive consumer communities across ecosystems [^116SW2Jf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here we disentangle the impact of changes in major components of plant diversity on species richness of herbivores, predators, and parasitoids for two different ecosystems. We make use of an extensive data set with 53 plant species and 34,060 individuals of 882 arthropod species of two large-scale biodiversity experiments, one in temperate grasslands, and one in subtropical forests. This comparison can help us to obtain first insights into the extent to which effects of plant diversity might operate in similar ways in contrasting ecosystems. We use path models to analyze the relative contribution of direct and indirect effects of plant taxonomic diversity (species richness), functional diversity and composition, and structural diversity on overall arthropod species richness and the species richness of major trophic groups of arthropods. We quantified functional diversity as the variability among plant species in morphological and chemical leaf traits that were shown previously to affect arthropods. Because plant traits can further influence arthropods via mass-ratio effects, we also tested for the effects of mean trait values on arthropod abundance and species richness. Vertical stratification and horizontal variation of plant height within study plots were used to quantify plant structural diversity. Importantly, we explicitly differentiated between direct and indirect plant diversity effects on arthropod species richness. We considered direct effects as those directly linking plant diversity to arthropod species richness (e.g. because plant diversity-mediated habitat diversity provides more niches that support a higher diversity of arthropods). Because we hypothesized that arthropod species richness is influenced by changes in arthropod abundances (i.e. assuming that species richness is affected via more individuals), we considered effects of plant diversity that modified arthropod abundances as indirect effects on arthropod species richness. Our study therefore provides important insights into the potential mechanisms linking changes in plant communities to consumer diversity via changes in abundances. We also tested the alternative hypothesis of reciprocal interactions between arthropod species richness and abundance, which might be better reflected by residual covariance terms than by a directional pathway in the path models. We show that the combination of plant functional and structural diversity mechanistically explains plant species richness effects on higher trophic levels in both ecosystem types. Although the relative effects of functional and structural diversity on arthropods differed among trophic levels and ecosystems, they operated in many cases via modifying arthropod abundances — indicating a high vulnerability of arthropod diversity to currently observed declines in arthropod numbers.

### Microbiota-nourishing immunity: a guide to understanding our microbial self [^116P6SBf]. Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

In ecological terms, the microbiome is defined as the microbiota and its environment, a definition that encompasses the human host. The size, species composition, and biogeography of microbial communities is shaped by host interactions, and, in turn, the microbiota influences many aspects of human health. Here we discuss the concept of microbiota-nourishing immunity, a host-microbe chimera composed of the microbiota and host factors that shape the microbial ecosystem, which functions in conferring colonization resistance against pathogens. We propose that dysbiosis is a biomarker of a weakening in microbiota-nourishing immunity and that homeostasis can be defined as a state of immune competence. Microbiota-nourishing immunity thus provides a conceptual framework to further examine the mechanisms that preserve a healthy microbiome and the drivers and consequences of dysbiosis.

### Single gene locus changes perturb complex microbial communities as much as apex predator loss [^1135YkQJ]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results show that single-locus changes in genes regulating species' niche construction and motility traits can modify communities to a greater extent than loss of the niche-constructing species itself and to the same extent as the loss of an apex predator. These findings have novel and important implications for our understanding of community dynamics, demonstrating that intraspecific genetic variability at the scale of even a single gene locus can be as important as strong trophic interactions in determining the structure of complex communities. While it is becoming increasingly apparent that intraspecific trait variation can moderate community dynamics (for example, refs,), our findings indicate remarkable scope for fine-scale genetic variability within populations to regulate the structure, dynamics and functioning of whole ecosystems.

Recent studies suggest that shifts in the composition of the human microbiota are of great importance for human disease. These compositional shifts are often caused by changing conditions within the host or invasions into these communities. However, our results suggest that changes in social traits within resident species could be as important as these other known factors in shaping the composition of host microbiota and other communities. We found that communities in which the behaviour of a single species was constrained to constitutive phenotypes differed remarkably in terms of their structure and dynamics from those containing plastic phenotypes that could switch between behaviours. The direct and indirect effects of these shifts in social behaviour then propagated throughout the ecological network in different ways to transform the structure and dynamics of whole communities. Bacterial social traits are often encoded on mobile genetic elements and so may be rapidly lost or acquired by a bacterial population depending on environmental conditions. Developing our understanding of the effects of bacterial niche construction and trait plasticity on community composition may, therefore, prove critical in the development of treatments aimed at manipulating our microbiota.

### Context-dependent dynamics lead to the assembly of functionally distinct microbial communities [^115qxGHh]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The effects of historical contingencies are difficult to isolate and detect in the field, because even adjacent sites can experience distinct environmental conditions. The effects can be difficult to capture in a laboratory as well, because historical contingencies may only affect community assembly when disturbance is low and environmental selection is weak, and these conditions are rarely met when natural communities are moved into laboratory settings. Our study demonstrates that historical contingency strongly influences community assembly in a realistic, but controlled, laboratory environment. Moreover, the effects of historical contingency are persistent and reproducible, suggesting that, with enough information about species' functional capabilities, responses to environmental conditions, and interactions with other species, community assembly dynamics might be predictable.

We find the dynamics of individual ASVs affected key functional measures and were influenced by community context; likely driven by interactions among species within microcosms. For example, priority effects may have played a role, with species that quickly grow to high abundances altering growth conditions for other species. Microcosm communities remained different in richness and in composition, despite an initial shift when assembling in a constant in vitro environment. Surprisingly, strong differences also remained in terms of functional activity and functional dynamics were highly correlated with compositional dynamics in our study. Our results suggest that species across the microcosm communities were not functionally redundant with regard to chitinase activity, a relevant substrate degradation capability in the pitcher plant system. Redundancy in bacterial functional roles has been suggested as an explanation for the high complexity of microbial communities, and as a buffer that increases stability in the face of perturbation. However, important but more "narrow" functional roles, such as the degradation of complex substrates, may often not be redundant. This study highlights how specific and relevant functional measures should be examined more closely in microbial ecology, because a general lack of redundancy in key functions could influence both the carbon flux and the overall stability of an ecosystem.

### Evolutionary diversification in stickleback affects ecosystem functioning [^114adzML]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Explaining the ecological causes of evolutionary diversification is a major focus of biology, but surprisingly little has been said about the effects of evolutionary diversification on ecosystems. The number of species in an ecosystem and their traits are key predictors of many ecosystem-level processes, such as rates of productivity, biomass sequestration and decomposition. Here we demonstrate short-term ecosystem-level effects of adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over the past 10,000 years. These fish have undergone recent parallel diversification in several lakes in coastal British Columbia, resulting in the formation of two specialized species (benthic and limnetic) from a generalist ancestor. Using a mesocosm experiment, we demonstrate that this diversification has strong effects on ecosystems, affecting prey community structure, total primary production, and the nature of dissolved organic materials that regulate the spectral properties of light transmission in the system. However, these ecosystem effects do not simply increase in their relative strength with increasing specialization and species richness; instead, they reflect the complex and indirect consequences of ecosystem engineering by sticklebacks. It is well known that ecological factors influence adaptive radiation. We demonstrate that adaptive radiation, even over short timescales, can have profound effects on ecosystems.

### Extinction risk of soil biota [^111GEWLQ]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

No species lives on earth forever. Knowing when and why species go extinct is crucial for a complete understanding of the consequences of anthropogenic activity, and its impact on ecosystem functioning. Even though soil biota play a key role in maintaining the functioning of ecosystems, the vast majority of existing studies focus on aboveground organisms. Many questions about the fate of belowground organisms remain open, so the combined effort of theorists and applied ecologists is needed in the ongoing development of soil extinction ecology.

### Effect of localization on the stability of mutualistic ecological networks [^11316or7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Ecological networks may be viewed as a set of species (nodes) connected by interspecific interactions (competition, predation, parasitism and mutualism), represented by the links. Even though interaction strengths are largely unknown, the architecture of the ecological interaction networks has been thoroughly investigated, showing its important role in shaping and regulating community dynamics and in structuring diversity patterns. Several studies recognized the strong impact of the non-random structures of empirical interaction networks on both the resilience (time to return to the steady state after a small perturbation) and the persistence (number of coexisting species at equilibrium) of ecological communities, and much theoretical effort has been made to understand the relationship between stability and complexity in ecological communities, one of the most debated issues in ecology. In mutualistic networks, where species beneficially interact with each other, a core–periphery structure has been observed ubiquitously. The network core refers to a central and densely connected set of nodes, while the periphery denotes a sparsely connected non-central set of nodes, which are linked to the core. It has been posited that the architecture of mutualistic networks minimizes competition and increases biodiversity, community stability (resilience) and persistence, but other studies have demonstrated that structured mutualistic ecological networks may be less stable than their random counterparts. It has also been shown that community stability decreases as community size increases, and that this result holds even for more realistic ecological interactions with a mixing of interaction types ('hybrid communities'). Most of the aforementioned studies focused either on the resilience of the system — measured by the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the community matrix — or on the number of species that persist when starting from non-stationary conditions. However, both approaches have important limitations. Indeed, the maximum real part of the community matrix eigenvalues only describes the rate of recovery from perturbations in the long time limit, providing no information on the transient response. Perturbations can grow significantly before decaying, possibly impacting species' fate (Fig. 1a). A system at its stable stationary state that experiences such initial amplifications of the perturbations is called reactive. On the other hand, persistence (measured as the fraction of initial species with positive stationary population density) is strongly sensitive to initial conditions, the system's distance from stationarity and the choice of model and parameters. To garner a better understanding of the effect of perturbations on ecological communities, one should also study how the components of the leading eigenvectors (that is, the right and left eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue having the largest real part) are distributed, that is, study the localization of the system. In condensed matter physics, localization, also known as Anderson localization, is the absence of diffusion of waves in a disordered medium, and it describes the ability of waves to propagate through the system. Other approaches (for example, Markov chain models, or the inverse community matrix) can be used to study how disturbances propagate in species interaction networks and what their effects are on other species (that is, how many other species do they affect and what is the magnitude of this effect). However, it has been shown that small variations in the interaction strengths may lead to very different model predictions. Our theoretical framework may be considered as a complementary methodology to gain information on the general relation patterns between the interaction network architecture and the ability of perturbations to propagate within the system. Our goal in this work is to determine the degree of localization of eigenvectors in mutualistic ecological networks as a function of the network size, structure and interaction strengths, and to study the impact of localization on the perturbation amplitude and spreading within the system. Here we show that localization may be a useful mechanism that impacts on the stability of ecological networks. In fact, localization attenuates (asymptotically) and reduces perturbation propagation through the network. We find that mutualistic ecological networks are indeed localized and localization patterns are correlated with some network topological properties; in particular, heterogeneity in the weighted species degrees promotes localization in the network. Furthermore, the observed localization increases with the size of the ecological communities, highlighting a trade-off between the asymptotic resilience of the system and the attenuation of perturbations.

### An excess of niche differences maximizes ecosystem functioning [^112P1QWe]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Species and assembled communities with the diversity levels used in the experiment.

Here, consistent with recent theoretical advances, we provide empirical evidence that both selection and complementarity are related to a combination of the stabilizing niche differences that promote species diversity and to the average fitness differences that promote competitive exclusion. Despite these complex relationships, we find following our predictions that more stable coexistence promotes higher biomass. This implies that any process that destabilizes coexistence should reduce biomass and in fact it may be reduced even before coexistence is threatened. However, we also detect that extending these findings to functions beyond biomass is not straightforward because they are likely driven by other mechanisms unrelated or poorly related to plant coexistence. These discrepancies call to further develop a framework to link the species differences allowing stable coexistence of several trophic levels to those promoting high levels of different functions. Taken together, our results provide a first step in this direction by showing that the conditions promoting stable coexistence and high ecosystem functioning within a trophic level are the same.

### Clarifying the effect of biodiversity on productivity in natural ecosystems with longitudinal data and methods for causal inference [^112FeKhJ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Our results point to promising areas for future research, including studies that experimentally manipulate rare species and non-native species and seek to identify traits of these species that drive their effects on productivity. For example, in a recent study, researchers experimentally removed non-dominant species from randomly assembled communities and reported an increase in biomass one year after the removal; a result consistent with our results. Extensions of their study can help elucidate the traits of these species that drive their effects on productivity. Our results also imply that any estimated effect of changes in species richness on productivity may not generalize to different spatial or temporal scales, or to other ecosystems, forms of biodiversity, or ecosystem functions. Multiple ecological mechanisms underlie a relationship between richness and productivity (e.g. below-ground competition, niche complementarity), and their strength may vary across places and time depending on which types of species are changing and how (Fig. 4). When the operative mechanisms depend on the version of richness that is changing, ecologists face what has been called "treatment-variation relevance"or "consequential variation of the treatment". In such cases, interpreting and generalizing causal effects is challenging, whether ecologists use experimental or observational designs. The challenge is best met by using large observational datasets that capture the types of species changes that occur in nature and then, using methods like the ones in our study, determine which changes – in terms of which species are changing and how (Fig. 5) – are consequential for the effect of richness on ecosystem function. The results of these observational studies could then guide experimentalists in selecting experimental designs that can help confirm the results from observational studies and elucidate the underlying mechanistic processes.

Most importantly, our study extends prior researchthat highlights the importance of study design in credibly isolating causal relationships in natural ecosystems. Other fields have made important advances in observational analyses — advances that have not yet permeated into ecology and other natural sciences. By demonstrating how to apply these advances to an ecological question and data, our study aims to spur broader adoption of these advances in ecology. Given the challenges of randomizing all the important elements of ecosystems at larger spatial and temporal scales, observational designs like ours that leverage these advances offer important complements to experimental designs in research to elucidate how natural ecosystems function.

### An excess of niche differences maximizes ecosystem functioning [^115y5R7P]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

A large number of experimental and observational studies have shown that more diverse communities have higher levels of multiple ecosystem functions –. At the same time, global change is reducing opportunities for coexistence, and therefore diversity, ultimately reducing a range of ecosystem functions and services. A better understanding of the connections between the processes maintaining biodiversity in communities and those driving functioning would allow us to better predict effects of global change on ecosystem functioning and to optimize restoration efforts. However, links between the conditions necessary for species to coexist and the processes driving high functioning in diverse communities have remained elusive.

Two main effects have been identified as underlying causes of biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships: complementarity effects occur when species, on average, yield more in mixture than in monoculture, and selection effects occur when there is a covariance (positive or negative) between monoculture yield and dominance in mixture. Ecologists have often invoked principles from coexistence theoryto explain these effects. There is a general assumption that complementarity effects are driven by niche differences, which stabilize species coexistence when intraspecific competition exceeds interspecific competition. It is also tempting to assume that selection effects are driven by species competitive abilities or fitness. Surprisingly, empirical support for these connections is currently lacking because studies have not quantified selection and complementarity effects together with the determinants of competitive outcomes (i.e. niche and fitness differences). Both the two biodiversity effects and the two determinants of coexistence can be driven by multiple underlying mechanisms: complementarity and niche differences for instance can be driven by interspecific differences in resource use, the action of specialist natural enemies or facilitation, amongst other processes. While it would be ideal to link all these underlying mechanisms together, i.e. to understand how differences in resource use, natural enemies, facilitation, etc. combine and interact to drive both community assembly and functioning, this will be highly challenging. However, showing how overall biodiversity-functioning and coexistence processes relate to each other under is a first step towards providing a unified view of the conditions needed for stable coexistence and the conditions for high ecosystem functioning.

### Replicating community dynamics reveals how initial composition shapes the functional outcomes of bacterial communities [^115uYXv5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial communities play key roles in global biogeochemical cycles, industry, agriculture, human health, and animal husbandry. There is therefore great interest in understanding bacterial community dynamics so that they can be controlled and engineered to optimise ecosystem services. We assess the reproducibility and predictability of bacterial community dynamics by creating a frozen archive of hundreds of naturally-occurring bacterial communities that we repeatedly revive and track in a standardised, complex resource environment. Replicate communities follow reproducible trajectories and the community dynamics closely map to ecosystem functioning. However, even under standardised conditions, the communities exhibit tipping-points, where small differences in initial community composition create divergent compositional and functional outcomes. The predictability of community trajectories therefore requires detailed knowledge of rugged compositional landscapes where ecosystem properties are not the inevitable result of prevailing environmental conditions but can be tilted toward different outcomes depending on the initial community composition. Our results shed light on the relationship between composition and function, opening new avenues to understand the feasibility and limitations of function prediction in complex microbial communities.

### Community and single cell analyses reveal complex predatory interactions between bacteria in high diversity systems [^1151RqdQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

A fundamental question in community ecology is the role of predator–prey interactions in trophic web stability and species coexistence. This is central to the understanding of how food webs, which are the basis of sustainable life, are maintained. Predatory interactions have profound effects on food webs, among others by promoting diversity and creating trophic cascades that may vary in length and strength, depending on various parameters, e.g. predator size, temperature and else. Inherent properties such as the prey range of a predator, i.e. being a generalist or a specialist, or spatial complexity further strongly affect the type of control, promoting top-down or bottom-up effects –.

In aquatic food webs, protists (which are mostly considered generalists) are essential consumers of bacteria, and along with bacteriophages (mostly specialists) they may be the largest contributors to bacterial mortality and turnover. However, the ecological role of other members of the predatory guild has been much less explored. The Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) are highly motile gram-negative bacteria that obligatorily prey upon other gram-negative cells. They are smaller than their prey, which they mainly consume after penetrating their periplasmic space, to grow as a multi-nucleoid cell which will divide into the flagellated progeny, and exit the remains of the prey. BALOs are ubiquitous in soil and in water bodies and are considered to be "intermediate" versatilists, neither generalists nor specialists. Indeed, isolated BALO strains tested with prey arrays show utilisation ranging from singleto many prey strains. In natural microcosms, specific BALO predators are controlled by the availability of an adequate preyand rapidly respond to prey abundance; in turn, spiking microcosms with a specific BALO revealed that the predator impacted upon the bacterial community structure. Thus, BALOs may constitute a "sideway control" (i.e. neither top-down nor bottom-up) over food webs, affecting bacterial community structure and contributing to community succession.

### An excess of niche differences maximizes ecosystem functioning [^1129xTT8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Our study represents a step forward in evaluating the link between the drivers maintaining diversity and functioning compared to previous experimental work that considered particular components (e.g. interspecific facilitation) or aggregates (e.g. community evenness) of niche and fitness differences. Still our approach to measure community stability is fundamentally based on pairwise interactions between species. The next step is to move beyond this pairwise framework to one in which niche and fitness differences are estimated at the community level, and in which additional factors determining coexistence at the multispecies level such as indirect or higher-order interactions are incorporated. Although recent toolboxes have been proposed, we lack clear expectations about how the mechanisms determining the degree of stability in complex communities are linked to the net effect of biodiversity on functioning. However, incorporating these effects would be important to test if the communities providing high levels of functions like those related to nitrogen cycling are in fact able to stably coexist. Multispecies interactions under a multitrophic perspective may be more important for explaining other functions or functioning in other contexts but our results suggest that, for biomass at least, the conditions promoting stable coexistence for species pairs and high ecosystem functioning are the same.

### Initial community evenness favours functionality under selective stress [^117F2J7Q]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Owing to the present global biodiversity crisis, the biodiversity-stability relationship and the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have become major topics in ecology. Biodiversity is a complex term that includes taxonomic, functional, spatial and temporal aspects of organismic diversity, with species richness (the number of species) and evenness (the relative abundance of species) considered among the most important measures. With few exceptions (see, for example, ref. 6), the majority of studies of biodiversity-functioning and biodiversity-stability theory have predominantly examined richness. Here we show, using microbial microcosms, that initial community evenness is a key factor in preserving the functional stability of an ecosystem. Using experimental manipulations of both richness and initial evenness in microcosms with denitrifying bacterial communities, we found that the stability of the net ecosystem denitrification in the face of salinity stress was strongly influenced by the initial evenness of the community. Therefore, when communities are highly uneven, or there is extreme dominance by one or a few species, their functioning is less resistant to environmental stress. Further unravelling how evenness influences ecosystem processes in natural and humanized environments constitutes a major future conceptual challenge.
