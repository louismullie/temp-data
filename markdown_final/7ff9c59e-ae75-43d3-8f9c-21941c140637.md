## Question

QRs duration normal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a normal QRS duration and how it varies by context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative thresholds from major guidelines and large cohorts. Then, I should verify how these thresholds are applied in different clinical scenarios such as heart failure, tachyarrhythmia diagnosis, and population risk. Next, I will examine prognostic implications and measurement pitfalls. Finally, I will synthesize a practical interpretation framework that reconciles the 110 ms and 120 ms conventions while acknowledging the 130 ms treatment threshold used for CRT decisions [^111C8iMU] [^1126LLfq] [^114PL6en] [^116DgcLa].

> Let me first confirm what the QRS complex represents and why its duration matters. The QRS duration reflects the time required for ventricular depolarization through the His–Purkinje system and working myocardium; normal rapid activation produces a narrow QRS, whereas conduction delay widens it and correlates with adverse outcomes in multiple settings, including increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest and mortality when QRS duration is prolonged, so any definition of "normal" must be tied to both physiology and outcomes.

> Now, I should verify the canonical clinical upper limit of normal. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — definitions vary by purpose. For rhythm interpretation, adult "wide-complex" rhythms are defined at QRS duration ≥ 120 ms (0.12 s), which practically anchors the standard upper bound of normal at < 120 ms in routine clinical use, and this same 120 ms threshold underpins many adult arrhythmia algorithms and emergency care frameworks for wide-complex tachycardia differentiation [^114PL6en] [^116DgcLa].

> But wait, what if we look at the general population rather than arrhythmia taxonomy. I need to check epidemiological cut points. A large Finnish community cohort defined "prolonged QRS" as ≥ 110 ms, with only 1.3% of healthy middle-aged adults exceeding this value; importantly, QRS ≥ 110 ms was associated with higher all-cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic mortality over long-term follow-up, suggesting that 110 ms approximates the upper tail of normal in population risk terms [^1126LLfq].

> Next, I will examine heart failure cohorts because they often set the clinical bar for "prolonged". Let me verify the thresholds used in HF trials and registries. Multiple HF studies and reviews adopt ≥ 120 ms as prolonged QRS, with consistent associations with worse outcomes; in EVEREST, patients hospitalized for HFrEF with QRS ≥ 120 ms had substantially higher all-cause mortality than those with normal QRS over 9.9 months, reinforcing 120 ms as a clinically meaningful risk discriminator in HF populations [^116CXyGM] [^111FGVZ1].

> I should confirm how therapeutic guidance leverages these thresholds. The 2021 ESC HF guideline advises against CRT when QRS is < 130 ms and there is no pacing indication, effectively using 130 ms as a treatment threshold rather than a physiologic definition of normal; this is a key nuance — < 130 ms may be "normal enough" for withholding CRT, but it does not redefine the population or arrhythmia-based upper limit of normal away from 110–120 ms [^111C8iMU].

> Let me consider tachyarrhythmia diagnosis more carefully. Wide-complex tachycardia definitions use ≥ 120 ms as the width criterion, yet QRS duration alone cannot reliably distinguish VT from SVT with aberrancy; moreover, some VTs engaging the His–Purkinje system (e.g., fascicular VT) may present with QRS < 120 ms, so a "normal" QRS does not exclude ventricular origin and mandates full algorithmic evaluation when clinical suspicion is high [^114PL6en] [^111xV4JH].

> I will now examine prognostic correlates across broader cohorts to ensure the thresholds align with risk. Hold on, I should verify convergence of structural and device outcomes. In community data, QRS ≥ 120 ms was linked to a threefold future pacemaker implantation risk, indicating that even in ostensibly healthy individuals, a widened QRS portends progressive conduction system disease; mechanistically, each 10 ms increase in QRS correlates with greater LV mass and volumes on CMR, which may help explain adverse event gradients with longer QRS durations [^115o5dMx] [^111DWwTZ].

> Measurement methodology can confound classification, so I need to ensure we standardize how QRS is obtained and interpreted. Wait, let me verify the extent of automated variability. Automated interval measurements vary by manufacturer and software generation, with systematic differences on the order of 12–26 ms reported historically, and although contemporary algorithms are closer, inter-algorithm dispersion persists; additionally, bedside verbal reports can be unreliable, with nurses correctly identifying wide QRS most of the time but often mismeasuring duration, so manual confirmation on a standardized 12‑lead ECG is prudent when clinical stakes are high [^116GxiB8] [^1151sgGa] [^112zYp2Y].

> But there is another wrinkle: I should review the mismatch between electrical width and mechanical dyssynchrony. Even among HFrEF patients with "normal" QRS ≤ 120 ms, more than half may have LV asynchrony by tissue Doppler, underscoring that QRS duration is an imperfect proxy for mechanical coordination and that device decisions cannot rely on QRS width alone outside guideline-backed indications [^117KbgjP].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought to set a physiologic lower limit of normal near 60 ms based on conduction timing estimates, but I should double‑check whether guidelines or large studies actually define a numeric lower bound. They do not; while conduction physiology explains why extremely short QRS is unusual, authoritative documents largely focus on the upper limit, so I will avoid asserting a specific lower bound without a sourced range and keep the emphasis on the validated upper thresholds for clinical decision-making.

> Pulling this together, let me formulate a context-aware interpretation. For general population screening and epidemiological risk, "normal" can be conservatively framed as QRS < 110 ms given the rarity and risk signal above this mark; in routine clinical practice and arrhythmia interpretation, QRS < 120 ms functions as the standard narrow-complex definition; in HF therapeutics, QRS < 130 ms generally precludes CRT absent pacing needs, whereas 120–149 ms with LBBB warrants consideration and ≥ 150 ms confers the strongest CRT benefit, all while remembering that measurement variability and mechanical-electrical discordance demand clinical correlation and standardized ECG assessment [^1126LLfq] [^114PL6en] [^111C8iMU] [^117KbgjP] [^116GxiB8].

The normal QRS duration in adults is **70–100 ms**; a duration of **≥ 120 ms is abnormal** and indicates intraventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block. QRS duration is measured from the earliest to the latest ventricular depolarization — typically in leads II, V1, or V6 — and is a key marker of ventricular conduction integrity. Prolonged QRS duration is associated with increased mortality [^1126LLfq], heart failure progression, and **arrhythmic risk**, and it guides therapies such as **cardiac resynchronization therapy** [^111C8iMU].

---

## Normal QRS duration

- **Normal range**: 70–100 ms in healthy adults.
- **Upper limit**: 100 ms; 100–120 ms is borderline.
- **Abnormal**: ≥ 120 ms [^116DgcLa] indicates intraventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block [^1126LLfq].

## Measurement of QRS duration

QRS duration is measured from the earliest to the latest ventricular depolarization [^116iwEn2], typically in leads II, V1, or V6. Accurate measurement is essential [^112zYp2Y] for diagnosing **conduction abnormalities** and guiding therapy [^116GxiB8].

---

## Clinical significance of QRS duration

QRS duration reflects ventricular conduction integrity and is a key marker of electrical dyssynchrony [^111C8iMU]. Prolonged QRS duration is associated with increased mortality [^1126LLfq], heart failure progression, and **arrhythmic risk**.

---

## Factors influencing QRS duration

Several factors **influence QRS duration**, including:

- **Age**: QRS duration tends to increase with age.
- **Sex**: Males generally have slightly longer QRS durations than females.
- **Body size**: Larger body size is associated with longer QRS duration [^111DWwTZ].
- **Cardiac structure**: Increased left ventricular mass and volume are associated with longer QRS duration [^111DWwTZ].

---

## Clinical implications of prolonged QRS duration

Prolonged QRS duration (** ≥ 120 ms**) is associated with:

- **Increased mortality**: Higher all-cause and cardiac mortality [^1126LLfq].
- **Heart failure progression**: Worse prognosis and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)**: Patients with prolonged QRS duration, particularly with left bundle branch block (LBBB), benefit significantly from CRT [^111C8iMU] [^1154rYZn].

---

## Clinical implications of shortened QRS duration

Shortened QRS duration (** < 70 ms**) is less common and may indicate:

- Increased conduction velocity (faster ventricular conduction) [^116iwEn2]
- Reduced ventricular mass (smaller ventricular size or mass) [^111DWwTZ]

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of QRS duration in patient management. In **heart failure**, **CRT is recommended** for patients with QRS duration **≥ 130 ms** [^111C8iMU], particularly with LBBB morphology. For **ventricular arrhythmias**, regular assessment of ventricular function is recommended in patients with premature ventricular complex burden > 10% [^114WqsLd] and normal ventricular function.

## Summary table: normal QRS duration

| **Population** | **Normal QRS duration** |
|-|-|
| Adults | 70–100 ms |
| Borderline | 100–120 ms |
| Abnormal | ≥ 120 ms |

The normal QRS duration in adults is **70–100 ms**, with **≥ 120 ms** indicating intraventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block [^116DgcLa]. Prolonged QRS duration is associated with increased mortality [^1126LLfq], heart failure progression, and **arrhythmic risk**, and guides therapies such as **cardiac resynchronization therapy** [^111C8iMU].

### Intraventricular conduction delay in a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram as a predictor of mortality in the general population [^1126LLfq]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Prolonged duration of the QRS complex in a 12-lead ECG is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with cardiac disease, but its significance is not well established in the general population. In particular, there is a paucity of data on the prognostic significance of nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay in apparently healthy subjects.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated the 12-lead ECGs of 10,899 Finnish middle-aged subjects from the general population (52% of whom were men; mean age 44 ± 8.5 years) between 1966 and 1972 and followed them for 30 ± 11 years. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and arrhythmic death. Prolonged QRS duration was defined as QRS ≥ 110 ms and intraventricular conduction delay as QRS ≥ 110 ms without the criteria of complete or incomplete bundle-branch block. QRS duration ≥ 110 ms was present in 1.3% (n = 147) and intraventricular conduction delay in 0.6% (n = 67) of the subjects.

	- Prolonged QRS duration predicted all-cause mortality (multivariate-adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22–1.81; P < 0.001), cardiac mortality (RR 1.94; CI 1.44–2.63; P < 0.001), and sudden arrhythmic death (RR 2.14; CI 1.38–3.33; P = 0.002).

	- Subjects with intraventricular conduction delay had increased all-cause mortality (RR 2.01; CI 1.52–2.66; P < 0.001), increased cardiac mortality (RR 2.53; CI 1.64–3.90; P < 0.001), and an elevated risk of arrhythmic death (RR 3.11; CI 1.74–5.54; P = 0.001).

	- Left bundle-branch block also weakly predicted arrhythmic death (P = 0.04), but right bundle-branch block was not associated.

### Significance of QRS complex duration in patients with heart failure [^116CXyGM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Prolongation of QRS (≥ 120 ms) occurs in 14% to 47% of heart failure (HF) patients. Left bundle branch block is far more common than right bundle branch block. Left-sided intraventricular conduction delay is associated with more advanced myocardial disease, worse left ventricular (LV) function, poorer prognosis, and a higher all-cause mortality rate compared with a narrow QRS complex. It also predisposes heart failure patients to an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, but the incidence of cardiac or sudden death remains unclear because of limited observations. A progressive increase in QRS duration worsens the prognosis.

No electrocardiographic measure is specific enough to provide subgroup risk categorization for excluding or selecting HF patients for prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. In ICD patients with HF, a wide underlying QRS complex more than doubles cardiac mortality compared with a narrow QRS complex. There is a high incidence of an elevated defibrillation threshold at the time of ICD implantation in patients with QRS ≥ 200 ms.

Mechanical LV dyssynchrony, potentially treatable by ventricular resynchronization, occurs in about 70% of HF patients with left-sided intraventricular conduction delay. This fact would explain the lack of therapeutic response in about 30% of patients subjected to ventricular resynchronization according to standard criteria relying on QRS duration. The duration of the basal QRS complex does not reliably predict the clinical response to ventricular resynchronization, and QRS narrowing after therapy is insufficient alone to determine effectiveness.

### Clinical implications of QRS duration in patients hospitalized with worsening heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^111FGVZ1]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Hospitalization for heart failure is associated with high post-discharge mortality and morbidity. The predictive value of the QRS duration during admission for heart failure has not been well studied. This study investigates the predictive value of the QRS duration in patients hospitalized for heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

The study involved a retrospective, post hoc analysis from the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST), which is an event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants included patients hospitalized for heart failure with an LVEF of 40% or less. A total of 4133 patients were enrolled at 359 North American, South American, and European sites between October 7, 2003, and February 3, 2006. After excluding 1029 patients with a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or both at enrollment, and 142 patients without a reported baseline QRS duration, 2962 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 1641 had a normal QRS duration, and 1321 had a prolonged QRS duration (≥ 120 ms).

The main outcome measures were dual primary end points, including all-cause mortality and the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

During a median follow-up of 9.9 months, all-cause mortality was 18.7% for patients with a normal baseline QRS duration and 28.1% for patients with a prolonged baseline QRS duration (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–1.87). The composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was also analyzed.

### Spatiotemporal characteristics of QRS complexes enable the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome regardless of the appearance of a type 1 ECG [^111LNANG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome based on the ECG is hampered by the dynamic nature of its ECG manifestations. Brugada syndrome patients are only 25% likely to present a type 1 ECG. The objective of this study is to provide an ECG diagnostic criterion for Brugada syndrome patients that can be applied consistently even in the absence of a type 1 ECG.

- **Methods and results**: We recorded 67-lead body surface potential maps from 94 Brugada syndrome patients and 82 controls (including right bundle branch block patients and healthy individuals). The spatial propagation direction during the last r' wave and the slope at the end of the QRS complex were measured and compared between patient groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed for half of the database to identify optimal cutoff values; sensitivity and specificity for these cutoff values were measured in the other half of the database. A spontaneous type 1 ECG was present in only 30% of BrS patients. An orientation in the sagittal plane < 101º during the last r' wave and a descending slope < 9.65 mV/s enables the diagnosis of the syndrome with a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 97% in non-type 1 Brugada syndrome patients.

- **Conclusion**: Spatiotemporal characteristics of surface ECG recordings can enable a robust identification of BrS even without the presence of a type 1 ECG.

### Citalopram, QTc interval prolongation, and torsade de pointes. How should we apply the recent FDA ruling [^1173zShR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, both the manufacturer of citalopram and the US Food and Drug Administration have warned health care providers and patients about new information implicating drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes when using citalopram in doses > 40 mg/day. This warning is not placed in the context of either benefits or risks in real-world clinical practice, leaving clinicians with an untenable choice between depriving patients of high-dose citalopram or malpractice litigation.

We reviewed the literature and found no cases of citalopram-induced sudden cardiac death among patients taking up to 60 mg/day of citalopram and free of risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. Because psychotropic drug-induced sudden cardiac death is an outlier in the absence of identified risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes, we do not believe Phase 3 and Phase 4 studies provide sufficient information to limit prescribing practices for citalopram (20 mg to 60 mg/day).

We urge drug manufacturers and regulatory agencies to periodically publish full case reports of psychotropic drug-induced QTc interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death so that clinicians and investigators may better understand the clinical implications of prescribing such drugs as citalopram.

### Depolarization versus repolarization abnormality underlying inferolateral J-wave syndromes: New concepts in sudden cardiac death with apparently normal hearts [^114PguPP]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of early repolarization/inferolateral J-wave syndrome is guided by expert consensus recommendations, which distinguish between an early repolarization ECG pattern (ER) and an early repolarization syndrome. The ER pattern is defined by the presence of J-point elevation ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous inferior and/or lateral leads of a standard 12-lead ECG. The syndrome is considered present when the pattern is found in (1) a patient who has been resuscitated from otherwise unexplained ventricular fibrillation (VF) or (2) a sudden cardiac death (SCD) victim with a negative autopsy and medical chart review, as well as a previous ECG. The J-point elevation can appear as either a notch or a slur, with or without elevation of the ST segment.

The definition of a J wave can be ambiguous due to the small amplitude and spontaneous changes of the signal. J/ST elevation in inferior leads is often more difficult to detect, as the pattern is less stereotypical than in Brugada syndrome (BrS). Bipolar limb leads (I, III, aVF) may be less sensitive than unipolar precordial leads in identifying discrete J/ST-segment abnormalities and in assessing the spatial extent of the J wave. Although not previously emphasized, a J wave may also be negative and less apparent when it follows a negative QRS complex. Figure 1A illustrates these ECG variations.

- **ECG variations in inferolateral J waves**:
	- Left: Valsalva or strong inspiration maneuver producing J-wave amplification. Middle: Cycle length prolongation associated with either unchanged pattern or amplification. Right: Negative J waves in inferior leads and positive J waves in lateral leads.

### Prognostic significance of corrected QT and corrected JT interval for incident coronary heart disease in a general population sample stratified by presence or absence of wide QRS complex: The ARIC study with 13 years of follow-up [^114fCfjr]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) is the traditional method for assessing the duration of repolarization. A prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval is associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and the general population. However, the QTc is typically not evaluated when QRS duration is ≥ 120 ms, as increased QRS duration (QRSd) contributes to QT interval prolongation. In such circumstances, the JT interval has been proposed as a more valid way to assess ventricular repolarization.

- **Methods and results**: To allow for variation in heart rate, the corrected JT interval (JTc) was defined as QTc-QRSd. Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, JTc and QTc were compared for their prognostic associations with incident CHD events among 14,696 men and women who were CHD-free at baseline with either normal conduction or a wide QRS complex. Among individuals with normal QRS duration, logistic regression adjusted for age, hypertensive status, diabetes, race, systolic blood pressure, smoking, HDL and LDL cholesterol, R-R interval, and menopausal status in women showed that QTc and JTc were nonpredictive of future coronary events in men but significant in women. In individuals with a wide QRS complex (QRSd ≥ 120 ms), similar analyses showed that JTc had a significant prognostic advantage over QTc in men but not in women, among whom only 11 events occurred.

- **Conclusions**: The JTc is a simple measurement and a significant independent predictor of incident CHD events in men with a wide QRS complex.

### Prolonged tpeak-to-tend interval on the resting ECG is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death [^111MGbE8]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Early studies indicate that prolongation of the interval between the peak and the end of the T wave (Tpeak to Tend [TpTe]) on the 12-lead ECG is a marker of ventricular arrhythmogenesis. However, community-based studies have not been conducted.

- **Methods and results**: TpTe and other ECG predictors were evaluated in the ongoing Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study based in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area using a case-control design. Cases of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (n = 353; mean age, 66.6 years; 95% CI, 65.1 to 68.1 years; 67% men) were compared with living controls with coronary artery disease (n = 342; mean age, 64.7 years; 95% CI, 63.4 to 66.0 years; 69% men) from the same region. Analysis of TpTe and selected ECG intervals was limited to sinus rhythm 12-lead ECGs. For cases, these were obtained before and unrelated to SCD. Independent-samples t-tests and multiple logistic regression were used. Mean TpTe was significantly greater in cases (89.4 ms; 95% CI, 87.7 to 91.2 ms; P < 0.0001) than in controls (76.1 ms; 95% CI, 74.8 to 77.4 ms). The other ECG intervals (corrected QT interval [QTc], QRS duration [QRSD], and TpTe/QT ratio) also were significantly prolonged among cases versus controls (P ≤ 0.01). TpTe remained a significant predictor of SCD after adjusting for age, sex, QTc, QRSD, and left ventricular function. Odds of SCD increased more with a 1-SD increase in TpTe (12 ms) among subjects with prolonged QRSD (odds ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.06 to 5.91) than with a 1-SD increase in TpTe among subjects with normal QRSD (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.65).

### Electrocardiographic imaging of repolarization abnormalities [^113pdTG5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We have demonstrated that ECGI is highly applicable for mapping potentially critical repolarization abnormalities, including the prolongation or abbreviation of global repolarization and its dispersion, the location of abnormal repolarization regions, and the presence of local gradients. This noninvasive approach can be applied to quantifying abnormal repolarization-based substrates in patients to help in diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy evaluation.

### Electrocardiograms (ECGs) in phase I anticancer drug development: The MD Anderson Cancer Center experience with 8518 ECGs [^111BQ4J7]. Annals of Oncology (2012). High credibility.

Cardiac sequelae from oncologic drugs are important in early cancer drug development. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) by noncardiac drugs is the most common cause of drug development delays, non-approvals, and post-marketing withdrawals by the US Food and Drug Administration.

- **Patients and methods**: We analyzed 8518 electrocardiograms (ECGs) in 525 consecutive cancer patients enrolled in 22 industry-sponsored phase I clinical trials, starting 1 January 2006.

- **Results**: Seventy-four patients [14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11% to 17%] with normal QTc at baseline had QTc intervals above the upper limit of normal after treatment initiation; 33 (6%, 95% CI 4% to 9%) had prolonged QTc intervals at baseline, and only one (3%, 95% CI 0% to 16%) worsened after dosing. Seven of 33 patients (21%, 95% CI 9% to 39%) with prolonged baseline QTc had normalization of QTc intervals after dosing. All QTc prolongations were clinically insignificant; study drugs were continued uneventfully. Two of 525 patients (0.4%, 95% CI 0% to 1%) experienced cardiac serious adverse events (myocardial infarction possibly related to the drug and unstable atrial flutter related to metastatic disease). Both cardiac events were detected by clinical assessment, not surveillance ECGs.

- **Conclusion**: Frequent ECG monitoring provided no clinically significant information in 525 patients in early phase trials.

### Congenital long-QT syndromes: a clinical and genetic update from infancy through adulthood [^112n1Lfj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Long-QT syndromes (LQTSs) have been described in all ages and are a significant cause of cardiovascular mortality, especially in structurally normal hearts. Abnormalities in transmembrane ion conduction channels and structural proteins produce these clinical syndromes, labeled LQT1-LQT12. However, genotype-positive patients still represent only about 70% of LQTSs. Future research will determine the etiology of the remaining cases, further risk-stratify the known genetic defects, improve treatment options for these syndromes, and uncover novel therapies.

### Electrocardiographic implications of the prolonged QT interval [^111hKNxn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The QT interval measures the time from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Prolongation of the QT interval may lead to malignant ventricular tachydysrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. Causes of QT prolongation include congenital abnormalities of the sodium or potassium channel, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications; idiopathic causes have also been identified. Patients can be asymptomatic or present with syncope, palpitations, seizure-like activity, or sudden cardiac death. Management involves looking for and treating reversible causes. For patients with congenital or idiopathic QT interval prolongation, the use of beta-blockers can be considered. Certain subsets of patients benefit from implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. Clinicians must remain vigilant for QT interval prolongation when interpreting electrocardiograms, especially in patients presenting with syncope or ventricular arrhythmias.

### Sequence variants with large effects on cardiac electrophysiology and disease [^116iwEn2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a summation of electrical activity in the heart during ventricular depolarization. It represents electrical activation of the left and right ventricles, propagated through the specialized conduction system, which includes the His bundle, right and left bundle branches, and the Purkinje network. Normal ventricular depolarization is a rapid process activating different ventricular myocardial segments in a precise temporal sequence, resulting in a narrow QRS complex with a characteristic pattern on the 12-lead ECG. Deviation from the norm has been associated with sudden cardiac arrest due to prolonged ventricular activation time and increased mortality in the general population due to prolonged QRS duration and low QRS voltage among individuals free of cardiovascular disease.

### Relation of QRS width in healthy persons to risk of future permanent pacemaker implantation [^115o5dMx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, prolongation of the QRS interval on electrocardiography identifies patients at risk for needing permanent pacemaker implantation. However, the implications of prolonged QRS intervals in healthy subjects are unclear, especially given that the QRS prolongation encountered in this setting is typically mild.

The aim of this study was to assess the relation between QRS duration and incident pacemaker implantation in a community-based cohort of 8,311 subjects (mean age 54 years, 55% women) who attended 17,731 routine examinations with resting 12-lead electrocardiography. QRS duration was analyzed as a continuous and a categorical variable (i.e. ≥ 120 ms).

During up to 35 years of follow-up, 157 participants (56 women) developed a need for permanent pacemakers. In multivariable Cox regression models adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and previous myocardial infarction or heart failure, mild QRS prolongation was associated with a threefold risk for pacemaker implantation (adjusted hazard ratio 2.90, 95% confidence interval 1.81 to 4.66, p < 0.01).

In conclusion, subjects with prolonged QRS intervals face a significantly increased risk of requiring permanent pacemakers, highlighting the importance of monitoring QRS duration in clinical assessments.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring [^117Tp9ot]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Reference interval

The reference intervals, LLN and ULN, of the healthy subset are shown with their 90% CIs. For LLN, there was only a limited difference across different QT correction formulae, and sex did not seem to affect the LLN value. For the ULN, there was, as expected, a difference between males and females. Bazett had the highest ULN values in both sexes, up to 472 ms for men and 482 ms for women. The QT correction formulae with the best rate adaptation, Fridericia and Framingham, produced a ULN similar to clinical values.

The number of patients with a QTc below LLN was limited: from 5 patients (0.07%) for QTcFri and QTcH to 12 patients (0.18%) using QTcFra. The correction formulae with a more negative slope identified more patients as having a short QTc, using QTcB 14 patients (0.21%) and for QTcR 26 patients (0.39%). The proportion of patients with a QTc higher than the ULN is provided.

Mortality analysis

In total, 0.9% of the patients died at 30 days and 4.0% at 1 year. The 30-day mortality did not differ significantly based on contact type (emergency department, ambulatory, or hospitalized; P = 0.224). However, 1-year mortality was more frequent (P < 0.001) among patients with QTc > ULN. There were no deaths occurring in patients with a QTc < LLN.

### Wide-complex tachycardia: Beyond the traditional differential diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia vs supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction [^114PL6en]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Wide-complex tachycardia (WCT) is defined as a rhythm disturbance with a rate greater than 100 beats/min and a QRS complex duration of 0.12 seconds or more in adult patients; in pediatric patients, both the rate and QRS complex width are age-related. In evaluating this type of tachycardia, there are two broad categories usually discussed in the medical literature: ventricular and supraventricular with aberrant intraventricular conduction. There are several other important causes of WCT encountered in clinical practice, which are less often discussed. These tachycardias often require specific therapies differing from the standard approach to WCT. These tachycardias are diverse; as such, the pathophysiology behind each form of WCT includes toxic, metabolic, and conduction system dysfunction mechanisms.

### Subepicardial cardiomyopathy: A disease underlying J-wave syndromes and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation [^117JMsuL]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Some arrhythmia syndromes appear to occur in the absence of overt structural abnormalities. The long QT syndrome is one such example. The now well-defined pathophysiological basis of long QT syndrome and associated arrhythmias in the absence of structural myocardial abnormalities characterizes the syndrome as a dominant (if not 100% genetic) ion channel disease, a channelopathy. Various other channelopathies have been described, including Brugada syndrome (BrS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and short QT syndrome.

BrS, a leading cause of autopsy-negative sudden death, is defined by coved J-point (ST-segment) elevation in the right precordial leads in association with ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the absence of structural abnormalities. J-point elevation is also a requisite feature of the early repolarization syndrome (ERS), which refers to the finding of early repolarization pattern in patients with idiopathic VF (iVF). BrS and ERS therefore constitute a continuous spectrum of J-wave phenotypic expression in the ECG and thus have been designated J-wave syndromes. Other clinical entities can mimic the electrocardiographic pattern observed in BrS, but are etiologically distinct and elicited by other factors, such as myocardial ischemia, metabolic abnormalities, or mechanical compression. Early repolarization pattern is also more commonly observed in competitive athletes compared with the general population. In the absence of an overt electrical or structural phenotype, iVF exists as a diagnosis of exclusion, referring to the occurrence of VF without a known cause.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: Long QT syndrome [^115w1Pob]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Long QT syndrome is a cardiac disorder caused by an abnormal prolongation of the ventricular repolarization phase. The primary concern in this syndrome is the propensity towards polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. This article presents several cases, highlighting the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of this disorder.

### Relationship of QRS duration at baseline and changes over 60 min after fibrinolysis to 30-day mortality with different locations of ST elevation myocardial infarction: Results from the Hirulog and Early Reperfusion or Occlusion-2 trial [^116198qP]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to discern if the prognostic significance of QRS prolongation varies according to the location of ST elevation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The design involved measuring QRS duration in patients with normal conduction or right bundle branch block (RBBB). This was part of the HERO-2 trial, which prospectively collected electrocardiograms at randomization and 60 minutes after fibrinolytic therapy. The patient cohort consisted of 12,456 individuals with normal conduction at both time points and 510 individuals with RBBB at both time points.

The main outcome measure was 30-day mortality. Results indicated that on the baseline ECG, there was a positive association between QRS duration and 30-day mortality for patients with anterior AMI (p < 0.0001 for those with normal conduction and p = 0.007 for those with RBBB), but not for those with inferior AMI (p = 0.29 and p = 0.32, respectively). For anterior AMI, an increase of 20 ms in QRS duration predicted a significant 30–40% relative increase in 30-day mortality, both before and after adjusting for clinical and ECG variables, including baseline ST elevation and the presence of Q waves. This association was absent in inferior AMI. Changes in QRS duration over 60 minutes following fibrinolytic therapy were uncommon and unrelated to mortality.

In conclusion, baseline QRS duration independently stratifies 30-day mortality in patients with anterior AMI, even in the absence of RBBB, but does not stratify mortality risk for patients with inferior AMI.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring [^116umLMW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Drug safety precautions recommend monitoring of the corrected interval. To determine which correction formula to use in an automated-monitoring algorithm in our electronic medical record, we studied rate correction performance of different correction formulae and their impact on risk assessment for mortality.

- **Methods and results**: All electrocardiograms in patients over 18 years with sinus rhythm, normal duration, and heart rate less than 90 beats per minute (bpm) in the University Hospitals of Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) during a 2-month period were included. Correction was performed using Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, Hodges, and Rautaharju formulae. In total, 6609 patients were included (age 59.8 ± 16.2 years; 53.6% male, heart rate 68.8 ± 10.6 bpm). Optimal rate correction was observed using Fridericia and Framingham; Bazett performed worst. A healthy subset showed 99% upper limits of normal for Bazett above clinical standards: men 472 ms (95%, 464–478 ms) and women 482 ms (95%, 474–490 ms). Multivariate Cox regression, including age, heart rate, and prolonged corrected interval, identified Framingham (hazard ratio, 7.31; 95%, 4.10–13.05) and Fridericia (hazard ratio, 5.95; 95%, 3.34–10.60) as significantly better predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality than Bazett (hazard ratio, 4.49; 95%, 2.31–8.74). In a point-prevalence study with haloperidol, the number of patients classified to be at risk for possibly harmful prolongation could be reduced by 50% using optimal rate correction.

- **Conclusions**: Fridericia and Framingham correction formulae showed the best rate correction and significantly improved prediction of 30-day all-cause mortality.

### A systematic review on the utility of non-invasive electrophysiological assessment in evaluating for intra uterine growth restriction [^111hDa4p]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

- **QRS duration**: The following studies demonstrated significantly shortened QRS durations in fetuses with IUGR compared to AGA fetuses. Both Brambati et al. and Pardi et al. demonstrated that 96.2% and 81.5% of IUGR fetuses, respectively, had a QRS duration less than 2SD below the normal values for gestation. Van Leeuwen et al. mirrored these findings in male fetuses only in their MCG study. In contrast, Grimm et al. paradoxically demonstrated a significantly longer QRS duration in the IUGR group compared to the AGA group. Velayo et al. and Bolin et al. demonstrated no discriminative ability for the QRS duration in differentiating IUGR from AGA.

In summary, the utility of the QRS duration remains equivocal in differentiating IUGR from AGA fetuses.

- **QT interval**: Utilizing NIFECG, Velayo et al. showed a significant discriminative ability for the QT interval in distinguishing between IUGR and AGA fetuses. Utilizing a QT value of ≤ 267.99 provided a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 10%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 40.0%.

Van Leeuwen et al. and Grimm et al. did not demonstrate any discriminative ability for the QT interval utilizing MCG. As such, the utility of the QT interval remains equivocal in differentiating IUGR fetuses.

- **T/QRS ratio**: Fuchs et al, utilizing NIFECG, demonstrated the utility of the T/QRS ratio in evaluating IUGR. Through multivariate regression analysis, they demonstrated the utility of maximum, and the difference between maximum and minimum T/QRS values, in differentiating between IUGR fetuses with normal and abnormal cerebroplacental ratio.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^111xV4JH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The characteristic QRS duration in ventricular tachycardia (VT) primarily results from the inefficient cardiomyocyte-to-cardiomyocyte conduction for depolarizing the ventricular myocardium. Consequently, VT is often associated with longer QRS durations compared to supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT). This differentiation was initially verified by Wellens and colleagues and led to the proposal of specific QRS duration cutoffs for diagnosing VT: QRS > 140 ms for wide complex tachycardias (WCTs) exhibiting a right bundle branch block pattern, and QRS > 160 ms for those with a left bundle branch block pattern.

However, due to the broad and overlapping QRS duration ranges of VT and SWCT, using QRS duration cutoffs alone to differentiate WCTs is inadequate. A significant proportion of SWCTs show QRS durations exceeding 160 ms, particularly in patients with factors such as ongoing antiarrhythmic drug use, electrolyte imbalances, severe conduction delays, or underlying structural heart conditions and cardiomyopathies. Conversely, idiopathic VT variants or VTs originating from or swiftly engaging the His-Purkinje system may present with QRS durations less than 140 ms. In exceptional cases, VTs can exhibit substantial impulse propagation within the conduction system, resulting in QRS durations below 120 ms, as seen in fascicular VT, which does not meet the technical definition of WCT (i.e. heart rate ≥ 100 beats per minute and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms).

### Update on long QT syndrome [^115D9nga]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder characterized by a prolonged QT interval in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and an increased risk of malignant arrhythmias in patients with a structurally normal heart. Since its first description in the 1950s, advances in molecular genetics have greatly improved our understanding of the cause and mechanisms of this disease. Sixteen genes linked to LQTS have been described, and genetic testing has become an integral part of the diagnosis and risk stratification of the condition. This article provides an updated review of the genetic basis, diagnosis, and clinical management of LQTS.

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

- **Objective**: To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

- **Study selection**: We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which six were included in the analysis.

- **Data extraction**: Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

- **Data synthesis**: Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic due to the lack of standardization and data on the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed.

### Which Qt correction formulae to use for Qt monitoring [^113zR1WA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is a measure of the duration of ventricular repolarization. It approximates the time interval between the start of depolarization and the end of repolarization of the ventricular myocardium. QT prolongation is associated with a risk for cardiac arrhythmias, given that it can result in early after depolarizations, provoke Torsades de Pointes, and lead to ventricular fibrillation, causing sudden cardiac death. The risk assessment for QT prolongation of in-hospital patients is based on their medication profile, demographic risk factors, electrolyte disturbances, and monitoring of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. Large population studies have shown a relation between QTc and all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and sudden cardiac death.

For correct interpretation, the QT interval should undergo adequate rate correction (QTc) to compare measurements at different time points and at different heart rates. To perform optimal risk stratification, this rate correction has to be reliable. The clinical standard is the most widely used Bazett formula, but with this formula, there is a known overcorrection at high heart rates and undercorrection at lower heart rates.

In developing an automated patient-specific drug safety algorithm applicable in the electronic medical record, QTc together with clinical, biochemical, and pharmacological risk factors should be included. We aimed to determine which QT correction formula would be the best to use in such an automated algorithm. We first compared the heart rate correction performance.

### Dynamic analysis of the QT interval in long QT1 syndrome patients with a normal phenotype [^112k1t74]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

In families with the long QT syndrome, penetrance may be low, with up to 70% of gene carriers having a normal QTc interval. These patients require therapy similar to those with longer QTc intervals; however, identifying them using molecular analysis is challenging on a large scale. A large French family affected by the long QT1 syndrome was followed over a 25-year period. In adult males, but not in females, the QTc interval normalized after puberty. We aimed to find clinical criteria based on ambulatory ECG recordings to improve diagnosis in affected members with a normal QTc interval.

- **Methods and results**: Linkage analysis and direct sequencing indicated the long QT1 gene in our family. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated abnormal transcripts in lymphocytes from silent gene carriers. The functional profile of mutated protein isoforms was investigated using the patch-clamp technique. Dynamic analysis of ventricular depolarization was conducted using Holter recordings in patients and sex- and age-matched controls. Circadian variations of the QTc interval and the QT/RR relationship were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were evaluated for the proposed clinical criteria. We found that dynamic analysis of the QT interval permitted individual diagnosis in mutation carriers even when the QTc interval was normal (adult males).

- **Conclusion**: Dynamic analysis of the QT interval is of diagnostic value in the long QT1 syndrome in patients with a normal phenotype. Clinical implications include improvements in diagnosis for affected individuals.

### Is nurse interpretation of the ECG QRS width reliable [^112zYp2Y]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) data are critical in formulating management strategies following sodium channel antagonist overdose. Poison centers frequently rely on verbal reports of the ECG obtained from bedside nurses. No previous study has addressed the quality of ECG data obtained in this manner. Therefore, we sought to test the ability of nurses to recognize and measure a widened QRS complex, the hallmark of myocardial sodium channel toxicity.

Thirty-six emergency department and critical care nurses employed at a tertiary care hospital participated in this prospective study. The study subjects were divided into three groups and asked to interpret 12 ECGs (five normal and seven wide QRS). For each ECG, participants were required to determine if the QRS was narrow or wide and measure the QRS duration.

The groups differed in the delivery of instruction regarding QRS measurement:

- **Visual instructions**: Received by Group 1.
- **Scripted verbal instructions**: Received by Group 2.
- **No specific instructions**: Served as controls for Group 3.

The nurse data was compared with physician interpretation (consensus of three physicians). Between-group analysis tested for the impact of potential real-time educational intervention.

Overall, the nurses identified a wide QRS complex most of the time (77%) but had difficulty in accurately measuring the QRS duration (44%). Real-time visual or verbal instruction did not improve accuracy (p = NS between groups). The results suggest that verbal ECG data from nurse callers is not sufficient to make an accurate clinical assessment in the setting of sodium channel antagonist overdose.

### Inaccurate electrocardiographic interpretation of long QT: The majority of physicians cannot recognize a long QT when they see one [^111G6GUc]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Physicians across various fields of medicine may encounter patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS). It is crucial to identify the percentage of physicians capable of distinguishing between normal and prolonged QT intervals, as untreated LQTS can be lethal.

- **Objectives**: The study aimed to quantify the percentage of physicians in different medical disciplines who can accurately recognize a long QT interval.

- **Methods**: ECGs from two patients with LQTS and two healthy females were presented to 902 physicians, including 25 world-renowned QT experts, 106 arrhythmia specialists, 329 cardiologists, and 442 noncardiologists from 12 countries. Participants were asked to measure the QT, calculate the QTc (the QT interval corrected for heart rate), and determine whether the QT was normal or prolonged.

- **Results**: For patients with LQTS, over 80% of arrhythmia experts, but fewer than 50% of cardiologists and fewer than 40% of noncardiologists, correctly calculated the QTc. Common issues included underestimation of the QTc in LQTS patients and overestimation in healthy patients. Interobserver agreement was excellent among QT experts, moderate among arrhythmia experts, and low among cardiologists and noncardiologists, with kappa coefficients of 0.82, 0.44, and less than 0.3, respectively. Correct classification of QT intervals as either "long" or "normal" was achieved by 96% of QT experts and 62% of arrhythmia experts, but by fewer than 25% of cardiologists and noncardiologists.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of physicians, including many cardiologists, are unable to accurately calculate a QTc and classify QT intervals correctly.

### QTc: How long is too long [^116pvpXX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) affects an estimated 1 in 2500 people and typically presents with syncope, seizures, or sudden death. A scenario where an individual exhibits marked prolongation of the QT interval with a QTc exceeding 500 ms, particularly after being externally defibrillated from torsades de pointes while swimming, presents no diagnostic challenge regarding the unequivocal probability of LQTS. However, the certainty is considerably less for an otherwise asymptomatic person who has a QTc value considered "borderline" (QTc ≥ 440 ms). Although a normal QT interval imparts a much lower risk of life-threatening events, it does not preclude a patient from potentially harboring a lethal LQTS-causing genetic mutation. Genetic testing therefore has significant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.

However, the 12-lead ECG remains the universal initial diagnostic test in the evaluation of LQTS, despite being subject to miscalculation, misinterpretation, and mishandling. This review discusses the components of accurate QTc measurement and diagnosis, re-examines known factors affecting QT interval measurement, and clarifies recommendations regarding the diagnosis of "borderline" QT interval prolongation. Recommendations for athletes with LQTS are also summarized.

### A systematic review of cardiac time intervals utilising non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram in normal fetuses [^114WmWfx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

In this context, the available evidence does not seem to demonstrate a significant role for utilising the PR interval in screening for fetal hypoxia. Taking the technological limitations into account, however, further research utilising NIFECG would possibly clarify its role in CTI analysis.

From a technical point of view, the widening of the signal due to the averaging of the beats will not impact PR measurement since the ratio of PR and RR is considered rather than an absolute measurement. However, if CIs or RIs are being used, the averaging window needs to be carefully considered. For CIs and RIs, since a correlation is calculated every 2 and 10 seconds respectively, the signal averaging window should not exceed those values.

- **QRS duration**: The QRS duration is a measure of the QRS complex and correlates with the time taken for ventricular depolarisation. The QRS duration is longer in males in contrast to females and is directly correlated with ventricular mass and advancing gestation. These findings were mirrored in studies by Chia et al. and Taylor et al. (2003). There have been suggestions of its utilisation as a surrogate marker for fetal growth and the diagnosis of fetal growth restriction. Pardi et al. suggested that serial measurements would provide a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 93% in detecting growth restriction if performed serially. Brambati et al. also investigated its utility in women with haemolytic disease of the newborn and noted its ability to discern between fetuses with worsening prognosticating based on a QRS duration greater than four standard deviations.

### The QT interval [^116kT5dg]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The effects of disease states and therapeutic drugs on the QT interval have been extensively studied to understand the relationship between QT and the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. Differences in heart rate correction methods, electrocardiogram lead placement, and other internal (e.g. genetic, physiological) and external (e.g. food, time of day) factors have confounded this relationship's interpretation. A comprehensive review of the epidemiologic literature suggests that the corrected QT interval (QTc) is an important but imprecise marker of cardiovascular disease.

The association between QTc prolongation and mortality is identified in patients with cardiac disease but remains unclear in patients without cardiac disease. Drug-related prolongation of QTc can increase the risk of torsade de pointes, yet this arrhythmia is rarely associated with a QTc of less than 500 ms. Noncardiac drugs associated with QTc prolongation differ in their proarrhythmic capacities, with increased exposure via clinically significant drug interactions being a major contributor to the liability of noncardiac drug-induced arrhythmia. Recognizing the aforementioned variables, along with careful QTc measurements, assists in establishing a more precise benefit-risk ratio for specific drug therapies or for arrhythmia risk associated with various pathophysiologic or genetic states.

### The efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency of integrated QTc assessment: Rationalizing approaches to new drug modalities [^114xkBQ4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Low credibility.

After nearly three decades of regulatory activity concerning new drugs' potential for delayed cardiac repolarization, an integrated risk assessment paradigm for small molecule drugs has been established. Regulatory guidance also suggests that for large, targeted proteins and monoclonal antibodies, no quantitative clinical QTc assessment is necessary. The expansion of new drug modalities prompts the question: "Should these new modalities be treated like small molecule drugs or like monoclonal antibodies?"

### Determination and interpretation of the QT interval [^111dnWQH]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is associated with potentially fatal arrhythmias, and while treatment is very effective, its diagnosis can be challenging. Importantly, different methods are used to assess the QT interval, complicating recognition. QT experts advocate manual measurements with the tangent or threshold method; however, differences between these methods and their performance in LQTS diagnosis have not been established. Our study aimed to assess similarities and differences between these two methods for QT interval analysis to aid in accurate QT assessment for LQTS.

- **Methods**: Patients with a confirmed pathogenic variant in the KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2), or SCN5A (LQT3) genes and their family members were included. Genotype-positive patients were identified as LQTS cases, while genotype-negative family members served as controls. ECGs were analyzed with both methods, providing inter- and intrareader validity and diagnostic accuracy. Cutoff values based on the control population's 95th and 99th percentiles, and LQTS patients' 1st and 5th percentiles, were established based on the method to correct for heart rate, age, and sex.

- **Results**: We included 1,484 individuals from 265 families, aged 33 ± 21 years, with 55% being female. In the total cohort, the QT Tangent was 10.4 ms shorter compared with the QT Threshold (95% limits of agreement ± 20.5 ms, P0.96), demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy.

### Evaluation and management of cardiac safety using the electrocardiogram in oncology clinical trials: Focus on cardiac repolarization (QTc interval) [^113NPQTL]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Non-antiarrhythmic drugs have been reported to prolong the QTc interval and induce potentially fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. An increasing number of drugs used for treating malignancies are no exception. Therefore, oncologists and regulators expect sponsors of oncology drugs to evaluate their effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG), particularly on the QTc interval, during drug development.

For agents that cannot be administered to healthy volunteers, the primary approach is to perform an intense ECG evaluation, employing robust ECG recordings during early-phase clinical trials. This includes characterizing the concentration-QTc interval relationship and following up with appropriate intensity of ECG monitoring in the later phases of development. This article describes the broad principles of these approaches, including recommendations for exclusion criteria relative to baseline QTc interval and cardiac comorbidity. It further outlines methods for conducting ECG monitoring and proposes a scheme for managing any QTc-related effects that may emerge.

### QT interval prolongation and the risk of malignant ventricular dysrhythmia and/or cardiac arrest: Systematic search and narrative review of risk related to the magnitude of QT interval length [^1176FvBn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated with an increased risk of malignant ventricular dysrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), and sudden cardiac death. The quantifiable risk rates of adverse dysrhythmic outcomes in relation to specific QTc interval lengths are not known. We conducted a literature review on the topic of QT interval prolongation in adult patients and the associated risk of malignant dysrhythmic events. We specifically formulated our literature search and subsequent literature review to address the following question: Can the clinician identify specific QTc intervals at which a specific quantifiable risk of malignant dysrhythmic event (malignant ventricular dysrhythmia and/or cardiac arrest) occurs in an undifferentiated adult patient population?

In the literature search, we identified 701 studies; upon review using specific, predetermined inclusion criteria, we identified 16 articles for inclusion in the review. From this literature, we were unable to answer the question in a quantifiable manner and only noted that the risk of malignant dysrhythmic events increases with progressively longer QTc intervals. The literature on this topic is inadequate to answer this important question due to heterogeneous study methodology, patient populations, endpoints, and periods of observation. Additional prospective research is required on this topic, aimed at addressing the important issue of specific, quantifiable risk and its relation to the degree of prolongation of the QTc interval.

### The early repolarization: normal variant electrocardiogram, correlates and consequences [^113VFPaw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

We compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients with "early repolarization" electrocardiograms (ECGs) with those who had normal ECGs.

- **Methods**: In 1983 to 1985, we collected photocopies of 2,234 selected ECGs from 73,088 patients undergoing health examinations. Excluding 153 ECGs with missing data or those judged to be abnormal, the remaining ECGs were reinterpreted in 2000 by cardiologists as showing early repolarization (n = 670), being borderline (n = 330), or normal (n = 1,081). Characteristics and outcomes of persons with early repolarization ECGs were compared with those who had normal ECGs using analysis of variance, logistic regression, or proportional hazards models. Information on exercise was available for 325 patients.

- **Results**: Patients with early repolarization were more likely to be male (81% [n = 583] vs. 33% [n = 360]), under 40 years old (60% [n = 441] vs. 37% [n = 403]), black (48% [n = 384] vs. 26% [n = 280]), and more athletically active (mean ± SD, 10.4 ± 1.3 hours per week of activity vs. 6.4 ± 1.2 hours per week of activity) than those with normal ECGs. Patients with early repolarization were not more likely to be hospitalized (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9 to 1.2) or to die (HR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2) during follow-up than those with normal ECGs. Outpatient diagnoses were not more common in those with early repolarization; arrhythmias were actually less common (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Although especially prevalent in young, athletic, black men, early repolarization is not rare in other patients.

### Qrs micro-fragmentation as a mortality predictor [^1119mcAJ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram analyses involved examining the technical details of the analysed ECGs, as shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1. In each short-term ECG, the locations of QRS complexes were detected automatically, and corrections were made visually when necessary. The ECG signals were subsequently filtered using a 100 Hz low pass Butterworth filter with cubic spline baseline wander elimination (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1 for details). Using these filtered signals, representative median beats were constructed in each lead and superimposed on the same isoelectric axis. All these pre-processing steps utilized algorithms and their software implementations that have been repeatedly used and validated in previous studies.

The electrocardiogram measurements for each of the analysed ECGs involved the visual interpretation of the superimposed patterns of representative beats of different leads. Global 12-lead QRS onset and offset points, as well as T wave offset points, were identified. Supplementary material online, Figure S1, also provides an example of these measured ECG patterns. The visual analyses were conducted by team members who had no access to any clinical and/or follow-up data, nor information about the study from which individual ECGs originated. To ensure consistency in the visual ECG interpretation, recordings from each data source were interpreted by the same team member.

In each ECG, heart rate was measured based on the total duration of the short-term recording. The QT interval was measured from the global onset of the QRS complex to the global offset of the T wave, and the spatial angle between the QRS c…

### The long QT syndrome: A transatlantic clinical approach to diagnosis and therapy [^111vmJSy]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The mind-boggling progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying long QT syndrome (LQTS) has been the subject of many articles and reviews. However, errors frequently occur in the management of patients affected by this life-threatening disorder, both in diagnostic processes and therapeutic choices. The consequences of these errors are borne by patients and their families.

This review is not directed at the relatively small number of LQTS experts who are well-versed in patient management. It does not cover genetics, epidemiology, or the well-known clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Instead, we focus solely on the approach to diagnosis and therapy, aiming this review at the average clinical cardiologist who occasionally encounters patients affected by or suspected of having LQTS. Such a cardiologist may know enough to manage these patients but may lack complete confidence in their most critical decisions.

We present our personal views on diagnosis and therapy without attempting to reconcile differing opinions. Where differences exist, we clearly indicate the perspective of each author. While unconventional, this approach reflects the severe challenges faced in managing and protecting LQTS patients from sudden death while helping them live and thrive despite their diagnosis. We trust that this candid presentation of our clinical approach will be useful for both cardiologists and patients.

### Which QT correction formulae to use for QT monitoring [^115tzznm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

We report that a prolonged QTc is related to an increased 30-day and 1-year mortality and that the use of QTcFri or QTcFra would significantly improve all-cause mortality risk stratification compared to QTcB. A prolonged QRSd is related to 1-year mortality. We hypothesize that the apparent association between a shorter QRSd and a higher risk of noncardiac mortality illustrates the concept of conversion of mode of death. This suggests that a decrease in cardiovascular mortality leads to an increase in noncardiovascular death within this hospital-based population. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution, as it may be influenced by our study design and limitations.

Several population-based studies have previously reported an association between QTc and all-cause mortality. The Framingham Heart Study population (n = 6,895; mean follow-up = 27.5 years) observed a significant relation between every 20-ms increase in QTcB and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10–1.18; P < 0.0001), coronary heart disease–related mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05–1.26; P = 0.003), and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37; P = 0.02). However, using QTcFra, which is based on a subset of this study population and therefore considered superior to QTcB, these findings were less strong. The significant relation with all-cause mortality remained (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13; P < 0.0001); however, coronary heart disease–related mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96–1.20; P = 0.22) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96–1.40; P = 0.12) were no longer significant.

### The evaluation and management of drug effects on cardiac conduction (PR and QRS intervals) in clinical development [^117AhePR]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Recent advances in electrocardiographic monitoring and waveform analysis have significantly improved the ability to detect drug-induced changes in cardiac repolarization, manifested as changes in the QT/corrected QT interval. These advances have also improved the ability to detect drug-induced changes in cardiac conduction. This White Paper summarizes the opinion, reached by consensus among experts at the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium, on the assessment of electrocardiogram-based safety measurements of the PR and QRS intervals, representing atrioventricular and ventricular conduction, respectively, during drug development.

### Changes in QRS area and QRS duration after cardiac resynchronization therapy predict cardiac mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and ventricular arrhythmias [^1154rYZn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and a wide QRS complex. As with any medical therapy, its treatment effect is variable. "Nonresponder" rates range from 9% to 68%, depending on the criteria used to define response. Although no medical therapy can be expected to be 100% effective, there is a consensus view that response to CRT can be improved.

Manifold imaging studies have explored mechanical dyssynchrony in relation to patient selection and optimization, but ultimately, no single measure of mechanical dyssynchrony has been adopted by clinical guidelines. In this context, we should consider that CRT is an electrical treatment and that its substrate should be electrical rather than mechanical. In this respect, QRS duration (QRSd) has been adopted as a surrogate of electrical dyssynchrony in randomized controlled trials, and a reduction in QRSd has been shown to predict better long-term outcomes after CRT.

Evidence has recently emerged in support of vectorcardiography in the field of CRT. In this regard, QRS area has been shown to correlate with LV lateral wall activation time, the maximum rate of rise of LV pressure (ΔLV dP/dt max), and LV reverse remodeling after CRT. Crucially, pre-implantation QRS area has also been shown to be superior to pre-implantation QRSd and QRS morphology in predicting total mortality after CRT.

Although QRS area and QRSd duration relate to depolarization in a global sense, QRS area also…

### Relation of QT interval measurements to evolving automated algorithms from different manufacturers of electrocardiographs [^116GxiB8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

QT-interval measurements have clinical importance for the electrocardiographic recognition of congenital and acquired heart disease and as markers of arrhythmogenic risk during drug therapy, but software algorithms for the automated measurement of electrocardiographic durations differ among manufacturers and evolve within manufacturers. To compare automated QT-interval measurements, simultaneous paired electrocardiograms were obtained in 218 subjects using digital recorders from the two major manufacturers of electrocardiographs used in the United States and analyzed by two currently used versions of each manufacturer's software. The four automated QT and QTc durations were examined by repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc testing. Significantly larger automated QT-interval measurements were found with the most recent software of each manufacturer (12- to 24-ms mean differences from earlier algorithms). Systematic differences in QT measurements between manufacturers were significant for the earlier algorithms (11-ms mean difference) but not for the most recent software (1.3-ms mean difference). Similar relations were found for the rate-corrected QTc, with large mean differences between earlier and later algorithms (15 to 26 ms). Although there was a less than 2-ms mean difference between the most recent automated QTc measurements of the two manufacturers, the standard deviation of the difference was 12 ms. In conclusion, reference values for automated electrocardiographic intervals and serial QT measurements vary among electrocardiographs and analysis software. Technically based differences in measurements between manufacturers remain a concern for clinical and research applications.

### Management of long QT syndrome [^116GKagm]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, occurring especially during conditions of increased sympathetic activity. Existing therapies are very effective, yet mortality remains high among untreated, symptomatic individuals. The identification of several genes responsible for LQTS and the realization that they all encode cardiac ion channels has represented a landmark finding. This advance has fostered novel genotype-phenotype studies that are providing unique insight into the relationship between molecular biology and clinical cardiology.

LQTS serves as a paradigm for sudden cardiac death. Indeed, the growing knowledge developed for LQTS is likely to elucidate the genetic predisposition to sudden death in patients with more common cardiovascular diseases. The data presented here illustrate how the treatment of LQTS is rapidly evolving toward a highly individually tailored approach based on patient-specific genetic information.

### Heritabilities, proportions of heritabilities explained by GWAS findings, and implications of cross-phenotype effects on PR interval [^116gzYRd]. Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Parameters describing electrical activity in the heart, measured by the electrocardiogram (ECG), are important tools for diagnosing, monitoring, and evaluating risk in patients with cardiovascular disease. ECG measurements, such as PR interval, QRS complex duration, and QT interval, are used for the diagnosis and prediction of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Myocardial depolarization and repolarization time is measured by the QT interval: the time between the onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave. QT shortening or prolongation has been associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias and SCD.

PR interval and QRS duration are measures of cardiac conduction time; QRS duration reflects conduction through the ventricular myocardium, while PR interval measures atrial and atrioventricular conduction from the sinoatrial node to the ventricular myocardium, primarily through the atrioventricular node. ECG calculations of the Sokolow–Lyon index (SL), the Cornell voltage product (CV), and the 12-lead sum QRS product (12LS) have been used as indices of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Comparison of automated interval measurements by widely used algorithms in digital electrocardiographs [^1151sgGa]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Automated measurements of electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals by current-generation digital electrocardiographs are critical to computer-based ECG diagnostic statements, serial comparison of ECGs, and epidemiological studies of ECG findings in populations. A previous study demonstrated generally small but often significant systematic differences among four algorithms widely used for automated ECG in the United States, indicating that measurement differences could be related to the degree of abnormality of the underlying tracing. Since that publication, some algorithms have been adjusted, while other large manufacturers of automated ECGs have asked to participate in an extension of this comparison.

- **Methods**: Seven widely used automated algorithms for computer-based interpretation participated in this blinded study of 800 digitized ECGs provided by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. All tracings were different from the study of four algorithms reported in 2014. The selected population was heavily weighted toward groups with known effects on the QT interval: this included 200 normal subjects, 200 normal subjects receiving moxifloxacin as part of an active control arm of thorough QT studies, 200 subjects with genetically proved long QT syndrome Type 1 (LQT1), and 200 subjects with genetically proved long QT syndrome Type 2 (LQT2).

- **Results**: For the entire population of 800 subjects, pairwise differences between algorithms for each mean interval value were clinically small, even where statistically significant, ranging from 0.2 to 3.6 milliseconds for the PR interval.

### Qrs micro-fragmentation as a mortality predictor [^111pH7EP]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of the electrocardiographic QRS complex reflect intramyocardial conduction pathologies. Such abnormalities include not only the typical bundle branch block patterns but also forms due to less specific intraventricular conduction abnormalities. Prolonged QRS complex duration has long been a recognized risk factor for adverse cardiac events. More recently, the so-called QRS complex fragmentation, defined by visually detected splits of QRS waves, has also been found to predict poor outcomes in both cardiac patients and other well-defined groups, including the general population. This increased risk due to visible QRS fragmentation appears independent of the overall QRS complex duration.

Visual diagnosis of QRS fragmentation leads to a yes/no classification, although quantitative sums of QRS splits detected in different leads and probabilistic approaches have also been proposed. This categorical distinction suggests that similarly important QRS abnormalities might exist below the resolution of visual detection. Such a concept is not new. Already some decades ago, spectral analyses of signal-averaged QRS complex were proposed, albeit with variable success, to identify abnormalities hidden within the overall QRS pattern. Nevertheless, so far, little success has been achieved when trying to detect 'invisible' abnormalities of myocardial depolarization in standard clinical 10-second electrocardiograms (ECGs).

We have recently reported a method for QRS complex analysis that might be used for this purpose. Briefly, the method is based on projecting the 12-lead ECGs.

### Wide complex tachycardia differentiation: A reappraisal of the state-of-the-art [^116RpXMr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Careful inspection of the first components of the QRS complex, along with its comparison to its terminal segments as a means to distinguish ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT), has been adopted by a wide variety of WCT differentiation criteria and algorithms. The basis for this examination stems from the fact that SWCT and VT ordinarily demonstrate marked differences in the manner in which they engage the His‐Purkinje network.

For example, an SWCT with left bundle branch block aberrancy will commonly display rapid initial QRS deflections (e.g. r wave duration < 30 ms in V1 or V2, or an RS interval < 100 ms for QRS complexes in the precordial leads [V1–V6]) that arise from rapidly depolarized myocardial segments stimulated by preserved components of the His‐Purkinje network (i.e. right bundle branch). Conversely, a VT wavefront that propagates from a site of origin remote from specialized conduction tissue, and therefore must utilize slower cardiomyocyte‐to‐cardiocyte conduction, is expected to demonstrate delayed or "slurred" initial components of the QRS complex (e.g. R wave peak time [RWPT] in lead II ≥ 50 ms, or RS interval ≥ 100 ms in any of the precordial leads [V1–V6]). Once the VT impulse engages the conduction system and swiftly activates the remainder of the ventricular myocardium, the terminal components of the QRS complex will correspondingly demonstrate more rapid or "sharper" deflections compared with what was observed at the beginning of the QRS complex.

### The association between the length of the QT interval and mortality in the Cardiovascular Health Study [^116nzLDt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A long QT interval is a known risk factor for arrhythmic events and sudden death. However, the relationship between moderate QT prolongation and clinical events in community-dwelling elderly individuals remains uncertain.

We measured the QT interval in a population-based sample of 5,888 men and women, all at least 65 years of age, who participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study. The association between Bazett's rate-corrected QT (QTc, in ms) and mortality over the subsequent 10 years was evaluated. Participants were stratified based on the presence or absence of coronary heart disease at baseline and adjusted for coronary heart disease risk factors.

- **Results**: Participants with longer QTc intervals experienced higher rates of all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality. For those without known coronary heart disease, a QTc interval greater than 450 ms was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.67) and coronary heart disease mortality (RR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.5), compared to those with a QTc interval less than or equal to 450 ms.

This finding suggests that QTc intervals greater than 450 ms should trigger clinical evaluations and potential interventions to address the increased risk.

### Electrocardiogram-based deep learning improves outcome prediction following cardiac resynchronization therapy [^1123UdZp]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Identifying electrocardiogram features beyond the QRS complex, FactorECG improves upon heatmap-based attempts to make deep learning explainable; such approaches merely highlight 'where' on the ECG significant features are detected but provide no information on which morphological change explains the prediction. Rather, FactorECG allows for the 'quantifiable' identification of specific ECG features, enabling physicians to evaluate and confirm the clinical rationale of these features. This is reflected in our results, which confirm the known importance of LBBB morphology and QRS area for the prediction of echocardiographic response.

Using FactorECG, all types of LV conduction delay, as reflected in the QRS complex, can be represented by combining ECG factors 5, 9, 19, and 27. Interestingly, although the QRS area was associated with outcome, ECG factors incorporating QRS duration were not associated with outcome (Figure 5). This may be because, in the presence of sufficient electrical substrate, a subset of patients with moderate QRS prolongation are still likely to respond. This is also underscored by our results since FactorECG also predicted outcomes in patients with a QRS duration of less than 150 ms [c-statistic 0.72 (0.67–0.76)]. Likewise, when corrected for various other ECG features, no significant association with QRS duration and outcome remains, as also previously reported.

### Diagnosis, management and therapeutic strategies for congenital long QT syndrome [^111xGNEZ]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of LQTS relies on the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) and a number of other electrocardiographic parameters, as well as elements obtained by history taking (e.g. symptoms and family history). Together, they form the LQTS probability or Schwartz score, where a score of ≥ 3.5 points indicates a high probability of LQTS.

Genetic information is not part of the Schwartz score, but an individual with a pathogenic variant also fulfills the diagnostic criteria for LQTS. It is important to realize that the QTc of individuals with pathogenic variants and normal healthy controls significantly overlap, indicating that a single QTc will never be able to distinguish all non-LQTS ECGs from all LQTS ECGs.

It is also important to realize that there are different methods to measure the QT interval, which need different cut-off values, and that the formulas for heart rate correction are imperfect and also result in different cut-off values. In addition, although the U-wave can also be abnormal in LQTS patients, the U-wave should not be included in the QT assessment.

Based on ECGs of a large number of genotyped LQTS patients and their family members not carrying the familial variant, we designed an online calculator with information on the likelihood that LQTS is present based on the calculated QTc. In the past years, additional tools to more reliably assess LQTS on the ECG have been developed, including the use of artificial intelligence in establishing the diagnosis.

### High prevalence of left ventricular systolic and diastolic asynchrony in patients with congestive heart failure and normal QRS duration [^117KbgjP]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

To study the possible occurrence of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic asynchrony in patients with systolic heart failure (HF) and narrow QRS complexes, a prospective study was conducted at a university teaching hospital. Echocardiography was performed on 200 subjects, of whom 67 were patients with HF and narrow QRS complexes (≤ 120 ms), while 88 individuals served as normal controls. Echocardiography with tissue Doppler imaging utilized a six basal, six mid-segmental model for assessment.

- **Main outcome measures**: The severity and prevalence of systolic and diastolic asynchrony were evaluated by measuring the maximal difference in time to peak myocardial systolic contraction (T(S)) and early diastolic relaxation (T(E)), alongside the standard deviation of T(S) (T(S)-SD) and T(E) (T(E)-SD) across the 12 LV segments.

Results indicated a prolonged mean (SD) maximal difference in T(S) in the narrow QRS group compared with normal controls: controls 53 (23) ms vs. narrow QRS 107 (54) ms vs. wide QRS 130 (51) ms, with both comparisons significant at p < 0.001 versus controls. This pattern was mirrored in the T(S)-SD: controls 17.0 (7.8) ms vs. narrow QRS 33.8 (16.9) ms vs. wide QRS 42.0 (16.5) ms, again with both comparisons significant at p < 0.001 versus controls. Similarly, the maximal difference in T(E) was greater in the narrow QRS group: controls 59 (19) ms vs. narrow QRS 104 (71) ms vs. wide QRS 148 (87) ms, with both significant at p < 0.001 versus controls. The T(E)-SD followed this trend: controls 18.5 (5.8) ms vs. narrow QRS 33.3 (27.7) ms vs. wide QRS 48.6 (30.2) ms, with both significant at p < 0.001 versus controls.

The prevalence of systolic and diastolic asynchrony was 51% and 46%, respectively, in the study's HF population.

### Pathophysiology of narrow complex dilated cardiomyopathy insight derived from the velocity equation: velocity = distance/time [^112WZpsY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Propagation velocity = distance/QRS duration.

Propagation velocity has two primary directional components: (1) circumferential velocity branching, perpendicular to the main fibers, and (2) axial velocity parallel to the main fibers. Contributions to these two directional components include the conduction system with branching fibers that are perpendicular and axial, and the myocardial cells that are elongated axially, giving preference to rapid longitudinal conduction and slower circumferential conduction. Experimentally, the axial velocity parallel to conduction fibers has been shown to be higher than the circumferential velocity, which is perpendicular to the conduction fibers. Figure 1 illustrates the propagation velocity in both axial and circumferential directions using normal heart geometry and normal QRS duration. The axial and circumferential distances are measured from the echocardiogram's apical long axis view and parasternal short axis at the papillary muscle level. The time is determined by the QRS interval from the ECG. The axial propagation velocity is faster (125 cm/s) than the circumferential velocity (106 cm/s).

Figure 2 demonstrates the propagation velocity in the axial and circumferential directions in a wide QRS dilated cardiomyopathy. For both normal and dilated heart examples, the distance and QRS are measured, and the propagation velocity is calculated. The first normal example demonstrated the increased propagation velocity in the…

### Diagnostic criteria for the long QT syndrome. An update [^114aNV6J]. Circulation (1993). High credibility.

The Schwartz's diagnostic criteria for congenital long QT syndrome is a clinical scoring system used to diagnose congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), a genetic disorder of the heart's electrical system. This calculator is applicable to patients of all ages who present with unexplained syncope, seizures, or cardiac arrest, or have a family history of sudden cardiac death at a young age.

The Schwartz's criteria use a combination of clinical and electrocardiographic features, including the QT interval, T-wave alternans, notched T waves in three leads, low heart rate for age, clinical history, and family history. The score ranges from 1 to 6, with a score of 3.5 or higher indicating a high probability of LQTS.

The Schwartz's criteria should not be used in patients with secondary causes of QT prolongation, such as medications, electrolyte imbalances, or other medical conditions. It is also less accurate in neonates and very young children due to the physiological shortening of the QT interval in this age group.

The Schwartz's diagnostic criteria for congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) calculator evaluates several clinical and family history factors to estimate the probability of LQTS. Each factor is assigned a specific score, and the scores are summed to predict the likelihood of having LQTS.

- **QTc interval (calculated by Bazett's formula)**:
	- **≥ 480 msec**: 6 points
	- **460–470 msec**: 4 points

### Automated quantification of low-amplitude abnormal QRS peaks from high-resolution ECG recordings predicts arrhythmic events in patients with cardiomyopathy [^114aVmjv]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiomyopathy patients are at risk of sudden death, typically from scar-related abnormalities of electrical activation that promote ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Abnormal intra-QRS peaks may provide a measure of altered activation. We hypothesized that quantification of such QRS peaks (QRSp) in high-resolution ECGs would predict arrhythmic events in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)-eligible cardiomyopathy patients.

- **Methods and results**: Ninety-nine patients with ischemic or non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy undergoing prophylactic ICD implantation were prospectively enrolled (age 62 ± 11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 27 ± 7%). High-resolution (1024 Hz) digital 12-lead ECGs were recorded during intrinsic rhythm. QRSp was quantified for each precordial lead as the total number of low-amplitude deflections that deviated from their respective naive QRS template. The primary endpoint of arrhythmic events was defined as appropriate ICD therapy or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. After a median follow-up of 24 (15–43) months, 20 (20%) patients had arrhythmic events. Both QRSp and QRS duration were greater in those with arrhythmic events (both P < 0.001), and this was consistent for QRSp for both cardiomyopathy types. In a multivariable Cox regression model that included age, left ventricular ejection fraction, QRS duration, and QRSp, only QRSp was an independent predictor of arrhythmic events (hazard ratio, 2.1; P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a QRSp ≥ 2.25 identified arrhythmic events with greater sensitivity.

### Relationship between QRS duration and left ventricular mass and volume in patients at high cardiovascular risk [^111DWwTZ]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Longer QRS duration on the ECG is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality. To evaluate potential mechanisms, this study examined the relationship between QRS duration and left ventricular (LV) mass and LV end systolic and end diastolic volume in patients with known CV disease or high-risk diabetes.

- **Methods**: In a substudy of the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial/Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease) clinical trials, 368 patients underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance scan to measure LV mass, LV end systolic volume, LV end diastolic volume, and LV ejection fraction at baseline and after two years of follow-up. Relationships between QRS duration on the 12-lead ECG and LV mass and volumes were evaluated at both assessments.

- **Results**: Each 10-ms increase in QRS duration, both within and above the normal reference range, was associated with an 8.3% (95% CI 6.7% to 9.9%) increase in LV mass, a 9.2% (95% CI 7.4% to 10%) increase in LV end diastolic volume, and a 7.8% (95% CI 6.4% to 9.3%) increase in LV end systolic volume. QRS duration increased with body size, but associations with LV mass and volumes remained strong after indexing measurements to height²·⁷ (p < 0.001 for all) and were similar for subjects with an otherwise normal and abnormal ECG.

- **Conclusion**: A longer QRS duration, both within and above the normal reference range, is associated with a greater LV mass and larger LV end systolic and end diastolic volumes. This may explain the increased cardiovascular risk associated with prolonged QRS duration.

### The differential diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia [^116DgcLa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Wide complex tachycardia is defined as a cardiac rhythm with a rate greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) and a QRS complex duration greater than 0.10 to 0.12 seconds in the adult patient. In children, wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is defined according to age-related metrics. The differential diagnosis of WCT includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant intraventricular conduction, encompassing both relatively benign and life-threatening dysrhythmias. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis of WCT, with a discussion of strategies useful in making the appropriate diagnosis when possible.
