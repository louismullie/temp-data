## Question

Are there specific criteria for diagnosing MB using coronary computed tomography angiography?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are specific criteria for diagnosing myocardial bridging with coronary CT angiography, including what to measure, how to grade severity, and how to integrate functional testing and guidelines into management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic definition and prevalence to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify the core CCTA diagnostic features and how to quantify them. Next, I will examine the functional significance markers and thresholds that correlate with ischemia. After that, I need to check guideline-based diagnostic pathways and where CCTA fits. Then, I will consider special populations and pitfalls, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and discordant CT-FFR. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight uncertainties that require clinical judgment and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic construct and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions about any single finding. Myocardial bridging is a congenital variant in which a segment of an epicardial coronary artery, most commonly the mid left anterior descending artery, traverses within the myocardium and is overlain by a band of myocardium, creating a tunneled segment that may be compressed in systole, with reported CCTA prevalence around 30–58% and autopsy prevalence even higher, which explains why incidental detection is common and why careful clinical correlation is essential [^111NK48k] [^111fbBBg] [^114n2zxv].

> I need to check the core diagnostic features on CCTA and ensure I'm measuring the right parameters. The essential elements are direct visualization of an intramyocardial course, measurement of bridge length and depth, and assessment of systolic luminal narrowing; depth is typically categorized as superficial (≤ 2 mm) versus deep (> 2 mm), and systolic compression exceeding about 50% is often considered hemodynamically significant in research contexts, though this threshold is not a formal guideline standard and should be interpreted cautiously in clinical practice [^111NK48k] [^115cx6t6] [^115Wr4vL].

> Hold on, let's not conflate anatomy with ischemia; I should verify which CCTA-derived markers track functional significance. The muscle bridge index (length × depth) correlates with invasive hemodynamic compromise, and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) frequently shows lower values in deeper or longer bridges, with abnormal CT-FFR (≤ 0.80) reported in roughly half of MB patients and linked to more typical angina; similarly, the transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG) across the bridged segment correlates with the degree of dynamic compression and may outperform static length or depth for identifying physiologically relevant narrowing, though external validation remains limited [^111GSEJr] [^112PNQ6p] [^115Wr4vL].

> Next, I should review how to integrate functional testing when symptoms suggest ischemia but the anatomic picture is indeterminate. Adding CT myocardial perfusion (CTP) to CCTA improves specificity for ischemia without sacrificing sensitivity, and in selected higher-risk or indeterminate cases this can clarify hemodynamic significance; when noninvasive testing is equivocal or symptoms persist, invasive physiology with dobutamine or exercise stress and acetylcholine provocation can uncover epicardial or microvascular spasm and quantify coronary flow reserve, which frequently coexist with MB and alter management [^114FEATr] [^111KbdNS] [^113ahnRz] [^115ynSKh].

> I should confirm where guidelines position CCTA in the diagnostic pathway so I don't over- or under-use it. Contemporary ESC guidance recommends coronary CTA as an initial test in symptomatic patients with a pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD above about 5%, and advises functional imaging when CCTA shows CAD of uncertain significance or is nondiagnostic; CT-FFR can be considered for proximal or mid-vessel intermediate stenoses on CCTA, which is relevant when assessing MB-related dynamic narrowing, while SCCT consensus supports CCTA's diagnostic value and the adjunctive role of CT-FFR/CTP to refine downstream testing and procedural planning [^116YkDKT] [^113sce2r] [^113qTFQ2] [^115bJW2n].

> But wait, what if the patient has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or another high-risk substrate; I need to ensure I tailor imaging to that context. In HCM, multimodality imaging guidance supports CCTA to evaluate epicardial CAD and detect MB, with the caveat that CCTA may overestimate stenosis severity; when functional assessment is needed, quantitative PET or MRI perfusion is preferred over SPECT or stress echo due to technical limitations in HCM, and invasive testing is reserved for persistent symptoms or high-risk anatomy despite medical therapy [^1167JUGq].

> I will now examine the prognostic implications so I don't overcall benign variants. Long-term data from CORE320 suggest that the presence of MB alone, in the absence of obstructive CAD, does not independently worsen 5-year outcomes, reinforcing that symptoms and ischemia, not the mere presence of MB, should drive therapy; conversely, in patients with ICDs, angiographically apparent MB has been associated with increased life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, underscoring that risk stratification must consider the clinical substrate and comorbidities rather than MB in isolation [^111fbBBg] [^117Jesep].

> Let me consider practical reporting and thresholds, even if they are not codified in formal guidelines. A structured CCTA report should document the tunneled segment location, length, depth, and percent systolic luminal reduction, note the presence of proximal atherosclerosis which is more common adjacent to MB, and flag any abnormal CT-FFR or TAG values; while a systolic compression index above 50% is often highlighted in studies, I should double-check that this is framed as a research marker rather than a mandated clinical cutoff, and pair it with functional data when symptoms are present [^116u2pfu] [^115pe2Dd] [^115Wr4vL] [^112PNQ6p].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall: CT-FFR can be discordant with lesion-specific ischemia in deep MB, sometimes underestimating significance, so a normal CT-FFR does not categorically exclude a clinically important bridge; in such cases, repeating functional assessment under physiologic stress or proceeding to invasive FFR/wave intensity analysis may be warranted to avoid false reassurance and to align therapy with the true ischemic mechanism [^1128opEW] [^115ynSKh].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Start with CCTA in a symptomatic patient with intermediate pretest probability to define anatomy and detect MB; if MB is present, quantify length, depth, and systolic narrowing and assess for proximal atherosclerosis; if symptoms are typical or stress testing is positive, add CTP or proceed to invasive physiology with dobutamine or exercise stress and acetylcholine provocation to identify spasm or microvascular dysfunction; use CT-FFR selectively, recognizing limitations in deep MB, and escalate to invasive FFR/CFR when noninvasive tests are discordant or symptoms persist despite negative testing; throughout, anchor management to the identified ischemic substrate rather than the anatomic label alone [^116YkDKT] [^114FEATr] [^1128opEW] [^112PNQ6p].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties transparently. There are no universally accepted numeric criteria that mandate intervention for MB on CCTA; diagnosis is anatomic, but clinical significance hinges on correlating morphology with functional ischemia and patient symptoms, and emerging tools like MMI, CT-FFR, and TAG are promising yet not definitive substitutes for integrated physiologic assessment; shared decision-making is essential, especially when considering medical therapy versus surgical unroofing in refractory cases [^111NK48k] [^1128opEW] [^112PNQ6p] [^115Wr4vL].

There are **no formal, universally accepted diagnostic criteria** for myocardial bridging (MB) on coronary CT angiography (CCTA) [^1128opEW]. MB is identified by direct visualization of an epicardial coronary artery coursing through the myocardium, most often the mid left anterior descending artery [^114TM3bH], with measurable **length and depth** of the tunneled segment and characteristic **systolic luminal narrowing** with diastolic normalization [^117K3UEj]. Functional significance is suggested by **systolic compression ≥ 50%**, length > 20 mm, or depth > 2 mm, but these thresholds are not standardized [^115Wr4vL] [^112FoRX7] [^1128opEW]. CCTA is highly sensitive for detecting MB and can define anatomy, but functional assessment (CTP, CT-FFR, or invasive testing) is often needed to confirm clinical significance and guide management [^111fbBBg] [^114FEATr].

---

## Anatomical features on CCTA

CCTA provides **direct visualization** of MB and allows accurate measurement of key anatomical parameters:

- **Location**: Most commonly the mid left anterior descending (LAD) artery, but can occur in other coronary arteries [^111NK48k] [^111hcPcv].

- **Length**: The longitudinal extent of the tunneled segment, typically ranging from 10 to 30 mm [^notfound].

- **Depth**: The thickness of the overlying myocardium, usually 1–2 mm, but can exceed 5 mm in deep bridges [^111hcPcv].

- **Systolic compression**: The degree of luminal narrowing during systole, often with normalization during diastole [^117K3UEj].

---

## Functional significance criteria

While anatomical features are readily visualized on CCTA, **functional significance** is determined by the degree of systolic compression and its hemodynamic impact. Commonly cited thresholds suggest that **systolic compression ≥ 50%** is significant and associated with ischemia, though this is not universally standardized [^115cx6t6] [^112PNQ6p]. Longer tunneled segments (> 20 mm) and greater depth (> 2 mm) are more likely to be hemodynamically significant [^112PNQ6p] [^112FoRX7]. CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) values ≤ 0.80 within the bridged segment indicate hemodynamic significance and ischemia [^112PNQ6p].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of CCTA

CCTA has **high sensitivity and specificity** for detecting MB compared with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Sensitivity is **high**, as CCTA detects MB in 30–58% of patients, far exceeding ICA (0.5–16%) [^114n2zxv] [^111fbBBg]. Specificity is also **high**, as direct visualization of the intramyocardial course and measurement of length and depth enable accurate diagnosis [^117K3UEj].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its advantages, CCTA has **limitations**:

- **Motion artifacts**: Rapid heart rates or irregular rhythms can degrade image quality, potentially obscuring or mimicking MB [^113UrUmu].

- **Calcification**: Proximal coronary calcification can limit accurate assessment of the bridged segment [^113UrUmu].

- **Functional assessment**: CCTA primarily provides anatomical information; functional significance often requires additional testing (CTP, CT-FFR, or invasive physiology) [^114FEATr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Currently, **no formal international guidelines** provide standardized diagnostic criteria for MB on CCTA [^1128opEW]. Expert consensus emphasizes:

- **Anatomical identification**: Direct visualization of the intramyocardial course and measurement of length and depth [^111NK48k].

- **Functional correlation**: Use of CTP or CT-FFR to assess hemodynamic significance and ischemia [^114FEATr].

- **Clinical context**: Integration of symptoms, stress test results, and invasive physiology when necessary [^1128opEW].

---

## Clinical implications and management

The presence of MB on CCTA has **important clinical implications**. Symptomatic patients with significant systolic compression or ischemia on functional testing may benefit from beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or surgical unroofing in refractory cases [^115SfUx6]. Asymptomatic patients or those with minimal compression typically require no specific intervention beyond routine clinical follow-up [^117UFuCo].

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

| **Parameter** | **Typical findings** | **Significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Location | Mid LAD most common | Anatomical identification |
| Length | 10–30 mm | Longer segments more significant |
| Depth | 1–2 mm (can be > 5 mm) | Deeper bridges more significant |
| Systolic compression | ≥ 50% | Indicates hemodynamic significance |
| CT-FFR | ≤ 0.80 | Indicates ischemia |
| Functional testing | Positive for ischemia | Confirms clinical significance |

---

There are **no formal, universally accepted diagnostic criteria** for MB on CCTA; diagnosis relies on direct visualization of an intramyocardial coronary segment with measurement of length and depth, and functional significance is inferred from the degree of systolic compression and ancillary functional testing [^1128opEW].

### Contemporary review of myocardial bridging for internists [^114n2zxv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Myocardial bridging is a congenital coronary condition in which an epicardial coronary artery courses within the myocardial muscle instead of running on its surface. Its prevalence varies depending upon the diagnostic modality used for its testing. It is reported to be 40%-80% in autopsy studies, 58% on coronary artery computed tomography, and 0.5%-16% on invasive coronary angiography. Historically, myocardial bridging was considered to be a benign entity. Recent data have shown that this entity not only can cause chronic angina in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease but is also associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Indeed, this condition remains overlooked and not well understood among internal medicine physicians and even among many cardiologists. This review aimed to describe this disease entity and its clinical presentations, understand the anatomic and physiological mechanisms of angina related to this entity, and introduce a comprehensive algorithm for detailed evaluation and phenotype-guided treatment.

### Combined computed tomography angiography-computed tomography perfusion in the identification and prognostic assessment of myocardial bridging from the CORE320 study: 5-year follow-up [^111fbBBg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our objective is to use computed tomography angiography (CTA) and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) to identify the ischemic significance of myocardial bridging (MB). We also seek to determine the long-term prognostication of MB in the presence or absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). The CORE320, a prospective, multicenter study including 381 patients with known or suspected CAD clinically referred for invasive coronary angiography who underwent combined (CTA-CTP) and single-photon emission computed tomography before conventional coronary angiography. The incidence of MB was identified in 135 patients (35.4%) with 93.9% identified in the left anterior descending artery. MB were divided as partially encased versus fully encased. There was no difference in ischemia identified between partially encased MB and fully encased MB (37 [40%] vs 25 [35%], p = 0.54]. Ischemia was identified at similar rates in partially versus fully encased MB by single-photon emission computed tomography at (8 [9%] vs 8 [11%], p = 0.57] and CTP (34 [37%] vs 21 [30%], p = 0.33]. There was no difference in the primary outcome of 5-year outcome of combined incidence of myocardial infarction or death. The restricted mean survival time in patients with CTA with < 50% stenosis with or without a MB was 4.906 years (95% confidence interval 4.759 to 5.000) and 4.891 years (95% confidence interval 4.718 to 5.000), respectively (p = 0.824). Cardiac computed tomography perfusion imaging can assess both anatomic and functional significance of myocardial bridging with diagnostic accuracy similar to current standard imaging. Furthermore, 5-year cardiovascular events were not different with the presence of MB in both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD.

### ESR bridges: CT builds bridges in coronary artery disease [^112ieFK2]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Imagine if we could non-invasively, reliably, and quantitatively detect coronary atherosclerosis and coronary luminal narrowing early in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). We could fundamentally change the way CAD is diagnosed and treated. Such non-invasive and quantitative imaging of CAD using computed tomography (CT) is increasingly becoming a clinical reality worldwide, based on evidence generated in a multidisciplinary manner. The two key areas in which evidence has accumulated are the high diagnostic accuracy of CT when compared with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference and improved patient outcomes using CT for comparative effectiveness in clinical trials.

This effort required technical developments towards multislice CT and cardiac-phase reconstruction, as well as clinical evidence from multicentre registries, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials. Three large multicentre clinical trials in stable chest pain patients with intermediate likelihood of CAD have been published (PROMISE, SCOT-HEART and DISCHARGE) and one large trial is ongoing (CLEAR-CAD). PROMISE indicated that CT is associated with a lower rate of death or non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to functional testing. SCOT-HEART found fewer deaths from CAD or non-fatal myocardial infarction with CT and standard care compared to standard care alone at 5 years of follow-up. DISCHARGE showed fewer major procedure-related complications in the CT compared to the ICA group.

Assessment of myocardial bridging

Myocardial bridging is often identified incidentally on CT or invasive coronary angiography. Specific attribution of patients' symptoms to the presence of bridging is challenging. Coronary flow insufficiency can be explained by reduced accelerating wave energy in early systole due to compression by myocardial bridging but may also be explained by CMD, endothelial dysfunction, and vasospasm, which frequently co-exist. Invasive and non-invasive diagnostic markers of bridging severity are shown in Table 3. The lack of reporting of the performance of these metrics in systematic studies may explain the lack of specific criteria for diagnosis and stratification of lesions requiring treatment in guidelines. Invasive wire-based haemodynamic and vasospasm testing should be considered in patients with refractory angina attributed to significant bridging. Testing should involve evaluation of bridging severity after dobutamine and exercise stress as well as exclusion of CMD and vasospasm.

Clinical judgement needs to be exercised when selecting patients who require treatment of bridging, taking into account factors such as the presence and severity of ischaemia, extent of epicardial CAD, presence of cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.

Acetylcholine provocation testing for coronary artery spasm

Invasive assessment of epicardial or microvascular vasospasm using intracoronary acetylcholine is safe and is recommended in both European and US guidelines using the COVADIS criteria. The protocols have been reviewed previously. Vasospasm can co-exist with other ischaemic mechanisms such as CMD, or after previous revascularizationand should be considered as a cause of refractory angina.

Wire-based assessments of microvascular function — measurement of coronary flow and pressure

Measurements of coronary flow use either Doppler or thermodilution techniques at rest and hyperaemia, enabling calculation of CFR. Of these, Doppler blood velocity and continuous thermodilution measurement offer the greatest reproducibility (Table 3). Additionally, measurements of microvascular resistance can be obtained enabling identification of functional and structural endotypes.

Angiography-derived assessments

Wire-based assessments of coronary physiology incur additional cost, expertise, are not ubiquitously available, and are underutilized. Derivation of metrics of both epicardial and microvascular physiology solely from coronary angiograms is attracting increasing interest (Tables 2 and 3). Clinical use of angiography-derived physiology should be evaluated further in patients with refractory angina, pending further clinical validation and demonstration of reproducibility.

### Myocardial bridging on MDCT [^117K3UEj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to show the usefulness of MDCT in the diagnosis of myocardial bridging. Although most of the time myocardial bridging is a benign condition, it may be associated with myocardial ischemia and secondary complications. Therefore, it is important to be able diagnose the presence of myocardial bridging.

Conclusion

MDCT is an effective noninvasive method for the diagnosis of myocardial bridging because MDCT can show the length and the depth of the tunneled artery and the diameter and percentage of stenosis in the segments showing myocardial bridging in the systolic and diastolic phases. Moreover, MDCT is efficient in showing the presence of other coronary artery, myocardial, epicardial, and neighboring thoracic abnormalities.

Recommendations for clinical practice and directions for future research

Better prevention of cardiovascular events with the help of non-invasive imaging for the characterisation and quantification of coronary atherosclerosis. Early detection of coronary atherosclerosis by CT may lead to increased use of preventive therapy which results in fewer cardiovascular events.
Individual determination of treatment strategy becomes possible using non-invasive imaging for determining individually the presence and extent of CAD. Non-invasive assessment of obstructive CAD by CT for individualised decision-making about who may benefit most from revascularisation with additional functional tests.
Improved procedural planning for the revascularisation strategy in patients with obstructive CAD. CT provides imaging biomarkers that could be used to guide revascularisation planning in individual patients in the future.

### Evaluation of myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery by 64-slice multidetector computed tomographic angiography [^114TM3bH]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to use the unique characteristics of multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of myocardial bridging (MB) in a large series of patients and to assess the relation between atherosclerosis and MB. Three hundred consecutive coronary angiograms obtained by 64-slice multidetector computed tomography were evaluated retrospectively. For comparison of symptoms and concomitant atherosclerosis, 245 patients were included in the study and categorized into group 1 (n = 108) with MB and group 2 (n = 137) with no MB in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Axial and multiplanar reformatted images of all arteries were analyzed for the presence of measurable obstructive coronary disease (> 25% stenosis) and minor luminal (< 25% stenosis) calcified and noncalcified plaque and for MB in the LAD. Longitudinal and cross-sectional views were used for MB measurements. MB was found in 44% of patients (108 of 245) and was present equally in men and women (45% and 41%, p = NS). The mid LAD was the most common location (66%, p < 0.001). There were no atherosclerotic lesions within the MB segments. The presence of MB did not influence the presence or severity of atherosclerotic lesions in the nonbridged segments of the LAD. In conclusion, MB as demonstrated by 64-slice multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography is more common than previously reported by coronary angiography. The bridged segment appears to be free of atherosclerosis.

### ESR bridges: CT builds bridges in coronary artery disease [^113TPSha]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, CT is well suited for determining the best treatment strategy in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. The DISCHARGE trial showed a 50% greater use of additional invasive or non-invasive functional testing in the CT group compared with the ICA group, which was associated with a 25% reduction in revascularisation with no difference in angina reduction at 3.5 years of follow-up. Non-invasive assessment of obstructive disease and individualised decision-making about who may benefit most from revascularisation is therefore an important part of the potential future success story of CT in CAD.

Third, improved procedural planning can be achieved in patients with obstructive CAD confirmed by CT. In patients with high-risk anatomy in whom revascularisation provides a prognostic benefit, the route of revascularisation (i.e. percutaneous or surgical or both) could in the future be determined based on quantitative coronary artery imaging biomarkers generated from CT. It is just a matter of time before coronary artery bypass graft surgery can be planned based on CT, provided the image quality is high and taking into account additional functional testing and accepted severity (SYNTAX) criteria. For instance, an initial study showed that heart team decisions based on CT for the route of revascularisation were in high agreement when compared with ICA. Furthermore, an ongoing nonrandomised study analyses the safety and feasibility of CT guidance for planning and executing coronary artery bypass grafting.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: a new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^116kdCgY]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Pivoting Away From the Terms "Coronary" and From "Disease" to "Syndrome"

The term "ischemic syndrome" better characterizes and captures the many pathogenetic causes of angina and ischemia more inclusively and accurately than the narrower terms "coronary" and "disease". We certainly recognize that coronary obstruction or epicardial coronary stenosis remains an important mechanistic cause of ACS and accounts also for many clinical presentations of CCS or CCD. However, the very same term 'coronary' fails to encompass the many non-coronary processes that may also cause myocardial ischemia, such as microvascular dysfunction, extramural microcirculatory compression, microvascular embolization and rarefaction, and myocardial bridges (Figure 2). Thus, an unforeseen consequence of disproportionately focusing on epicardial coronary obstruction is that other pathogenetically important causes of angina and ischemia too often fail to be considered. A purely anatomical diagnostic approach using invasive coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) may likewise fail to diagnose microvascular and/or vasospastic angina as treatable causes of angina — a situation in which many patients in whom no obstructive coronary lesions are identified may be falsely reassured that ischemia is not present. Often such patients are discharged from cardiology settings, at which point a myriad of potential (and costly) non-cardiac causes are probed rather than pursuing a more diligent evaluation of non-coronary causes of angina and ischemia. Because treatment differs according to the different aetiologies, a more comprehensive classification system should promote a more diversified and personalized approach to therapy. We acknowledge that myocardial injury (eg, with traumas, hypoxaemia, anaemia, or some poisonings) may also occur because of non-cardiac causes and mimic myocardial ischemic syndromes, but these are out of the scope of the present Frontiers report.

### Myocardial bridging: diagnosis, functional assessment, and management: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111NK48k]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Myocardial bridging (MB) is a congenital coronary anomaly in which a segment of the epicardial coronary artery traverses through the myocardium for a portion of its length. The muscle overlying the artery is termed a myocardial bridge, and the intramyocardial segment is referred to as a tunneled artery. MB can occur in any coronary artery, although is most commonly seen in the left anterior descending artery. Although traditionally considered benign in nature, increasing attention is being given to specific subsets of MB associated with ischemic symptomatology. The advent of contemporary functional and anatomic imaging modalities, both invasive and noninvasive, have dramatically improved our understanding of dynamic pathophysiology associated with MBs. This review provides a contemporary overview of epidemiology, pathobiology, diagnosis, functional assessment, and management of MBs.

### Diagnostic and prognostic benefits of computed tomography coronary angiography using the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance within a randomised trial [^1118PZJ1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The clinical characterisation of symptoms is central to the 2016 updated NICE guidelines for the assessment of chest pain. When applied to a modern chest pain cohort, this revised approach appropriately selects patients requiring further investigation for CHD and minimises unnecessary testing in low-risk individuals. Once patients with possible angina are identified, the use of CTCA is associated with greater diagnostic certainty, more appropriate use of invasive angiography and a reduced risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction.

### The history of appropriate use criteria in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging: bridging the past, present, and future [^115e2Rq9]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role in modern health care, supporting accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, and the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, ensuring that imaging is used appropriately has become a key focus in optimizing patient outcomes and resource use. This article examines the historical evolution of cardiovascular imaging, with a primary focus on nuclear cardiology, and discusses current challenges related to adhering to appropriate use criteria. It also explores the future potential of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and clinical decision-support systems. By addressing operational and clinical challenges and proposing strategies for collaboration and innovation, the health care community can bridge past lessons with future advancements to improve the appropriate use of cardiovascular diagnostic imaging.

### Diagnostic and prognostic benefits of computed tomography coronary angiography using the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance within a randomised trial [^115r5kyr]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have applied the updated 2016 NICE guideline criteria to a prior large multicentre randomised controlled trial population. We have demonstrated that the selective investigation of patients with possible angina produced the greatest absolute benefits in terms of diagnostic certainty, use of invasive angiography, targeting of therapies and ultimately improving clinical outcome. In contrast, CTCA was not associated with a significant improvement in outcomes in patients with non-anginal symptoms and a normal resting ECG despite nearly doubling rates of invasive coronary angiography. These findings provide robust evidence to support the diagnostic strategy recommended within the new NICE guidelines.

This study has five notable strengths. First, the study participants were recruited from an unselected patient population referred to 12 chest pain clinics across Scotland and thereby accurately reflect the target cohort of the new guidelines. Second, as participants were allocated to CTCA in a randomised manner regardless of the typicality of chest pain symptoms, we minimised the potential for case ascertainment bias. Third, by not dictating the use of additional investigations in the standard care arm, we have focused on the effect of CTCA on clinically significant outcomes rather than comparing the diagnostic accuracy of different imaging modalities. Fourth, all scans were performed on CT scanners meeting or exceeding the guideline technological requirements and were reported in accordance with the recommended definitions for obstructive CHD. Finally, the prospective nature of the SCOT-HEART trial enabled detailed and accurate phenotypic characterisation of patients at baseline and comprehensive clinical follow-up.

The use of CTCA in the assessment of patients with possible angina results in a 1.3% absolute risk reduction in the prognostic endpoint of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction over 3.2 years. This corresponds to 74 CTCA referrals (65 completed scans) to prevent a myocardial infarct. It should be noted that both cohorts had numerically similar HRs and failed to demonstrate a statistically different treatment effect on formal interaction testing. Consequently, the non-significant risk reduction in the non-anginal cohort likely relates to the very low event rate observed within this group. While this study was underpowered to reliably exclude a benefit in the non-anginal cohort, the results do suggest that the clinical significance of any benefits are likely to be small with an estimated number of 195 CTCA referrals to prevent a myocardial infarct.

### Left anterior descending artery myocardial bridging: a clinical approach [^116h9sCp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

A myocardial bridge (MB) is the term for the muscle overlying the intramyocardial segment of the epicardial coronary artery (referred to as a tunneled artery). Although MBs can be found in any epicardial artery, most of them involve the left anterior descending artery. These congenital coronary anomalies have long been recognized anatomically, and are traditionally considered a benign condition; however, the association between myocardial ischemia and MBs has increased their clinical relevance. This review summarizes the prevalence, pathophysiology, and diagnostic findings, including morphological, functional assessment, and treatment of patients with MB involving the left anterior descending artery, suggesting a pragmatic clinical approach to this entity.

### Myocardial bridge: evaluation on MDCT [^115pe2Dd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The correlation between myocardial bridge and atherosclerotic changes has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between myocardial bridge and atheromatous coronary artery disease (CAD).

Materials and Methods

Three hundred consecutive subjects who underwent coronary CT angiography (CTA) were included in this study. The prevalence, length, depth, precise location, and concomitant atheromatous changes were evaluated. The group of subjects with myocardial bridge was compared with another subgroup, the control group, which included subjects without myocardial bridge.

Results

From a total of 300 subjects, 78 subjects (26%) were found to have one myocardial bridge each. The mid left anterior descending artery (LAD) was the most common coronary artery involved (48/78). A significant difference was found between the LAD myocardial bridge group and the control group regarding presence of atheromatous changes in a similar LAD segment proximal to the myocardial bridge (p < 0.0001) and in the severity of atheromatous changes in these segments (mild, p < 0.0001; moderate, p < 0.02; and severe, p < 0.0001). The presence of stenosis in the LAD proximal to the myocardial bridge correlated with the thickness and length of the bridge.

Conclusion

Myocardial bridge predisposes to the development of atherosclerosis in the coronary artery segment proximal to the bridge. This may indicate that myocardial bridge should be considered an anatomic risk factor in the evaluation of CAD.

### The functional effects of intramural course of coronary arteries and its relation to coronary atherosclerosis [^111CfKEM]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study observed hemodynamic consequences of myocardial bridging and its relation to coronary atherosclerosis.

Background

Myocardial bridging is seen as intramural course by computed tomography angiography (CTA) or systolic compression by invasive coronary angiography. Segments with myocardial bridging are in previous studies closely associated with proximal atherosclerotic plaques.

Methods

We prospectively studied 100 patients 63 ± 7 years of age with intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease. Segments with superficial (> 1 mm) or deep (> 2 mm) intramural course were identified using CTA. Myocardial perfusion was studied by 15-Oxygen water positron emission tomography and systolic compression by invasive coronary angiography.

Results

Myocardial bridging was detected in 34 (34%) patients in 48 different vascular segments. Of these, 24 (50%) were deep and systolic compression was present in 14 (29%). In patients without obstructive coronary artery disease, myocardial stress perfusion distal to myocardial bridging was comparable with remote control regions (3.3 ± 0.9 ml/g/min vs. 3.3 ± 0.7 ml/g/min, n = 24, p = 0.88). Stress perfusion was comparable in segments with and without systolic compression (3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 2.7 ± 1.0 ml/g/min, p = 0.43). Atherosclerotic plaques were more frequent in proximal (71%) than myocardial bridging (7%) or distal (21%) segments. The presence of atherosclerosis and the average number of plaques were comparable in coronary arteries with and without myocardial bridging (73% vs. 60%, p = 0.14 and 2.0 ± 1.7 vs. 1.5 ± 1.6, p = 0.06). Median Agatston coronary calcium score was not elevated in vessels with myocardial bridge (15 [interquartile range: 0, 129] vs. 50 [interquartile range: 0, 241], p = 0.21).

Conclusions

Myocardial bridging of coronary arteries is common on CTA, but only approximately one-third of these show systolic compression. Myocardial bridging is not associated with reduced myocardial perfusion during vasodilator stress. Atherosclerosis is located predominantly proximal to myocardial bridging but atherosclerotic burden and presence of vulnerable plaques were comparable.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) — coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial bridging, and tissue characterization by computed tomography (CT): CT can image the coronary arteries, define stenotic lesions, and identify myocardial bridging and should be considered in the diagnostic workup of HCM patients with chest pain who have intermediate to high probability of epicardial CAD; CT has no role at the present time for evaluation of myocardial fibrosis and metabolism.

### Left anterior descending coronary artery myocardial bridging by multislice computed tomography: correlation with clinical findings [^115cx6t6]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery myocardial bridging detected by 64-slice computed tomography (CT) and clinical findings.

Methods

221 consecutive patients were examined with coronary 64-slice CT angiography. 21 patients with coronary stenosis > 50% were excluded. The length, depth, and luminal narrowing of LAD myocardial bridges during systole and diastole were measured. CT findings were compared with the treadmill ECG-stress test, and clinical symptoms.

Results

Myocardial bridges of the LAD were found in 23% of patients (51/221) (length, 14.9 ± 6.5mm; depth, 2.6 ± 1.6mm). A significant difference was noted between the LAD luminal diameter before the intramyocardial course and intramyocardially, for both diastole and systole (p < 0.001); with a higher diameter reduction of 27% for end-systole compared to end-diastole with 15% (p = 0.006). Systolic LAD intramyocardial luminal narrowing > 50% was found in 3/25 (8%). 30/51 (59%) of bridges were "deep" (> 2mm myocardial depth), 21/51 (41%) were "superficial". The prevalence of a positive ECG-stress tests for the anterior myocardial region was significantly higher in patients with LAD myocardial bridges (34/50; 68%) compared to those without (28/144; 19.4%) (p < 0.001). There was no difference between "superficial" and "deep" LAD myocardial bridges in regard to a positive treadmill ECG-stress test. Typical angina was rare with 6%.

Conclusion

LAD myocardial bridges are common findings and can possibly explain a positive exercise ECG-stress test for anterior myocardial ischemia. Intramyocardial LAD segments show mild-to-moderate luminal narrowing at rest, which is higher during end-systolic phase.

### Contrast stress echocardiography findings in myocardial bridging compared to normal coronary course, with and without coronary artery disease [^112FoRX7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Myocardial bridging (MB) correlation with ischemia remains a diagnostic challenge. There is a lack of studies that have assessed MB using contrast stress echo and compared the findings with those in patients demonstrating a normal coronary course, with or without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

We evaluated all consecutive patients who underwent contrast stress echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) due to suspected symptoms of CAD within 3 months in Parma Hospital. Coronary computed tomography angiography served as the reference standard for detecting MB and obstructive CAD. The patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) MB and no evidence of obstructive CAD (MB group, N = 64), (2) no evidence of obstructive CAD or MB (NoCAD group, N = 135), (3) obstructive CAD without MB (CAD group, N = 68).

Results

The coronary flow velocity reserve in the LAD (CFVR-LAD) was reduced in the MB and CAD groups, measuring 1.91 ± 0.21 and 1.82 ± 0.28, respectively, whereas it was 2.27 ± 0.34 in the NoCAD group (P < .001). The MB and CAD groups exhibited a higher prevalence of reversible myocardial perfusion defects (rMPDs) compared to the NoCAD group (57.8% vs 64.7% vs 3.7%, P < .001). Reversible wall motion abnormalities were frequently observed in the CAD group and rarely found in the MB and NoCAD groups (47.1% vs 18.8% vs 4.4%, P < .001). In multivariable analyses, the presence of MB was independently associated with reduced CFVR-LAD (odds ratio = 14.55; 95% CI, 6.84–30.93; P < .001) and the presence of rMPD (odds ratio = 37.96; 95% CI, 13.49–106.84; P < .001). Patients with deep MB (> 2 mm depth) and very deep MB (≥ 5 mm depth) exhibited significantly greater CFVR-LAD reduction and rMPD than those with superficial MB.

Conclusions

Myocardial bridging is capable of inducing rMPD and reducing CFVR-LAD similar to obstructive CAD. The depth of the MB correlates with the abnormalities found in the stress echo evaluation. Contrast stress echo may serve as a valuable noninvasive tool for evaluating patients with MB.

### Computed tomography coronary angiography in patients without known coronary artery disease can demonstrate possible non-cardiovascular causes of non-acute retrosternal chest pain [^117UFuCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The evaluation of non-cardiac structures is a key point in these patients: chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists after a normal cardiac study. Patient management is often inefficient and associated with a significant economic burden. Onuma et al. found extracardiac findings on CT scans considered to be sufficient to explain the symptoms by providing an alternative diagnosis in about 16% (32/201) of patients in whom CAD was ruled out. In our study, instead, the percentage of patients with extracardiac diseases possibly explaining symptoms was 35%, which is clearly higher. Of note, cardiac CT can be performed with an acceptably low radiation dose and can be useful for symptomatic patients even at low risk of CAD.

As expected, we did not find any significant association between the kind of chest pain and disease, making CTCA a problem-solving diagnostic tool. In particular, patient management was immediately changed for one patient with pneumothorax and one patient with cholecystitis and pneumonia, avoiding potential delay in patient care or even misdiagnosis. Also, patients with suspected myocarditis and no coronary stenosis at CTCA (seven patients in our series) were promptly treated.

Notably, large discrepancies were found in the literature between the prevalence of clinically relevant findings and the number of findings that actually led to therapeutic or diagnostic interventions. Our patients with CAD evidence at CTCA all underwent a cardiologic evaluation and were treated with percutaneous revascularization or medical therapy (whenever possible), confirming the reliability of CTCA. We noted a difference in the management of patients with myocardial bridging, a benign condition that requires treatment when symptomatic, frequently detected at CT (21% in our population). While most of these patients were treated if evaluated by cardiologists, they were almost never treated if evaluated by general practitioners, probably because this is an unknown condition for non-cardiologists.

Our study has limitations. The first is the relatively small sample size (n = 106). However, patient selection was narrowed to only patients experiencing retrosternal chest pain, without previous CAD history. Second, the relationship between chest pain and CT findings (especially hiatus hernias and myocardial bridging) was not always completely clarified by our follow up. As a consequence, the attribute of clinical improvement to the treatment has some degree of uncertainty. In any case, the suspicion of non-cardiovascular disease from CT findings can be a valid aid for clinical decision-making.

### Myocardial bridging as evaluated by 16 row MDCT [^115AWPHM]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to find out the prevalence, appearance and clinical symptoms of myocardial bridging (MB) by MDCT coronary angiography (CTA).

Materials and Methods

A total of 280 (50 females) consecutive patients followed with coronary artery disease or postoperative stent and bypass control, underwent CTA performed by 16-MDCT scanner between January 2006 and April 2006. Short axis multiplanar reformatted images were evaluated. MBs were classified as complete and incomplete bridges with respect to continuity of the myocardium over the tunneled segment of left anterior descending artery (LAD) in interventricular groove and the cut-off value is 1.3mm. Patients diagnosed with MB on CTA who had prior catheter angiography studies were re-evaluated for the presence of MB.

Results

One hundred and twenty MBs [98 (81.6%) on LAD, 2 (1.6%) on diagonal branch, 11 (9.1%) on obtuse marginal, 4 (3.3%) on right coronary artery, 5 (4.1%) on ramus intermedius artery] were detected in 108 (38.5%) patients. Eighty-five (70.8%) of bridged segments in 79 (28.2%) patients were complete and the rest [35 (29.2%) in 34 (12.1%) patients] were incomplete. In 12 patients two MBs (either on different arteries or on the same artery) were detected. The length of bridged segments in patients with complete and incomplete MBs varied between 4–50.9mm (mean 18mm) and 4–37.3mm (mean 13.6mm), respectively, and the depth of myocardium over the artery ranged between 1–6.4mm (mean 2.3mm) and 1–1.2mm (mean 1mm), respectively. Thirty (27.7%) out of 108 patients, in whom MB was detected on CTA, were found to have correlative catheter angiography studies, retrospectively and MB was detected only in 4 (13.3%) out of 30 patients.

Conclusion

MDCT coronary angiography is a non-invasive, efficient method in the diagnosis of MB avoiding the procedural risks that catheter angiography carries. MDCT coronary angiography allows direct visualization of the bridge itself and may thus give the opportunity to differentiate between complete and incomplete myocardial bridges.

### Nomogram to predict recurrent chest pain in patients with myocardial bridging [^1158tBGF]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with myocardial bridging (MB) frequently experience recurrent chest pain, even in those without coronary heart disease. This study aims to predict the risk of recurrent chest pain in patients with MB by using a novel predictive nomogram.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled 250 patients with acute chest pain who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) between January and December 2018, including 111 patients with MB and 139 control patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to screen for significant parameters that were included to develop a novel predictive nomogram model. Receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses were used to evaluate the performance and clinical utility of the nomogram.

Results

A predictive nomogram was constructed in 111 patients with MB, 34 of whom (30.9%) had recurrent chest pain. The significant predictors screened out by the LASSO regression included age, sex, branch type MB, and systolic compression index. The area under the curves (AUCs) for recurrent chest pain at 12, 24, and 36 months were 0.688, 0.742, and 0.729, respectively, indicating remarkable accuracy of the nomogram. The calibration curve and decision curve analyses indicated a good agreement with the observations and utility of the nomogram.

Conclusions

This study presents a high-accuracy nomogram to predict recurrent chest pain in patients with MB. This model incorporates clinical risk factors and CT imaging features and can be conveniently used to facilitate the individualised prediction.

Key Points

- Symptomatic patients with myocardial bridging often present with recurrent chest pain.
- The potential predictors of recurrent chest pain in patients with myocardial bridging were age, sex, branch type MB, and systolic compression index.
- Nomogram based on clinical CT imaging features is valuable to predict recurrent chest pain in patients with myocardial bridging.

### Predictors of discordance between CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and △ CT-FFR in deep coronary myocardial bridging [^115ynSKh]. Clinical Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the performance between CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and ΔCT-FFR measurements in patients with deep myocardial bridging (MB) along the left anterior descending artery, and explore the potential predictors of discordance.

Methods

175 patients with deep MB who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and CT-FFR assessment were included. Clinical, anatomical and atherosclerotic variables were compared between patients with concordant and discordant CT-FFR and ΔCT-FFR.

Results

30.9% patients were discordantly classified, in which 94.4% patients were classified as CT-FFR+/△CT-FFR-. The discordant group showed significantly higher upstream stenosis degree, distance from MB to the aorta, △CT-FFR (P 0.007, 0.009 and 0.002, respectively), and lower CT-FFR (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, upstream stenosis degree (P 0.023, OR 1.628, 95% CI: 1.068–2.481) and distance from MB to the aorta (P 0.001, OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.016–1.064) were independent predictors for discordance between CT-FFR and ΔCT-FFR.

Conclusion

The discordance between CT-FFR and ΔCT-FFR measurements underscores the challenges in clinical decision-making, necessitating tailored approaches for MB evaluation.

### Coronary angiography by computed tomography: coronary imaging evolves [^111qdDqE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Rapid technological advances have facilitated high-resolution noninvasive coronary angiography using multislice computed tomography. Appropriateness guidelines recently have been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and endorsed by several imaging specialty societies. Clinical studies are now available supporting the use of this method in selected diagnostic situations, particularly when the exclusion of coronary artery disease is of paramount clinical concern.

### Non-invasive imaging of myocardial bridge by coronary computed tomography angiography: the value of transluminal attenuation gradient to predict significant dynamic compression [^115Wr4vL]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the diagnostic value of transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG) measured by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for identifying relevant dynamic compression of myocardial bridge (MB).

Methods

Patients with confirmed MB who underwent both CCTA and ICA within one month were retrospectively included. TAG was defined as the linear regression coefficient between luminal attenuation and distance. The TAG of MB vessel, length and depth of MB were measured and correlated with the presence and degree of dynamic compression observed at ICA. Systolic compression ≧50% was considered significant.

Results

302 patients with confirmed MB lesions were included. TAG was lowest (-17.4 ± 6.7 HU/10 mm) in patients with significant dynamic compression and highest in patients without MB compression (-9.5 ± 4.3 HU/10 mm, p < 0.001). Linear correlation revealed relation between the percentage of systolic compression and TAG (Pearson correlation, r = -0.52, p < 0.001) and no significant relation between the percentage of systolic compression and MB depth or length. ROC curve analysis determined the best cut-off value of TAG as -14.8HU/10 mm (area under curve = 0.813, 95% confidence interval = 0.764–0.855, p < 0.001), which yielded high diagnostic accuracy (82.1%, 248/302).

Conclusions

The degree of ICA-assessed systolic compression of MB significantly correlates with TAG but not MB depth or length.

Key Points

- TAG is associated with the extent of dynamic compression of MB.
- TAG is superior to depth and length for identifying dynamic compression.
- Cut-off value of TAG as -14.8HU/10 mm yielded high predictive value.

### Diagnostic and prognostic benefits of computed tomography coronary angiography using the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance within a randomised trial [^116w5mGv]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

The SCOT-HEART study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating the role of CTCA in patients referred to a specialist clinic with suspected angina due to CHD. The study designand principal findingshave previously been reported. The study population comprised individuals without a documented history of prior CHD referred for assessment of suspected stable angina of recent onset who were randomised 1:1 to CTCA plus standard care or standard care alone (see online supplementary material). Chest pain symptoms were defined as typical angina, atypical angina or non-anginal according to established criteria (see online supplementary table 1). An abnormal resting ECG was determined by the presence of any of the following: pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block or either ST segment or T wave abnormalities. As per the 2016 NICE guideline recommendations, participants were categorised into two groups: those with non-anginal chest pain and a normal ECG (non-anginal cohort) and those with either typical or atypical chest pain, or non-anginal chest pain and an abnormal ECG (possible angina cohort).

Outcomes

The primary (diagnostic) endpoint was clinician certainty (yes/no vs unlikely/probable) in the diagnosis of angina secondary to CHD at 6 weeks. The prognostic endpoint for this study was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Additional secondary endpoints included the requirement for invasive coronary angiography, changes in clinician prescribing of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, coronary revascularisation, all-cause death and non-fatal stroke.

Outcome data were updated on 29 June 2016 and were identified via record linkage from regional and national registries provided by the Information and Statistics Division of the National Health Service (NHS) Scotland and when appropriate, confirmed by review of patient health records. Within Scotland, this has previously been demonstrated as a robust approach to clinical trial endpoint identification. Categorisation for analysis was performed while masked to randomised allocation.

### Frequency and significance of coronary artery disease and myocardial bridging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1123gZag]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The etiology of chest pain in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) is diverse and includes coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as HC-specific causes. Myocardial bridging (MB) has been associated with HC, chest pain, and accelerated atherosclerosis. We compared HC patients with age-, gender- and CAD pre-test probability-matched outpatients presenting with chest pain to investigate differences in the presence of MB and CAD using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We studied 84 HC patients who underwent CCTA and compared these with 168 matched controls (age 54 ± 11 years, 70% men, pre-test probability 12% [5% to 32%]). MB, calcium score, plaque morphology and presence and extent of CAD were assessed for each patient. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences between cases and controls. MB was more often seen in HC patients (50% vs 25%, p < 0.001). Calcium score and the presence of obstructive CAD were similar in both groups (9 [0 to 225] vs 4 [0 to 82] and 18% vs 19%; p = 0.22 and p = 0.82). In the HC group, MB was associated with pathogenic DNA variants (p = 0.04), but not with the presence of chest pain (74% vs 76%, p = 0.8), nor with worse outcome (log-rank p = 0.30). In conclusion, the prevalence and extent of CAD was equal among patients with and without HC, demonstrating that pre-test risk prediction using the CAD Consortium clinical risk score performs well in HC patients. MB was twice as prevalent in the HC group compared with matched controls, but was not associated with chest pain or decreased event-free survival in these patients.

### Characterizing mechanisms of ischemia in patients with myocardial bridges [^113Ar42h]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Angina with nonobstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA) is a common clinical problem and comprises several distinct pathophysiological entities, including coronary microvascular disease (CMD), coronary artery spasm, and myocardial bridging. Myocardial bridging due to intramyocardial passage of varying lengths of an epicardial artery is a common anatomic variant, found in up to 30% of patients on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) imaging, predominantly in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery at the mid vessel. The intramyocardial segment of the vessel is known as the tunneled segment. Historically, myocardial bridges (MBs) have been considered a benign entity as myocardial perfusion predominantly occurs during diastole and MBs are thought to only alter vessel caliber during systole. However, growing evidence suggests that MBs are not always benign and have been associated with chronic intermittent angina, as well as acute ischemic presentations. Several mechanisms have been postulated, including delayed decompression of the tunneled segment in diastole leading to luminal narrowing akin to obstructive coronary artery disease, predisposition to coronary artery spasm, increased propensity to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease proximal to the bridged segment due to perturbed wall shear stress, and the venturi effect leading to reduced septal blood flow. However, while a handful of studies have assessed the physiological response to adenosine and dobutamine stress, using pressure as a surrogate of flow, coronary flow during exercise has not been specifically and systematically evaluated in patients with MBs. Our study aimed to characterize the mechanisms that lead to myocardial ischemia in patients with ANOCA and a MB (MB group) during physical exercise using wave intensity analysis to describe patterns of cardiac-coronary coupling. We compared these findings to those in patients with ANOCA but no MB, in turn classified as patients with CMD (CMD group: coronary flow reserve [CFR], < 2.5) or normal CFR (reference group: CFR, ≥ 2.5), respectively. Better understanding of the mechanisms causing ischemia may allow the development of stratified therapies for this underserved patient population.

### Recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^1167JUGq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — evaluation of chest discomfort for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD): For patients with a low probability of CAD (< 15%), a conservative initial approach without testing is appropriate; for most patients with a low-to-intermediate probability (15–50%), coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an effective approach to evaluate for epicardial CAD or myocardial bridging, noting that CCTA tends to overestimate severity compared to invasive angiography and that moderate angiographic stenosis by CT or cardiac catheterization is in many cases not functionally significant. In case of a high probability or known CAD, a functional test may be more efficient, and because of technical limitations of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and stress echocardiography in HCM, quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion techniques are preferable when available. Based on available data, it is reasonable to reserve invasive angiography for cases of severe CAD on CCTA (left main or triple vessel disease) or functional imaging or for patients with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy; functional assessment of CAD for revascularization may be considered before intervention, either by invasive means (fractional flow reserve [FFR]), a noninvasive functional test, or CT-FFR in case a CCTA of adequate quality is available.

### Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus document on myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging [^114FEATr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) indications with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) — Coronary CTA has high rule‑out value for non‑obstructive disease, and rest‑only CTP is discouraged; addition of CTP to CTA is recommended in selected higher‑risk or indeterminate cases. Coronary CTA alone has a very high negative predictive value to exclude myocardial ischemia in the presence of no CAD or a non‑obstructive stenosis (≤ 50% severity). Hence a rest CTP examination alone is generally not appropriate to assess for myocardial ischemia and should be avoided altogether or only used with caution. We recommend that myocardial CTP may be added to coronary CTA when patients are at high atherosclerotic risk for obstructive coronary artery disease, including those with prior coronary intervention or significant calcification, or when there is a stenosis of indeterminate functional significance.

### Stress cardiomyopathy in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial bridging [^112G17J6]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Stress cardiomyopathy is an acquired cardiomyopathy of unknown aetiology, but it most likely reflects the cardiac response to a surge of catecholamines. It affects ∼1–2% of all patients presenting with an initial diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction. It is characterised by three distinctive features: (1) the presence of acute left ventricular wall dysfunction, (2) the absence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease and (3) the rapid improvement of left ventricular systolic function. The inhospital mortality with this entity is ∼1%, and complete recovery of the left ventricular dysfunction is seen in most patients by 4–8 weeks.

The presence of myocardial bridging involving the midleft anterior descendant coronary artery has been shown to be associated with stress cardiomyopathy. In a study of 42 women with criteria of stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial bridging of the midleft anterior descendant coronary artery was noted on coronary angiogram in 17 cases (40%) and by CT angiography in 15 (with no myocardial bridging initially detected by coronary angiography). It was noted that, when compared with controls, there was a significantly higher incidence of myocardial bridging in patients with stress cardiomyopathy, p < 0.007.

The presence of myocardial bridging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs in approximately one-third of children, and in 15% of adults. The data on stress cardiomyopathy occurring in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are quite limited consisting mainly of isolated case reports. Moreover, the finding of stress cardiomyopathy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial bridging is quite rare. A search of the literature yielded a case with similar findings as the case presented. This was a woman aged 54 years with quadriplegia, secondary to advanced motor neuron disease, who presented with chest pain and hypotension. Echocardiogram performed revealed apical ballooning of the left ventricle, septal thickness of 19 mm and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Coronary artery angiography demonstrated a muscle bridge at the midleft anterior descending coronary artery and apical akinesis of the left ventricle. Another case of a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with midcavity obliteration, who developed a stress cardiomyopathy, demonstrated the development of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The authors concluded that in these cases, one may have a 'moving left ventricular obstruction'.

Learning points

Stress cardiomyopathy may occur in cases with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Stress cardiomyopathy may develop in cases with myocardial bridging at the left anterior descending artery.
Do hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and/or myocardial bridging predispose to stress cardiomyopathy?

### SCCT 2021 expert consensus document on coronary computed tomographic angiography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115bJW2n]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2020). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in patients with stable chest pain — For diagnosis, CTA was superior to functional testing or standard of care, with the SCOT-HEART trial reporting a 2-fold increase in diagnostic certainty. In SCOT-HEART 5-year follow-up, early increases in invasive angiography and revascularization were offset and by 5 years there was no difference; beyond the first year CTA was associated with less invasive coronary angiography (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.95; p = 0.022) and less coronary revascularization (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90; p = 0.015). For symptoms, CAPP and CRESCENT reported reduced angina after 12 months, with similar improvements in SCOT-HEART especially among those with normal coronary arteries or those with obstructive disease who underwent coronary revascularization. For clinical outcomes, although there was no difference in the primary composite, CTA appeared to be associated with a lower rate of death or myocardial infarction at 12 months, and meta-analysis reported reduced myocardial infarction with CTA (hazard ratio, 0.69 [95% confidence intervals, 0.49 to 0.98]) but no effect on overall mortality.

### Antiplatelet therapy in myocardial bridge: insights from the RIALTO registry [^114rasj9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our work has several limitations. First, the observational design of the study poses inherent constraints. The choice of antiplatelet treatment was at the discretion of the physician and could potentially be biased by several clinical or angiographic features that we cannot ascertain. Second, given the ambispective nature of the study, no sample size calculation was performed. Therefore, the low prevalence of this coronary anomaly along with the low number of ischemic and hemorrhagic events may have underpowered the multivariable and survival analyses. Third, angiography alone is less accurate than other diagnostic methods, such as coronary computed tomography angiography and intracoronary imaging (ie, intravascular ultrasound) in detecting MB, potentially resulting in under‐ or overestimations of the true prevalence of this coronary anomaly. However, at present, there are no established guidelines for the diagnosis of MB in daily clinical practice. Fourth, an extensive assessment of the hemodynamic impact of MB was not routinely performed, as this represents a real‐world study. Nevertheless, the prognostic impact of a full‐physiology evaluation in this subset of patients will be assessed in the ongoing RIALTO PRO (Reassessment of Myocardial Bridge Towards Personalized Medicine) trial (NCT06281067). Thus, our results should be interpreted with all these issues considered, waiting for future research on this topic. However, to the best of our knowledge, our registry is the first to specifically evaluate the real‐world use of SAPT in primary prevention and its impact on clinical events in patients with MB at a long‐term follow‐up. Larger studies, preferably with a randomized design, are urgently needed to confirm our results.

### Recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^112vAs4d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Coronary computed tomography angiography in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — illustrative findings show a case demonstrating no atherosclerotic coronary disease with myocardial bridging of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery and compression of the vessel during systole, a large septal branch perforating the proximal hypertrophic interventricular septum, and an atrial lead electrode causing limited streak artifacts near the right coronary artery.

### Prevalence of myocardial bridging in patients with myocardial infarction and nonobstructed coronary arteries [^111UHUVp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of acute myocardial infarction and nonobstructed coronary arteries (MINOCA) are incompletely understood. Myocardial bridging (MB) is usually considered a benign congenital variant, but serious complications have been reported. MB has also been proposed as a cause of takotsubo syndrome (TS). We aimed to examine whether MB was more frequent in patients with MINOCA or TS than in age- and gender-matched controls and to compare the MB detection rates of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with MINOCA (n = 57) and age- and gender-matched controls (n = 58), aged 45 to 70 were enrolled. Myocarditis was excluded by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with TS (n = 15) were considered as a subgroup and therefore not excluded. Patients with MINOCA underwent ICA and all study participants underwent coronary CTA. All examinations were reviewed with focus on MB. Among 57 MINOCA patients, 15 MINOCA patients with TS and 58 controls, MB was demonstrated in 28 patients (49%), 8 patients (53%), and 26 patients (45%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences regarding the prevalence of MB or the type, location, length, or thickness of MB. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between the detection rates of coronary CTA and ICA that demonstrated MB in 54 subjects (47%) and 13 subjects (23%), respectively. In conclusion, MB was frequent with a similar prevalence in patients with MINOCA, patients with TS and controls. This suggests that there is no causal link between MB and MINOCA or TS. Furthermore, coronary CTA detects MB at a significantly higher rate than ICA.

### Computed tomography coronary angiography in patients without known coronary artery disease can demonstrate possible non-cardiovascular causes of non-acute retrosternal chest pain [^1161qJWc]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Image analysis

All of the CT examinations were diagnostic, including the six cases of patients who had irregular heart rhythm during images acquisition: 65–70 bpm in the presence of 1–2 ectopic beats (n = 3); atrial fibrillation (n = 2); multiple ventricular ectopic beats (n = 1). The heart rate was 62 ± 10 bpm (mean ± SD; range: 40–94 bpm). Thirty-five percent (37/106) of patients did not present any pathological findings at the CT scan, 30% (32/106) were diagnosed with only coronary disease (Fig. 1), and 22% (23/106) with only non-cardiovascular disease (Fig. 2). Thirteen percent (14/106) of patients presented both a coronary and ≥ 1 non-cardiovascular disease: myocardial bridging and hiatal hernia (8/106); significant CAD and hiatal hernia (3/106); significant CAD, myocardial bridging, and hiatal hernia (2/106); malignant coronary anomaly and hiatal hernia (1/106). Table 1 presents all of the CT findings in relation to chest pain. The main possible causes of chest pain were hiatal hernia (33%, 35/106), significant CAD (23%, 24/106), and myocardial coronary bridging (22%, 22/106).

Table 1
Association between computed tomography (CT) results and chest pain among the 106 patients of the study population

Almost 80% of patients (82/106) presented with normal coronary arteries or minimal/mild CAD, the majority of whom presented with atypical pain (55/82; 67%). Among patients with typical pain (36/106), 25% (9/36) had significant CAD. No significant association was demonstrated between the kind of chest pain (typical versus atypical) and any disease detected at CT (coronary p = 0.955; non-cardiovascular p = 0.590).

### Characterizing mechanisms of ischemia in patients with myocardial bridges [^111GSEJr]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary Endothelial Dysfunction

Only a few studies have investigated the prevalence of coronary endothelial dysfunction in patients with MBs. In a study by Pargaonkar et al85% of patients with a MB had epicardial endothelial dysfunction using the same diagnostic criteria as our study, whereas Sara et alhave reported epicardial endothelial dysfunction in 60% and microvascular endothelial dysfunction in 58% of patients with a MB. Sara et al reported colocalization of epicardial endothelial dysfunction within the tunneled segments, suggesting a pathophysiological link between the 2. Alterations in wall shear stress have been purported to be the mechanism predisposing the tunneled segments to epicardial endothelial dysfunction. Lifelong systolic compression results in high wall shear stress within the tunneled segment and local structural changes of the endothelial cells, leading to reduced nitric oxide production.MMI was independently associated with epicardial endothelial dysfunction in our study. Forsdahl et alhave previously reported that MMI > 31 on CTCA predicts dobutamine diastolic fractional flow reserve < 0.76 with good diagnostic accuracy. Dobutamine diastolic fractional flow reserve < 0.76, in turn, predicts the presence of inducible ischemia on exercise stress echocardiography. These findings have significant clinical implications, as an ischemic substrate can potentially be identified on the basis of the characteristics of a MB on CCTA.

In summary, we have demonstrated that patients with myocardial bridging have 3 main mechanisms of ischemia, namely the hemodynamic consequences of the tunneled segment on accelerating wave energy, and endothelium-independent and endothelium-dependent microvascular dysfunction. In our study, 93% of patients in the MB group had an identifiable substrate for ischemia, with a significant overlap between them. Overall, 73% of patients in the MB group had impaired coronary perfusion efficiency during exercise (driven by deleterious mechanical effects of the tunneled segment on accelerating wave energy), 47% had endothelium-independent microvascular dysfunction, and 83% had endothelium-dependent dysfunction (epicardial and microvascular;). As these ischemic substrates may represent distinct therapeutic targets, comprehensive coronary physiology assessment should be advocated in patients with ANOCA and myocardial bridging who have limiting symptoms to both confirm and identify the specific substrate for ischemia.

### Diagnosis of coronary stenosis with CT angiography comparison of automated computer diagnosis with expert readings [^115m4312]. Academic Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To compare computer-generated interpretation of coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) by commercially available COR Analyzer software with expert human interpretation.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act‑compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Among 225 consecutive cCTA examinations, 207 were of adequate quality for automated evaluation. COR Analyzer interpretation was compared to human expert interpretation for detection of stenosis defined as ≥ 50% vessel diameter reduction in the left main, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (LCX), right coronary artery (RCA), or a branch vessel (diagonal, ramus, obtuse marginal, or posterior descending artery).

Results

Among 207 cases evaluated by COR Analyzer, human expert interpretation identified 48 patients with stenosis. COR Analyzer identified 44/48 patients (sensitivity 92%) with a specificity of 70%, a negative predictive value of 97% and a positive predictive value of 48%. COR Analyzer agreed with the expert interpretation in 75% of patients. With respect to individual segments, COR Analyzer detected 9/10 left main lesions, 33/34 LAD lesions, 14/15 LCX lesions, 27/31 RCA lesions, and 8/11 branch lesions. False-positive interpretations were localized to the left main (n = 16), LAD (n = 26), LCX (n = 21), RCA (n = 21), and branch vessels (n = 23), and were related predominantly to calcified vessels, blurred vessels, misidentification of vessels and myocardial bridges.

Conclusions

Automated computer interpretation of cCTA with COR Analyzer provides high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of coronary disease in major coronary arteries as well as first-order arterial branches. False-positive automated interpretations are related to anatomic and image quality considerations.

Table 2
Study outcomes

MPI Myocardial perfusion imaging; CCTA coronary computed tomographic angiography; CABG coronary artery bypass grafting; PCI percutaneous coronary intervention

* Adjusted for recruiting centers and symptom status

† Adjusted for recruiting centers, symptom status, and physician preference of procedure at baseline

‡ Includes all patients whose outcome data were available, analyzed by the group to which they were initially randomized

§ Excludes those who did not undergo the allocated diagnostic procedure, or underwent the procedure 180 days after randomization

Table 3
Reasons for further non-invasive testing

* One patient had a dilated left ventricle and another had an equivocal perfusion defect (both studies were reported as normal)

† One patient had multiple mild lesions and the others were suspected to have microvascular disease causing angina. All 4 patients had normal subsequent non-invasive test results. No patient had coronary angiography

‡ This group includes 10 patients with severe (≥ 70% diameter stenosis), 5 with intermediate (50%-69% stenosis), and 2 with mild (30%-49%) lesions where the clinician was uncertain about the relationship of the lesions to symptom status. This group also includes one patient with a myocardial bridge involving the left anterior descending artery and 3 patients who could not complete the procedure (2 because of very high calcium scores and 1 because of an allergic reaction to contrast agent)

There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients undergoing coronary angiography at 6 months or any revascularization procedure at 12 months (Table 2). One patient in the CCTA arm died during the follow-up. Two patients in the MPI arm and one in the CCTA arm had recurrent ischemia. One additional patient in the MPI arm underwent unplanned PCI. Overall, the composite of death, nonfatal MI, recurrent ischemia, or unplanned revascularization occurred in 3 (2.3%) patients in the MPI arm and 2 (1.6%) in the CCTA arm.

### Fractional flow reserve derived from CCTA may have a prognostic role in myocardial bridging [^112PNQ6p]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the feasibility of fractional flow reserve (cFFR) derivation from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in patients with myocardial bridging (MB), its relationship with MB anatomical features, and clinical relevance.

Methods

This retrospective study included 120 patients with MB of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 41 controls. MB location, length, depth, muscle index, instance, and stenosis rate were measured. cFFR values were compared between superficial MB (≤ 2 mm), deep MB (> 2 mm), and control groups. Factors associated with abnormal cFFR values (≤ 0.80) were analyzed.

Results

MB patients demonstrated lower cFFR values in MB and distal segments than controls (all p < 0.05). A significant cFFR difference was only found in the MB segment during systole between superficial (0.94, 0.90–0.96) and deep MB (0.91, 0.83–0.95) (p = 0.018). Abnormal cFFR values were found in 69 (57.5%) MB patients (29 [49.2%] superficial vs. 40 [65.6%] deep; p = 0.069). MB length (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.10; p = 0.001) and systolic stenosis (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.01–1.07; p = 0.021) were the main predictors for abnormal cFFR, with an area under the curve of 0.774 (95% CI 0.689–0.858; p < 0.001). MB patients with abnormal cFFR reported more typical angina (18.8% vs 3.9%, p = 0.023) than patients with normal values.

Conclusion

MB patients showed lower cFFR values than controls. Abnormal cFFR values have a positive association with symptoms of typical angina. MB length and systolic stenosis demonstrate moderate predictive value for an abnormal cFFR value. KEY POINTS:
- MB patients showed lower cFFR values than controls.
- Abnormal cFFR values have a positive association with typical angina symptoms.
- MB length and systolic stenosis demonstrate moderate predictive value for an abnormal cFFR value.

### The role of myocardial perfusion imaging in evaluating patients with myocardial bridging [^117Qu6qZ]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Myocardial bridging (MB) is a common, congenital coronary-abnormality that is found on average in one out of every three adults at autopsy (Moehlenkamp et al in Circulation, 106:2616–2622, 2002; Erbel et al in Circulation, 120:357–359, 2009). However, its clinical significance and impact on myocardial ischemia remains controversial and unclear. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to assess myocardial ischemia in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, and is frequently performed to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of MB. This study was undertaken to determine the use of MPI in evaluating MB and to identify the characteristics of MB associated with perfusion defects using MPI.

Methods and Results

Thirty-nine patients with MB of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery as documented by coronary angiography (CA) were enrolled for this study. None of the patients exhibited other forms of heart disease as determined by both CA and stress-rest MPI, no later than 1 month prior to the study. Using MPI, eight patients (20.5%) were found to have perfusion defects in the corresponding myocardial areas. This frequency was significantly higher when compared with results obtained by stress electrocardiogram. The difference in the mean systolic narrowing of bridging segments was statistically significant between patients with and without ischemia. The positive rate of reversible defects in patients with severe systolic narrowing was significantly higher than in patients with mild-to-moderate systolic narrowing. However, there was no significant difference either between the mean length of the tunneled artery in patients with and without abnormal MPI or the positive rate of abnormal MPI in patients with different locations of the tunneled artery.

Conclusions

MPI is an effective, noninvasive technique for the evaluation of patients with MB. The myocardial ischemia that resulted from bridging is associated more closely with the degree of systolic narrowing than with the length of tunneled artery or the location of MB.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

Of 418 patients screened, 141 were found to meet clinical eligibility criteria. Once these patients underwent invasive physiological assessment, 105 were found to have ANOCA, of which 73 did not have a MB and 32 did have a MB. After excluding patients on account of poor Doppler signals or inability to pass the Combowire into the distal LAD artery, 92 patients were recruited into the study: 30 in the MB group, 33 in the CMD group, and 29 in the reference group (Figure 2). The groups were well matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. There were more women in the CMD and control groups, compared with the MB group (Table 1). Twelve patients in the MB group underwent a CCTA scan before coronary angiography; in this cohort, the tunneled segment length, depth, and MMI were 29 ± 9, 2 ± 1, and 79 ± 30 mm, respectively.

Table 1.

Whole Cardiac Cycle Physiology Measurements

Epicardial physiology measurements confirmed the absence of obstructive coronary disease in all patients (as per eligibility criteria), but the MB group had lower Pd/Pa and fractional flow reserve values than the reference group. CFR in the MB group was 2.5 ± 0.5, which was lower than the reference group (3.2 ± 0.6) but higher than the CMD group (2.0 ± 0.3; P < 0.001); 14 patients (47%) in the MB group had a CFR < 2.5. Minimal microvascular resistance was similar between the MB and reference groups (Table 2).

Table 2.
Coronary Physiology Parameters

Patients with a MB had the lowest exercise Pd/Pa (0.89 [0.87–0.93]; P < 0.001 versus both CMD and reference groups). The MB and CMD groups had similar exercise flow reserve (1.5 [1.2–1.9] versus 1.4 [1.2–1.6]; P = 0.150), both were lower than the reference group (Table 2).

### The prevalence and anatomical patterns of intramuscular coronary arteries: a coronary computed tomography angiographic study [^111hcPcv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to report prevalence and radiologic patterns of intramuscular coronary arteries (myocardial bridging) on coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA).

Background

Reported prevalence of intramuscular coronary arteries varies between 5% and 86% in autopsy and 0.8% and 4.9% in coronary angiography. Intramuscular coronary arteries can cause technical problems during coronary bypass surgery, including inadvertent perforation of the right ventricle.

Methods

One hundred and eighteen consecutive patients were studied with CCTA using Brilliance 40/64 multidetector computed tomography (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, Ohio). Parameters evaluated were number, length, and depth of intramuscular coronary segments; diameter and evidence of atherosclerosis in the involved artery proximal and within the intramuscular segment; and its course in relation to the interventricular septum and right ventricular wall.

Results

Forty-seven intramuscular segments were identified in 36 of 118 (30.5%) patients. Most were located in mid left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), 27 of 47 (57%), and distal LAD, 7 of 47 (15%). The CCTA features in the LAD showed 3 patterns: superficial septal, 10 of 34 (29.4%); deep septal, 14 of 34 (41.1%); and right ventricular type, 10 of 34 (29.4%). Intramuscular segment length ranged from 13 to 40 mm. Coronary diameter proximal and within the affected segment was 2.2 ± 0.5 mm versus 1.6 ± 0.6 mm for the LAD, and 1.9 ± 0.3 mm versus 1.5 ± 0.6 mm for the remaining arteries, respectively. Depth ranged from 0.1 to 5.6 mm.

Conclusions

Prevalence of intramuscular coronary arteries on CCTA is in concordance with most pathological reports and higher than in angiographic series. The CCTA clearly showed presence, course, and anatomical features of intramuscular coronary arteries. Coronary computed tomographic angiography may provide potentially useful information in the preoperative evaluation of candidates for coronary bypass surgery.

### Interplay between myocardial bridging and coronary spasm in patients with myocardial ischemia and non-obstructive coronary arteries: pathogenic and prognostic implications [^115qdsYj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, Italy, undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia with angiographic evidence of NOCAD (angiographically normal coronary arteries or diffuse atherosclerosis with stenosis < 50% or fractional flow reserve > 0.80) and undergoing an intracoronary provocative test with acetylcholine from September 2015 to December 2019. There was no overlap in the enrollment of patients with a previous study published by our group. We enrolled both patients admitted with suspected stable angina and patients with suspected MINOCA. Patients with stable angina were defined as patients admitted with a stable pattern of typical chest pain at rest, on exertion, or a combination of both, without signs of myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with MINOCA were diagnosed based on their reporting of one or more episodes of chest pain at rest, typical enough to suggest a cardiac ischaemic origin in the previous 24 hours, associated with ST‐segment and/or T wave abnormalities on the ECG and detection of raise and fall of serum troponin‐T levels with at least 1 value exceeding the 99th percentile of a normal reference population with an upper limit of 0.014 μg/L. Among patients presenting with MINOCA, we excluded those with obvious causes of MI other than suspected coronary vasomotor abnormalities and in whom provocative testing was not performed. In particular, we excluded 66 patients with a diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome confirmed by left ventricle angiography, 40 patients with a suspected diagnosis of myocarditis (diagnosis based on the presence of signs and symptoms of inflammatory activation associated with wall motion abnormalities at left ventricular angiography and echocardiogram suggesting a non‐epicardial pattern confirmed by subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), 109 patients with type 2 MI with mechanism other than suspected vasospasm (eg, pulmonary embolism, evidence of coronary thrombosis on an unstable plaque confirmed by optical coherence tomography, cardiotoxic drug administration, hypertensive crisis, or severe valvulopathies). Finally, 310 patients who underwent acetylcholine intracoronary provocative test were included in the analysis (Figure 1). The study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study was approved by the institutional review committee. All patients gave written informed consent to coronary angiography and provocative tests and to be included in the follow‐up study.

### Coronary computed tomography angiography in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^114HJn9a]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is defined by stable anatomical atherosclerotic and functional alterations of epicardial vessels or microcirculation, focuses on managing intermittent angina symptoms and preventing major adverse cardiovascular events with optimal medical therapy. When patients with known CAD present with angina and no acute coronary syndrome, they have historically been evaluated with a variety of noninvasive stress tests that utilize electrocardiography, radionuclide scintigraphy, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging for determining the presence and extent of inducible myocardial ischemia. Patient event-free survival, however, is largely driven by the coronary atherosclerotic disease burden, which is not directly assessed by functional testing. Direct evaluation of coronary atherosclerotic disease by coronary computed tomography angiography (coronary CTA) has emerged as the first line noninvasive imaging modality as it improves diagnostic accuracy and positively influences clinical management. Compared to functional assessment of CAD, coronary CTA-guided management results in improved patient outcomes by facilitating prevention of myocardial infarction. Other strengths of coronary CTA include detailed atherosclerotic plaque characterization and the ability to assess functional significance of specific lesions, which may further improve risk assessment and prognosis and lead to more appropriate referrals for additional testing, such as invasive coronary angiography.

Clinical Pathway in CCTA and ICA Groups

All of the patients underwent coronary evaluation before surgery. Seven hundred fifty‐five (78.8%) patients in the CCTA group avoided subsequent invasive angiography, while 203 (21.2%) patients underwent subsequent ICA as follows: 178 (18.6%) patients diagnosed with moderate or severe coronary stenosis and 25 (2.6%) patients with uncertain diagnosis (motion artifact: n = 9; calcification artifact: n = 16). Among the 9 patients with motion artifact, 6 patients had atrial fibrillation. One hundred forty‐one patients were finally diagnosed with ≥ 50% stenosis by ICA. Concomitant CABG surgery was performed in 152 patients (15.9%) including 18 unplanned CABG because of intraoperative coronary complications despite negative results by CCTA (n = 16) or ICA (n = 2). Furthermore, 1 patient was found to have lung cancer incidentally by CT examination. In the ICA group, 266 patients (17.4%) were diagnosed with ≥ 50% stenosis and 273 patients (17.9%) underwent CABG including 34 unplanned CABG. The pathway of the CCTA group and the ICA group is shown in Figure 1.

Unplanned CABG was performed because of difficulty in cardiac repulse (n = 29) or visible regional wall motion abnormality (n = 23) appeared during the surgery. All the CCTA and ICA images of patients with unplanned CABG were re‐evaluated. Two patients in the CCTA group were misdiagnosed with severe stenosis in the left circumflex artery and posterior descending artery, respectively, and 1 patient underwent CABG because of myocardial bridge at the left anterior descending artery mentioned in the CCTA report. The other 15 patients in the CCTA group were diagnosed with no stenosis (n = 4), mild stenosis in the anterior descending artery (n = 8) and right coronary artery (n = 3) respectively. Three patients in the ICA group were diagnosed with no stenosis and 31 patients were diagnosed with mild stenosis in the anterior descending artery (n = 25), circumflex artery (n = 4), and right coronary artery (n = 6). The clinical characteristics of patients with unplanned CABG (n = 49) are shown in Table S1.

### Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus document on myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging [^111KbdNS]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) key consensus statements — We recommend that myocardial CTP may be added to coronary CTA when there is a high likelihood of ischemic heart disease, known CAD, prior coronary intervention, or significant calcifications, and additionally, CTP may be added when there is a known stenosis of indeterminate functional significance. Myocardial CTP imaging with pharmacologic stress testing requires supervision by a trained healthcare provider experienced in the administration of pharmacologic stress agents and stress testing. Continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring may be performed using radiolucent electrodes and leads; alternatively, 12-lead ECG monitoring can be interrupted during scan acquisition while continuous rhythm is still being recorded and monitored by the scanner console, and upon the completion of imaging, a 12 lead ECG should be performed to ensure there are no significant changes from baseline suggestive of post-stress myocardial ischemia or injury. A delay of 10–20 minutes between the rest and stress CTP acquisitions is recommended to minimize myocardial contrast agent contamination and to eliminate the potential adverse interactions of pharmacologic stress agents and nitroglycerin administration. In static visual CTP interpretation, myocardial images are typically arranged using three standard orthogonal views - the short axis, vertical long axis, and horizontal long axis, and perfusion defects should be described in terms of size, transmurality, and reversibility in the context of the degree of stenosis in the supplying coronary artery.

Follow-up

Follow-up information was available for 94/106 patients (89%), with a median follow-up time of 33 months (range 7–57). In Table 2, the association between CT results and the patient management among the 94 patients with available follow-up is summarized. Seventy-five percent (71/94) of these patients no longer experienced chest pain. Considering these 94 patients, the results of follow-up were: free of any disease, 36% (34/94); evidence of cardiovascular disease, 40% (38/94); evidence of non-cardiovascular disease, 38% (36/94). Among patients with patent coronary arteries at CTCA (34/94), seven were diagnosed with myocarditis and promptly treated at the time of diagnosis with pain relief, four received cardiologic therapy; one patient, a woman with diffuse calcific plaques determining multiple non-significant stenosis in at least two vessels at CT, underwent conventional coronary angiography and percutaneous revascularization 1 year after CT. Among the 17 patients with evidence of significant CAD at CT, 82% (14/17) had been treated (five with percutaneous revascularization, nine with medical therapy) and three not treated, two of them due to contraindications. All treated patients no longer experienced chest pain, whereas non-treated patients reported persistence of symptoms at follow-up interview. All patients with myocardial bridging at CT had been treated if evaluated by cardiologists and almost never treated if evaluated by general practitioners; 62% of them (13/21) were free of chest pain at follow-up. The majority of the patients with non-cardiovascular disease (27/36) were pain-free at follow-up; the patient with pneumothorax and the patient with pneumonia were treated at the time of diagnosis, while 16 of 25 patients with hiatal hernia received appropriate therapy.

### Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus document on myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging [^114dAjMm]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) — introduction and overview: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has emerged as an accurate non-invasive test for anatomic stenosis assessment, but coronary CTA alone has been limited in its ability to define hemodynamic significance, so assessment of both coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion is needed in some clinical scenarios. Myocardial CTP imaging has demonstrated high accuracy compared with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), invasive coronary angiography (ICA), positron emission tomography (PET), and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR), and multicenter studies have established its accuracy with coronary CTA, with studies suggesting CTP is particularly accurate when interpreted in the context of coronary CTA findings; there is a large body of evidence establishing myocardial CTP diagnostic accuracy and incremental value over coronary CTA. Implementation barriers include heterogeneity in stress agents, imaging sequences, scanner types, acquisition protocols, post-processing, and interpretation, and the absence of expert consensus regarding when and how to perform CTP. Myocardial CTP is contrast enhanced imaging of myocardial perfusion using qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative methods, and it may be performed at rest and during pharmacologically induced stress.

### Surgical intervention of myocardial bridge combined coronary artery disease: could a combination of supra-arterial myotomy and CABG be a better option? [^115SfUx6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial bridge (MB) is a congenital coronary artery variant in which a portion of the epicardial coronary arterial segment runs in the myocardium and mainly in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). It has been characterized by systolic compression of part of an epicardial vessel by a segment of the overlying myocardium. It is one of the most common coronary artery malformations, with a prevalence between 1.5% and 16% assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and up to 80% at autopsy. Although coronary artery myocardial bridge is usually considered a benign condition, some studies have reported that myocardial bridges are associated with acute coronary syndromes and angina pectoris, fatal arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction, and even cardiac sudden death. Our previous studies demonstrated that supera-arterial myotomy is a safe and effective procedure for patients with medication refractory isolated LAD-MB.

Pathological studies have clearly shown that atherosclerotic changes are present in the intima proximal to the MB. Although the incidence of coronary artery disease combined with atherosclerotic stenosis proximal to the LAD-MB is not reported in the literature, such patients are still found in clinical practice. Unfortunately, there are many contradictions in the choice of the treatment strategy for patients with myocardial bridge and coronary artery disease. In this study, we describe a group of patients who underwent supra-arterial myotomy and coronary artery bypass grafting for severe stenosis proximal to the LAD-MB and summarize the outcomes of their treatment.

Follow-up

Follow-up was conducted either by means of telephone interviews or by reviewing the hospital medical records, such as hospital discharge letters, provocative tests, or conventional coronary angiography results, with a wide follow-up time range, mainly due to the duration of the study and different follow-up modalities. For each patient, the definitive diagnosis and treatment choice were decided by the referring cardiologist or general practitioner. Correlations between CTCA results, patient management, and relief from chest pain were analyzed.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), whereas categorical variables are indicated as frequencies or percentages. Association between gender, age, and risk factors, including BMI, was estimated with the χ² or Fisher's exact test. Correlation between BMI and risk factors was estimated with Spearman's correlation. Association between type of chest pain and presence of cardiovascular alterations was estimated using the χ² or Fisher's exact test. All analyses were performed using SPSS v.21 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) and p -values < 0.05 were considered significant.

### A novel stress echocardiography pattern for myocardial bridge with invasive structural and hemodynamic correlation [^115BSriq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial bridges (MBs) are a common anatomic variant, predominantly involving the left anterior descending artery (LAD), with a prevalence of up to 85% on autopsy. Their anatomic identification is generally considered benign, although there is a small subset of patients with MBs who experience severe anginal symptoms and find relief with surgical unroofing.

Identifying MBs among patients with angina is problematic. Historically, MBs have been found by coronary angiography (CA). However, the sensitivity of CA is very low (0.5% to 2.5%). – Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can detect MBs with much greater sensitivity, both by systolic compressionand a characteristic echo lucent "half‐moon" appearancein the tunneled vessel under the bridge. Tsujita et alfound MBs in 23% of a group of 331 patients, all of whom underwent IVUS, as compared to 3% when using CA alone. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is a promising noninvasive alternative with accuracy approaching that of IVUS. Nevertheless, a noninvasive functional test for clinically significant MBs would be valuable. Nuclear stress testing is not sensitiveand the reported usefulness of exercise echocardiography (EE) in the detection of ischemia in MBs is near absent from the literature.

One challenge to functional testing is that the pathophysiology of how MBs can cause ischemia is poorly understood. There is the belief that MBs should not cause ischemia as they primarily affect only systolic and not diastolic flow. However, at high heart rates, diastole shortens and the systolic contribution to coronary blood flow increases. Also, the assumption has been that the compression of the MB during systole into diastole would have to limit blood flow distal to the MB during diastole to cause ischemia. Yet, in 12 symptomatic patients who were otherwise normal apart from harboring MBs, diastolic fractional flow reserve (dFFR) measured distal to the MB under dobutamine stress was < 0.75 in only 5 patients.

In this study, we describe a novel EE finding involving a focal abnormality in the end‐systolic to early‐diastolic septal wall motion with apical sparing. We initially had observed the mid‐septal buckling on exercise echocardiography in routine clinical care, with anecdotal cases of finding LAD MBs during follow‐up coronary angiography. We hypothesized that the focal EE finding represented ischemia caused by MBs under stress localized to the bridge.

### Detection of anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) by echocardiogram: when does computed tomographic angiography add value? [^112a5Fud]. Clinical Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

There is limited literature comparing TTE and CCTA in children with suspected AAOCA. To determine the distribution of various coronary anomalies comparing TTE and CCTA data, and define the added value advanced imaging brings in clinical decision-making.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of data was obtained in patients aged 0–18 years who underwent TTE and CCTA for suspected AAOCA. Patient demographics, CCTA and TTE findings, and interventions performed were recorded.

Results

100 consecutive patients were included (60% male), mean age 11 years (7 days-18 years old). In 93 patients, CCTA detected 94 anomalous coronaries. Definitive coronary abnormality was reported on TTE in 77 patients; 76 of which were confirmed by CCTA, 1 patient was found to have a normal variant. Suspected anomalous origin was reported in 16 patients on TTE, 13 of which were abnormal on CCTA. The coronary origin was not seen on TTE in 6 patients; of these, 3 had AAOCA on CCTA and 3 had hypoplastic RCA with left dominant system. Only 1 patient who had a normal TTE was found to have AAOCA on CCTA. CCTA was better than TTE in defining ostial characteristics and the course of the anomalous coronary artery, and detecting myocardial bridge.

Conclusions

CCTA adds value in diagnosing AAOCA when the coronary origins are not well assessed or suspected anomalous origin is suggested on TTE. In addition, when a confident definitive diagnosis of AAOCA is reported on TTE, CCTA demonstrates better performance in determining additional features of AAOCA.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) quantitative endpoints and analysis levels — definitions and protocol guidance emphasize that percent plaque volume (%PV) is defined as the total plaque volume divided by the total vessel volume encompassing the coronary artery of > 2 mm in diameter in the coronary artery tree, and the %PV has been commonly used to account for vessel size and exclusion of non-diagnostic segments. Quantifying plaque in small coronary branches is less accurate and more susceptible to inconsistent scan conditions; alternatively, selective interrogation of large vessels or large plaques will be more accurate and will provide smaller, but potentially more specific and reproducible changes, and sampling errors can be minimized by using standardized, volumetric or volume averaged measurements and image co-registration. A study protocol should clearly outline the imaging endpoints and changes can be evaluated at several levels including plaque-level analysis — plaques are identified at baseline and the same anatomical location is evaluated on follow-up CCTA; co-registration should be done considering anatomical landmarks such as side branches and calcifications; every attempt should be made to review datasets side-by-side and preferably blinded to exam timing; when there are no neighboring landmarks, distance from the coronary ostium could be used — and vessel-level analysis, which resembles intravascular ultrasound progression/regression clinical studies and typically includes most of the length of one of the major coronary epicardial vessels.

### Coronary CT angiography and 5-year risk of myocardial infarction [^116a4z2R]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) improves diagnostic certainty in the assessment of patients with stable chest pain, its effect on 5-year clinical outcomes is unknown.

Methods

In an open-label, multicenter, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned 4146 patients with stable chest pain who had been referred to a cardiology clinic for evaluation to standard care plus CTA (2073 patients) or to standard care alone (2073 patients). Investigations, treatments, and clinical outcomes were assessed over 3 to 7 years of follow-up. The primary end point was death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 5 years.

Results

The median duration of follow-up was 4.8 years, which yielded 20,254 patient-years of follow-up. The 5-year rate of the primary end point was lower in the CTA group than in the standard-care group (2.3% [48 patients] vs. 3.9% [81 patients]; hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.84; P = 0.004). Although the rates of invasive coronary angiography and coronary revascularization were higher in the CTA group than in the standard-care group in the first few months of follow-up, overall rates were similar at 5 years: invasive coronary angiography was performed in 491 patients in the CTA group and in 502 patients in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.13), and coronary revascularization was performed in 279 patients in the CTA group and in 267 in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.27). However, more preventive therapies were initiated in patients in the CTA group (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.65), as were more antianginal therapies (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.54). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of cardiovascular or noncardiovascular deaths or deaths from any cause.

Conclusions

In this trial, the use of CTA in addition to standard care in patients with stable chest pain resulted in a significantly lower rate of death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 5 years than standard care alone, without resulting in a significantly higher rate of coronary angiography or coronary revascularization.

### Myocardial bridging on dual-source computed tomography: degree of systolic compression of mural coronary artery correlating with length and depth of the myocardial bridge [^1173drzT]. Clinical Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the correlation between the degree of systolic compression of mural coronary artery (MCA) and the length and depth of myocardial bridging (MB) with dual-source computed tomography (DSCT).

Methods

The length and depth of MB were measured from diastolic phase. All datasets were reconstructed in 5% steps of R-R interval. The optimum phases were chosen where the maximal and minimal diameters were shown. The degree of systolic compression of MCA was calculated. The correlation between length and depth of MB and the degree of systolic compression of MCA were analyzed by Pearson test.

Results

The minimal diameters were found in 27 sites (90.0%) from 30% to 35% R-R interval, and the maximal diameters were found in 27 sites (90.0%) from 70% to 80% R-R interval. The correlation between systolic compression of MCA and length of MB was not significant (r = 0.096, P = 0.613); however, the correlation between systolic compression of MCA and the depth of MB was significant (r = 0.675, P < .01).

Conclusion

The minimal and maximal diameters of MCA are usually demonstrated in 30–35% and 70–80% R-R reconstruction interval, respectively. The degree of systolic compression of MCA correlates well with the depth of MB.

### Symptomatic myocardial bridges: overview of ischemic mechanisms and current diagnostic and treatment strategies [^116SV3RU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This review article focuses on the morphological and functional alterations that characterize patients with myocardial bridges (MB) as well as the currently available diagnostic and treatment strategies. Because of incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of MB, their clinical significance has been the subject of debate for the last quarter century. Investigational tools now available in the cardiac catheterization laboratory have helped clarify why symptoms and signs of ischemia can occur in such patients, especially when the only angiographic finding appears to be systolic compression or milking effect of a coronary vessel. Quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) clearly demonstrate that the phasic systolic vessel compression visualized on the angiogram is coupled with a persistent diastolic diameter reduction. Intracoronary Doppler reveals increased flow velocities, retrograde systolic flow, and reduced coronary flow reserve. The clinical diagnosis can be established by significant percent lumen diameter and area narrowing, increased flow velocity, and by characteristic patterns such as the "half moon" phenomenon on IVUS and the early diastolic "finger tip" phenomenon on intracoronary Doppler. Successful medical, interventional, or surgical therapy leads not only to marked improvement or normalization of these alterations but also relief of angina and ischemia.

### Practice pattern, diagnostic yield, and long-term prognostic impact of coronary computed tomographic angiography [^113rbRvk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Because coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high prevalence and lacks specific diagnostic clinical signs and symptoms, guidelines recommend coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with stable pain syndromes who show moderate pretest risks of obstructive CAD. 1, 2 The goal of these recommendations is to prevent patients with low risks of obstructive CAD from undergoing unnecessary coronary CTA, thereby enhancing the diagnostic yield and clinical usefulness of coronary CTA as well as reducing test‐related costs and risks. Because CTA provides a direct anatomic assessment of CAD with substantially higher accuracy compared with functional testing, 3, 4 the use of coronary CTA has substantially increased and is widely used as a frontline noninvasive diagnostic tool for the detection of obstructive CAD. Another potential benefit of CTA is the reduction in the need for invasive cardiac catheterization, which has a low diagnostic yield in routine clinical practice. 5 On the basis of such usefulness and reliability of CTA, the recently updated guidelines recommend coronary CTA as the first‐line test or class 1 recommendation for the evaluation of patients with suspected stable CAD or atypical symptoms. 6, 7

Nevertheless, the overuse of coronary CTA may be a potentially significant health problem, considering the possibility of radiation hazard as well as increases in the number of downstream invasive cardiac procedures and CAD‐related costs. 8, 9 Particularly, in asymptomatic patients, unnecessary use of coronary CTA could have a negative net effect if the overall benefits by the coronary CTA are not readily apparent. The contemporary patterns of coronary CTA use and their impact on subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic management and clinical outcomes are yet to be clarified. We therefore evaluated the current practices and diagnostic yield of coronary CTA as measured by the prevalence of obstructive CAD, and examined the associations among clinical risk factors, presenting symptoms, results of subsequent catheterization, and the long‐term prognostic impact of coronary CTA.

### Recent improvement in coronary computed tomography angiography diagnostic accuracy [^115gQwH5]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although invasive coronary angiography has been the gold standard for evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD), it should not be routinely performed as an initial test to assess CAD in subjects with suspected CAD by the recent guidelines, due to cost, invasiveness, and measurable risk. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a rapidly growing, noninvasive imaging modality that developed quickly over the last decade, and its role for evaluation of CAD becomes of great promise with high diagnostic accuracy. Although artifact issues have created some challenges for CCTA, recent advances-including the introduction of more detectors, leading to broader coverage, and faster and higher-definition scanners-allow improved precision and fewer uninterpretable studies. This review article summarizes the current key literature regarding the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA in native coronary arteries, stents, coronary artery bypass grafts, lesions with high calcification, and the functional assessment of CAD.

### Prognostic significance of myocardial ischemia detected by single-photon emission computed tomography in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115cXBcG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

As in the studies of other authors, the maximum LV wall thickness correlated with the presence of perfusion disorders. In children with MP defects, myocardial hypertrophy occurred with significantly greater degree than in patients without them. This finding is of particular relevance since LGE in CMR is observed in 60% to 80% of patients with HCM and is frequently associated with rest perfusion abnormalities. It should be stressed that in our study, as many as 66% of children with MP defects had intramuscular fibrosis expressed by the presence of LGE. As with ours, other studies also proved a close relationship between the severity of microvascular ischemia, the degree of hypertrophy, and the severity of LV fibrosis. Literature reports indicate that myocardial ischemia in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also be caused by the presence of myocardial bridging. In most cases, they are asymptomatic, therefore, there are only a few studies and individual case reports in the pediatric population. The results of one study showed no evidence that myocardial bridging is an important cause of myocardial perfusion abnormalities, while the results of others indicate a relationship between the presence of myocardial bridging, perfusion defects, and the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events. It remains possible that, in a small group of patients, a severe degree of epicardial coronary compression contributes to myocardial ischemia and can cause chest pain with exercise, syncope, ventricular arrhythmia, and consequently sudden cardiac death. Currently, there is little evidence to suggest that relieving myocardial bridging in children with HCM will improve their symptoms or prognosis. In our center, in accordance with the diagnostic protocol for children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in the case of severe myocardial perfusion defects in SPECT study, the presence of clinical symptoms (chest pain, syncope), ST- segment depression in exercise ECG we perform computed tomography angiography to assess the coronary arteries in terms of the presence of myocardial bridging.

In children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and diagnosed myocardial perfusion defects in SPECT, we consider extending the cardiac tests to include computed tomography angiography to assess coronary arteries, modify pharmacological treatment by increasing the dose of beta blocker and recommend low or moderate intensity physical activity. We advise against competitive sports in these children. We determine the indications for ICD implantation on an individual basis.

### Impact of myocardial bridge on life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator [^117Jesep]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) among patients treated with ICD for primary or secondary prevention of SCD, 37.9% of the patients subsequently experienced LTVA (appropriate ICD treatments for ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation, or sudden cardiac death), whereas angiographically apparent MB was present in 22.1% of the patients; and (2) in addition to LV dysfunction, presence of angiographically apparent MB was independently associated with the increased risk of LTVA in the multivariate analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the prevalence of MB by CAG in patients with ICD treatment and to potentially indicate angiographically apparent MB as an important risk factor for long‐term arrhythmic events in this population.

Prevalence of Myocardial Bridge in Patients With ICD

The prevalence of MB remains undefined and the reported incidence of MB varies widely according to the population studied and the methods of evaluation: 0.5% to 16% in resting conditions up to 40% with intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine and/or provocative tests using acetylcholine or dobutamine by CAG, 4, 9 3.5% to 58% by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), 23 23% to 58% by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), 24, 25 and 5% to 86% in autopsy series. 26 Saito et al 9 used CAG to report that MB was present in 36% of the patients without coronary stent in the LAD who underwent acetylcholine provocative test. Tsujita et al 24 reported the incidence of MB as 23% by IVUS in patients with de novo coronary lesions in the LAD. The present study focused for the first time on patients with ICD treatment for primary or secondary prevention of SCD who had various cardiac conditions (ICM, VSA, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, cardiac channelopathies, etc), and identified MB in 22.1% of the patients by CAG, being in line with previous studies and contributing to the growing body of evidence of the prevalence of MB. Although CAG remains the most common technique for diagnosing MB, it can also underdiagnose MB especially in patients with weak systolic arterial compression because the diagnosis of MB by CAG is usually made only indirectly by detecting the characteristic "milking" effect, rather than by directly visualizing the structure of MB. Therefore, future studies using CCTA and IVUS are warranted to address the exact prevalence of MB in this population.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) — comparisons to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) emphasize that established ICA standards for classifying the coronary tree and stenosis severity have been used with minimal alteration, while CTA can additionally characterize extraluminal plaque and plaque composition not routinely available on ICA without intravascular imaging and contains important noncoronary cardiac and extracardiac thoracic information; this breadth of findings demands a systematic approach that enforces attention to all anatomic structures and the full potential of the technology.

### Role of computed tomography for diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease [^114mFuRU]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a powerful imaging modality for the detection and prognostication of individuals with suspected coronary artery disease. Because calcification of coronary plaque occurs in proportion to the total atheroma volume, the initial diagnostic potential of CCTA focused on the identification and quantification of coronary calcium in low- to intermediate-risk individuals, a finding that tracks precisely with the risk of incident adverse clinical events. Beyond noncontrast detection of coronary calcium, CCTA using iodinated contrast yields incremental information about the degree and distribution of coronary plaques and stenosis, as well as vessel wall morphology and atherosclerotic plaque features. This additive information offers the promise of CCTA to provide a more comprehensive view of total atherosclerotic burden because it relates to myocardial ischemia and future adverse clinical events. Furthermore, emerging data suggest the prognostic and diagnostic importance of stenosis severity detection and atherosclerotic plaque features described by CCTA including positive remodeling, low-attenuation plaque, and spotty calcification, which have been associated with the vulnerability of plaque. We report a summary of the evidence supporting the role of CCTA in the detection of subclinical and clinical coronary artery disease in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and discuss the potential of CCTA to augment the identification of at-risk individuals. CCTA and coronary artery calcium scoring offer the ability to improve risk stratification, discrimination, and reclassification of the risk in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and to noninvasively determine the measures of stenosis severity and atherosclerotic plaque features.

### Identification of clinical phenotypes in type 2 myocardial infarction: insights into characteristics, prognosis, and management strategies [^112gf34s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and Adjudication

Diagnosis of T2MI was independently assessed by 2 clinical cardiologists (D.B. and M. A.) in all patients on the basis of all clinical and instrumental data collected during the hospitalization. In case of disagreement, a third experienced cardiologist (C.P.) was consulted to reach a consensus. According to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia, where myocardial injury occurred due to an imbalance between oxygen supply and without evidence of acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption, were diagnosed with T2MI. Patients with elevated cTn levels but without signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia were classified as having nonischemic myocardial injury.

For all patients with a definitive diagnosis of T2MI, precipitating factors for the supply–demand mismatch were identified and treated: sepsis, severe anemia or relevant recent bleeding, tachyarrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, respiratory failure, hypertension, hypotension/shock, recent noncardiac surgery, acute kidney injury, and nonatherosclerotic coronary artery lesions such as vasospasm, embolism, myocardial bridging, or dissection. While some authors have proposed classifying patients with myocardial infarction due to reduced coronary blood flow from nonatherothrombotic causes separately, others support their inclusion within T2MI according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. In line with this latter view, and given our study objectives, such cases were included in the present analysis. For patients in whom ≥ 2 causes of T2MI were present, these were categorized as multiple contributing factors. Detailed criteria for each causative factor can be found in the Supplemental Material (Supplemental Methods).

### Outcomes of non-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of coronary artery disease: network meta-analysis of diagnostic randomised controlled trials [^112DPnrr]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To evaluate differences in downstream testing, coronary revascularisation, and clinical outcomes following non-invasive diagnostic modalities used to detect coronary artery disease.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Medline in process, Embase, Cochrane Library for clinical trials, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Clinicaltrials.gov.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Diagnostic randomised controlled trials comparing non-invasive diagnostic modalities in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of low risk acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease.

Data synthesis

A random effects network meta-analysis synthesised available evidence from trials evaluating the effect of non-invasive diagnostic modalities on downstream testing and patient oriented outcomes in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Modalities included exercise electrocardiograms, stress echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging, real time myocardial contrast echocardiography, coronary computed tomographic angiography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Unpublished outcome data were obtained from 11 trials.

Results

18 trials of patients with low risk acute coronary syndrome (n = 11 329) and 12 trials of those with suspected stable coronary artery disease (n = 22 062) were included. Among patients with low risk acute coronary syndrome, stress echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and exercise electrocardiograms resulted in fewer invasive referrals for coronary angiography than coronary computed tomographic angiography (odds ratio 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.57), 0.32 (0.15 to 0.71), and 0.53 (0.28 to 1.00), respectively). There was no effect on the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction, but estimates were imprecise. Heterogeneity and inconsistency were low. In patients with suspected stable coronary artery disease, an initial diagnostic strategy of stress echocardiography or single photon emission computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging resulted in fewer downstream tests than coronary computed tomographic angiography (0.24 (0.08 to 0.74) and 0.57 (0.37 to 0.87), respectively). However, exercise electrocardiograms yielded the highest downstream testing rate. Estimates for death and myocardial infarction were imprecise without clear discrimination between strategies.

Conclusions

For patients with low risk acute coronary syndrome, an initial diagnostic strategy of stress echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance is associated with fewer referrals for invasive coronary angiography and revascularisation procedures than non-invasive anatomical testing, without apparent impact on the future risk of myocardial infarction. For suspected stable coronary artery disease, there was no clear discrimination between diagnostic strategies regarding the subsequent need for invasive coronary angiography, and differences in the risk of myocardial infarction cannot be ruled out.

### Characterizing mechanisms of ischemia in patients with myocardial bridges [^116uYCw7]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

It is now increasingly recognized that not all MBs are benign anatomic variants. We have demonstrated, for the first time that coronary perfusion efficiency is impaired during exercise in patients with MBs. Furthermore, our data suggest that the diminution of coronary perfusion efficiency during exercise is due to the attenuation of accelerating wave energy during early systole arising from the upstream tunneled segment. We have also demonstrated a high prevalence of both epicardial and microvascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with a MB. These insights demonstrate how patients with benign MBs might be distinguished from those with substrates for ischemia. Development of therapies that specifically target the ischemic mechanisms, as identified in our study, may lead to better patient-centric outcomes than empirical management. Finally, dobutamine is currently used in the catheter laboratory to identify MBs with an ischemic substrate. However, whether dobutamine has similar effects on coronary wave energies as exercise is unknown and should be investigated in future studies.

Study Limitations

This is a small single-center study with some limitations. First, our study participants had a high suspicion of an ischemic substrate based on pretest probabilities, and therefore, our findings should not be extrapolated to MBs that are incidentally discovered or are found in patients with symptoms atypical of angina. Second, all investigations were performed in the LAD artery, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings in other vessels, although MBs mostly involve the LAD artery. Third, we did not assess the bridged vessels with intravascular imaging, which may have uncovered another mechanism of ischemia in the form of proximal vessel atherosclerosis as has been demonstrated in previous studies. Fourth, our study was powered to detect a difference in the primary outcome, change in perfusion efficiency, between the MB and reference groups. Any other comparison is hypothesis generating and should be confirmed in larger studies.

Conclusions

Patients with ANOCA and a MB exhibit impaired coronary perfusion efficiency during exercise, which is predominantly due to diminution of the accelerating wave energy in early systole; this is secondary to the tunneled segment in the upstream epicardial vessel. This mechanism is distinct to that leading to coronary perfusion inefficiency in patients with CMD. Furthermore, patients with a MB have a high prevalence of epicardial endothelial dysfunction, which correlates with the MMI on CCTA. Comprehensive coronary physiology assessment with wave intensity analysis helps distinguish MBs with an ischemic substrate from benign MBs. Future studies are warranted to assess whether patients with anMB may benefit from distinct pharmacological or mechanical therapies targeting these abnormalities.

SCCT 2021 expert consensus — CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and CT perfusion (CTP) to guide invasive angiography: CT-FFR has been reported to preclude invasive angiography, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) can be safely deferred when CT-FFR shows a lack of lesion-specific ischemia, with cost-effectiveness estimates and real-world confirmation; in CRESCENT II, adding CTP when coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a > 50% stenosis resulted in far fewer invasive angiograms without a class I indication for revascularization, supporting CTA's ability to optimize downstream angiography use.

Study procedures

Patients were randomly allocated to either initial computed tomography or initial invasive coronary angiography. We defined obstructive disease as detection of at least one ≥ 50% coronary artery luminal diameter stenosis. We categorised obstructive coronary artery disease as high risk anatomy if three vessel coronary artery disease, left main coronary artery stenosis, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, or any combination of these was present. The clinical sites were provided with central management recommendations that incorporated contemporary European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease in prevention of cardiovascular disease, including the clinical indication for statins in clinical practice and on myocardial revascularisation, as described in the study design and protocol. The management decisions on patients were made by local heart team members and referring physicians on the basis of the computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography reports at each study site. Patients randomised to computed tomography as the initial test were subsequently managed according to the DISCHARGE computed tomography guided strategy protocol. In both randomisation groups, patients without obstructive coronary artery disease by invasive coronary angiography or computed tomography were discharged back to the referring physician, and patients with obstructive coronary artery disease were managed according to guidelines. Further recommendations included prescription of anti-anginal dugs, additional invasive or non-invasive functional testing, and coronary revascularisation as appropriate. Patients in both randomised groups were advised to be treated to target values for blood pressure, glycaemia, and lipids according to European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention.

Computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography protocols

To ensure adherence to image quality criteria for computed tomography and invasive coronary angiography, we did a pilot study before the randomised study, in which each of the participating clinical centres had to provide imaging datasets of three patients for each imaging strategy. Adherence to the predefined standards for the computed tomography protocol and invasive coronary angiography recommendations were verified at all sites.

At all clinical centres, trained personnel did computed tomography on at least 64 slice computed tomography scanners following a 10 step acquisition guide and scanner specific recommendations to identify coronary artery obstruction. Trained interventional cardiologists did invasive coronary angiography at each participating centre according to contemporary guidelines and routine clinical practice at the individual clinical site. Board certified and experienced radiologists with SCCT level II or III certification evaluated computed tomography.

CTA specificity and value-added modalities: CTA has lower specificity and positive predictive value, similar to stress imaging, but CT-FFR and CTP may significantly minimize this disadvantage. Evidence supports CT-FFR for diagnosing CAD in stable chest pain with diagnostic rates comparable to invasive FFR, and early CT perfusion data suggest a similar gain. Tiered testing as in CRESCENT I and II showed advantages in early discharge and safe outcomes in small randomized trials; however, robust evidence-based recommendations await well conducted prospective studies, and hybrid CTA–PET approaches are being developed to improve the predictive value of a positive CTA.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) plaque characterization — classification of plaque components on CCTA is based on Hounsfield units and summarizes thresholds used across selected studies; because the intensity of contrast enhancement of the coronary lumen affects measured attenuation in plaques, this guideline does not recommend a specific absolute threshold for low-attenuation plaque, and scan-specific thresholds based on attenuation values sampled in the proximal coronary arteries have been proposed to compensate for variations in lumen opacification.

### The present state of coronary computed tomography angiography a process in evolution [^111pHrEE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In the past 5 years since the introduction of 64-detector row cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), there has been an exponential growth in the quantity of scientific evidence to support the feasibility of its use in the clinical evaluation of individuals with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Since then, there has been considerable debate as to where CCTA precisely fits in the algorithm of evaluation of individuals with suspected CAD. Proponents of CCTA contend that the quality and scope of the available evidence to date support the replacement of conventional methods of CAD evaluation by CCTA, whereas critics assert that clinical use of CCTA is not yet adequately proven and should be restricted, if used at all. Coincident with the scientific debate underlying the clinical utility of CCTA, there has developed a perception by many that the rate of growth in cardiac imaging is disproportionately high and unsustainable. In this respect, all noninvasive imaging modalities and, in particular, more newly introduced ones, have undergone a higher level of scrutiny for demonstration of clinical and economic effectiveness. We herein describe the latest available published evidence supporting the potential clinical and cost efficiency of CCTA, drawing attention not only to the significance but also the limitations of such studies. These points may trigger discussion as to what future studies will be both necessary and feasible for determining the exact role of CCTA in the workup of patients with suspected CAD.

Discussion

The diagnosis of this patient with UAP was clear and coronary was performed. The angiography showed diffuse lesion in the near middle segment of LAD. The lesion had 3 characteristics: (1) The lesion with stenosis of 60–70% was intermediate lesion (50–90% stenosis), and does not need stent implantation according to the results of IVUS. (2) The patient was diagnosed of UAP with classical symptom, FFR was performed further which suggested of stent implantation. (3) The lesion was diffuse and accompanied by myocardial bridge. As is known to all, IVUS can indicate the nature and composition of lesion plaques in addition to providing lesion area and length. However, the case did not meet the criteria for stent implantation on these indicators. FFR guidance for PCI in patients with UAP can define the culprit vessels and improve prognosis, especially in patients with multi-vessel, diffuse lesions. For this case, stent implantation was needed according to FFR. Why the strategy according to endovascular imaging and functional test were contradictory? Maybe because of the following: (1) The lesion was not significant stenosis according to endovascular imaging, but it was diffuse with the length of more than 40 mm, which could result in insufficient blood supply to the distal LAD. (2) The lesion was wrapped with myocardial bridge which could influence the hemodynamics of coronary artery, and that could be detected by functional test such as FFR.

Myocardial bridging (MB) is a common congenital condition in which a major coronary artery is covered by a bridge of muscle and narrows during systole. We present a patient with typical angina, severe MB of the left anterior descending artery and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. In this case, dipyridamole 201Tl SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, besides detecting coronary artery disease, provided supportive evidence that severe MB can cause myocardial ischemia and was useful for the assessment of the interventional outcome, as well as having played a key role in the clinical decision-making process.

The role of coronary computed tomography angiography in patients with symptoms or proven coronary artery disease

Coronary computed tomography angiography-defined atherosclerosis for prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events in symptomatic patients

The burden of CCTA-defined extent of CAD is a strong predictor for MACE in patients with symptomatic or proven CAD, with consistent incremental prognostic value over the clinical risk spectrum as demonstrated in several subpopulations.

A large body of studies has shown that the degree or extent of obstructive CAD (defined as either ≥ 50% or ≥ 70%) has important prognostic implications in patients undergoing clinically indicated CCTA. Compared with a normal CCTA, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for myocardial infarction or death were 2.2, 2.9, 3.5, and 4.7 for the presence of angiographically non-obstructive, one-vessel obstructive, two-vessel obstructive, and three-vessel or left main obstructive CAD in Coronary CT Angiography Evaluation For Clinical Outcomes: An International Multicenter (CONFIRM). In 17 793 patients from this registry, the two visually assessed CCTA parameters 'number of proximal segments with mixed or calcified plaques', and 'the number of proximal segments with a stenosis ≥ 50%' provided independent discriminatory value for death at 2.3-year beyond 3 commonly used clinical risk scores for future MACE, including the FRS.

### Testing for coronary microvascular dysfunction… [^115fw45p]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Bairey Merz CN. Testing for Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction. JAMA. 2019; 322:

2358. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.16625 Coronary microvascular dysfunction refers to abnormal dilation and constriction of the small blood vessels in the heart. Conditions that increase a person's risk of having coronary microvascular dysfunction are high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, autoimmune disease, and prior breast cancer treatment, as well as other unknown factors. Testing for coronary microvascular dysfunction is recommended for people who have chest pain, shortness of breath, an abnormal result of stress testing such as exercise or chemical stress, a heart attack, or clinically indicated angiography with no blockage of the larger coronary arteries. Symptoms that occur when the heart does not get enough blood flow include chest discomfort or shortness of breath triggered by physical exertion or stress and can be of relatively long duration at rest.

The goal of testing for coronary microvascular dysfunction is treatment to lower the chance of symptoms worsening, to control symptoms, and to avoid heart attack and heart failure. Medications include those to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, blood thinners such as aspirin, and medications for chest pain relief such as α- and β-blockers or calcium channel blockers. The most commonly used tests to look for coronary microvascular dysfunction include invasive functional coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography. The latter 2 types of imaging studies are noninvasive. The invasive test, which is more commonly used for patients undergoing stenting, can also be used for coronary microvascular dysfunction and involves placing a catheter directly inside the blood vessels of the heart.

A majority of people with coronary microvascular dysfunction are women, yet coronary microvascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized in men. The reason for this may be that women have a greater ability to widen and narrow their arteries, perhaps because of the need to control blood flow during pregnancy and delivery. Additionally, women experience relatively more pain sensations than men, leading to more perceived chest pain.
