## Question

What is the recommended monitoring for patients on sarilumab to minimize infection risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended monitoring for patients on sarilumab to minimize infection risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline pre-treatment assessments that identify and mitigate infection risk. Then, I should verify the ongoing laboratory and clinical monitoring cadence. Next, I will examine dose modification thresholds tied to hematologic and hepatic abnormalities. After that, I need to consider special populations and opportunistic infections, including TB, hepatitis B, and fungal disease. Finally, I will integrate vaccination strategy and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified monitoring plan with clear checkpoints and actions, ensuring each step aligns with FDA labeling and pivotal safety data.

> Let me first confirm the baseline pre-treatment evaluations that are mandatory to reduce infection risk before the first dose. The FDA label requires a complete blood count with differential to exclude significant neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, liver function tests to avoid starting in patients with ALT/AST above 1.5× ULN, and a comprehensive infection screen including latent and active tuberculosis testing with treatment of latent TB prior to initiation, as well as assessment for active infections and hepatitis B risk, while updating immunizations and avoiding live vaccines during therapy [^850f895f] [^5d6757bf] [^8808a73b].

> Wait, let me verify the ongoing laboratory monitoring cadence because timing matters for early detection of cytopenias and transaminitis. The label directs CBC with differential and platelets, and ALT/AST to be checked 4 to 8 weeks after initiation and then every 3 months thereafter, with lipid parameters assessed 4 to 8 weeks after initiation and then about every 6 months; importantly, when interpreting neutrophil counts for dose decisions, values obtained at the end of the dosing interval should be used given the pharmacodynamic nadir around day 3–5 and recovery by day 15 in q2w dosing [^0fdbac4b] [^536043b9].

> I need to ensure dose modification thresholds are explicit and actionable. Hold or reduce sarilumab for ANC less than 1000 cells/mm³, platelets less than 100,000/mm³, or ALT/AST greater than 3× ULN, and permanently discontinue for ANC less than 500 cells/mm³, platelets less than 50,000/mm³, or ALT/AST greater than 5× ULN or greater than 3× ULN with bilirubin greater than 2× ULN; these thresholds are designed to mitigate infection risk from neutropenia and hepatic injury while balancing efficacy [^850f895f] [^cb083f4d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neutropenia automatically translating to infection risk. I should double-check the long-term safety data. Integrated analyses show that while ANC less than 1000 cells/mm³ occurred in roughly 13–15% of patients, most normalized on therapy and decreased ANC was not associated with increased infection or serious infection rates, supporting the labeled monitoring and dose-adjustment approach rather than reflex discontinuation [^3614272f] [^49d495e0] [^ff557453].

> Next, I should review special populations and opportunistic infections where vigilance must be heightened. For tuberculosis, test all patients pre-treatment, treat latent TB before starting, and maintain a high index of suspicion during therapy even if initial tests are negative; for hepatitis B, screen and manage prophylaxis or monitoring if HBsAg-positive or with isolated core antibody, given reactivation risk with immunosuppression; for invasive fungal disease, consider geography and host risk, and evaluate promptly if suspected, recognizing that sarilumab has been associated with opportunistic fungal infections including pneumocystis in RA populations [^5d6757bf] [^850f895f].

> I will now examine vaccination strategy because preventing infections is foundational. Update all age-appropriate immunizations before initiation, avoid live vaccines during therapy, and ensure close contacts are vaccinated to reduce pathogen exposure; in older adults or those with comorbidities, consider pneumococcal and influenza vaccination timing and, where indicated, shingles vaccination, aligning with immunization guidance for immunocompromised hosts [^8808a73b] [^850f895f].

> But wait, what if the patient is being treated for COVID-19 rather than RA. I should confirm that COVID-19 guidance differs. IDSA suggests sarilumab as an alternative to tocilizumab only when tocilizumab is unavailable and steroids are part of standard care, with conditional recommendations and very low certainty; this is distinct from RA safety monitoring and should not be conflated with chronic immunosuppression management in rheumatic disease [^1cfac900] [^900b6acc] [^dd0d4be2].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified monitoring plan and sanity-check each element against the label. Before starting: CBC with differential, platelets, LFTs, TB testing with treatment of latent TB, hepatitis B screening, infection assessment, and immunization update; at 4–8 weeks: repeat CBC, platelets, LFTs, and lipids; every 3 months thereafter: CBC, platelets, and LFTs; every 6 months: lipids; continuously: screen for infection symptoms at each visit and hold therapy for serious or opportunistic infections until controlled; apply dose holds or reductions per the labeled thresholds and use end-of-interval ANC for decisions [^850f895f] [^0fdbac4b].

> I should confirm that patient counseling is embedded in this plan. Advise patients to report fevers, persistent cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, dysuria, skin changes, or herpetic lesions promptly, and remind them that sarilumab may blunt inflammatory markers, so clinical vigilance is essential even when CRP or ESR are less reliable during therapy [^5d6757bf].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan remains dynamic with risk reassessment over time. If the patient develops recurrent infections, requires concomitant corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, or has new epidemiologic exposures, intensify infection surveillance and consider prophylaxis strategies tailored to the specific risk, coordinating with infectious diseases specialists when appropriate [^5d6757bf] [^850f895f].

---

To minimize infection risk with sarilumab, **screen for latent TB and hepatitis B before starting** [^850f895f] and **monitor CBC, LFTs, and lipids at 4–8 weeks, then every 3 months** [^0fdbac4b]. Hold sarilumab for **ANC < 1000/mm³, platelets < 100,000/mm³, or ALT/AST > 3× ULN** [^850f895f], and interrupt therapy for serious or opportunistic infections until controlled [^5d6757bf]. Educate patients to report fevers or infections promptly, and avoid live vaccines during treatment [^8808a73b].

---

## Pre-treatment screening and baseline assessments

Before initiating sarilumab, perform the following evaluations to identify and mitigate infection risk:

- **Tuberculosis screening**: Test for latent and active TB (TST, IGRA, or chest radiograph) [^850f895f]; treat latent TB before starting sarilumab [^5d6757bf].

- **Hepatitis B screening**: Test HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs; manage chronic HBV or prior exposure before therapy [^notfound].

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Baseline ANC and platelets; avoid starting if ANC < 2000/mm³ or platelets < 150,000/mm³ [^850f895f].

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Baseline ALT/AST; avoid starting if > 1.5× ULN [^850f895f].

- **Immunizations**: Update all non-live vaccines per guidelines; avoid live vaccines during therapy [^8808a73b].

---

## Ongoing monitoring during treatment

Regular monitoring is essential to detect early infection risk or laboratory abnormalities:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Action thresholds** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC with differential | 4–8 weeks after initiation, then every 3 months | - Hold for ANC < 1000/mm³ <br/> - Or platelets < 100,000/mm³ [^850f895f] |
| LFTs (ALT, AST) | 4–8 weeks after initiation, then every 3 months | Hold for ALT/AST > 3× ULN [^850f895f] |
| Lipid panel | 4–8 weeks after initiation, then every 6 months | Manage per hyperlipidemia guidelines [^0fdbac4b] |
| Clinical assessment for infection | Every visit | Interrupt therapy for serious or opportunistic infections until controlled [^5d6757bf] |

---

## Patient education and infection prevention strategies

Patient education is critical to early infection detection and prevention:

- **Infection awareness**: Instruct patients to report fevers, chills, cough, dyspnea, dysuria, or skin changes promptly [^a3d0e444].

- **Vaccination counseling**: Emphasize avoidance of live vaccines and adherence to non-live vaccination schedules [^8808a73b].

- **Hygiene measures**: Reinforce hand hygiene and infection precautions, especially during outbreaks [^notfound].

---

## Management of infections during sarilumab therapy

When infections occur, manage as follows:

- **Serious infections**: Interrupt sarilumab until infection is controlled; monitor closely and provide appropriate antimicrobial therapy [^5d6757bf].

- **Opportunistic infections**: Interrupt therapy and treat per standard protocols (e.g. PJP, TB, invasive fungal infections) [^5d6757bf].

- **Neutropenia**: Hold for ANC < 1000/mm³; consider G-CSF if severe or recurrent [^850f895f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Concomitant immunosuppressants**: Avoid combination with other biologics (e.g. TNF inhibitors) due to increased infection risk [^850f895f].

- **Travel and endemic exposures**: Assess for TB, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis risk; consider prophylaxis or alternative therapies in high-risk patients [^5d6757bf].

- **Pediatric and geriatric patients**: Use caution; monitor more frequently given variable infection risk [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Pre-treatment**: Screen for TB and HBV; obtain baseline CBC, LFTs, and update immunizations [^850f895f].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: CBC, LFTs, and lipids at 4–8 weeks, then every 3 months; clinical infection assessment at each visit [^0fdbac4b].

- **Infection management**: Interrupt therapy for serious or opportunistic infections until controlled [^5d6757bf].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize infection reporting, vaccine avoidance, and hygiene [^8808a73b].

---

By following these recommendations, clinicians can **significantly reduce infection risk** in patients receiving sarilumab while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Patients treated with KEVZARA are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Opportunistic infections have also been reported in patients receiving KEVZARA. Most patients who developed infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.

Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection.

Reported infections include:

Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before KEVZARA use and during therapy. Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to KEVZARA use.
Invasive fungal infections, such as candidiasis, and pneumocystis. Patients with invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
Bacterial, viral and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.

Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA. If a serious infection develops, interrupt KEVZARA until the infection is controlled.

Consider the risks and benefits of treatment with KEVZARA prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.

2.1 General Considerations Prior to Administration

Not Recommended for Concomitant Use with Biological DMARDS

The concurrent use of KEVZARA with biological DMARDs such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, IL-1R antagonists, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and selective co-stimulation modulators has not been studied. Avoid using KEVZARA with biological DMARDs because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.

Recommended Evaluations Prior to Treatment

Complete blood count (CBC): Treatment initiation with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2000 per mm3, or platelet count below 150,000 per mm3. Monitor laboratory parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Liver function tests (LFT): Treatment initiation with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with or who have alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Monitor laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides): Assess lipid parameters at baseline. Monitor laboratory parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Active and latent tuberculosis infection evaluation: Prior to initiating KEVZARA, test patients for active and latent tuberculosis (TB). KEVZARA should not be administered to patients with active TB. If positive for latent infection, consider treating for TB prior to KEVZARA use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Evaluate for infections: Avoid KEVZARA use in patients with active infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended dosage of KEVZARA is 200 mg once every two weeks given as a subcutaneous injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

KEVZARA may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional DMARDs.

Modify the dosage as recommended in Table 1 if the patient develops neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or liver enzyme abnormalities [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guidelines — sarilumab and tocilizumab considerations note that among patients who otherwise qualify for tocilizumab, it is acknowledged that patients, particularly those responding to steroids alone or baricitinib, who place a high value on avoiding the possible adverse events of sarilumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction would reasonably decline sarilumab. Additional research is needed to understand the efficacy of tocilizumab at different times in the disease course, including that there are no data to guide recommendations in patient < 18 years of age at this time, and to inform the generalizability of tocilizumab with different IL-6 receptor inhibitors for patients with COVID-19 (Supplementary Table s2). At the time of update, preliminary data from a trial of treatment with sarilumab had been shared as a pre-print, with the number of patients who received sarilumab limited (n = 45), the published manuscript not available for analysis or inclusion, and other studies of sarilumab not made available.

5.1 Serious Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including KEVZARA. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystis were reported with KEVZARA. Some patients presented with disseminated rather than localized disease and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. The most frequently observed serious infections with KEVZARA in RA patients included pneumonia and cellulitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. While not reported in KEVZARA clinical studies, other serious infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis) have been reported in patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of RA.

Avoid use of KEVZARA in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating KEVZARA in patients who have:

chronic or recurrent infection;
a history of serious or opportunistic infections;
underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection;
been exposed to tuberculosis; or
lived in or traveled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during treatment with KEVZARA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Hold treatment with KEVZARA if a patient develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.

Perform prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient who develops a new infection during treatment with KEVZARA; initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.

Tuberculosis

Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating treatment with KEVZARA. Treat patients with latent TB with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating KEVZARA. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of KEVZARA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but having risk factors for TB infection. When considering anti-TB therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in TB may be appropriate.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.

### The precision interventions for severe and / or exacerbation-prone (precISE) asthma network: an overview of network organization, procedures, and interventions [^ddd3548e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety monitoring considerations.

Clazakizumab is a human recombinant mAb that binds to IL-6, and clinical trials of clazakizumab in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis have shown clinical efficacy. Sarilumab and tocilizumab are mAbs that bind to the IL-6 receptor, and these drugs are both FDA-approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is also FDA-approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome. – The risks of inhibiting IL-6 or IL-6R are similar and include injection-site reactions, more frequent infections, liver dysfunction, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, bowel perforation, and (very rarely) demyelination. To mitigate the risk of liver dysfunction and cell count dyscrasia, a safety lab monitoring protocol was developed for dose reductions when baseline or monitoring safety lab thresholds were met (see Table E3 in this article's Online Repository at). Subjects who have a dose adjustment to the lower 6.25-mg dose will remain at the 6.25-mg dose until the end of the intervention unless the subject meets criteria for discontinuation of the drug (ie, diverticulitis, triglycerides > 1000 mg/dL, or an opportunistic infection). If a subject meets criteria for discontinuation of the drug, they will not be given additional drug doses, but they will remain in the trial and complete all procedures. To mitigate the risk of serious infections, we elected to exclude patients with a history of diseases associated with immunosuppression and/or individuals with known infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis. Patients taking other immunosuppressive medications were also excluded from this trial. Finally, the relatively short trial length of 16 weeks will minimize the exposure period and infection risk but allow sufficient time to determine clinical efficacy.

### A practical guide to the safety and monitoring of new IBD therapies [^c4a0be05]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease is rapidly evolving with the development of novel treatment options including targeted monoclonal antibodies and small molecules. With these new therapies come additional safety and side effect concerns. Infections, malignancies, immunogenicity, and metabolic issues exist for each treatment. Management of these agents in the face of such complications is a challenge clinicians will encounter. In this article, we review the existing safety data behind the monoclonal antibodies and small molecules, suggest appropriate risk stratification and assessment considerations before and during therapy, and make expert recommendations on the management of potential complications or clinical scenarios.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^7ca112df]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition, MM, a disease of the immune system, is frequently associated with significant immune impairment and dysfunction of the adaptive immune response, due to malfunction of the immune regulation of plasma cells. This results in an increased risk of infections in this population.

Currently, there are general guidelines and recommendations available for the management and prophylaxis of infections in patients with MM, as well as CAR T-cell guidelines for infection management. As BsAbs become a treatment option for MM, guidance on the diagnosis of infections, monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment is needed.

This review summarizes the discussions of a panel of global experts and provides consensus recommendations based on available clinical evidence and clinical experience, which inform on infection risk, prophylaxis, and management of patients receiving BsAb monotherapy or combination therapy.

### Sarilumab plus standard of carestandard of care for the treatment of severe COVID-19: a phase 3, randomized, open-labeled, multi-center study (ESCAPE study) [^471ac243]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Apparently, an inverse correlation with lymphocyte count was found, but inflammatory biomarkers' trajectories in SARS-CoV-2 infection are not overlapped, and CRP elevation may be delayed compared to the appearance of lymphopenia.

Encouragingly, no new safety signals for sarilumab was identified in terms of AEs, serious and not, and secondary infections. Of note, higher rates of secondary infections were observed among participants receiving two doses of sarilumab, probably as a consequence of the disease severity and the patients' complexity. This evidence was consistent with previous clinical trial data for sarilumab, and needs to be taken into account in case of corticosteroids concomitant administration.

Our study had several strengths including the randomized, controlled and multicenter design, the stratification based on disease severity, the homogeneous target population of patients with severe COVID-19 and the well-balanced baseline characteristics and cotreatments administered in the two arms. However, some study limitations must be addressed. It was a non-blinded trial, which has the potential for ascertainment bias; besides, awareness of the intervention assignment could affect management in the control group. The recruitment phase was extended over a long period, which could potentially affect background care during the trial, particularly if considering different clinical sites; nonetheless, the main co-treatment choices (corticosteroids and remdesivir) were well balanced between the two arms. Another limitation was that the 400 mg dose may be sub-therapeutic, as suggested in previous studies, and the second dose has been left to investigator's decision, increasing the risk of heterogeneous choices. Besides, data on sarilumab concentrations were not provided. However, our post-hoc analysis did not demonstrate any superiority of 2 doses of sarilumab. Furthermore, the unequal distribution of males and females between the two groups, despite the web-based randomization, and the predominance of male patients in the treatment arm, may have partially biased the results, considering that men are described as being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, the difference between the two arms only showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.063). Finally, it should be noted that the effect estimate used for the power calculation was large, and thus the study may have been underpowered to identify small changes in outcomes. However, given the larger body of research, including other clinical trials and meta-analyses, it is unlikely that conclusions would have been different with a larger sample size.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab over 5 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to TNF inhibitors [^f188720a]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab over 5years in patients with RA refractory to TNF inhibitors (TNFis).

Methods

Patients in the 24-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) TARGET (NCT01709578) who received double-blind placebo or sarilumab 150 or 200mg every 2weeks (q2w), plus conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), were eligible to receive open-label sarilumab 200mg q2w plus csDMARDs in the open-label extension (OLE), EXTEND (NCT01146652). OLE dose reduction to 150mg q2w was permitted per investigators' judgement or protocol-mandated safety concerns. Safety and efficacy were assessed through treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), laboratory abnormalities and clinical DASs. All statistics are descriptive.

Results

Of 546 patients, 454 (83%) were treated with sarilumab in the OLE. The cumulative observation period was 1654.8 patient-years (PY; n = 521); 268 patients (51%) had ≥ 4 years' exposure. Incidence rates per 100 PY of AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation, infection and serious infection were 160.4, 8.1, 57.8 and 3.9, respectively. Neutropenia was the most common AE (15.3 per 100 PY). An absolute neutrophil count of < 1000cells/mm3 (Grade 3/4 neutropenia) was observed in 74 patients (14.2%) and normalized on treatment in 48. Clinical efficacy was sustained through 5years' follow-up. Efficacy was similar for patients with 1 and > 1 TNFi failure, and similar for patients who either remained on 200mg or reduced to 150mg.

Conclusion

In patients with RA refractory to TNFi, sarilumab's long-term term safety profile was consistent with previous clinical studies and post-marketing reports. Efficacy was sustained over 5years.

However, it is essential to perform well‐controlled clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of immunosuppressants to provide data for evidence‐based decision‐making. Therefore, amidst the lack of robust evidence regarding the use of immunosuppressants treatment for COVID‐19, we aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of immunosuppressants therapy in a systematic review and meta‐analysis involving 33 studies in 3073 cases with COVID‐19 and 6502 controls. We hope that this will help to inform clinical management of the secondary infection.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^0aaa92db]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

RRMM patients are at high risk of life-threatening reactivation of viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and HBV, and acquisition of new viral infections such as influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can lead to severe complications and death.

RRMM patients may have increased risk of CMV reactivation, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and can result in severe end-organ disease. The incidence of CMV reactivation in MM patients receiving BsAbs is uncertain, due to limited clinical trial experience to-date.

MM patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have an increased risk of severe outcomes. Risk is likely increased with BsAb treatment, due to depletion of functional plasma cells. While the relationship between BsAb treatment and rate of severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, it has been observed that patients receiving myeloma treatment, including BsAbs, are less likely to develop antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Use of a booster dose can significantly improve antibody levels in MM patients; however, patients treated with anti-BCMA agents are less likely to achieve neutralizing antibody levels above the positivity threshold.

Recommendations for prophylaxis and management of viral infections

Monitoring

Monitoring should be carried out based on symptoms and clinical presentation. The use of PCR-based viral panels is recommended to diagnose active viral infections and reactivations (level IIC).

Prophylaxis

Acyclovir or valacyclovir are recommended as anti-viral prophylaxis against HSV and VZV in all RRMM patients (level III). Prophylaxis should be maintained whilst the patient is still receiving treatment for MM, and thereafter at the discretion of the individual physician. Monitoring while using these prophylactic treatments is not recommended by the expert panel (level IIB).

Treatment of emergent viral infections

Recommendations on anti-viral treatment type and duration are dependent on the infectious agent. Prior to anti-viral treatments, documentation of the viral infection through clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and anti-microbial tests is recommended (level IIC). In line with the FDA Prescribing Information (PI) for teclistamab, we recommend temporary discontinuation of BsAbs during anti-viral treatment until clinical resolution of infection symptoms or until the viral load is not clinically significant (level IIC).

### Long-term safety of sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis: an integrated analysis with up to 7 years' follow-up [^f9ded558]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

One limitation of this analysis is that cumulative patient-years of exposure to sarilumab in combination with csDMARDs was ∼10 times greater than exposure to sarilumab monotherapy; consequently, the level of evidence is lower for monotherapy than for combination therapy. Moreover, where the incidence of an adverse event is low, it is not possible to appropriately determine a differential rate between combination and monotherapy because too few events occurred with monotherapy to allow a meaningful comparison. Another limitation, common to all prospective long-term analyses, is that attrition of patients who develop AEs, SAEs or serious infections tends to enrich the long-term population with patients who are best able to tolerate treatment.

In conclusion, no new safety concerns emerged in this integrated analysis of up to 7 years' sarilumab treatment representing almost 9000 years cumulative exposure. The long-term safety profile of sarilumab, either in combination with csDMARDs or as monotherapy remained stable and consistent with the anticipated profile of an IL-6 signalling inhibitor. Safety follow-up is ongoing in the sarilumab clinical development programme for both combination treatment and monotherapy.

### Safety and tolerability of subcutaneous sarilumab and intravenous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^3aa53886]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were observed with regard to safety between sarilumab and tocilizumab in either study, including the incidence and types of TEAEs. Laboratory changes (e.g. decrease in ANC and increase in ALT) noted in the sarilumab groups were within the same range as those noted in the tocilizumab groups. Although numeric differences in incidence of ANC < 1.0 giga/l between the sarilumab and tocilizumab groups were observed in ASCERTAIN, considering the results of Study 1309, this most likely reflects differences in PK (related to route of administration; s.c. for sarilumab and i.v. for tocilizumab) and dosing interval (q2w for sarilumab versus q4w for tocilizumab) in relation to the sampling schedule (q2w). Decreased ANC was not associated with an increased incidence of infection.

Neutropenia

Background

MM patients are at risk of developing neutropenia, which can result in increased risk of serious infections and febrile neutropenia. Neutropenia-related infections may be potentially life-threatening, resulting in treatment delays or dose modification, which in turn can reduce treatment efficacy. Neutropenia can be treated by using recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Appropriate use of G-CSF prophylaxis is important to reduce the risk of infection in MM patients.

Recommendations for the management of neutropenia

We recommend use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with documented Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia (level III). If neutropenia is prolonged or chronic despite G-CSF treatment, anti-bacterial or anti-fungal prophylaxis should be considered (level IIC) (see section below for general recommendations on anti-bacterial prophylaxis). G-CSF use should be avoided during periods when a patient is at risk of CRS, due to the overlapping symptomology of febrile neutropenia and CRS, and the release of cytokines with G-CSF treatment (level IIB). In line with the FDA prescribing information for teclistamab, it is recommended to withhold BsAb dosing in neutropenia cases where absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 ×10 9 /L or in febrile neutropenia cases, until neutrophil count has returned to normal levels.

Literature summary

Incidence of neutropenia has been recorded across a number of clinical trials with BsAbs in MM patients. In the Phase I MagnetisMM-1 study with elranatamab, 74.5% experienced any grade, and 71.0% experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia. In the Phase II MagnetisMM-3 study, 48.0% experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia. With teclistamab, 64.2% experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia in Phase I/II MajesTEC-1 study. In this study, one patient had a BsAb dose reduction due to recurrent neutropenia, and 91 (55.1% patients) received treatment with G-CSF. In the Phase I study with ABBV-383, 34% experienced any grade, and 26% experienced Grade 3 neutropenia.

Monitoring for suspected infections

Recommendations for the identification of suspected infections

Laboratory tests, metabolic panels, and imaging should remain as standard clinical practice, and should be carried out based on symptoms and clinical presentation, in order to identify the infection. Specific recommendations from the panel for viral, bacterial, and fungal infections are provided in the following sections of the manuscript and can be found in Table 4.

### Long-term safety of sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis: an integrated analysis with up to 7 years' follow-up [^3614272f]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-6 from binding to membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptor-α. We assessed the long-term safety of sarilumab in patients from eight clinical trials and their open-label extensions.

Methods

Data were pooled from patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received at least one dose of sarilumab in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs; combination group) or as monotherapy (monotherapy group). Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and AEs and laboratory values of special interest were assessed.

Results

2887 patients received sarilumab in combination with csDMARDs and 471 patients received sarilumab monotherapy, with mean exposure of 2.8 years and 1.7 years, maximum exposure 7.3 and 3.5 years, and cumulative AE observation period of 8188 and 812 patient-years, respectively. Incidence rates per 100 patient-years in the combination and monotherapy groups, respectively, were 9.4 and 6.7 for serious AEs, 3.7 and 1.0 for serious infections, 0.6 and 0.5 for herpes zoster (no cases were disseminated), 0.1 and 0 for gastrointestinal perforations, 0.5 and 0.2 for major adverse cardiovascular events, and 0.7 and 0.6 for malignancy. Absolute neutrophil counts < 1000 cells/mm3 were recorded in 13% and 15% of patients, respectively. Neutropenia was not associated with increased risk of infection or serious infection. Analysis by 6-month interval showed no signal for increased rate of any AE over time.

Conclusion

The long-term safety profile of sarilumab, either in combination with csDMARDs or as monotherapy, remained stable and consistent with the anticipated profile of a molecule that inhibits IL6 signalling.

Dose reduction to sarilumab 150 mg q2w was permitted for patients who recovered following a laboratory event, which included absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 500– < 1000 cells/mm 3 (once ANC had returned to ≥ 1000 cells/mm 3), platelet count ≥ 50– < 100×10 9 cells/L (once platelet count had returned to ≥ 100×10 9 cells/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 3–5× the upper limit of normal (ULN; once ALT had returned to < 3 ULN) or per investigator judgement. Sarilumab was to be permanently discontinued in cases of significant laboratory abnormalities (ALT > 5× ULN or ALT > 3× ULN with concomitant total bilirubin > 2× ULN; neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm 3 or neutrophil count < 1000 cells/mm 3 with evidence of infection; platelet count < 50×10 9 cells/L or platelet count < 100×10 9 cells/L with evidence of bleeding), opportunistic infection, active tuberculosis, positive culture for non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions, severe neurological disease, HIV positive status, acute renal failure, pregnancy, use of other biological agents or any AEs deemed by the investigator to jeopardise patient safety.

4 DISCUSSION

The World Health Organization has declared that COVID‐19 may progress to a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and is a public health emergency of international concern as of 1 February 2020. At the time this manuscript was compiled, over 82 million laboratory‐diagnosed cases of COVID‐19 had been reported spanning 212 countries or regions and contributing to over 1,700,000 deaths.

The proinflammatory cytokine IL‐1β is activated and secreted upon initiation of the inflammasome. Nod‐like receptor protein‐3, the most‐frequently studied inflammasome, is activated by danger signals and speculated to be viroporin A, E protein or open reading frame 3 proteins from SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. Anakinra, a recombinant IL‐1 receptor a antagonist, has proven effective in treating sHLH, and it is currently used in IL‐1‐induced autoinflammatory diseases.

### Long-term safety of sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis: an integrated analysis with up to 7 years' follow-up [^15dc6b47]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This integrated analysis of ∼9000 patient-years of cumulative patient exposure to sarilumab represents the most comprehensive investigation of sarilumab long-term safety to date. Results were consistent with the safety findings of sarilumab phase III trials, and consistent with the anticipated safety profile of IL-6 signalling inhibition. No signal was observed for an increased IR of any of the AEs or laboratory assessments analysed over time by 6-month interval. For several AEs, including serious infections, thrombocytopenia, ALT elevation, MACE and lipid elevations, the incidence was markedly lower with monotherapy than with combination therapy. Moreover, incidences of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were lower with monotherapy than with combination therapy. These disparities likely reflect differences in the patient populations recruited into the combination and monotherapy trials, and in the case of serious infections and thrombocytopenia, possibly also the additional burden of taking more than one immunomodulator.

The IRs for SAEs and serious infections observed with sarilumab were no greater than those observed with other biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs in long-term studies. Focussing on DMARDs that target IL-6 signalling, the IRs for AEs and SAEs with sarilumab monotherapy (151.8 and 6.7 per 100 patient-years, respectively) and sarilumab combination therapy (144.2 and 9.4, respectively) may compare favourably with those observed for tocilizumab (224.5 and 13.6, respectively; all-exposed population: all doses, combination and monotherapy, exposure > 36 months). Similarly, the IRs for serious infection with sarilumab monotherapy and combination therapy, 1.0 and 3.7 per 100 patient-years, respectively, may compare favourably with the IR of 4.5 observed with tocilizumab (all-exposed population).

### Safety and tolerability of subcutaneous sarilumab and intravenous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^0fedddda]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In ASCERTAIN, tocilizumab was administered i.v. according to US product labelling; patients were treated with 4 mg/kg and the dose was increased at the discretion of the investigator. In the study, 60% of patients received at least one dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Because of differences in the route of administration (s.c. for sarilumab, i.v. for tocilizumab), PK profiles and dosing intervals (q2w for sarilumab, q4w for tocilizumab) in relation to the sampling schedule (q2w for haematology assessments), numeric differences were observed in the incidence of ANC < 1.0 giga/l, a PD marker of IL-6 inhibition, between the sarilumab and tocilizumab groups. Regardless, there was no difference in the rates of infection or serious infection between the tocilizumab and sarilumab groups.

The rapid and similar decrease in ANC with these IL-6R inhibitors is potentially explained by redistribution from the vascular compartment and results in the uptake and removal of circulating neutrophils without affecting their function. In vitro evidence suggests that IL-6 increases circulating neutrophils by releasing them from marginated pools in bone marrow. Thus, an anti-IL-6R agent may potentially reverse this effect. The rapid onset and recovery of the decrease in neutrophil count observed in Study 1309 provides support for this mechanism, and a PD model that implemented neutrophil margination with ANC-specific tolerance describes the mechanism of transient decreases in ANC observed with IL-6R inhibitors.

One limitation of ASCERTAIN is that robust characterization of the neutrophil kinetics (including identification of the nadir) after multiple doses of sarilumab and tocilizumab, as was done in Study 1309 after single-dose administration, could not be performed because of less frequent PK and PD sampling. Therefore, Study 1309 provides valuable insight into the similarities in changes in neutrophil parameters that occur with the two IL-6R inhibitors.

In summary, IL-6R inhibition leads to transient decreases in ANC, likely due to margination of neutrophils from the circulation where the neutrophils remain present and maintain their functionality if triggered. This phenomenon of margination is further supported by the fact that no clinically meaningful consequence of the decrease in ANC by IL-6R inhibitors has been identified.

### Efficacy and secondary infection risk of tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab8570f0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

In a recent study, anakinra significantly reduced both the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU and mortality among patients with severe COVID‐19, with no serious side‐effects. Kooistra et al.and Cauchois et al.also investigated whether anakinra was effective at reducing clinical signs of hyperinflammation in critically ill COVID‐19 patients. In this study, we found significantly decreased mortality after patients received anakinra therapy, but no increase in bacterial/fungal co‐infection risk. Furthermore, there are no reports investigating the effect of anakinra on the treatment of fungal co‐infection in COVID‐19 patients.

Inhibitors of IL‐6 or its receptor have been successful in treating other cytokine storm syndromes, or CRS secondary to CAR‐T cell therapies. Several drugs are available, including IL‐6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) and IL‐6 inhibitors (siltuximab and sirukumab). It is noteworthy that since March 2020 tocilizumab has been formally included in the National Health Commission of China's COVID‐19 diagnosis and treatment program (7th edition): 'Tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive bilateral lung lesion opacity or in severe or critical patients, who have elevated IL‐6 levels'. More recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has published guidelines and recommends that, for patients who have been admitted to hospital with COVID‐19, tocilizumab should be used only in the context of a clinical trial, due to a 'knowledge gap'.

### Outcomes and biomarker analyses among patients with COVID-19 treated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist sarilumab at a single institution in Italy [^f88905e7]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak appears to have peaked in some regions around the world with new cases and fatalities beginning to decline week by week, the healthcare system remains stretched thin. Supplies of personal protective equipment are running low in multiple areas and shortages of several crucial drugs are predicted. Effective interventions to reduce the number of patients requiring intensive care are still needed, especially as some areas relax physical distancing mandates and cases rebound. In all likelihood, effective management of COVID-19 will require a strategy encompassing antivirals, multiple anticytokine agents and/or passive immunization using convalescent plasma. Examples of such approaches include the ongoing REMDACTA trial of tocilizumab in combination with remdesivir. Although initial results indicating clinical benefit with the use of sarilumab and other cytokine-modulatory therapies have begun to be reported, further definitive prospective randomized trials should also be conducted with all due haste. Additionally, future studies should further characterize immune and inflammatory responses throughout the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as after treatment. A collaborative and multidisciplinary approach will be needed in order to reduce the human toll of this unprecedented and devastating pandemic.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade and pediatric evidence: Tocilizumab or sarilumab is suggested for use in treatment of COVID-19 in certain situations (recommendations 11–12). Of the studies informing the tocilizumab recommendations, only two did not specifically exclude children under 18 years from enrolling; the RECOVERY trial included children, but results from those in the tocilizumab arm have not yet been reported, and Hermine et al. did not specifically exclude children but did not separately report results in children. For sarilumab, three of the four studies used to inform recommendations excluded children from participation. The pre-print network meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IL-6 inhibitors included some studies that enrolled children, but results in children were not separately reported. There are several publications reporting on cohorts of children with COVID-19 who received treatment with tocilizumab, and although there have been no clear contraindications to using IL-6 inhibitors in children based on these reports more studies in children are needed to determine whether the criteria for their pediatric use would be similar to those in adults.

Adverse events

The overall incidence and exposure-adjusted IR of AEs were similar between combination and monotherapy (Table 2). The incidence and exposure-adjusted rate of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were numerically lower with monotherapy compared with combination therapy. The most common AEs were neutropenia, injection-site erythema and upper respiratory tract infection with combination therapy, and neutropenia, injection-site erythema and nasopharyngitis with monotherapy. The most common SAEs were pneumonia, osteoarthritis and RA with combination therapy, and osteoarthritis, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia and RA with monotherapy. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation were neutropenia, ALT increased and herpes zoster (all non-disseminated) with combination therapy, and neutropenia, injection-site erythema and RA with monotherapy. There was no signal for an increased rate over time for any of the AEs analysed by 6-month interval (Fig. 1).

5.2 Laboratory Abnormalities

Neutropenia

Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), including neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Assess neutrophil count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor neutrophil count 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on ANC results see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.6).
Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], use results obtained at the end of the dosing interval when considering dosage modification.

Thrombocytopenia

Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Assess platelet count prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on platelet counts see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.6).

Elevated Liver Enzymes

Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with KEVZARA.

Assess ALT/AST levels prior to initiation of KEVZARA and monitor ALT and AST levels 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For recommendations regarding initiating KEVZARA therapy and dosage modifications based on transaminase elevations see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.6).

Lipid Abnormalities

Treatment with KEVZARA was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and/or triglycerides [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment with KEVZARA, then at approximately 6-month intervals.
Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

### Long-term safety of sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis: an integrated analysis with up to 7 years' follow-up [^b68ee3b2]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

AEs, including serious AEs (SAEs: including AEs that required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization) and prespecified AESIs, were collected at every visit. Samples for laboratory analysis, including haematology and clinical chemistry, were collected during screening, and pre-dose on treatment day 1, then at least every 2 weeks until week 12, at least every 12 weeks up to week 96, and at least every 24 weeks thereafter. AEs and AESIs were categorized according to Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (narrow definitions) and High-Level Terms, except for infection (MedDRA primary system organ class), opportunistic infection (case-report form checkbox), and overdose (administering ⩾2 doses in < 11 calendar days [once every 2 weeks (q2w) schedule] or < 6 days [weekly (qw) schedule]; case-report form checkbox; reported as an AE per protocol). Serious infections were defined as infections requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous antibiotics. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were reviewed by an independent cardiovascular adjudication committee, and suspected gastrointestinal perforations were confirmed by medical review. Thromboembolic events were not prespecified as an AESI in the study protocols but are reported here post hoc based on the MedDRA high-level group term 'Embolism and thrombosis'. IR by 6-month interval was analysed for serious AEs, serious infections, AEs leading to discontinuation, malignancies, MACE, injection-site reactions, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1000 cells/mm 3, ALT > 3× upper limit of normal (ULN), and platelet count < 100 giga/L. The exact method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for proportions. For ANC, ALT and platelet count, the largest abnormality during follow-up is reported. Incidences of infection and serious infection were calculated by maximum neutropenia grade recorded at any time during the study. In addition, for infections that occurred within 12 weeks after an ANC assessment, incidences of infection and serious infection were calculated by the last ANC assessment before onset of the infection.

Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists — rationale and existing approvals in COVID-19 are outlined, noting that some patients develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome with elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and multiorgan dysfunction, and early descriptions found that elevated IL-6 with hyperinflammation was associated with more severe disease. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL-6-receptor blocking antibody, has been proposed to mitigate hyperinflammation and is FDA-approved for various rheumatologic conditions and cytokine release syndrome associated with CAR-T cell therapy, while sarilumab is currently FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis.

### Outcomes and biomarker analyses among patients with COVID-19 treated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist sarilumab at a single institution in Italy [^76bc051e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Although caution must be exercised when comparing across trials, the outcomes observed in this case series roughly correspond to the topline results that were announced for the global randomized phase II/III trial of sarilumab for critically ill patients with COVID-19. In the trial, of the 88 patients in the critical group who received high-dose sarilumab (400 mg), 52 (59%) achieved clinical improvement after treatment and 20 (23%) died.

Modulation of the severe inflammatory state associated with severe COVID-19 may offer a potentially important strategy to limit pulmonary complications of the disease, reducing the necessity for intensive care unit support and ultimately mortality. It is evident, however, that the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly heterogeneous, with presentations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to irreversible respiratory failure. Furthermore, the ultimate etiology of acute respiratory distress in COVID-19 remains a matter of some controversy, with the relative contributions of unrestrained viral replication versus hyperinflammation still incompletely understood. The timing of intervention may be important, as treatment with anti-IL-6 therapies too early in the course of infection could hinder the eventual development of a protective adaptive immune response. Conversely, the benefit of IL-6 modulation may be limited in cases where the hyperinflammatory cascade is too far advanced. Multiple strategies may be needed due to the overlapping regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Ongoing trials are investigating agents directed against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IFNγ and IL-1, among others. Encouraging results have been reported in a small-scale study of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, where a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death was observed with treatment compared with historical controls (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41; p < 0.0001). Identifying biomarkers of response to treatment with sarilumab or other IL-6-modulatory therapies will be important for the ultimate incorporation of these strategies into widespread use. Among patients studied here, the most reliable marker of clinical response was CRP, which declined steeply immediately after sarilumab administration among patients with responsive disease. Although IL-6 levels also eventually decreased, the initial kinetics (characterized by a transient increase after treatment) make measurements of the cytokine non-ideal for clinical decision making. Furthermore, given that same-day access to IL-6 levels may be limited in some hospitals, CRP is a more useful marker of real-time evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^01128e5c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as an important novel class of immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), and are set to be more widely used in clinical practice. However, this new class of therapies is associated with a distinct adverse event (AE) profile that includes cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, as well as AEs leading to increased infection risk such as cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections themselves. As preliminary data with this class of agents shows an increased risk of infections as compared with conventional MM treatment regimens, such as immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), guidance on infection monitoring, prophylaxis and treatment is required. This review provides consensus recommendations from a panel of 13 global experts, following a meeting in August 2022. The meeting objective was to review existing literature and identify relevant information on infections with all BsAbs in patients with MM, as well as to discuss clinical experience of experts in managing these infections. The recommendations outlined here can be used to guide management of infection risk factors, such as hypogammaglobulinemia and neutropenia. In addition, they can be used to guide the monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections, including emerging infections of interest, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the use of vaccinations prior to and during BsAb treatment. The recommendations have been graded by the panel based on level of data available. Key recommendations include universal herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus prophylaxis, screening for hepatitis B virus reactivation risk in all patients, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for immunoparesis and in the absence of life-threatening infectious manifestations, use of colony-stimulating factors in patients with Grade 3 neutropenia, universal pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis and no routine anti-fungal prophylaxis.

### Sarilumab and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [^d55da0b8]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sarilumab plus conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to receive sarilumab 150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks with background conventional synthetic DMARDs. The co-primary end points were the proportion of patients achieving a response according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for improvement (ACR20) at week 24, and change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI) at week 12. Each sarilumab dose was evaluated against placebo; differences between the 2 sarilumab doses were not assessed.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the treatment groups were similar. The ACR20 response rate at week 24 was significantly higher with sarilumab 150 mg and sarilumab 200 mg every 2 weeks compared with placebo (55.8%, 60.9%, and 33.7%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The mean change from baseline in the HAQ DI score at week 12 was significantly greater for sarilumab (least squares mean change: for 150 mg, -0.46 [P = 0.0007]; for 200 mg, -0.47 [P = 0.0004]) versus placebo (-0.26). Infections were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Serious infections occurred in 1.1%, 0.6%, and 1.1% of patients receiving placebo, sarilumab 150 mg, and sarilumab 200 mg, respectively. Laboratory abnormalities included decreased absolute neutrophil count and increased transaminase levels in both sarilumab groups compared with placebo. In this study, reductions in the absolute neutrophil count were not associated with an increased incidence of infections or serious infections.

Conclusion

Sarilumab 150 mg and sarilumab 200 mg every 2 weeks plus conventional synthetic DMARDs improved the signs and symptoms of RA and physical function in patients with an inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF agents. Safety data were consistent with interleukin-6 receptor blockade and the known safety profile of sarilumab.

3.2 Mortality

We performed a meta‐analysis of 33 observational studies (3073 cases and 6502 controls) which reported significantly decreased mortality after patients received immunosuppressants in the overall analysis (OR = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57–0.89, p = 0.004). When using subgroup analysis, we found significant associations within the mixed race subgroup (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72–0.95, p = 0.006), Caucasian subgroup (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.35–0.74, p = 0.000), moderate subgroup (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.01–0.33, p = 0.001), severe subgroup (OR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.45–0.80, p = 0.001), critical (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65–0.92, p = 0.003), dose of 8 mg/kg subgroup (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60–0.95, p = 0.019), no specific dose subgroup (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.60–0.87, p = 0.001), case‐control subgroup (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.46–0.97, p = 0.035), multicentre case‐control subgroup (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.48–0.83, p = 0.001), journal type subgroup (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.54–0.88, p = 0.003), case size of > 100 subgroup (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57–0.94, p = 0.015), case size of < 100 subgroup (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.48–0.99, p = 0.042), tocilizumab subgroup (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58–0.94, p = 0.013) and anakinra subgroup (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.19–0.85, p = 0.017), but not the remaining subgroups. Interestingly, when compared to the standard treatment group, we found increased mortality after COVID‐9 patients had received immunosuppressants in the Asian subgroup analysis (OR = 8.71, 95% CI = 1.08–10.14, p = 0.042). Specific data are summarised in Figure 2a and Table 2.

### Efficacy and secondary infection risk of tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^410669bf]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Some RCTs have reported that tocilizumab was not effective in preventing intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalised patients with COVID‐19. However, several studies have found that tocilizumab may be a safe and promising therapeutic option for use in combination with standard care to prevent disease progression in hospitalised patients with moderate COVID‐19 and hyperinflammation. Only one article was found to show that overall clinical improvement and mortality in patients with severe COVID‐19 were not significantly different between sarilumab and standard care options.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the only systematic review and meta‐analysis conducted to investigate the efficacy and secondary infection risk of immunosuppressants treatment in COVID‐19 patients. In our meta‐analysis, we also found that tocilizumab significantly decreased mortality in COVID‐19 patients without any increased risk of secondary infection. In addition, we found similar results in several subgroups. However, we found that tocilizumab therapy significantly increased the risk of fungal co‐infection in COVID‐19 patients. Therefore, our data suggest that clinicians should be aware of antifungal therapy when COVID‐19 patients are receiving tocilizumab therapy.

There are several limitations to our current study, which needs to be addressed. Firstly, only 33 studies were included, and the relatively small total sample size had limited power for the exploration of real associations. Secondly, subgroup analyses involved relatively small groups, which may not impart sufficient statistical power to explore real associations and are more likely to reveal greater beneficial effects than large‐scale trials. Thirdly, every doctor has a different treatment for clinical diagnostic and treatment algorithms, which would allow for adjustment by other factors. In addition, the inclusion of zero‐event trials can sometimes decrease the effect size estimate and narrow the CIs.

### Two years of sarilumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to MTX: safety, efficacy and radiographic outcomes [^fb62fb3c]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine 2-year safety, efficacy and radiographic outcomes of sarilumab in adults with RA and inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR).

Methods

In the randomized, placebo-controlled MOBILITY trial, MTX-IR patients received subcutaneous sarilumab (150 or 200 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks (q2w) plus MTX for up to 1 year. Upon study completion, patients could enrol in the open-label, long-term extension study (EXTEND, NCT011046652), in which all patients received sarilumab 200 mg q2w plus MTX. Dose reduction to 150 mg q2w was allowed for abnormal laboratory findings and per investigator's discretion.

Results

Of 1197 patients participating in MOBILITY, 901 entered EXTEND. Over the 2-year period, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious AEs occurred at rates of 279.6 events per 100 patient-years and 16.6 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. The most common TEAEs were neutropenia, injection site erythema, increased alanine aminotransferase and upper respiratory tract infections. After 1 year in the open-label, long-term extension, disease activity reached similar levels regardless of initial treatment. Modified total Sharp scores at year 1 were maintained through year 2. Best radiographic outcomes were observed in patients initially randomized to sarilumab 200 mg q2w. After dose reduction, 89.4% of patients continued the study through 2 years.

Conclusion

Sarilumab safety through year 2 was consistent with IL-6 receptor blockade. Clinical response was similar irrespective of initial treatment, and radiographic progression stabilized. Patients initiated on sarilumab 200 mg q2w had the best radiographic outcomes. Dose reduction allowed most patients to continue with the study.

### A comprehensive review on sarilumab in COVID-19 [^66278084]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread all around the world. Despite the emergency of COVID-19 worldwide, remdesivir is the only treatment that has been recently approved to treat the diseases, and other effective therapies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. Based on available data, there is an association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and severe COVID-19. Sarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody binding to both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors with high affinity and has been considered for off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19. Areas covered: The present article reviews recently published literature focusing on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, the potential therapeutic role, and important clinical issues of sarilumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: The off-label treatment administration is unavoidable in the critical situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further efforts should be directed to determine mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced immune dysregulation as well as indications of sarilumab in the patients with COVID-19 to minimize concerns regarding its off-label administration.

### Sarilumab plus methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to methotrexate: results of a phase III study [^995ecdd6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sarilumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Adults with moderate-to-severe RA and an inadequate response to MTX were randomized (1:1:1) to receive sarilumab (doses of 150 mg or 200 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks in conjunction with weekly MTX for 52 weeks. Co-primary end points were the proportion of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement responses at week 24, change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) at week 16, and change from baseline in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) of radiographic damage at week 52.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar among the groups. For all 3 co-primary end points, the sarilumab 150 mg and 200 mg groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements as compared with the placebo group (ACR20 response rate at week 24, 58.0%, 66.4%, and 33.4%, respectively [P < 0.0001]; least squares mean change in HAQ DI at week 16, -0.53, -0.55, and -0.29, respectively [P < 0.0001]; and mean change in SHS at week 52, 0.90, 0.25, and 2.78, respectively [P < 0.0001]). The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was infection. In the sarilumab 150 mg, sarilumab 200 mg, and placebo groups, the incidence of serious infections was 2.6%, 4.0%, and 2.3%, respectively. Elevations in alanine aminotransferase levels > 3-fold the upper limit of normal occurred in 9.5%, 8.0%, and 2.1% of patients, respectively; in 24 patients, this led to discontinuation of treatment. Elevated total cholesterol levels were observed in 36.8%, 43.0%, and 18.3% of patients, respectively. In patients receiving 150 mg and 200 mg sarilumab, neutrophil counts of 0.5 to < 1.0 × 10(9) /liter were observed in 5.1% and 7.8% of patients, respectively, while neutrophil counts of < 0.5 × 10(9) /liter were observed in 0.9% and 0.7% of patients, respectively; none of the patients receiving placebo experienced changes in neutrophil counts.

Conclusion

In RA patients treated with sarilumab (150 mg or 200 mg every 2 weeks) in combination with MTX, both doses provided sustained clinical efficacy, as shown by significant improvements in symptomatic, functional, and radiographic outcomes. Sarilumab was generally well tolerated. The adverse events observed in this study were consistent with the effects of interleukin-6 signaling blockade.

Laboratory abnormalities

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1000 cells/mm 3, ALT > 3 upper limit of normal and platelet count < 100 × 10 9 cells/l occurred in 10 (9.1%), 3 (2.7%) and 1 (0.9%) patients in Sarilumab Monotherapy and 244 (12.8%), 190 (10.0%) and 74 (3.9%) patients in Sarilumab + csDMARD groups, respectively. Similarly, 24 (15.2%), 19 (11.5%) and 4 (2.4%) patients in Continuation and 24 (15.6%), 13 (8.4) and 4 (2.6%) patients in Switch groups had ANC < 1000 cells/mm 3, ALT > 3 upper limit of normal and platelet count < 100 × 10 9 cells/l, respectively (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). In the majority of patients, a second assessment was within normal limits without interruption of treatment. Overall, patients with ANC below the lower limit of normal had similar incidences of infections compared with those with normal ANC counts (Supplementary Table S7, available at Rheumatology online). Thus, incidence of infections was generally similar between patient groups regardless of reported neutropenia.

Efficacy outcomes

Improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA achieved during the DB period were maintained throughout the OLE assessment period. Mean DAS28-CRP, mean Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and proportions of patients with ACR 20/50/70 responses, DAS28-CRP < 2.6 and CDAI ≤ 2.8 (CDAI remission) were maintained across all treatment groups (Figs 2 and 3), and this was similarly true for individual ACR components (Supplementary Figs S7 and S8, available at Rheumatology online). Both Continuation and Switch groups demonstrated stable mean DAS28-ESR levels over time and proportions of patients with DAS28-ESR < 2.6 (remission) and DAS28-ESR < 3.2 (low disease activity) were maintained (Fig. 3).

### Sarilumab use in severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^e3e40fa8]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, Sarilumab appears to be safe and we did not register drug-related serious adverse events and no secondary infections up to the last follow-up.

Initial reports revealed that baseline demographic and clinical parameters may be useful to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection prognosis. In this contest, we found that young SARS-CoV-2 pos patients with severe pneumonia with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio > 142·7 and not extreme systemic inflammation (IL-6 plasma levels < 91·3 pg/ml) have the highest chance of Sarilumab efficacy in terms of early clinical response and less need to be transferred to ICU than patients not fulfilling these criteria. Whether a higher intensity drug exposure (more i.v. infusions) would better control the more aggressive underlying inflammation, will be highligthed only by a targeted randomized trial using a biomarker-oriented approach. Conversely, a multiparametric nomogram including such variables allows to predict the need of being transferred to ICU up to 80% of patients with severe pneumonia. Interestingly, analysing the dynamics of clinical response of patients treated with Sarilumab, it arose that the sooner therapy is started, the sooner the positive result in terms of clinical improvement is observed ("window of opportunity"). In this study neither-Dimers levels, nor lymphopenia arose as predictors of a critical outcome, while the pre-treatment PaO/FiO 2 value had the greatest role along with age.

The limitations of this report are its open-label nature with no comparison group, the single center setting, the limited number of critical-ICU patients and adoption of concomitant treatments of unproven efficacy (possibly increasing the safety results). Moreover, a longer follow-up may be useful to increase the strength of our findings in terms of long-term efficacy and safety of Sarilumab in SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia. Yet, an outpatient clinic for these patients has already been set-up to collect prospective clinical and biological informations.

In conclusion, IL-6R inhibition leads to good clinical outcome in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and Sarilumab is a valid and safe alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium of this disease without defined standardized treatment algorythms.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO — Patients with COVID-19 pulmonary disease needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO have the highest risk of mortality, and pharmacologically, we recommend treating them similarly to those on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula. Corticosteroids are strongly recommended as trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit. In addition to steroids, the panel recommends using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab is preferred over sarilumab) in critically ill patients who have elevated inflammatory markers like CRP; where IL-6 inhibitors are not available, baricitinib can be used in mechanically ventilated patients as a small trial showed a mortality benefit. Most other COVID-19 therapies studied in other severities have either not demonstrated benefit or not been studied in this population.

5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforation

Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies, primarily as complications of diverticulitis. GI perforation risk may be increased with concurrent diverticulitis or concomitant use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4 Immunosuppression

Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of treatment with KEVZARA on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were reported in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with KEVZARA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.3% of patients in controlled RA trials. Injection site rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop administration of KEVZARA immediately. Do not administer KEVZARA to patients with known hypersensitivity to sarilumab [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.6 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment

Treatment with KEVZARA is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment, as treatment with KEVZARA was associated with transaminase elevations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

5.7 Live Vaccines

Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines during treatment with KEVZARA due to potentially increased risk of infections; clinical safety of live vaccines during KEVZARA treatment has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving KEVZARA. Prior to initiating treatment, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of KEVZARA therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Safety and tolerability of subcutaneous sarilumab and intravenous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^536043b9]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Mean change from baseline in ANC ± by treatment and visit in (A) ASCERTAIN (weeks 1–24), (B) Study 1309 (days 1–29) and (C) Study 1309 (days 1–7)

a Patients in the 4/8 mg/kg q4w i.v. group increased their dose to 8 mg/kg at week 4 and remained on 8 mg/kg for the remainder of the study. b There were four sampling points on day 1: baseline, 1 h, 4 h and 8 h after dosing. ANC: absolute neutrophil count; BL: baseline; q2w: every 2 weeks; q4w: every 4 weeks.

In Study 1309, a dose-dependent effect on ANC < 1.0 giga/l was observed, with a higher incidence reported in the high-dose sarilumab and tocilizumab groups compared with the low-dose groups (Table 4). Over days 1–7, there was no meaningful difference across all treatment groups in the ANC parameters assessed. The time to onset for decreased ANC and magnitude of decrease were similar across the sarilumab and tocilizumab groups for all doses. ANC decreased within a few hours of dosing (Fig. 1 B and C). The median time to ANC nadir ranged from 3 to 5 days after administration; mean nadir values ranged from 1.55 to 1.78 giga/l across all treatment groups. The timing of the trend for return to baseline was consistent with the dosing interval for both sarilumab (q2w) and tocilizumab (q4w). By day 15, the approximate time that a second dose of sarilumab would be given in a q2w dosing regimen, ANC values in the sarilumab groups had increased but had not yet returned to baseline. By day 29, the approximate time that a second dose of tocilizumab would be given in a q4w dosing regimen, ANC values had essentially returned to baseline in the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg group but not in the 8 mg/kg group. Decreases in ANC did not appear to be associated with an increased incidence of infections.

### Safety and tolerability of subcutaneous sarilumab and intravenous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^cb25978e]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Safety and efficacy of mAbs blocking the IL-6 receptor have been established in RA. This is the first analysis examining safety and tolerability of sarilumab and tocilizumab administered as single or multiple doses in patients with RA within the same study.

Methods

In ASCERTAIN, patients were randomized 1: 1: 2 to 24 weeks' double-blind sarilumab 150 or 200 mg every 2 weeks s.c. or tocilizumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks i.v., increased to 8 mg/kg if clinically indicated. In Study 1309, patients were randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to single-dose open-label sarilumab 150 or 200 mg s.c. or tocilizumab 4 or 8 mg/kg i.v.

Results

In ASCERTAIN, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between sarilumab and tocilizumab. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were the following: sarilumab: neutropenia [6 patients (12.2%) in the 150 mg group and 8 (15.7%) in the 200 mg group], nasopharyngitis [6 (12.2%) and 3 (5.9%)], and injection-site erythema [4 (8.2%) and 4 (7.8%)]; tocilizumab: accidental overdose [9 (8.8%)], upper respiratory tract infection [7 (6.9%)] and nausea [7 (6.9%)]. Laboratory changes in both studies included decreased neutrophils and platelets and increased transaminases and lipids. In Study 1309, incidence of absolute neutrophil count < 1.0 giga/l was similar between sarilumab and tocilizumab, and occurred more frequently in the higher dose groups. No association between decrease in absolute neutrophil count and increased incidence of infection was observed in either study.

Conclusion

No clinically meaningful differences in treatment-emergent adverse events were observed between sarilumab and tocilizumab. Laboratory changes with sarilumab were within the same range as those with tocilizumab.

Incidence rates of selected laboratory abnormalities by 6-month interval

ALT: alanine aminotransferase; ANC: absolute neutrophil count; csDMARD: conventional synthetic DMARD; PY: patient-years; ULN: upper limit of normal.

ALT increase was reported as an AE in 11% and 6% of patients treated with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (IR 5.0 and 3.8 per 100 patient-years, respectively; Table 2). ALT elevations were observed in 65% and 48% of patients with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online). ALT elevations > 3× ULN, the level at which dose interruption is recommended, were observed in 10% and 6% of patients with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively. Analysis by 6-month interval showed that incidence of ALT > 3× ULN was greatest during the first 6 months of treatment and declined thereafter (Fig. 2). ALT normalized on treatment in 162 (55%) of the 296 patients with ALT > 3× ULN in the combination group and in 17 (65%) of the 26 patients with ALT > 3× ULN in the monotherapy group (Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online). Bilirubin elevations > 1.5× ULN were observed in 135 patients (4.7%) and 25 patients (5.3%) with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively, of whom 43 (1.5%) and 6 (1.3%) had elevations > 2× ULN. There were no cases of Hy's law attributable to sarilumab treatment.

Thrombocytopenia was reported at a rate of 1.8 and 1.0 per 100 patient-years with combination therapy and monotherapy, respectively (Table 3). Platelet counts < 100 giga/L, the level at which dose interruption is recommended, were observed in 2.8% and 1.3% of patients with combination and monotherapy, respectively (Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online). Analysis by 6-month interval showed no increased incidence of platelet count < 100 giga/L over time (Fig. 2). Platelet counts normalized on treatment in 47 (59%) of the 80 patients with platelet count < 100 giga/L in the combination group and in four (67%) of the six patients with platelet count < 100 giga/L in the monotherapy group (Supplementary Table S5, available at Rheumatology online).

### Sarilumab plus standard of carestandard of care for the treatment of severe COVID-19: a phase 3, randomized, open-labeled, multi-center study (ESCAPE study) [^d51eac73]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In line with our findings, evidences supporting the treatment with sarilumab from other Randomized Clinical Trials evaluating its efficacy compared to usual care or placebo, were not so certain. Indeed, each of these trials failed to demonstrate sarilumab superiority in terms of clinical improvement and mortality among patients with severe or critical COVID-19. In the SARICOR study, only a trend toward better outcomes was observed for the early use of sarilumab, compared to SOC, among patients requiring oxygen support and with features of systemic inflammation, 90% of whom was on corticosteroids therapy. However, important differences in the design of all these studies need to be considered in drawing conclusions about their implications for clinical practice, and their clinical and methodological heterogeneity might limit the extent to which resulted estimates can lead to relevant conclusions. Moreover, although not published, the press release from the manufacturer of sarilumab strongly suggests no benefit (and possible arm) when used as monotherapy.

Therefore, studies on sarilumab had the main limitation to have been generally performed earlier in the pandemic, when COVID-19 treatment was not standardized, with low rates of concomitant corticosteroids use. Similarly, in our study, in which adjunctive steroid treatment was not defined by the protocol but was prescribed on the judgment of the clinical investigator, less than half of the participants received such agents at the randomization, equally distributed between the two treatment arms, and this could be one of the explanations for the lack of efficacy of the study drug. Interestingly, and partially supporting this hypothesis, some benefits were shown in participants with low CRP values, in whom IL-6 suppression alone might be sufficient to control the inflammatory burden, also in the absence of the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by corticosteroids, highlighting the importance of the timing of the intervention. A subgroup analysis, considering only patients receiving corticosteroids, was not performed for the relatively small sample size.

### Efficacy and secondary infection risk of tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4c4098bd]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

As the pandemic progresses, the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is becoming clearer and the potential for immunotherapy is increasing. However, clinical efficacy and safety of immunosuppressants (including tocilizumab, sarilumab and anakinra) treatment in COVID‐19 patients are not yet known. We searched PubMed, Embase Medline, Web of Science and MedRxiv using specific search terms in studies published from 1 January 2020 to 20 December 2020. In total, 33 studies, including 3073 cases and 6502 controls, were selected for meta‐analysis. We found that immunosuppressant therapy significantly decreased mortality in COVID‐19 patients on overall analysis (odds ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.57–0.89, p = 0.004). We also found that tocilizumab and anakinra significantly decreased mortality in patients without any increased risk of secondary infection. In addition, we found similar results in several subgroups. However, we found that tocilizumab therapy significantly increased the risk of fungal co‐infections in COVID‐19 patients. This represents the only systematic review and meta‐analysis to investigate the efficacy and secondary infection risk of immunosuppressant treatment in COVID‐19 patients. Overall, immunosuppressants significantly decreased mortality but had no effect on increased risk of secondary infections. Our analysis of tocilizumab therapy showed a significantly increased risk of fungal co‐infections in these patients.

Methods

Study design

ASCERTAIN (NCT01768572) was an international, multicentre, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, three-arm study assessing the safety and tolerability of sarilumab and tocilizumab in patients with RA and inadequate response to or intolerance of TNF inhibitor (TNF-IR) receiving background csDMARDs. The primary objective of ASCERTAIN was to assess the safety and tolerability of sarilumab and tocilizumab in TNF-IR patients with RA. Patients were randomized 1: 1: 2 to sarilumab 150 or 200 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) s.c. or tocilizumab 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks (q4w) i.v. which could be increased to 8 mg/kg if clinically indicated, consistent with US prescribing information at the time of the study (October 2012). Patients were also allowed to decrease the dose of tocilizumab from 8 to 4 mg/kg during the course of the study at the discretion of the investigator. Dose adjustments were not allowed for sarilumab. Safety assessments included incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), adverse events (AEs) of special interest, serious AEs, and potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. During the study, patients who experienced AEs and prespecified laboratory abnormalities [e.g. decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC), decreased platelet count, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] could temporarily or permanently discontinue the study drug in accordance with protocol requirements. Laboratory assessments were made at predetermined time points throughout the study (e.g. complete blood count every 2 weeks).

Mortality and secondary infection risk after COVID‐19 patients received immunosuppressants therapy

3.3 Secondary infection risk

No significant associations were observed between immunosuppressants and an elevated risk of secondary infection in the overall analysis (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.89‐1.43, p = 0.309). We did, however, find significantly decreased secondary infection risk after COVID‐19 patients received immunosuppressants in the mixed‐severity subgroup (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18–0.74, p = 0.005). However, we found significantly increased secondary infection risk after COVID‐19 patients received immunosuppressants in the dose of 400‐mg subgroup (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.15–2.26, p = 0.005) and dose of 400 to 800‐mg subgroup (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.07–193, p = 0.017). In addition, an edge effect may exist in the RCT subgroup (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.57–1.01, p = 0.057). Data on the association between risks of immunosuppressants and secondary infection are summarised in Table 2 and Figure 2b.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors

Tocilizumab and sarilumab are potent IL-6 receptor inhibitors. Initial trials were not powered to detect safety but did report cases of severe Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, zoster and limb abscess. With initial trials showing elevated LDL cholesterol, a cardiovascular safety trial randomised 3080 patients to tocilizumab or etanercept. While there was no difference in cardiovascular outcomes, there was a significantly higher risk of serious infections with tocilizumab, with 4.5 serious infections/100 pyrs for tocilizumab compared with 3.2/100 pyrs for etanercept (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.79). One observational study from insurance databases showed a small difference in the rate of a composite outcome including serious bacterial infection, diverticulitis, and skin and soft tissue infections in tocilizumab compared with TNFi (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.33), and showed larger differences compared with abatacept (1.40, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.63). A separate observational study showed similar risk of serious infection with tocilizumab compared with TNFi. Overall the risk for infection with IL-6 inhibitors seems similar or perhaps slightly greater than the risk with TNFi, although more data are needed to better quantify this risk.

CD20 targeting for B cell depletion

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 which leads to B cell depletion. The data regarding the risk of serious infections in rituximab are generally favourable. Pooled analysis of cohort and randomised studies showed no significant differences between rituximab and other treatment groups both in overall infections and in serious infections (4.1% vs 4.6%; OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.31). A Cochrane review of eight trials in rituximab in conjunction with methotrexate for RA compared with methotrexate alone showed no significant difference in the risk of all infections (relative risk [RR] 1.1, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30) or serious infections (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.10). One observational study suggested a higher risk of infection with rituximab compared with other biologics, although this has not been found in other observational studies. The risk for serious infection with rituximab does not seem substantially different from other biologics, with some studies even suggesting a risk similar to csDMARDs.

### Safety and tolerability of subcutaneous sarilumab and intravenous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^dbc2b5ca]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ASCERTAIN and Study 1309 were the first studies in which sarilumab and tocilizumab were evaluated in patients with RA within the same study using multiple and single doses, respectively, providing an opportunity to understand the safety and tolerability of these two agents within the same therapeutic class of IL-6R inhibitors. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were observed regarding safety between sarilumab and tocilizumab in either study. The incidence and type of TEAEs were similar for the sarilumab and tocilizumab groups in each study.

In ASCERTAIN, the incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was numerically higher with sarilumab than with tocilizumab, but some of these discontinuations were due to protocol-mandated criteria related to laboratory changes; these laboratory changes occurred without clinical manifestations. While most patients in the sarilumab groups who interrupted therapy because of laboratory abnormalities resumed treatment as these abnormalities resolved, three patients were discontinued because the protocol-mandated interval between i.v. infusions had been exceeded. There was no clinical pattern for the non-laboratory TEAEs that led to discontinuation, but the low number of events limits assessment and interpretation of these data.

Upper respiratory tract infections and neutropenia were among the most frequent TEAEs in both studies. Laboratory changes in both studies were consistent with IL-6R inhibition and included increases in lipids and transaminases and decreases in neutrophil counts. Mean changes in ANC in the sarilumab groups were within the ranges observed in the tocilizumab groups.

The association between IL-6 signalling and the PD marker ANC after a single dose of sarilumab or tocilizumab was assessed in Study 1309. This assessment indicated that despite differences in PK profiles due to route of administration and 10-fold lower drug peak concentrations with sarilumab s.c. compared with tocilizumab i.v. (data not shown), similar rapid decreases in ANC (within 4 h), nadir values and median time to nadir values were observed across all four treatment groups. ANC returned towards baseline earlier with sarilumab than with tocilizumab, which is consistent with drug concentration–time profiles. A dose-dependent effect on ANC < 1.0 giga/l was observed, with a higher incidence reported in the high-dose sarilumab and tocilizumab groups versus the low-dose groups. Decreased ANC was not associated with an increased incidence of infections.

Tocilizumab Exposure

During the study period, preference was given to enrollment in an IL-6 inhibitor (sarilumab) clinical trial. However, given strict trial eligibility criteria and protocol requirements (eg, timed phlebotomy and repeated SARS-CoV-2 testing), tocilizumab was considered in patients ineligible for the trial or when trial enrollment was not feasible due to logistical constraints (eg, outside of enrollment hours or on nonstudy units). Criteria for tocilizumab usage were developed by the institutional Antimicrobial Stewardship Program and Division of Infectious Diseases. In general, tocilizumab was recommended for consideration in patients with rapid respiratory deterioration and evidence of hyperinflammation. Guidance was slightly modified during the study period based on drug availability, whether the sarilumab trial was active, and experiences of the treating team. None of these changes were substantial (usage criteria as of 19 May 2020 in Supplementary Methods). Adherence to this guidance was not enforced or mandatory, as within our large Infectious Diseases Division providers had varying views on the use of investigational or repurposed agents such as tocilizumab. The language in the guidance was intentionally nonprescriptive, saying that tocilizumab "May be considered. " and cautioning that ". the evidence for benefit is weak, and a risk for potential harm exists". Ultimately, individualized decisions on tocilizumab usage were made by the attending infectious diseases physician. The standard tocilizumab dose was 8 mg/kg (maximum 800 mg) × 1; additional doses were discouraged.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was survival probability after intubation. A secondary endpoint assessed status at day 28 on a 6-level ordinal scale of illness severity, including bloodstream infection and pneumonia: (1) discharged alive, (2) hospitalized/off ventilator without superinfection, (3) hospitalized/off ventilator with superinfection, (4) hospitalized/mechanically ventilated without superinfection, (5) hospitalized/mechanically ventilated with superinfection, and (6) deceased.

### Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in psoriatic patients treated with biologics: a real life experience [^2a39deb4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of COVID‐19 in psoriasis is still not adequately known, and there is no evidence that psoriatic patients are at high‐risk and that biologics alter the risk of contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or cause a worse outcome of COVID‐19 disease. Biological agents target the immune system and are contraindicated in patients with chronic viral infections, as HIV or active hepatitis. In general, in patients under immune‐modulating treatments, including biological agents, it is recommended to continue their therapy during COVID‐19 pandemic. On the contrary, it is reasonable to interrupt systemic therapy in psoriatic patients with positive test for SARS‐CoV‐2 or with COVID‐19 disease because potentially negative effects of the therapy cannot be fully excluded.

These patients should monitor the symptoms and discuss the management of their diseases with health care providers.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^3db213da]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Vaccinations

Background

Appropriate use of vaccinations is important in MM patients, to produce immune responses and prevent potentially harmful infections. However, MM patients often have a lower response to vaccinations, so additional guidance may be required.

Vaccine recommendations for patients receiving BsAbs

We recommend following general guidelines on the use of live attenuated vaccines (level IIC); however, it should be noted that live vaccines are contraindicated in MM patients, with the exception of those with complete immune reconstitution (patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT] > 24 months prior). Immunity following vaccination is not guaranteed in these patients, as immune response is variable across vaccine recipients, and is particularly unpredictable among patients with MM due to the immune-regulating treatments they receive. It has been observed that vaccinations in patients with MM may induce protective T-cell responses even in the absence of antibody responses.

It must be ensured that post-stem cell transplant vaccinations have been carried out (level III). In patients without a history of transplant, it is recommended that patients receive COVID-19 vaccination as per CDC guidelines (level III), yearly influenza vaccination (level III), pneumococcal vaccine (level III), and the varicella zoster vaccine (level III).

To reduce the infection risk, it is recommended that close contacts receive seasonal vaccines (level III). We cannot recommend avoiding close contact with recipients of live vaccines, due to the difficulty of achieving this (level IIC). However, it is recommended that healthcare providers caring for these patients should be fully immunized and should receive seasonal influenza vaccines (level III). Prior to traveling to endemic areas of infection, patients should receive travel vaccinations and undergo consultation with an infectious disease specialist (level III).

Literature summary

There are currently no clinical trial data regarding the use of vaccines in patients receiving BsAbs.

### Interleukin-6 blocking agents for treating COVID-19: a living systematic review [^90267d39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) blocking agents have been used for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Their immunosuppressive effect might be valuable in patients with COVID-19 characterised by substantial immune system dysfunction by controlling inflammation and promoting disease tolerance.

Objectives

To assess the effect of IL-6 blocking agents compared to standard care alone or with placebo on efficacy and safety outcomes in COVID-19. We will update this assessment regularly.

Search Methods

We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to 11 February 2021) and the L-OVE platform, and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register to identify trials up to 26 February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL-6 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two review authors independently collected data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence with the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes such as clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement on the scale used by trialists to evaluate clinical progression or recovery) (day (D) 28 / ≥ D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation ± additional organ support OR death) (D28 / ≥ D60); all-cause mortality (D28 / ≥ D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs with available data including one platform trial comparing tocilizumab and sarilumab with standard of care. These trials evaluated tocilizumab (nine RCTs including two platform trials; seven were reported as peer-reviewed articles, two as preprints; 6428 randomised participants); and two sarilumab (one platform trial reported as peer reviewed article, one reported as preprint, 880 randomised participants). All trials included were multicentre trials. They were conducted in Brazil, China, France, Italy, UK, USA, and four were multi-country trials. The mean age range of participants ranged from 56 to 65 years; 4572 (66.3%) of trial participants were male. Disease severity ranged from mild to critical disease. The reported proportion of participants on oxygen at baseline but not intubated varied from 56% to 100% where reported. Five trials reported the inclusion of intubated patients at baseline. We identified a further 20 registered RCTs of tocilizumab compared to placebo/standard care (five completed without available results, five terminated without available results, eight ongoing, two not recruiting); 11 RCTs of sarilumab (two completed without results, three terminated without available results, six ongoing); six RCTs of clazakisumab (five ongoing, one not recruiting); two RCTs of olokizumab (one completed, one not recruiting); one of siltuximab (ongoing) and one RCT of levilimab (completed without available results). Of note, three were cancelled (2 tocilizumab, 1 clazakisumab). One multiple-arm RCT evaluated both tocilizumab and sarilumab compared to standard of care, one three-arm RCT evaluated tocilizumab and siltuximab compared to standard of care and consequently they appear in each respective comparison. Tocilizumab versus standard care alone or with placebo a. Effectiveness of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 Tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome of clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; I² = 40.9%; 7 RCTs, 5585 participants; absolute effect: 31 more with clinical improvement per 1000 (from 0 fewer to 67 more); moderate-certainty evidence). However, we cannot exclude that some subgroups of patients could benefit from the treatment. We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (≥ D60). The effect of tocilizumab on the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level of 7 or above is uncertain at D28 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.74; I² = 64.4%; 3 RCTs, 712 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (≥ D60). Tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; I² = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 6363 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 52 fewer to 9 fewer); high-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests uncertainty around the effect on mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.40; I² = 0.0%; 2 RCTs, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence). b. Safety of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tocilizumab on adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.72; I² = 86.4%; 7 RCTs, 1534 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06; I² = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 2312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Sarilumab versus standard care alone or with placebo The evidence is uncertain about the effect of sarilumab on all-cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty), on all-cause mortality at ≥ D60 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.0; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low certainty), and serious adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty). It is unlikely that sarilumab results in an important increase of adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; 1 RCT, 420 participants; moderate certainty). However, an increase cannot be excluded No data were available for other critical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

On average, tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo and probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo. Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement measured by trialist-defined scales) at D28. The impact of tocilizumab on other outcomes is uncertain or very uncertain. With the data available, we were not able to explore heterogeneity. Individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to be able to identify which patients are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Evidence for an effect of sarilumab is uncertain and evidence for other anti-IL6 agents is unavailable. Thirty-nine RCTs of IL-6 blocking agents with no results are currently registered, of which nine are completed and seven trials were terminated with no results available. The findings of this review will be updated as new data are made available on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com).

### Interleukin-6 receptor blockade in patients with COVID-19: placing clinical trials into context [^f0f0a795]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but uncertainty remains about the potential benefits and harms of targeting IL-6 signalling in patients with the disease. The efficacy and safety of tocilizumab and sarilumab, which block the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, have been tested in adults with COVID-19-related acute respiratory illness in randomised trials, with important differences in trial design, characteristics of included patients, use of co-interventions, and outcome measurement scales. In this Series paper, we review the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of studies of IL-6 receptor antagonists, and consider how this heterogeneity might have influenced reported treatment effects. Timing from clinical presentation to treatment, severity of illness, and concomitant use of corticosteroids are among the factors that might have contributed to apparently inconsistent results. With an understanding of the sources of variability in these trials, available evidence could be applied to guide clinical decision making and to inform the enrichment of future studies.

### Risk of infections and cancer in patients with rheumatologic diseases receiving interleukin inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^469ef6d7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The pooled results from 74 randomized clinical trials (n = 29 214) suggests that the risk of serious infections, opportunistic infections, and cancer is increased in patients with rheumatologic diseases who are treated with IL inhibitors compared with placebo. This association is warranted by at least moderate certainty using the GRADE approach. The results are robust; the cumulative meta-analysis suggests that estimates are stable, and subgroup analysis based on drugs and disease state showed consistent results. Subgroups for individual drugs (ixekizumab, rilonacept, sarilumab, ustekinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab) or diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, gout, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus) with a limited number of trials suggested that the risk of serious infections may be increased, but results were not statistically significant, likely reflecting the fewer number of events and small sample sizes.

Several smaller studies of IL inhibitors in individual rheumatic diseases have demonstrated an increased risk of infections, which is consistent with our study. There have also been several systematic reviews addressing the efficacy and safety of IL-1 inhibition in rheumatoid arthritis with similar findings. These studies assessed the infection risk of IL-1 inhibition, but we believe our study is unique in assessing infection risk across all IL inhibitors and is more comprehensive. Our findings are also comparable with the safety profile of TNF inhibitors in rheumatic diseases, suggesting an increased risk of serious infections. This finding of an increased number of serious infections is in contrast to a Cochrane database systematic review that compared the adverse effects of biologics (TNF inhibitors, IL-1 antagonist [anakinra], IL-6 antagonist [tocilizumab], anti-CD28 [abatacept], and anti–B cell [rituximab]) in patients with any disease and reported an increased risk of serious infections that was not statistically significant compared with placebo. A later meta-analysis of 106 randomized clinical trials showed that the risk of serious infections was increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biologics compared with nonbiologic, traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, supporting the findings of this analysis.

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^b1b422a2]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fungal infections in MM patients who have undergone HSCT, or who are receiving immunosuppressive immune therapies, may be associated with early mortality. PJP is a rare opportunistic fungal infection that can result in life-threatening pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies such as MM. The mortality rate of PJP in these patients is 30–60%.

Although PJP is rare in patients with MM, use of immunomodulatory therapies can result in patients being at risk of infection, with PJP being diagnosed in patients who would typically be considered lower risk. Early recognition of at-risk patients and the disease is critical for optimal management.

Recommendations for prophylaxis and management of fungal infections

Monitoring

Routine fungal testing with β-glucan or galactomannan tests is not recommended (level IIC). It is recognized that β-glucan tests can often be falsely positive in this patient population, due to patients receiving IVIG treatment. If aspergillosis is suspected, we recommend serum galactomannan testing (level IIC). Cultures, imaging, and diagnostic tests can help identify the fungal infection, if suspected (level III). If imaging is concerning for a patient with sinusitis, it is recommended to consult an ear, nose, and throat specialist to perform a biopsy, confirming fungal infections (level III).

Prophylaxis

With the exception for P. jirovecii (see below), anti-fungal prophylaxis is not recommended, unless a patient has a previous history of fungal infections (level IIC), prolonged neutropenia (level IIC), or has recently received prolonged treatment with high dose corticosteroids (> 2 weeks) (level IIC). If, following consultation with an infectious disease specialist, prophylaxis is needed, fluconazole is recommended (level IIC). Itraconazole and voriconazole may also be considered (level IIC). Monitoring during anti-fungal prophylaxis is not recommended, unless for suspected aspergillosis (level IIC). We recommend maintaining BsAb treatment during anti-fungal prophylaxis, when needed (level III).

Treatment of emergent fungal infections

Patients with invasive fungal infections, such as invasive candidiasis or Aspergillosis should be treated per standard infectious diseases guidelines, preferably in consultation with an infectious diseases provider. We recommend temporarily discontinuing BsAb treatment during anti-fungal treatment, until symptom resolution (level III).

### Monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections in patients with MM receiving bispecific antibody therapy: consensus recommendations from an expert panel [^6e2dfa04]. Blood Cancer Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk factors overview

Noting that all MM patients receiving BsAbs warrant a high degree of vigilance for infection risk and occurrence, the panel categorized risk factors, from the BsAb literature reviewed, by patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Risk factors for infection in patients with MM receiving BsAbs.

BsAb bispecific antibody, CAR-T chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, CMV cytomegalovirus, HBV hepatitis B virus, IMiD immunomodulatory drug, MM multiple myeloma, PI proteasome inhibitors, PS propensity score, VZV varicella zoster virus.

Some of the risk factors warrant consideration for specific prophylactic approaches prior to initiation of BsAb treatment, based on data from other therapeutic classes.

Hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG)

Background

MM patients commonly experience secondary immune deficiencies such as HGG, a disorder defined by low serum IgG levels. HGG increases infection risk with encapsulated bacteria, and is associated with decreased overall survival. It has been observed that treatment with BsAbs can lead to prolonged HGG, which in turn is associated with increased infection risk.

### Identification of sarilumab pharmacodynamic and predictive markers in patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibition: a biomarker substudy of the phase 3 TARGET study [^2c56bd2c]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

The phase 3 TARGET study has previously been described. Patients were randomised to receive sarilumab 200 mg q2w, sarilumab 150 mg q2w or placebo for 24 weeks with background csDMARDs. All patients provided written informed consent before study entry. The study was conducted in compliance with institutional review board regulations, the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample selection and biomarker analysis

Sera samples from 291 patients from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population were analysed (placebo: n = 97; sarilumab 200 mg q2w: n = 97; sarilumab 150 mg q2w: n = 97; biomarker population). Sera were collected at baseline (before first dose) and post-treatment through week 24 in patients treated with placebo or sarilumab (200 mg or 150 mg q2w) and stored frozen until analysis; time points for analysis of individual biomarkers are described in table 1. Patients were included in the biomarker substudy if the following criteria were met: 28-joint disease activity score by CRP (DAS28-CRP) assessment was available at baseline (before first dose) and week 24, serum samples were collected at baseline and week 24 and at least 16 weeks elapsed between randomisation visit and week 24 biomarker sample collection. Patients treated with placebo who were rescued with open-label sarilumab 200 mg q2w at week 12 were excluded from the analysis. Based on these criteria, 97 patients were included from the placebo group, and then equal numbers of patients treated in each sarilumab group were randomly selected in order to balance the sample size across treatment arms.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula — We strongly recommend systemic corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a mortality benefit (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54; 0.82). In critically ill patients, dexamethasone 6mg/day is preferred, but doses up to 20 mg/day can be used if indicated; hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6 hours is an alternative, and methylprednisolone or prednisone are reasonable alternatives at equipotent doses. In addition to corticosteroids, we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab preferred over sarilumab) or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in patients with elevated inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP). Trials have not identified specific sub-populations of critically ill patients already receiving corticosteroids who would benefit with additional IL-6 or JAK inhibitors, and we do not recommend remdesivir since it has not shown a benefit in this sub-population.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^dd0d4be2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of severe COVID-19 — criteria and therapies are specified: Patients with severe COVID-19 are those with pulmonary involvement and hypoxia or needing low flow oxygen, and most existing criteria for trials consider either a SpO2 level less than 94% or 90% or tachypnea (respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute) as severe COVID-19. Corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, are recommended as the cornerstone of therapy in severe COVID-19. Remdesivir may be considered as it has shown to decrease time to recovery or discharge, though it has not been shown to improve mortality. The IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab and JAK inhibitors baricitinib and tofacitinib have shown a benefit in severe, but non-critical COVID-19 when used with corticosteroids, and we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in those with elevated inflammatory markers like CRP and progressive severe COVID-19; since there is greater supportive data for tocilizumab and baricitinib we recommend them preferentially over sarilumab and tofacitinib, though the latter agents are suitable alternatives if the former are not available. We do not recommend using hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir, or convalescent plasma, and we also recommend against the use of ivermectin outside of the context of a clinical trial given the low certainty of evidence for its benefit.

IL-17 inhibitors — HIV and hepatitis B/C considerations: Use caution in patients with pre-existing immunosuppression-related conditions (expert opinion). Patients with a history of or currently active hepatitis C may receive an IL-17 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and concomitant management with an appropriate health care provider is warranted. Patients with a currently active hepatitis B may receive an IL-17 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis; however, patients should first be evaluated by an appropriate health care professional and may require concomitant treatment with an approved antiviral medication directed against hepatitis B, and a hepatitis B core antibody test in this setting is recommended. Patients with a history of hepatitis B (confirmed resolved infection) do not need to follow-up with a specialist but require monitoring because of the risk of reactivation.

Communicating a change in practice

HCPs felt that any changes should be communicated through various channels (direct to clinicians, through specialist societies and/or articles in medical publications and magazines). Furthermore, they felt while a risk-stratified approach would be well received by most clinicians, some would need persuading beyond an update to national guidance (v). Additional detail about the research evidence behind the proposed changes was wanted by some HCP participants before they could say they would fully accept it, including an explanation of the prognostic factors included and excluded from the risk calculator and the weight each factor contributes towards the risk score. Given that they have been emphasizing the importance of three-monthly testing to their patients, HCPs felt that information leaflets and disseminating changes in practice through patient organizations would be necessary to support any verbal explanation they could provide (w).

Tuberculosis

Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving TNF blockers, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating SIMPONI and periodically during therapy.

Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating SIMPONI, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; an induration of 5 mm or greater is a positive tuberculin skin test, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SIMPONI in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.

Cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with SIMPONI during and after treatment for latent tuberculosis. Monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy, patients who are on treatment for latent tuberculosis, or patients who were previously treated for tuberculosis infection.

TNF-α inhibitors — ongoing monitoring and visit frequency include specific assessment for infections (eg, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), screening for skin cancer especially in those taking TNF-α-inhibitors and in high-risk patients, and that yearly testing for latent TB (PPD, T-Spot, or Quantiferon Gold) should be done in patients at high risk, whereas for patients who are not at high risk screening should be done at the discretion of the dermatologist; an annual chest radiograph may be considered at the discretion of the treating dermatologist. CBC with differential and CMP are not supported by evidence and are to be assessed at the discretion of each physicians' criteria except in cases involving patients treated with infliximab, for whom it is recommended that liver function tests be repeated every 3 mo after initiation, and if the result is normal, every 6–12 mo thereafter; a follow-up visit may be scheduled from quarterly to twice yearly depending on time of treatment, response, and tolerability of medication.

### Shared inflammatory pathways and therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 and cancer immunotherapy [^0acc1fd1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Final considerations

COVID-19 is an inflammatory disease caused by a viral infection. The ultimate strategy to stop the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a vaccine campaign covering the majority of the population worldwide. A variety of vaccines have been recently approved in different countries and are increasing in availability to high-risk and low-risk individuals. Until then, social distancing measures will remain the most efficient way to limit the spread of the disease and protect the most sensitive individuals. Immunotherapeutic approaches to modulate the immune system may help to treat patients with COVID-19 by mitigating viral replication and stemming the cascade of inflammatory events induced by SARS-CoV-2.

To date, a few immunomodulating therapies have been successful in the treatment of COVID-19. Corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the mortality in patients with COVID-19 with ARDS, and the FDA approved the use of the REGN-COV2 mAb cocktail for patients with recent infection, mild symptoms, and high risk of progression. Baricitinib, an anti-JAK agent, is now recommended in association with remdesivir for hospitalized patients. Tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone has recently received recommendation for some group of patients with rapidly evolving respiratory disease. Other anti-IL-6 agents, such as sarilumab, have shown promising preliminary results, as well as ruxolitinib and other anti-inflammatory mAbs such as anakinra. Cell therapy and other inhibitors, such as defibrotide and eculizumab, have potential for benefit and are being tested in many ongoing clinical trials. Stratification of patients based on values of the cytokines that appear more involved in the underlying COVID-19 inflammatory process might expand our knowledge on the before-mentioned drugs in specific subgroups. The rapid development of several anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and the volume of clinical trials testing anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 based on what we have learned from immunotherapy, highlight the capability of modern medicine to produce high-quality evidence and offer effective strategies in the middle of a pandemic.

### The changing spectrum of infection with BCMA and GPRC5D targeting bispecific antibody (bsAb) therapy in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma [^564d4352]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, the current report is a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in early phase trials and treated at varying doses and frequencies of bsAb. Second, infection prophylaxis and monitoring strategies were not standardized at our institutions during the time-period of patient enrollment in these trials, with practice varying according to the treating physician. Third, our follow-up was short. It is unclear whether the risk of infection continues to increase or there is a plateau in incidence after a certain time point. Taken together, infection-related morbidity and mortality is a clinically significant adverse effect of bsAb in MM.

Given the available data, practical recommendations for monitoring and prophylaxis of infections have been published. While waiting for robust data generated by clinical trials, it is now highly recommended to maintain a high level of vigilance by implementing routine antibacterial prophylaxis during the first month of therapy. Additionally, for all patients undergoing bsAb therapy, primary IVIG and PCP prophylaxis are recommended.

In conclusion, infection-related morbidity and mortality is a clinically significant adverse effect of bsAb in multiple myeloma. Research on strategies to mitigate infection risk, including prophylaxis, fixed-duration treatment, and treatment-free intervals are urgently needed. Our study corroborates previous reports showing a high risk of infection with BCMA-targeting bsAb therapy. We further show that GPRC5D bsAb therapy has a significantly lower risk of infections compared to BCMA therapy. Combination GPRC5D bsAb therapy raises the overall infection rates to comparable levels of BCMA therapy, albeit the severity of infections (grade ≥ 3) appears still higher in BCMA bsAb- treated patients.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab for COVID-19 [^9aaf93bd]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is accumulating evidence for an overly activated immune response in severe COVID-19, with several studies exploring the therapeutic role of immunomodulation. Through systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess the effectiveness of specific interleukin inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched on 7 January 2021 to identify studies of immunomodulatory agents (anakinra, sarilumab, siltuximab and tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were severity on an Ordinal Scale measured at day 15 from intervention and days to hospital discharge. Key secondary endpoints included overall mortality.

Results

71 studies totalling 22 058 patients were included, 6 were randomised trials. Most studies explored outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab (60/71). In prospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with improved unadjusted survival (risk ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, I² = 0.0%), but conclusive benefit was not demonstrated for other outcomes. In retrospective studies, tocilizumab was associated with less severe outcomes on an Ordinal Scale (generalised OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.64, I² = 98%) and adjusted mortality risk (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.66, I² = 76.6%). The mean difference in duration of hospitalisation was 0.36 days (95% CI -0.07 to 0.80, I² = 93.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity in retrospective studies, and estimates should be interpreted cautiously. Other immunomodulatory agents showed similar effects to tocilizumab, but insufficient data precluded meta-analysis by agent.

Conclusion

Tocilizumab was associated with a lower relative risk of mortality in prospective studies, but effects were inconclusive for other outcomes. Current evidence for the efficacy of anakinra, siltuximab or sarilumab in COVID-19 is insufficient, with further studies urgently needed for conclusive findings.

Rare cases of increased liver transaminase levels have occurred with use of IL-23 inhibitors, and IL-23 inhibitors have demonstrated no unique adverse events of interest.

### Clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab: an individual patient data systematic review [^afbd8d0c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Current evidence suggests an important role of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related cytokine release storm in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Inhibition of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab has been employed successfully in some of these patients but the data is mostly consistent of case reports and series.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 22nd April 2020 and again on 27th April 2020 using the following search terms alone or in combination: "COVID-19", "coronavirus", "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID", "anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibodies", "anti-IL-6", "tocilizumab", "sarilumab", "siltuximab". We included studies that reported individual patient data. We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital complications, recovery rates, effect of patient characteristics on the primary outcome and changes in levels of inflammatory markers.

Results

Three hundred fifty-two records were identified through a systematic search, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. A single study currently under review was also added. Eleven observational studies encompassing 29 patients were included in the present review. There were more males (24 [82.8%]), and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (16 [48.3%]). Over an average of 5.4 hospital days, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients. Among surviving patients, about 10% had worsened disease and 17% recovered. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (8 [27.6%]). The IL-6 level was significantly higher after the initiation of tocilizumab with median (interquartile range) of 376.6 (148–900.6)pg/mL compared to the baseline of 71.1 (31.9–122.8)pg/mL (P = 0.002). Mean (standard deviation) levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9)mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77)mg/L (P < .0001). Baseline demographics were not significantly different among survivors and nonsurvivors by Fisher's exact test.

Conclusion

In COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated, which are supportive of cytokine storm. Following initiation of tocilizumab, there is elevation in the IL-6 levels and CRP levels dramatically decrease, suggesting an improvement in this hyperinflammatory state. Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy.

Importance

Recent data indicate that severe COVID-19 causes a cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role. It is suggestive that anti-IL-6 results in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. However, to our knowledge, there is no individual patient data systematic review performed to summarize baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab.

### Systemic rheumatic diseases: from biological agents to small molecules [^bc1aec93]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The development of biologics and small oral molecules has recently changed the scenario of pharmacologic treatment of systemic rheumatic diseases and it has become a real revolution. These drugs have innovative mechanisms of action, based on the inhibition of specific molecular or cellular targets directly involved in disease pathogenesis. This new scenario has lead to a regular update of the management recommendations of several institutions, such as those for Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment that address the use of conventional and biologic therapies including TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab), abatacept, rituximab, IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab), biosimilars and small oral molecules (the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib). Monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (such as treat-to-target) and the targets of sustained clinical remission or low disease activity are the final goal of the guidelines for rheumatic patients management. In another condition represented by Axial Spondyloarthritis guidelines suggest to start first with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to improve lifestyle and reduce spine inflammation, but if this is not achieved in 2–4 weeks it is important to consider the use of local therapies (i.e.g.lucocorticoid injections) or to start biologic therapy such as TNF inhibitors and then eventually switching to another TNF inhibitor or swapping to IL-17 inhibitor. In the case of active Psoriatic Arthritis, guidelines suggest to start with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even local glucocorticoid injections especially for oligoarthritis, then to start conventional therapies if lack of efficacy, and finally start biologics or small oral molecules in the presence of drugs toxicity, unfavorable prognostic factors and still active arthritis. In several cases, active Psoriatic Arthritis patients develop a complex clinical condition with comorbidities such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and high risk of infections, and for this reason the American College of Rheumatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation have developed specific guidelines for their management. Biologic and new small molecules therapies are very expensive, but the availability of biosimilars offers the opportunity of reducing the treatment cost and significantly decreasing the cost of originators as well. In fact, we live in a period characterized by the need to rationalize costs of these drugs, to allow treating a higher number of patients and to maintain a homogeneous possibility of treatment choice. For these reasons, we need to follow scientific guidelines and patients' clinical conditions to choose the correct treatment, also based on the economic burden of therapies.

Biomarkers of response to treatment

Hematological and inflammatory parameters were monitored for 15 days after sarilumab administration. Consistent with published observations, all patients presented with elevated IL-6, CRP and d-dimer combined with high NLR and thrombocytopenia, signatures that have been described as indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation and/or cytokine storm. At baseline, elevated NLR was observed in all patients (median 14.6, range 1.8–25.1), with values ≥ 10 measured in 10 patients (66.6%). All patients for whom measurements were available displayed elevated levels of CRP (median 15 mg/dL, range 1.1–30.5) as well as IL-6 (median 61.9 pg/mL, range 5.2–1000 pg/mL). Pronounced thrombocytopenia was present at baseline in 14 (93.3%) patients, and the median platelet count was 306×10 9 /μL (range 127–535). In patients who died, platelet counts decreased dramatically in 2 days after sarilumab treatment, whereas levels remained relatively constant throughout the course of the study for patients who experienced clinical improvement. Among the 11 patients for whom d-dimer measurements were available before treatment, levels were greater than two times the upper normal limit in eight patients (53.3%). The median d-dimer value for the entire cohort was 1151 ng/mL (range 200–4250).

Cardiovascular Involvement

There is no change to the 2020 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) "pediatric septic shock guidance" recommended in children with COVID-19. Of note, hypovolemia is common following the vomiting and diarrheal prodrome with reduced fluid intake before ICU admission.

Specific MIS treatment (Fig. 1) should follow a multidisciplinary approach involving infectious diseases specialists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, and intensivists. In Kawasaki-like or TSS presentations (e.g. hyperinflammatory shock) especially when myocardial dysfunction is documented, successful use of IV immunoglobulin administered early as per KD guidelines has been reported and can be recommended, acknowledging this is not based on data for the TSS-like presentation. Besides IVIG, steroids are the most frequently used anti-inflammatory drug. In the event of resistance to IVIG and persistent high inflammatory markers, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (Tocilizumab, Sarilumab), IL-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra), or tumor necrosis factor-α antagonist (Infliximab) has been used on an empirical basis. However, according to NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines (July 17, 2020), there are insufficient data yet to recommend for or against the use of either IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors.

In cardiovascular compromise/hemodynamic instability, repeated multimodal hemodynamic monitoring, including point of care ultrasound, can optimize therapy. With documented myocardial and/or coronary involvement, serial and follow-up echocardiography by a pediatric cardiologist is important and might allow for an eventual better understanding of this novel disease for which the Initial early prognosis seems good.

5.1 Serious Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections (including COVID‑19) have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including SAPHNELO. Overall, the incidence of serious infections in controlled trials was similar in patients receiving SAPHNELO compared with placebo, whereas fatal infections occurred more frequently in patients receiving SAPHNELO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In controlled trials, SAPHNELO increased the risk of respiratory infections and herpes zoster (disseminated herpes zoster events have been reported) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Consider the benefit and risk of administering SAPHNELO in patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infections, or known risk factors for infection. Avoid initiating treatment with SAPHNELO in patients with any clinically significant active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically significant infection occur. If a patient develops an infection, or is not responding to standard anti-infective therapy, monitor the patient closely and consider interrupting SAPHNELO therapy until the infection resolves.

5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported following SAPHNELO administration [see Contraindication (4)]. Events of angioedema have also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Other hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related reactions have occurred following administration of SAPHNELO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider pre-medication before infusion of SAPHNELO for patients with a history of these reactions.

SAPHNELO should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and infusion-related reactions. If a serious infusion-related or hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) occurs, immediately interrupt the administration of SAPHNELO and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.3 Malignancy

There is an increased risk of malignancies with the use of immunosuppressants. The impact of SAPHNELO treatment on the potential development of malignancies is not known.

Consider the individual benefit-risk in patients with known risk factors for the development or reoccurrence of malignancy prior to prescribing SAPHNELO. In patients who develop malignancies, consider the benefit-risk of continued treatment with SAPHNELO.

5.4 Immunizations

Update immunizations, according to current immunization guidelines, prior to initiating SAPHNELO therapy. Avoid concurrent use of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients treated with SAPHNELO.

### IL-6 inhibition in the treatment of COVID-19: a meta-analysis and meta-regression [^c72ca44b]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Multiple RCTs of interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors in COVID-19 have been published, with conflicting conclusions. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results.

Methods

Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification.

Results

Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I 2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence.

Conclusions

IL-6 inhibition is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19. Long-term benefits of IL-6 inhibition, its effectiveness across healthcare systems, and implications for differing standards of care are currently unknown.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Interactions between ILARIS and other medicinal products have not been investigated in formal studies.

7.1

	TNF-Blocker and IL-1 Blocking Agent

An increased incidence of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia have been associated with administration of another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors in another patient population. Use of ILARIS with TNF inhibitors may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The concomitant administration of ILARIS with other drugs that block IL-1 has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacological interactions between ILARIS and a recombinant IL-1ra, concomitant administration of ILARIS and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended.

7.2

	Immunization

No data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ILARIS. Therefore, avoid administration of live vaccines concurrently with ILARIS. It is recommended that, if possible, pediatric and adult patients complete all immunizations in accordance with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating ILARIS therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 4)].

7.3

	Cytochrome P450 Substrates

The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g. IL-1) during chronic inflammation. Thus, it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as canakinumab, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of canakinumab, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration should be performed, and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted as needed.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^a4e688bb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Vedolizumab (α4β7 integrin antagonist) for colitis refractory to infliximab or infliximab contraindicated is dosed 300 mg IV on weeks 0, 2, 6, and then once every 8 weeks thereafter. Vedolizumab is contraindicated in patients who have had a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to vedolizumab or any of its excipients. Warnings include hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and infections — treatment with vedolizumab is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled; although no cases of PML have been observed in clinical trials, JCV infection resulting in PML and death has occurred in patients treated with another integrin receptor antagonist, a risk of PML cannot be ruled out, and monitor patients for any new or worsening neurologic signs or symptoms.
