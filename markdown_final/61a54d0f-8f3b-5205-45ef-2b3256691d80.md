## Question

mitral regurgitation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mitral regurgitation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify mitral regurgitation by etiology and mechanism. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially echocardiographic quantification and when to use adjunct imaging. Next, I will review management principles for primary versus secondary MR, including medical therapy, surgical indications, and transcatheter options. After that, I need to check special scenarios like acute MR, mixed-valve disease, and atrial functional MR. Finally, I will consider prognosis, follow-up, and quality metrics, and I will double-check areas of controversy and evidence gaps before concluding with a practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Primary MR reflects intrinsic leaflet or chordal pathology such as degenerative disease, prolapse, or rheumatic changes, whereas secondary MR arises from LV remodeling and dysfunction with tethering and annular dilatation; mixed MR combines both, and this distinction drives different natural histories and treatment strategies, so I need to ensure I anchor on this before proceeding.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic foundation before talking treatment. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to define mechanism and severity, but I should confirm severity with quantitative indices such as effective regurgitant orifice area, regurgitant volume, and regurgitant fraction, and I must integrate multiple parameters because no single measure suffices; if severity remains indeterminate, transesophageal echocardiography or cardiac MRI can resolve uncertainty and guide therapy selection, so I should not jump to conclusions based on a single view or color jet size alone [^111CPH8U] [^1112y4Lw] [^114eMYat].

> Hold on, let's not conflate primary and secondary MR when setting thresholds. For primary MR, severe disease is typically EROA ≥ 0.40 cm², regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL, and regurgitant fraction ≥ 50%, and I should remember that symptoms or LV dysfunction can appear late, so surveillance is essential; for secondary MR, thresholds may be lower in low-flow states and the hemodynamic context matters, so I need to check for proportionate versus disproportionate MR and avoid overcalling severity in dilated ventricles [^1157cXYn] [^113Y2Txx].

> I will now examine primary MR management, and I should confirm that repair is preferred when feasible. In symptomatic patients with severe primary MR, mitral valve repair is recommended over replacement if a durable repair is expected, ideally before LV dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension emerge; in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and normal LV function, early surgery can be considered if the likelihood of successful repair exceeds 95% and operative mortality is under 1% at a high-volume center, and I should double-check that this strategy is supported by observational data showing improved long-term survival with early surgery [^115PoAz3] [^113WMhFG] [^114TaMdL].

> But wait, what if the patient is high surgical risk or anatomy is unfavorable for repair. In that case, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is reasonable for severely symptomatic primary MR when surgery is high or prohibitive risk and anatomy is suitable, and I should confirm that guidelines endorse this approach while emphasizing careful selection and heart team consensus [^116zwLDD] [^112PKP4W].

> Next, I should review secondary MR, and I need to ensure I do not overpromise on survival. The cornerstone is guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, including ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sacubitril/valsartan, with CRT when indicated; importantly, surgery may improve symptoms but has not consistently improved survival, so I should avoid implying mortality benefit where it is unproven [^114KamYf] [^117CwZ3z].

> Let me consider transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in secondary MR carefully, because the evidence is heterogeneous. COAPT showed reduced heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in selected patients with persistent symptoms despite optimized therapy, whereas MITRA-FR did not show benefit; reconciling this, a proportionality framework suggests patients with disproportionate MR relative to LV size may benefit more, but I should confirm that this remains debated and that patient selection and timing are critical, with heart team evaluation after 3 to 6 months of optimized therapy [^112PidoX] [^116RFxzi] [^111Pa5qC].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm for secondary MR. Start GDMT and titrate aggressively over 6 to 12 weeks, address AF rhythm control and consider CRT if indicated, reassess symptoms and MR severity after optimization, and if symptoms persist with moderate-to-severe or severe secondary MR, refer to the heart team for consideration of TEER or surgery; this staged approach aligns with contemporary guidance and helps avoid premature or inappropriate intervention [^111Pa5qC] [^114DdCqF].

> Now, I need to ensure I cover acute severe MR, because this is a different beast. Acute severe primary MR from papillary muscle rupture or infective endocarditis is poorly tolerated hemodynamically and often requires urgent surgery, preferably repair if feasible; I should confirm that guidelines prioritize prompt surgical correction in this setting given the risk of cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure [^114DrLvN].

> Let me think about mixed-valve scenarios, and I should verify the sequencing. In patients with severe aortic stenosis and severe MR, a staged approach with TAVI followed by mitral TEER can be effective when surgical risk is high, whereas combined surgery may be reasonable at low-to-intermediate risk centers; I need to counsel that secondary MR may not improve after aortic valve replacement, so expectations must be managed [^116HVpnR].

> I should confirm the role of atrial functional MR and AF. When atrial enlargement and AF drive MR with preserved LV function, rhythm control strategies and AF ablation can reduce MR severity in select cases, but I must individualize decisions and coordinate with electrophysiology within the heart team, recognizing that data are evolving and patient selection is key [^114oW7mV].

> Next, I should review prognosis and follow-up, and I need to check that I am not overstating benignity in moderate MR. Untreated severe MR carries high mortality, and even moderate MR is associated with increased mortality, underscoring the need for proactive surveillance; after successful repair, durability exceeds 80% freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR at 15 to 20 years in high-volume centers, but lifelong echocardiographic follow-up remains essential to detect late failure or complications [^116Dih8i] [^113YJB9F].

> Hold on, I should verify quality metrics and system issues, because outcomes hinge on them. Repair rates above 80 to 90% and operative mortality below 1% are achievable in experienced centers, yet many eligible patients are not referred; standardized echocardiographic reporting, heart team review, and center-of-excellence pathways are critical to close these gaps and improve access to durable therapies [^113YJB9F] [^111ZQjRe] [^1164vTjb].

> Let me reconsider areas of controversy so I do not overgeneralize. The timing of intervention in asymptomatic severe primary MR remains debated, with observational data supporting early repair but randomized evidence limited; similarly, the proportionality concept in secondary MR is promising yet unsettled, and ongoing trials may refine selection; finally, durability of transcatheter repairs beyond 5 years is less certain than surgical repair, so I should communicate this uncertainty during shared decision-making [^114TaMdL] [^116RFxzi] [^1165sP8b].

> To synthesize, I should confirm a practical algorithm: classify MR as primary versus secondary with echocardiography and quantify severity using multiple parameters; for primary MR, favor early repair at experienced centers when feasible and consider TEER for high surgical risk; for secondary MR, optimize GDMT and CRT, reassess at 3 to 6 months, and refer for TEER or surgery if symptoms persist with significant MR; throughout, use a multidisciplinary heart team, prioritize durable repair strategies, and embed longitudinal surveillance to catch late failures early [^111RLNSq] [^111Pa5qC] [^1164vTjb].

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the **backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium** due to incomplete mitral valve closure, causing volume overload and progressive heart failure. It is classified as **primary (degenerative)** — due to leaflet or chordal pathology — or **secondary (functional)** — due to LV remodeling and annular dilation. Severe MR is associated with high mortality and morbidity if untreated [^116Dih8i], so **accurate echocardiographic assessment** of mechanism and severity is essential to guide therapy [^111CPH8U]. Management is individualized: primary MR is treated with **early surgical repair** when feasible [^115PoAz3], while secondary MR is managed with guideline-directed medical therapy and CRT, reserving transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip) for selected symptomatic patients despite optimal therapy [^114KamYf] [^112PKP4W]. A **heart team approach** ensures optimal outcomes [^1164vTjb].

---

## Pathophysiology and classification

MR is classified as **primary or secondary** based on etiology:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary MR | Intrinsic valve pathology | - Degenerative mitral valve disease <br/> - Mitral valve prolapse <br/> - Rheumatic heart disease <br/> - Infective endocarditis [^notfound] |
| Secondary MR | LV remodeling and annular dilation | - Ischemic cardiomyopathy <br/> - Dilated cardiomyopathy <br/> - Atrial fibrillation with annular dilation [^114wf12d] |

---

Primary MR imposes a **pure volume overload** on the left ventricle, leading to eccentric hypertrophy and progressive LV dysfunction [^113Y2Txx]. Secondary MR reflects LV disease with tethering and malcoaptation of a structurally normal valve, worsening heart failure symptoms and prognosis [^114wf12d].

---

## Clinical presentation

MR presents with symptoms of heart failure — dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and fatigue — and palpitations from atrial fibrillation. Acute severe MR may cause **acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock** [^114DrLvN].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Echocardiography is the **cornerstone** for diagnosing and quantifying MR [^111CPH8U]. Key parameters include:

- **EROA**: Effective regurgitant orifice area
- **Regurgitant volume**: Volume of backflow
- **Regurgitant fraction**: Percentage of stroke volume that regurgitates
- **Vena contracta**: Width of the regurgitant jet

Severity is graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on these parameters [^114eMYat]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is used when transthoracic images are inadequate or to define anatomy for intervention [^111CPH8U]. Cardiac MRI is useful when echocardiography is inconclusive or to quantify regurgitation and assess myocardial viability [^111CPH8U].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on MR type, severity, symptoms, and LV function, and **requires a multidisciplinary heart team** [^1164vTjb].

---

### Primary MR

- **Surgical repair**: Preferred over replacement due to better preservation of LV function and lower mortality [^115PoAz3] [^112vmXFo].
- **Indications**: Symptomatic severe MR, or asymptomatic severe MR with LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 mm) [^114YsDte] [^113e9KxH].
- **Transcatheter repair**: MitraClip for high surgical risk patients with suitable anatomy [^116zwLDD] [^112PKP4W].

---

### Secondary MR

- **Medical therapy**: Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure, CRT when indicated, and treatment of underlying causes (e.g. ischemia, atrial fibrillation) [^114KamYf] [^112conto].
- **Transcatheter repair**: MitraClip for persistent symptomatic severe MR despite optimal medical therapy and CRT [^112PKP4W] [^112PidoX].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for selected patients after careful heart team evaluation, as benefits are uncertain [^114oxhQt] [^117CwZ3z].

---

## Prognosis

Untreated severe MR carries a **poor prognosis**, with high mortality and heart failure hospitalizations [^116Dih8i]. Early intervention, particularly surgical repair in primary MR, significantly improves outcomes and survival [^114TaMdL] [^112vmXFo].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR)**: Under investigation for high-risk patients with unsuitable anatomy for repair [^117VcqRn].
- **Improved patient selection**: Use of proportionality concepts and advanced imaging to identify patients likely to benefit from intervention [^116RFxzi] [^114Yzdse].
- **Durability and long-term outcomes**: Ongoing studies to assess the longevity of transcatheter repairs and their impact on survival [^1165sP8b].

Mitral regurgitation is a complex valvular disorder requiring **precise diagnosis and individualized management**. Early, accurate assessment and a heart team approach are essential to optimize outcomes and quality of life.

### A pathoanatomic approach to the management of mitral regurgitation [^116aFRBd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation remains the most common global valvular heart disease. From otherwise unsuspecting healthy patients without overt symptoms to those with recalcitrant heart failure, mitral valve (MV) disease touches millions of patients per year. While MV prolapse without regurgitation remains benign, once regurgitation begins, quantification of severity is related to prognosis. Understanding the mechanism of regurgitation guides appropriate treatment. Current management guidelines emphasize early therapy after careful assessment of both anatomy and severity of mitral regurgitation. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the treatment of MV disease and to offer additional granularity on pathoanatomic decision making that may aid a more precise application of optimal guideline-directed therapy of primary and secondary mitral regurgitation.

### Treatment and management of mitral regurgitation [^1128hpHU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most-common valvular heart disease in the western world. From an etiologic point of view, MR can be either organic (mainly degenerative in western countries) or functional (secondary to left ventricular remodeling in the context of ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy). Degenerative and functional MR are completely different disease entities that pose specific decision-making problems and require different management. The natural history of severe degenerative MR is clearly unfavorable. However, the appropriate and timely correction of degenerative MR is associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. By contrast, the prognostic impact of the correction of functional MR is still a matter of debate. In this Review, we discuss the optimal treatment of both degenerative and functional MR, taking into account all presently available therapeutic options, including novel percutaneous methods. Since a clear understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of valvular dysfunction is important to guide the timing and choice of treatment, the role of echocardiography in the management of MR is also addressed.

### Transcatheter therapy for mitral regurgitation clinical challenges and potential solutions [^117VcqRn]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Severe mitral regurgitation is a common and complex disease that is associated with an adverse prognosis. For decades, surgical treatment has been the standard of care. Recently, multiple technologies for transcatheter mitral therapy have emerged, with the potential for both repair and replacement in patients with native mitral regurgitation. Transcatheter mitral technologies have potential as solutions for unmet clinical needs. Further rigorous clinical studies are needed to determine their efficacy and safety, as well as the appropriate patient candidates. These evaluations will help to define the role of transcatheter mitral therapy as a potentially exciting new strategy to improve the lives of patients with mitral regurgitation.

### Mitral valve regurgitation in the contemporary era: insights into diagnosis, management, and future directions [^111xpVva]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular heart disease. Primary MR is a disease of the mitral valve apparatus, whereas secondary MR is a disease of the left ventricle. Diagnosing and managing MR is often challenging and requires a structured approach, integrating findings on history, physical examination, and imaging. Decisions regarding treatment depend on knowledge of the etiology, natural history, and outcome of interventions for these patients with mitral valve disease. The optimal timing of intervention requires a comprehensive 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiogram in each patient to determine the cause of the mitral valve disease, the severity of the regurgitation, and the effect of the volume overload on the left ventricle, as well as determining if a durable valve repair can be performed. Advances in both surgical and catheter-based therapies have resulted in recommendations for lower thresholds for operation and extension of interventional treatments to the older, sicker population of patients with MR. The current review discusses the pathophysiological rationale for current diagnostic and management strategies in MR.

### Degenerative mitral regurgitation [^1165sP8b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Degenerative mitral regurgitation is a major threat to public health and affects at least 24 million people worldwide, with an estimated 0.88 million disability-adjusted life years and 34,000 deaths in 2019. Improving access to diagnostic testing and to timely curative therapies such as surgical mitral valve repair will improve the outcomes of many individuals. Imaging such as echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance allow accurate diagnosis and have provided new insights for a better definition of the most appropriate timing for intervention. Advances in surgical techniques allow minimally invasive treatment with durable results that last for ≥ 20 years. Transcatheter therapies can provide good results in select patients who are considered high risk for surgery and have a suitable anatomy; the durability of such repairs is up to 5 years. Translational science has provided new knowledge on the pathophysiology of degenerative mitral regurgitation and may pave the road to the development of medical therapies that could be used to halt the progression of the disease.

### Mitral valve surgery in advanced heart failure [^115Fvjwv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The appropriateness and timing of mitral valve surgery in patients with advanced heart failure and severe mitral regurgitation remains controversial. Recent surgical results provide evidence for beneficial effects on left ventricular remodeling and functional capacity. Given the absence of randomized trials comparing the outcomes of mitral valve surgery to medical therapy, however, clinical decision making regarding surgery for these fragile patients poses a dilemma to thoughtful clinicians. This paper reviews the pathophysiology of mitral regurgitation in heart failure and proposes an integrated approach to management.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^115cnDsU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Significant mitral regurgitation (MR) is an increasingly common disorder affecting nearly 10% of the US population aged > 75 years and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the setting of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure symptoms. Mitral valve repair or replacement improves morbidity and mortality in appropriate clinical contexts, but determination of optimal timing of these therapies can be clinically challenging. Consequently, nearly 50% of patients meeting an indication for mitral valve surgery are not referred. Premature exposure to operative risk and limitations in durability are factors that may delay surgery. Conversely, high predicted operative mortality and severe frailty limit other patients from referral to surgery altogether. The recent development of less invasive transcatheter repair provides an additional therapeutic option for some nonoperative patients. Detailed patient and valvular pathology assessments are essential for appropriate utilization of medical, surgical, and transcatheter therapies. Given this complexity, current guidelines recommend that patients being considered for surgical or transcatheter therapies undergo consultation with a multidisciplinary heart team within a heart valve center of excellence. In the current review, we summarize the pertinent aspects of patient and valvular assessments used to guide the optimal timing and type of intervention for severe chronic MR.

MR is the most prevalent heart valve disease in the United States. Moderate or severe MR is found in 0% to 1.0% of people aged 18 to 64 years, 6.4% of people aged 65 to 75 years, and a striking 9.3% of people aged ≥ 75 years. 1 The volume overload of chronic MR results in progressive cardiac remodeling and cyclical worsening of MR severity, which ultimately leads to heart failure and increased mortality. Beyond determining and tracking MR severity, management is dependent on differentiation between primary and secondary mechanisms of regurgitation. Primary (or degenerative) MR results from lesions of ≥ 1 element of the mitral valve apparatus, including the leaflets, chordae tendinae, annulus, and papillary muscles. Secondary (or functional) MR is characterized by a structurally normal valve apparatus and instead develops from abnormal LV function and geometry, such as in ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. In primary MR, therapies are generally focused on mechanically correcting the valvular dysfunction. Alternatively, secondary MR management is initially focused on the root problem of LV dysfunction. If significant secondary MR persists after optimized medical therapy for heart failure, revascularization, and resynchronization therapy, then mitral valve repair or replacement of the valve is considered. 2

### Mitral valve repair in degenerative mitral regurgitation: state of the art [^117Gxgj7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In industrialized countries, the most common etiology of mitral regurgitation (MR) is degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease. The natural history of severe degenerative MR is poor. However, its appropriate and timely correction is associated with a life expectancy similar to that of the normal population. Surgical MV repair is the gold standard treatment. This review will focus on the most recent evidence with a specific emphasis on surgical indications, timing of treatment, contemporary surgical techniques, Heart Teams and Centers of Excellence.

### The current therapy for mitral regurgitation [^1111uACY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

In addressing the current therapy for mitral regurgitation (MR), it is useful to distinguish primary MR from secondary (functional) MR. In primary MR, abnormalities of one or more of the components of the mitral valve cause it to leak, imparting a volume overload on the left ventricle (LV). Severe prolonged primary MR leads to LV remodeling, myocardial dysfunction, heart failure, and death. Correction of MR, preferably by valve repair rather than replacement, is curative. Severe MR by itself is considered an indication for repair in many centers, and mitral surgery (repair or replacement) should take place when even mild symptoms appear or when ejection fraction approaches 0.60 or end systolic dimension approaches 40 mm. In secondary MR, myocardial damage from infarction or cardiomyopathy produces papillary muscle displacement and annular dilatation, causing a normal valve to leak. Because the MR in this case is not the primary problem, the indications for mitral valve intervention are less certain and considerably more data are needed to aid us in selecting the most appropriate patients for surgical therapy. Percutaneous therapies for both primary and secondary MR have generated much interest, and many different percutaneous technologies are being developed. Future data from randomized trials will help clarify when and in whom these therapies are applicable.

### The choice of treatment in ischemic mitral regurgitation with reduced left ventricular function [^115zEnBH]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ischemic mitral regurgitation is a condition characterized by mitral insufficiency secondary to an ischemic left ventricle. Primarily, the pathology is the result of perturbation of normal regional left ventricular geometry combined with adverse remodeling. We present a comprehensive review of contemporary surgical, medical, and percutaneous treatment options for ischemic mitral regurgitation, rigorously examined by current guidelines and literature.

Methods

We conducted a literature search of the PubMed database, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (through November 2018) for studies reporting perioperative or late mortality and echocardiographic outcomes after surgical and nonsurgical intervention for ischemic mitral regurgitation.

Results

Treatment of this condition is challenging and often requires a multimodality approach. These patients usually have multiple comorbidities that may preclude surgery as a viable option. A multidisciplinary team discussion is crucial in optimizing outcomes. There are several options for treatment and management of ischemic mitral regurgitation with differing benefits and risks. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure is the treatment choice for moderate and severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, with consideration of coronary revascularization, mitral valve surgery, cardiac resynchronization therapy, or a combination of these, in appropriate candidates. The use of transcatheter mitral valve therapy is considered appropriate in high-risk patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, heart failure, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, especially in those with hemodynamic instability.

Conclusions

The role of mitral valve surgery and transcatheter mitral valve therapy continues to evolve.

### Mitral valve regurgitation: a disease with a wide spectrum of therapeutic options [^11485b84]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Over the past two decades interest in mitral valve regurgitation has increased as a result of the development of new technologies that have expanded the number of patients who can potentially benefit from mitral regurgitation treatments. To develop new devices for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, the focus has been placed on the functional anatomy and pathophysiology of the mitral valve, with the use of the most advanced methods of cardiac imaging that allow the best visualization of the mitral valve and a perfect understanding of the complexity of a specific disease. Mitral regurgitation is still underdiagnosed and undertreated in a substantial number of patients who have poor survival. Therefore, the priority should be to identify and treat these patients to increase their survival and quality of life. To achieve this goal, general physicians and cardiologists must be aware of all the treatment options that are currently available in dedicated centres of excellence. Patients referred to these centres can benefit from a tailored heart team-based approach. The aim of this Review is to analyse the basic principles of mitral regurgitation, discussing new concepts on the pathophysiology of the mitral valve that have been developed to facilitate the selection of patients for transcatheter procedures. We also describe the indications and timing of treatment, contemporary surgical and transcatheter techniques and the heart team approach, and highlight the need for centres of excellence.

### Degenerative mitral valve regurgitation: best practice revolution [^113JmPGe]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Degenerative mitral valve disease often leads to leaflet prolapse due to chordal elongation or rupture, and resulting in mitral valve regurgitation. Guideline referral for surgical intervention centres primarily on symptoms and ventricular dysfunction. The recommended treatment for degenerative mitral valve disease is mitral valve reconstruction, as opposed to valve replacement with a bioprosthetic or mechanical valve, because valve repair is associated with improved event free survival. Recent studies have documented a significant number of patients are not referred in a timely fashion according to established guidelines, and when they are subjected to surgery, an alarming number of patients continue to undergo mitral valve replacement. The debate around appropriate timing of intervention for asymptomatic severe mitral valve regurgitation has put additional emphasis on targeted surgeon referral and the need to ensure a very high rate of mitral valve repair, particularly in the non-elderly population. Current clinical practice remains suboptimal for many patients, and this review explores the need for a 'best practice revolution' in the field of degenerative mitral valve regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) definitions and diagnostic foundation — evaluation and management algorithms in this document flow from an echocardiographically validated diagnosis of MR, and primary, secondary, and mixed MR are delineated by mechanism. Primary MR is defined by principal involvement of the leaflets and/or chordae tendineae in the pathological process, secondary MR is characterized by incompetence due to adverse changes in LV size, shape, or function with or without annular dilatation, and mixed MR is due to both primary and secondary causes. It is now recognized that primary and secondary MR are different diseases with different outcomes and indications for treatment, and the writing committee emphasized the need for additional testing when severity could not be established with certainty.

### Practice gaps in the care of mitral valve regurgitation: insights from the American college of cardiology mitral regurgitation gap analysis and advisory panel [^111ZQjRe]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The revised 2014 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association valvular heart disease guidelines provide evidenced-based recommendations for the management of mitral regurgitation (MR). However, knowledge gaps related to our evolving understanding of critical MR concepts may impede their implementation.

Methods

The ACC conducted a multifaceted needs assessment to characterize gaps, practice patterns, and perceptions related to the diagnosis and treatment of MR. A key project element was a set of surveys distributed to primary care and cardiovascular physicians (cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons). Survey and other gap analysis findings were presented to a panel of 10 expert advisors from specialties of general cardiology, cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgeons with expertise in valvular heart disease, especially MR, and cardiovascular education. The panel was charged with assessing the relative importance and potential means of remedying identified gaps to improve care for patients with MR.

Results

The survey results identified several knowledge and practice gaps that may limit implementation of evidence-based recommendations for MR care. Specifically, half of primary care physicians reported uncertainty regarding timing of intervention for patients with severe primary or functional MR. Physicians in all groups reported that quantitative indices of MR severity were frequently not reported in clinical echocardiographic interpretations, and that these measurements were not consistently reviewed when provided in reports. In the treatment of MR, nearly 30% of primary care physician and general cardiologists did not know the volume of mitral valve repair surgeries by their reference cardiac surgeons and did not have a standard source to obtain this information. After review of the survey results, the expert panel summarized practice gaps into 4 thematic areas and offered proposals to address deficiencies and promote better alignment with the 2014 ACC/American Heart Association valvular disease guidelines.

Conclusion

Important knowledge and skill gaps exist that may impede optimal care of the patient with MR. Focused educational and practice interventions should be developed to reduce these gaps.

Two trials (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation Trial and Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation Trial) were published in 2018 evaluating the effectiveness and safety of transcatheter repair for patients with heart failure with significant functional mitral regurgitation, which yielded different results. This article reviews the strength of the evidence, differences in trial designs, ethical and implementation implications, and delineates future research needs to help guide the appropriate dissemination of transcatheter repair for functional patients with mitral regurgitation.

Methods

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a workshop of interdisciplinary experts to address these objectives.

Results

Transcatheter repair of functional mitral regurgitation can provide significant benefits in terms of heart failure hospitalizations, survival, and quality of life when appropriate heart failure candidates with moderate to severe or severe mitral regurgitation while on optimal guideline-directed medical therapy can be identified. Key ingredients for success are preoperative evaluation and management and postoperative care by an interdisciplinary heart team.

Conclusions

Given the discordance observed between trials, ongoing innovation in patient management, and potential expansion of indications for use, the evidence base must be expanded to optimize appropriate implementation of this complex therapy. This will require more complete capture of outcome data in real-world settings for all eligible candidates whether or not they receive this therapy. Inevitably, the indications for use of this therapy will expand, as will the devices and therapeutic approaches for this population, necessitating the study of comparative effectiveness through randomized trials or observational studies. Moreover, given the substantial variations in care delivery, conducting implementation research to delineate characteristics of the optimal care model would be of benefit.

### Mortality associated with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation in 608 570 men and women undergoing echocardiography [^116Dih8i]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary we confirm that when left untreated, severe MR is associated with a very poor prognosis. Furthermore, we reveal that moderate MR is also not benign. Instead, it is associated with an increased risk of mortality irrespective of a person's age or the underlying cause of MR. As with severe MR, some individuals with moderate MR also have comorbidities that may independently affect their mortality trajectory. Nevertheless, these new findings have important clinical implications given the frequency of moderate MR. Strategies are needed to improve proactive clinical surveillance of these cases. Moreover, in this rapidly developing era of improved mitral valve therapies, our findings provide a strong rationale for more research to determine whether there is a role for interventions to minimise clinical deterioration, hospitalisation for HF, AF and premature death, among those presenting with moderate MR. Further studies are needed to examine the independence of moderate MR from comorbidities and other potential clinical confounders. Finally, the persistently poor prognosis associated with severe MR renews calls for active clinical review of these individuals, for more informed patient-centred discussions and consideration of timely intervention where appropriate.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) surgery — guideline recommendations for mitral valve (MV) surgery for the treatment of moderate or severe secondary MR, with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, are more conservative because surgical intervention in this patient group may improve symptoms and quality of life, but has not been shown to improve survival. MV repair (usually with a downsized annuloplasty ring) may be considered at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate secondary MR, although its benefit in this context is uncertain. In patients with severe secondary MR, MV surgery (either replacement or repair) is reasonable at the time of other cardiac surgery and can be considered as an isolated procedure for selected patients with advanced New York Heart Association functional class despite guideline-directed management inclusive of CRT when indicated. For severely symptomatic patients with severe ischemic, secondary MR, it is reasonable to choose chordal-sparing MV replacement over downsized annuloplasty repair, reflecting RCT findings that repair patients experienced a significantly higher rate of recurrent moderate or severe MR with more HF events and cardiovascular readmissions during follow-up. In patients deemed appropriate surgical candidates for atrial functional MR with annular dilatation and persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), a catheter-based AF ablation procedure would generally not be recommended, and individual patient considerations require careful assessment and MDT consensus decision-making.

Multidisciplinary team (MDT) processes and patient selection — supporting guidance emphasizes communication, referral, evolving device use, and follow-up in mitral regurgitation (MR). "Standardized echocardiographic reporting and timely access to accurate information are critical for effective patient management". "The prognostic, evaluative, and management differences between primary and secondary MR should be recognized". "An MDT consensus treatment recommendation should be discussed with the patient and family to enable shared decision making". "Ongoing communication between members of the MDT and the referring clinician is strongly endorsed, especially at critical junctures in the course of treatment and at times of transition of care". For surgery, "Referral for repair to an experienced MV surgeon at a heart valve center should be considered for patients with severe MR in whom other cardiac diseases require concomitant operative management (e.g., coronary artery disease)", and also "for those in whom complex repair of primary MR is contemplated, or for those with primary MR who wish to pursue a minimally invasive or robotic approach". Device therapy notes that "Use of TMVr with an edge-to-edge clip device in the United States has expanded from the treatment of severely symptomatic patients with primary, severe MR who are poor operative candidates to carefully selected secondary MR patients with persistent HF symptoms despite rigorous GDMT (and CRT when indicated)". "The roles of the MDT and its individual members are critical to decision making and consensus treatment recommendations". "Other TMVr and TMVR systems are under active investigation and are anticipated to become clinically available in the near to intermediate term", and "Introduction of these systems into clinical practice will require iterative updates to this ECDP". "Long-term follow-up of patients after surgical or transcatheter MV intervention is essential for assessment of durability of MR reduction, functional outcome, quality of life, and survival".

Mitral regurgitation — acute severe primary MR intervention: Prompt mitral valve surgery, preferably mitral repair if possible, is lifesaving in the symptomatic patient with acute severe primary MR, and most patients with acute severe MR require surgical correction for reestablishment of normal hemodynamics and for relief of symptoms; this is especially true for a complete papillary muscle rupture that causes very severe MR, which is poorly tolerated.

### Management of secondary mitral regurgitation: from drugs to devices [^114oW7mV]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe secondary mitral regurgitation carries a poor prognosis with one in five patients dying within 12 months of diagnosis. Fortunately, there are now a number of safe and effective therapies available to improve outcomes. Here, we summarise the most up-to-date treatments. Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy is the mainstay therapy and has been shown to reduce the severity of mitral regurgitation in 40–45% of patients. Rapid medication titration protocols reduce heart failure hospitalisation and facilitate earlier referral for device therapy. The pursuit of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation has been shown to significantly reduce mitral regurgitation severity, as has the use of cardiac resynchronisation devices in patients who meet guideline-directed criteria. Finally, we highlight the key role of mitral valve intervention, particularly transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation in carefully selected patients with poor left ventricular systolic function, with a number needed to treat of 3.1 to reduce heart failure hospitalisation and 5.9 to reduce all-cause death. To slow the rapid accumulation of morbidity and mortality, we advocate a proactive approach with accelerated medical optimisation, followed by management of atrial fibrillation and cardiac resynchronisation therapy if indicated, then, rapid referral to the Heart Team for consideration of mitral valve intervention in patients with ongoing symptoms and at least moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Mitral TEER has been shown to be 'reasonably cost-effective' (but not cost-saving) in the UK in selected patients, although TEER remains underused with only 6.5 procedures per million population (pmp) compared with Germany (77 pmp), Switzerland (44 pmp) and the USA (32 pmp).

### Basic principles of the echocardiographic evaluation of mitral regurgitation [^111CPH8U]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment decisions are completely dependent on accurate diagnosis of both mechanism and severity of MR, which can be challenging and is often done incorrectly. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most commonly used imaging test for MR; transesophageal echocardiography is often needed to better define morphology and MR severity, and is essential for guiding transcatheter therapies for MR. Multidetector computed tomography has become the standard to assess whether transcatheter valve replacement is an option because of its ability to assess valve sizing, access, and potential left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Finally, cine cardiac magnetic resonance has been recommended by recent guidelines to quantify MR severity when the distinction between moderate and severe MR is indeterminate by echocardiography. This paper focuses on the main questions to be answered by imaging techniques and illustrates some common tips, tricks, and pitfalls in the assessment of MR.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^112mShQk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Parallel to the current and numerous developing therapeutic options, the variety of patient characteristics and MR mechanisms result in a complex decision tree directing patient evaluation as well as timing and appropriateness of therapy. As such, current guidelines recommend that patients being considered for surgical or transcatheter therapies undergo consultation with a multidisciplinary heart team within a heart valve center of excellence. 2 This includes focused evaluations by physicians and advanced practitioners with expertise in heart failure, echocardiography, interventional cardiology, and cardiac surgery. Care by heart failure specialists promotes achievement of optimized guideline‐directed medical therapy in secondary MR patients, such that MR severity improves in many cases. Likewise, use of beta blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists can be maximized in primary MR patients who have developed LV dysfunction. Similarly, simultaneous patient assessment by cardiac surgeons and cardiologists with expertise in echocardiography and interventional therapies facilitates evaluation for candidacy of surgical or transcatheter therapies. Evaluation by multiple clinicians in the same setting enables real‐time discussion and planning with the patient and enhances communication with referring providers.

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 6–10) highlight that "indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation are expanding", and for severe aortic stenosis "the choice of type of intervention… should be a shared decision-making process that considers the lifetime risks and benefits" including valve type and approach. For valvular regurgitation, "indications for intervention… are relief of symptoms and prevention of the irreversible long-term consequences of left ventricular volume overload", and "thresholds for intervention now are lower than they previously were because of more durable treatment options and lower procedural risks". "A mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is of benefit to patients with severely symptomatic primary mitral regurgitation who are at high or prohibitive risk for surgery", and to a select subset with secondary mitral regurgitation despite guideline-directed therapy. Patients with severe symptomatic isolated tricuspid regurgitation "may benefit from surgical intervention" if performed before severe right ventricular dysfunction or end-organ damage. For prosthetic valves, "bioprosthetic valve dysfunction may occur" from leaflet degeneration or thrombosis, and "catheter-based treatment… is reasonable in selected patients" with leaflet degeneration or paravalvular leak without active infection.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) expert consensus decision pathway scope and emphasis — The ECDP emphasizes: Clinical and echocardiographic assessment; Establishment of MR etiology (primary, secondary, mixed) and mechanism; Consideration of associated hemodynamic consequences; Recognition of the indications for surgical or transcatheter intervention; Appreciation of the increasing complexity of surgical mitral valve (MV) repair as a function of pathoanatomy; Understanding of the current role for transcatheter MV edge-to-edge repair using a clip device. Recent emphasis has been placed on multidisciplinary team (MDT) consensus decision making to optimize outcomes for patients with valvular heart disease, including those with aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (MR). A highly functioning and expanded MDT is critical for the care of patients with significant MR. This document contains clinical expert consensus recommendations to guide the approach to patients with MR, and recommendations are based on the 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease (2), its 2017 focused update (3), and the results of landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (4,5) published in 2018.

Hemodynamic effects of mitral regurgitation — primary versus secondary pathophysiology and prognostic implications: MR is considered primary when due to disease of the mitral valve leaflets or chordae tendineae, and chronic severe primary MR imposes a pure LV volume overload resulting in eccentric hypertrophy and LV dilation; increased preload with low‑to‑normal afterload augments LV ejection fraction, which is typically supranormal. In secondary MR, LV dilatation and decreased function are usually the cause rather than the consequence of MR; severity can be dynamic and change abruptly with afterload, preload, ischemia, and heart rate or rhythm. Any degree of secondary MR is associated with worsened prognosis in ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and although a framework linking severity by effective regurgitant orifice areas to LV end‑diastolic volume has been proposed, further prospective validation is required before widespread clinical adoption.

### Surgical and transcatheter mitral valve repair for severe chronic mitral regurgitation: a review of clinical indications and patient assessment [^114hX7tt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As the US population continues to age, the prevalence of significant MR is expected to further increase. In high‐volume centers of excellence, the operative mortality for mitral intervention is < 1%, and successful surgical repair improves long‐term survival enough to equate to an age‐matched population with 95% freedom from repeat surgery and > 80% freedom from moderate to severe or severe MR at 20 years after surgery. 36 Nevertheless, almost 50% of patients who meet current indications for mitral valve surgery are not offered this therapy because of elevated surgical risk 6 from decreased LV ejection fraction, advanced age, and other comorbidities such as advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. TMVR is an exciting new technology that offers a treatment option for many of these patients who, until recently, had limited options outside of palliative care and hospice. The superiority of MV surgery and the complexity of MitraClip TMVR demand detailed clinical assessment to ensure delivery of the appropriate therapy at the appropriate time point to these patients. A multidisciplinary team approach is optimal for the evaluation of these patients and provides multifaceted expertise for a successful mitral valve program.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) 2020 focused update — key changes include expanded evidence recognition and pathway modifications for secondary MR and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. The update acknowledges new randomized controlled trial (RCT) data supporting transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in selected patients with heart failure (HF) and secondary MR, and notes publication of MITRA FR and COAPT in 2018 with subsequent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in March 2019. In the management pathway, exercise echo is added to ancillary testing that may be considered to establish severity of MR, transcatheter treatment is extended to secondary MR after documentation of persistent symptoms despite optimal guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) for HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF), and an HF expert is added among clinicians who may provide patient follow-up. The document includes the theoretical concept of disproportionate MR as a proposed means of evaluating secondary MR and potential candidacy for valve directed therapies, adds consideration of rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) — especially those with atrial functional MR — and includes a statement about survival benefit with edge-to-edge repair in selected patients with secondary MR. Interventional content is revised with new Figure 9A (Primary MR) and 9B (Secondary MR) and inclusion of transcatheter mitral valve (MV) therapy. Team-based care is broadened by expanding the multidisciplinary team (MDT) to include a cardiologist with experience managing HF and MR in management of patients with secondary MR and by expanding use of edge-to-edge repair for selected patients with secondary MR.

### Moderate secondary mitral regurgitation: evolving evidence and management strategies [^112sJUya]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is common in patients with heart failure (HF). Although randomized clinical trials have been focused on the treatment of severe SMR, the prognostic role and potential for treatment of moderate SMR cannot be overlooked. The randomized RESHAPE-HF2 trial included patients with moderate and severe SMR with consistent findings in both groups, raising the hypothesis that transcatheter correction of moderate SMR could have beneficial effects, although this needs further investigation. The aim of this review is to describe the prevalence of moderate SMR in patients with HF, its prognostic impact, and discuss current evidence for pharmacologic and interventional management of patients with moderate SMR.

Summary and recommendations

The evolution of device therapies for the mitral valve has led to a renaissance in our understanding of this complex valve system. With it comes the opportunity to improve outcomes for our patients in a variety of ways, and with each of these strategies, the benefits appear to be additive. In figure 1, we outline an accelerated treatment pathway guided by the Heart Team, designed to rapidly optimise patients with sMR and direct 'non-responders' towards device therapy to minimise the early accumulation of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Figure 1
Recommended treatment approach. AF, atrial fibrillation; DCCV, direct current cardioversion; GDMT, guideline-directed medical therapy; LVAD, left ventricular assist device; MR, mitral regurgitation; TEER, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair;

From the time of diagnosis, we recommend commencement and rapid uptitration of GDMT over a period of 6 weeks–3 months according to published protocols. This should include one of each of the four classes of heart failure therapies. During this time, consideration should be given to the management of AF if present, either with medical therapy, DC cardioversion and/or catheter ablation. After 3–6 months of stable therapy, the patient can be reassessed for ongoing symptoms and MR severity. If the patient continues to have symptoms ≥ NYHA class II and MR severity ≥ moderate-severe, then they should be referred to the Heart Team for consideration of mitral valve intervention according to what is most suitable for and available to that patient. If the patient meets criteria for CRT, then this should be undertaken prior to any mitral valve intervention being performed.

Spectrum and management considerations in secondary mitral regurgitation — secondary MR occurs as a consequence of adverse LV remodeling with papillary muscle displacement, leaflet tethering, and annular dilation, and mitral valve closing forces may also be reduced. At one extreme is a severely dilated, spherical LV with markedly depressed LV systolic function and secondary MR along the leaflet coaptation line; at the other, an isolated inferolateral myocardial infarction may produce severe secondary MR due to asymmetric posteromedial annular dilation and posterior leaflet tethering despite normal LV size and global ejection fraction. Secondary MR may also emerge or worsen in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF) due to left atrial stretch and annular dilation despite preserved LV systolic function. Management considerations need to take into account the mechanism(s) of MR and potential indications for other interventions, such as coronary revascularization and rhythm control. In patients with heart failure, advanced LV remodeling/chamber dilatation, and significant LV systolic dysfunction who remain symptomatic despite optimized guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) (including cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] when indicated), mitral valve intervention may not improve HF symptoms or quality of life if the dominant problem is severe LV dysfunction, and heart transplantation or destination LV assist device therapy may be a more effective treatment strategy than MV intervention in this context.

ACC focused update — intervention for symptomatic secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) outlines an algorithm beginning with patients who have moderate to severe or severe secondary MR and heart failure with LVEF < 50%, asks whether revascularization is indicated, and directs "CABG or PCI as part of a comprehensive treatment plan to include MV intervention per MDT consensus" while also to "initiate or intensify GDMT" for left ventricular systolic dysfunction; subsequent steps include determining whether CABG is preferred or other surgery is needed with options such as "CABG/MVRR/other†", reassessing for ongoing heart failure symptoms with the option to "Continue GDMT", considering cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with the option to "Continue CRT+GDMT", and multidisciplinary team assessment of appropriateness for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMV r), proceeding to "TMV r‡" if suitable or to mitral valve repair or replacement (MVRR) if not; response to GDMT and/or CRT is evaluated " ≥ 3 months after optimization", the "other†" procedures are specified, candidacy for TMV r depends on anatomic findings and relation of MR severity to left ventricular size, and patients not considered surgical candidates may be considered for transplantation or ventricular assist device therapy if TMV r is not feasible.

### Percutaneous interventions for secondary mitral regurgitation [^11285wV5]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation is frequently associated with ventricular dysfunction and carries a high mortality. Guideline-directed medical therapy, surgical mitral valve repair or replacement, and, in the setting of advanced heart failure, heart transplant and left ventricular assist devices have been the mainstay of treatment. However, rapid advancement in the field has resulted in approval of edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with the MitraClip, and there are several novel catheter-based percutaneous options in clinical trials. Percutaneous options, while promising, must be deployed in patients who are most likely to benefit, and thus, understanding the pathophysiology of specific subgroups of patients with functional mitral regurgitation (eg, disproportionate versus proportionate mitral regurgitation) is key to the success of new devices. We review the pathophysiology, percutaneous therapeutic treatment options, and ongoing clinical trials for functional mitral regurgitation.

### Mitral regurgitation [^112vmXFo]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Mitral regurgitation affects more than 2 million people in the USA. The main causes are classified as degenerative (with valve prolapse) and ischaemic (ie, due to consequences of coronary disease) in developed countries, or rheumatic (in developing countries). This disorder generally progresses insidiously, because the heart compensates for increasing regurgitant volume by left-atrial enlargement, causes left-ventricular overload and dysfunction, and yields poor outcome when it becomes severe. Doppler-echocardiographic methods can be used to quantify the severity of mitral regurgitation. Yearly mortality rates with medical treatment in patients aged 50 years or older are about 3% for moderate organic regurgitation and about 6% for severe organic regurgitation. Surgery is the only treatment proven to improve symptoms and prevent heart failure. Valve repair improves outcome compared with valve replacement and reduces mortality of patient with severe organic mitral regurgitation by about 70%. The best short-term and long-term results are obtained in asymptomatic patients operated on in advanced repair centres with low operative mortality (< 1%) and high repair rates (≥ 80–90%).

### New perspective on pathophysiology and management of functional mitral regurgitation [^1149UpuE]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) occurs as a result of global or segmental left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or left atrial dilatation, leading to mitral annular dilatation, papillary muscle displacement, mitral valve (MV) leaflet tethering, and leaflet remodeling. The prevalence of FMR continues to rise in the United States. Even mild FMR is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Echocardiography is the primary imaging modality used to assess the type and severity of mitral regurgitation. FMR treatment depends on the etiology. Evidence-based pharmacologic and cardiac resynchronization therapies for underlying LV dysfunction remain the mainstay of treatment. Patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy can be considered for surgical or percutaneous MV intervention. This article reviews the pathophysiology, imaging evaluation, and therapeutic options of FMR, highlighting the most recent developments in a rapidly evolving field.

### Heart team approach in treatment of mitral regurgitation: patient selection and outcome [^112kW1US]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients undergoing surgical treatment for mitral regurgitation (MR) have been studied for decades. In selected patient populations (relatively young patients, primary MR), surgical mitral valve repair (MVrepair) leads to outstanding repair rates and excellent long-term survival. However, in patients with secondary MR, and in particular in ischaemic heart disease, it is an ongoing debate whether surgical MVrepair or mitral valve replacement (MVR) is the treatment of choice. In addition, for elderly patients outcomes after mitral valve (MV) surgery are far less favourable. Percutaneous MV repair using the Mitraclip (MC) procedure has proven to be a treatment alternative for surgical high-risk patients with MR. However, these specific cohorts or randomised trials exclude many patients seen in daily practice, and single surgeon experiences in few, highly specialised centres may not represent reality in large parts of the world where patients are evaluated and treated by heart teams.

The concept of an multidisciplinary heart team (MDT) has evolved to a central role in modern cardiovascular care to ensure the most appropriate individual treatment and to improve the outcome for each patient. However, evidence supporting such an approach is lacking, in particular for MV regurgitation. Furthermore, the exact patient selection process performed by the MDT has not been described. The aim of this study was to report the selection process and the outcomes of patients undergoing MV treatment in a centre with an institutionalised MDT approach.

Mitral valve (MV) repair candidacy and postoperative imaging — patients with a single segment flail of the posterior leaflet due to fibroelastic deficiency without annular or leaflet calcification have the highest chance of technically successful and durable valve repair and should not undergo valve replacement unless a repair has been attempted and was unsuccessful. Patients with severe anterior, bileaflet, Barlow's, or mixed disease that may require extensive and complex reparative techniques should be preferentially referred to an experienced MV surgeon at a high-volume institution. The most important predictor of long-term failure is the presence of moderate or greater residual MR at the time of the index operation. A small subgroup with primary MR may be better served by valve replacement rather than repair, such as those with prior cardiac operation or prior chest radiation where any subsequent operation for a failed repair would be at substantially increased risk. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended either prior to discharge or by 1 to 3 months after surgical MV repair or replacement, with longitudinal TTE thereafter dictated by clinical findings and by the presence of a prosthetic heart valve replacement.

### Educational needs and application of guidelines in the management of patients with mitral regurgitation. A European mixed-methods study [^1169852X]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the knowledge and application of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines in the management of mitral regurgitation (MR).

Methods and Results

A mixed-methods educational needs assessment was performed. Following a qualitative phase (interviews), an online survey was undertaken using three case scenarios (asymptomatic severe primary MR, symptomatic severe primary MR in the elderly, and severe secondary MR) in 115 primary care physicians (PCPs), and 439 cardiologists or cardiac surgeons from seven European countries. Systematic cardiac auscultation was performed by only 54% of clinicians in asymptomatic patients. Cardiologists appropriately interpreted echocardiographic assessment of mechanism and quantification of primary MR (≥ 75%), but only 44% recognized secondary MR as severe. In asymptomatic severe primary MR with an indication for surgery, 27% of PCPs did not refer the patient to a cardiologist and medical therapy was overused by 19% of cardiologists. In the elderly patient with severe symptomatic primary MR, 72% of cardiologists considered mitral intervention (transcatheter edge-to-edge valve repair in 72%). In severe symptomatic secondary MR, optimization of medical therapy was advised by only 51% of PCPs and 33% of cardiologists, and surgery considered in 30% of cases (transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in 64%).

Conclusion

Systematic auscultation is underused by PCPs for the early detection of MR. Medical therapy is overused in primary MR and underused in secondary MR. Indications for interventions are appropriate in most patients with primary MR, but are unexpectedly frequent for secondary MR. These gaps identify important targets for future educational programs.

### Quantitating mitral regurgitation in clinical trials: the need for a uniform approach [^113pfo51]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an established relationship between the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) and prognosis. Quantitation of MR severity guides therapeutic approaches. Inconsistent definitions and categorization of MR severity in clinical studies limit meaningful comparisons among trials and compromise development of an effective evidence base. The purpose of this study was to quantify heterogeneity in grading systems for MR severity in the contemporary literature.

Methods

This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and propensity score-adjusted clinical studies of mitral valve interventions (surgical or percutaneous). A total of 35 articles from 2015 to 2020 were included (15 randomized controlled trials and 20 propensity score-adjusted clinical studies).

Results

There were 22 studies that reported MR severity in numeric categories, either values from the historical "plus" system or numeric MR grades, whereas 9 studies reported MR severity using text-only descriptive categories. Among the studies that used numeric categories, 2+ MR was defined as moderate in 64% of studies, mild in 27%, and mild-moderate in 9%, and 3+ MR was defined as moderate in 14%, moderate-severe in 52%, and severe in 14%.

Conclusions

There was substantial variability in MR severity definition and reporting in contemporary clinical studies of mitral valve interventions. We recommend that the historical plus numeric grading system be abandoned and that inclusion and outcome criteria in MR clinical trials be based on US and European guideline-recommended categories as none or trace, mild, moderate, and severe. Adoption of these simple recommendations will improve the consistency and quality of MR clinical trial design and reporting.

### Controversies in valvular heart disease: insights from cardiac imaging [^1138Lijp]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Numerous controversies still exist in the diagnosis and management of valvular heart disease, for example, the benefit of treating moderate aortic stenosis (AS) or asymptomatic, severe AS and the appropriate selection criteria for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. While numerous imaging parameters have been linked to the risk of sudden cardiac death in mitral valve prolapse, their relative merits are unknown and this is a challenging population to risk-stratify. No large, randomized data exist to guide selection of patients for transcatheter repair of tricuspid regurgitation or valve intervention in severe pulmonary regurgitation. Multimodality cardiac imaging provides unique insights into these important questions.

### Misconceptions and facts about mitral regurgitation [^114hYnQU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation is a common heart valve disease. It is defined to be primary when it results from the pathology of the mitral valve apparatus itself and secondary when it is caused by distortion of the architecture or function of the left ventricle. Although the diagnosis and management of mitral regurgitation rely heavily on echocardiography, one should bear in mind the caveats and shortcomings of such an approach. Clinical decision making commonly focuses on the indications for surgery, but it is complex and mandates precise assessment of the mitral pathology, symptom status of the patient, and ventricular performance (right and left) among other descriptors. It is important for healthcare providers at all levels to be familiar with the clinical picture, diagnosis, disease course, and management of mitral regurgitation.

Prognosis — secondary mitral regurgitation (MR): In ischemic cardiomyopathy, "the presence of MR of any grade results in worse long-term prognosis", and severe ischemic MR is "an indicator of short-term mortality". Among secondary MR measures, "An EROA ≥ 0.2 cm² has been shown to be a predictor of adverse outcomes", and secondary MR "appears to be an independent marker of adverse prognosis" after multivariable adjustment. Therapeutically, surgical correction "may improve symptoms and quality of life but has not been shown to improve survival", whereas transcatheter edge-to-edge clip repair "has been shown in 1 RCT to improve both survival and quality of life in selected patients with HF". The page also notes that "severe MR (≥ 0.40 cm²) can be lower in patients with secondary MR and elliptical orifices", supporting integrative severity assessment.

### Contrasting effects of pharmacological, procedural, and surgical interventions on proportionate and disproportionate functional mitral regurgitation in chronic heart failure [^116RFxzi]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Two distinct pathways can lead to functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. When remodeling and enlargement of the left ventricle (LV) cause annular dilatation and tethering of the mitral valve leaflets, there is a linear relationship between LV end-diastolic volume and the effective regurgitant orifice area of the mitral valve. These patients, designated as having proportionate MR, respond favorably to treatments that lead to reversal of LV remodeling and a decrease in LV volumes (eg, neurohormonal antagonists and LV assist devices), but they may not benefit from interventions that are directed only at the mitral valve leaflets (eg, transcatheter mitral valve repair). In contrast, when ventricular dyssynchrony causes functional MR attributable to unequal contraction of the papillary muscles, the magnitude of regurgitation is greater than that predicted by LV volumes. These patients, designated as having severe but disproportionate MR, respond favorably to treatments that are directed to the mitral valve leaflets or their supporting structures (eg, cardiac resynchronization or transcatheter mitral valve repair), but they may derive little benefit from interventions that act only to reduce LV cavity size (eg, pharmacological treatments). This novel conceptual framework reflects the important interplay between LV geometry and mitral valve function in determining the clinical presentation of patients, and it allows characterization of the determinants of functional MR to guide the most appropriate therapy in the clinical setting.

### The management of secondary mitral regurgitation in patients with heart failure: a joint position statement from the heart failure association (HFA), European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI) of the ESC [^115jWHLN]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and scope

Moderate or severe secondary (also known as functional) mitral regurgitation (SMR) accompanies heart failure (HF) in about one-third of patientsand contributes to clinical deterioration, progression of the syndrome, and adverse outcomes. Secondary mitral regurgitation results from left ventricular (LV) remodelling as a consequence of ischaemic or non-ischaemic myocardial disease that leads to reduced coaptation of normal mitral valve leaflets via several mechanisms. Since SMR is principally a disease of the left ventricle and not of the valve itself, current treatment strategies target the underlying LV disorder. However, SMR exaggerates LV remodelling by increasing volume load and mechanical correction has been proposed alongside guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to improve symptoms and prognosis.

The interventional management of patients with HF and SMR is challenging. In contrast to primary (including degenerative) mitral regurgitation (MR), the outcomes of surgical mitral valve repair, either alone or combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), are of questionable benefit. Transcatheter techniques for the correction of SMR have broadened the spectrum of patients who may benefit from mitral valve intervention, although current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of both HF and valvular heart disease (VHD) indicate the need for further clinical research in this area. The recently published COAPTand MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation (MITRA-FR)randomized controlled trials have addressed this deficit but their conflicting results have generated considerable discussion and require careful interpretation.

This position statement, developed in collaboration by the ESC Heart Failure Association (HFA), European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), and European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), proposes an updated practical approach to the management of patients with HF and SMR based on a multidisciplinary Heart Team approach. We outline the current evidence (and its limitations), discuss open issues that need to be addressed by future research, and stress the importance of appropriate referral and selection of patients for transcatheter mitral valve intervention alongside guideline-recommended medical and device therapies.

Decision tree for assessing severity of chronic MR by TTE — Chronic Mitral Regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography classifies mitral regurgitation (MR) by first asking whether MR meets specific criteria for mild or severe MR; intermediate values are labeled MR probably moderate, and the pathway advises to perform quantitative methods whenever possible. Branch logic uses 2–3 criteria to tentatively classify as mild or severe, ≥ 4 Criteria as definitely mild or definitely severe, and an indeterminate MR branch directs clinicians to consider transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for quantitation.

Pathway for management of mitral regurgitation (MR) outlines staged evaluation and care: classification uses the Carpentier scheme with primary, secondary, or mixed etiologies; severity assessment specifies quantitation with EROA, RVol, and RF, assessment of LV/LA size, PASP, TR, and PV flow reversal, and additional testing with TEE, CMR, ETT, exercise echo, and cath/angio; treatment is organized by a multidisciplinary team including HF, imaging, valve, interventional, surgical, anesthesia, nursing, and other specialists; therapeutic options include GDMT for HF, CAD, AF, HTN, and lipids, surgical treatment with repair, replacement, CABG, AF surgery, and LAA management, and transcatheter treatment with edge-to-edge clip repair, other repair systems if/when approved, replacement, AF ablation, and LAA management; follow-up specifies HF expert, clinical cardiologist, and primary care clinician with symptom status, physical examination, surveillance TTE, and GDMT for HF, CAD, AF, and HTN; footnotes add that advanced heart failure/transplant expertise is preferred when available and treatment for secondary MR should include CRT when indicated by wide QRS and LV dysfunction, that investigational treatment systems are in clinical development and not approved, and that follow up of treated primary MR is most often provided by a valve expert or general cardiologist while follow up of treated secondary MR and HF should be provided by a heart failure expert when available, with severity categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for severe primary MR emphasizes mechanism and timing: Primary MR is a mechanical problem of the leaflet coaptation that has only a mechanical solution — that of mitral valve mechanical intervention, and the onset of symptoms that results from severe MR worsens prognosis even when LV function appears to be normal; thus, the onset of symptoms is an indication for prompt mitral valve surgery, and the ideal time for mitral valve surgery is when the patient's LV approaches but has not yet reached the parameters that indicate systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 mm), with imaging surveillance used because symptoms do not always coincide with LV dysfunction.

### Survival after coronary revascularization, with and without mitral valve surgery, in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation [^114AxMi6]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most appropriate treatment for patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is often debated. We compared the survival rates of patients with IMR undergoing different treatment strategies, namely: medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and CABG + mitral valve (MV) surgery.

Methods and Results

Patients undergoing catheterization between 1986 and 2001 were included. IMR was defined as: ≥ grade 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR) and significant coronary artery disease (CAD) without primary mitral valve disease. Patients undergoing catheterization for the evaluation of congenital or other valvular heart disease were excluded. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was utilized to assess the independent relation between treatment and survival. Propensity score methods were used to correct for the nonrandom assignment of treatment. Of the 2,757 patients who met study criteria: 1,305 were treated medically, 537 underwent PCI, 687 underwent CABG, and 228 underwent CABG + MV surgery. The median duration of follow-up was 3.2 (0.9, 7.1) years. Patients undergoing CABG + MV surgery had more severe MR and more severe heart failure than those treated by other modalities. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, patients undergoing PCI, CABG, and CABG + MV surgery had a 31% (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.69; P = 0.0001), 42% (HR = 0.58; P = 0.0001), and 42% (HR = 0.58; P = 0.0001) reduction in the risk of death, respectively, compared with those undergoing medical therapy. The performance of mitral valve surgery with CABG was not associated with improved survival versus CABG alone (P = 0.258).

Conclusions

Among patients with IMR, treatment with PCI, CABG, or CABG + MV surgery is associated with improved survival compared with medical therapy.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) medical therapy — recommendations state that patients with chronic severe secondary MR (Stages C and D) and heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction should receive standard guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and/or sacubitril/valsartan, and biventricular pacing as indicated, and that a cardiologist expert in the management of patients with HF and LV systolic dysfunction should be the primary MDT member responsible for implementing and monitoring optimal GDMT. Supportive text notes that chronic secondary MR usually develops as a result of LV systolic dysfunction and that standard GDMT for HF forms the mainstay of therapy; diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists help improve symptoms and/or prolong life; GDMT can reduce LV volumes (reverse remodeling) in many patients, which reduces severity of secondary MR; secondary MR is often responsive to GDMT (including coronary revascularization or cardiac resynchronization therapy in appropriate patients); and optimization of GDMT should be under the supervision of a cardiologist expert to determine whether MR and symptoms are truly refractory before surgical or transcatheter treatment.

ACC/AHA 2020 — Mixed aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR): Overall, patients with severe AS and severe primary MR are best treated with SAVR and mitral valve surgery unless the surgical risk is high or prohibitive, and if there is a high or prohibitive surgical risk, a staged procedure, with TAVI followed by mitral TEER, can be effective. If there is severe AS and severe secondary MR, either SAVR and mitral valve surgery or a staged approach with TAVI followed by mitral TEER are options. In patients with both AS and MR who are at a low or intermediate surgical risk, it is reasonable to address both valves with surgery. Patients with severe AS who are at high to prohibitive surgical risk are best served by TAVI, and if symptoms persist after TAVI and if there is suitable anatomy, percutaneous mitral repair can be performed, which can reduce MR and improve symptoms. For patients with AS who have secondary MR, the fate of MR after SAVR or TAVI is uncertain, and secondary MR does not improve or may even worsen after AVR in many cases. Because there are limited data to support CORs, a table provides a perspective on possible interventions in these complex patients.

### Aortic and mitral valve disease and left ventricular dysfunction in children [^114boXe9]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this review, we will discuss aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis. We will review the etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of aortic and mitral valve disease. Age and lesion specific treatments are outlined based on the severity of valve disease with an aim at long-term preservation of left ventricular function.

Data Source

MEDLINE and PubMed.

Conclusions

Mitral and aortic valve disease leads to unique hemodynamic burdens that can impact left ventricular function, quality of life, and longevity. The primary challenge in the management of mitral and aortic valve disease is to apply appropriate medical management and identify that point in time at which the surgery is necessary. Although guidelines have been established for the management of aortic and mitral valve disease in adults, the challenges of early presentation, maintenance of growth potential, and apparent increased tolerance of hemodynamic burden in children makes decision making challenging.

### Clinical trial design principles and endpoint definitions for transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement: part 2: endpoint definitions: a consensus document from the mitral valve academic research consortium [^1122zwLN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most prevalent valve disorders and has numerous etiologies, including primary (organic) MR, due to underlying degenerative/structural mitral valve (MV) pathology, and secondary (functional) MR, which is principally caused by global or regional left ventricular remodeling and/or severe left atrial dilation. Diagnosis and optimal management of MR requires integration of valve disease and heart failure specialists, MV cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists with expertise in structural heart disease, and imaging experts. The introduction of transcatheter MV therapies has highlighted the need for a consensus approach to pragmatic clinical trial design and uniform endpoint definitions to evaluate outcomes in patients with MR. The Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium is a collaboration between leading academic research organizations and physician-scientists specializing in MV disease from the United States and Europe. Three in-person meetings were held in Virginia and New York during which 44 heart failure, valve, and imaging experts, MV surgeons and interventional cardiologists, clinical trial specialists and statisticians, and representatives from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered all aspects of MV pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapies, culminating in a 2-part document describing consensus recommendations for clinical trial design (Part 1) and endpoint definitions (Part 2) to guide evaluation of transcatheter and surgical therapies for MR. The adoption of these recommendations will afford robustness and consistency in the comparative effectiveness evaluation of new devices and approaches to treat MR. These principles may be useful for regulatory assessment of new transcatheter MV devices, as well as for monitoring local and regional outcomes to guide quality improvement initiatives.

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) surgical thresholds and outcomes — because of altered loading, a higher cutoff for "normal" LVEF is used in MR, and although it is inadvisable to allow LV function to deteriorate beyond an LVEF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 mm, some recovery can still occur after crossing these thresholds. Repair success increases with surgical volume and expertise, and mitral valve replacement is preferable to a poor repair. When only annuloplasty and posterior leaflet repair are required, expected results include an operative mortality rate of < 1%, approximately 95% freedom from reoperation, and > 80% freedom from recurrent moderate or severe MR at 15 to 20 years after operation. The onset of symptoms, LV dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension worsens prognosis, and an attractive alternative strategy is early mitral repair before these triggers are reached, provided a durable repair is achieved.

### Waiting vs early surgery for mitral regurgitation… [^114TaMdL]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Similar results were observed in relative reduction in mortality following early surgery in the subset with class II triggers. With class II triggers, survival was better with early surgery, both overall and in the matched cohort at 10 years. The long-term mortality rate was lower after early surgery over all periods examined. Minimal subjective manifestations were noted at initial consultation in 451 patients and absent in 570. Our study shows that early mitral valve surgery was not associated with excess short-term mortality or heart failure but did carry a small increased risk of early atrial fibrillation.

Long-term, the results are coherent by all methods used that early surgical correction of mitral valve regurgitation was associated with a significant survival benefit and diminished heart failure risk. Furthermore, the lasting benefit of early surgery appeared to be sustained 20 years following diagnosis and observed in subgroups with or without class II triggers for surgery, and with or without minor subjective manifestations. These findings emanate from institutions that together provide a very high rate of mitral valve repair with low operative mortality, emphasizing that such results might also be achieved in routine practice at many advanced repair centers.

We selected 3 months as the window for performance of early surgical intervention based on clinical observation of the practicalities of patients making arrangements to schedule and undergo mitral valve surgery. Even with early surgery defined as occurring within 1 or 6 months following diagnosis in exploratory models, surgical intervention was still associated with better outcomes than initial medical management (at 1 month: adjusted risk of death, 0. 51; heart failure,
0. 36 [95% CI, 0. 23–0. 57, P <. 00.

Regarding surgical interventions for mitral regurgitation, more specifically with respect to mitral valve repair, primary MR, asymptomatic patients, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider performing mitral valve surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and normal LV systolic function (LVEF > 60% and LVESD < 40 mm; stage C1) but with a progressive increase in LV size or decrease in ejection fraction on ≥ 3 serial imaging studies, irrespective of the probability of a successful and durable repair.

### MitraClip for severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation in patients at high surgical risk: a comprehensive systematic review [^111bB3vy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) at high surgical risk (HSR) is unknown. Recently, the EVEREST II (Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair) High Risk Study suggested MitraClip (MC) was a safe and effective treatment option.

Methods

We performed a search strategy for MC or mitral valve surgery (MVS) in patients at HSR for surgical mortality (logistic EuroSCORE > 18 or STS score > 10) using Medline databases, proceedings of international meetings, and the STS database. We identified 21 studies utilizing MC (n = 3,198) and MVS (n = 3,265, > 90% from the STS database) from 2003 to 2013. Information about patient characteristics, surgical risk, and 30-day and 1-year outcomes were extracted.

Results

Patients who underwent MC or MVS had a mean age of 74 ± 10 years with no differences in surgical risk, NYHA class, or MR grade (P = 0.46). Technical success was achieved in 96% of patients undergoing MC versus 98% in the MVS group (P = 0.45). Patients undergoing MC were treated with one or two MC in 90% (n = 2,878) with only a few requiring repeat MC (0.4%, n = 13) or mitral surgery (0.3%, n = 52) at 30 days. The pooled event rates for mortality was 3.2% (95% CI [2.5–4.2]), stroke was 1.1% (95% CI [0.7–0.2]) at 30 days. At 31 days to 1 year, the pooled event rate for mortality was 13.0% [95% CI (9–18.3)], stroke was 1.6% [95% CI (0.8–3.2)], and repeat MVS was 1.3% [95% CI (0.7–2.6)] with the majority of patients in the mild/moderate MR grade and NYHA class after MC. The 30-day event rates for mortality and stroke were 16.8% (95% CI [14–19]) and 4.5% (95% CI [3.9–5.3]) after MVS, respectively.

Conclusion

Based on high risk MC studies and high risk MVS data predominantly from STS database, patients with severe MR who are at HSR can be effectively treated with MC or MVS. MC can be safely implanted in high risk patients with relatively low mortality and stroke risk.

### Clinical trial design principles and endpoint definitions for transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement: part 2: endpoint definitions: a consensus document from the mitral valve academic research consortium [^1166hj96]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most prevalent valve disorders and has numerous aetiologies, including primary (organic) MR, due to underlying degenerative/structural mitral valve (MV) pathology, and secondary (functional) MR, which is principally caused by global or regional left ventricular remodelling and/or severe left atrial dilation. Diagnosis and optimal management of MR requires integration of valve disease and heart failure specialists, MV cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists with expertise in structural heart disease, and imaging experts. The introduction of trans- catheter MV therapies has highlighted the need for a consensus approach to pragmatic clinical trial design and uniform endpoint definitions to evaluate outcomes in patients with MR. The Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium is a collaboration between leading academic research organizations and physician-scientists specializing in MV disease from the United States and Europe. Three in-person meetings were held in Virginia and New York during which 44 heart failure, valve, and imaging experts, MV surgeons and interventional cardiologists, clinical trial specialists and statisticians, and representatives from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered all aspects of MV pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapies, culminating in a 2-part document describing consensus recommendations for clinical trial design (Part 1) and endpoint definitions (Part 2) to guide evaluation of transcatheter and surgical therapies for MR. The adoption of these recommendations will afford robustness and consistency in the comparative effectiveness evaluation of new devices and approaches to treat MR. These principles may be useful for regulatory assessment of new transcatheter MV devices, as well as for monitoring local and regional outcomes to guide quality improvement initiatives.

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^114Yzdse]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparison of Proportionality Frameworks for Mitral and Tricuspid Regurgitation: Learning From a Controversy

Notably, the proportionality concept for functional mitral regurgitation was developed to explain apparently discordant results from 2 randomized controlled trials of transcatheter mitral valve repair, and by relating the degree of mitral regurgitation severity (expressed as mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice area) to the severity of left ventricular remodeling (expressed as left ventricular end‐diastolic volume), it postulates that correction of mitral regurgitation by transcatheter mitral valve repair might be particularly effective in improving outcomes in patients with disproportionate mitral regurgitation (proposed threshold, 0.15 cm² /100 mL). In fact, there were profound differences in baseline characteristics of the patient populations enrolled in the MITRA‐FR (Percutaneous Repair With the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral Regurgitation) and COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trials: COAPT enrolled patients whose mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice area was larger and whose left ventricular end‐diastolic volume was smaller than those in MITRA‐FR, resulting in a higher proportion of patients with disproportionate mitral regurgitation in the COAPT trial. Supporting the proportionality concept, transcatheter mitral valve repair was shown to reduce rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalizations only in the COAPT trial. However, a post hoc analysis of the MITRA‐FR trial failed to demonstrate better efficacy of transcatheter mitral valve repair in patient subsets with disproportionate than in those with proportionate mitral regurgitation. Another (retrospective multicenter) study reported that more pronounced early reduction in mitral regurgitation severity was not durable in patients with disproportionate mitral regurgitation, and ultimately resulted in similar rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalization between patients with proportionate and disproportionate mitral regurgitation. While substantial controversy about the proportionality concept for mitral regurgitation remains, the evaluation of proportionality in patients with severe TR promises to provide a more physiological approach for the treatment of severe TR because PH as the true culprit causing dilatation of the right ventricular free wall, papillary muscle displacement, leaflet tethering, and failure of leaflet coaptation in the majority of cases (72.2% of patients were diagnosed with mPAP levels ≥ 25 mm Hg; 59.3% of patients were diagnosed with secondary ventricular etiology of TR) is unlikely to be ameliorated by TTVI, and it will hence persist to cause maladaptive right ventricular remodeling with its fatal consequences. Importantly, the threshold to define disproportionate mitral regurgitation is based on a predictive model for left ventricular remodeling, while we calculated an outcome‐oriented threshold to predict 2‐year mortality after TTVI and confirmed its prognostic significance by external validation. Because patients with severe TR typically suffer from advanced heart failure symptoms and experience repeated heart failure hospitalizations, it will be interesting for future studies to investigate further end points such as heart failure hospitalizations and quality of life after TTVI in accordance with proportionality of TR.

### Secondary mitral regurgitation in heart failure: pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapeutic considerations [^115SWc5N]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The development of secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) due to left ventricular dysfunction, also known as functional MR, is strongly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. The mechanisms underlying secondary MR are multifactorial; accurate imaging assessment of secondary MR may be challenging and nuanced; and the appropriate roles of medical, surgical, and interventional therapies for management of secondary MR are controversial and evolving. In this review, the pathophysiology, evaluation, and prognosis of secondary MR in patients with heart failure are discussed, and we evaluate in detail the evidence for the various therapeutic approaches for secondary MR, including guideline-directed medication for left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac resynchronization therapy and revascularization when appropriate, and mitral valve surgery and transcatheter interventions. The role of a multidisciplinary heart team in determining the optimal management strategy for secondary MR is also discussed.

### Outcome of mitral valve repair or replacement for non-ischemic mitral regurgitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112sV69]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a rather common form of mitral valve (MV) dysfunction, occurring in approximately 10% of the population. Normal mitral closure depends on the integrity and normal function of five components: the leaflets, annulus, tendons, papillary muscles, and left ventricle. Abnormalities in the structure and function of any one of these five components can lead to MR. Patients with mild MR have only occasional exertional dyspnea, and can be asymptomatic. However, acute severe MR (e.g. papillary muscle rupture) can lead to acute left heart failure or even cardiac death.

Severe MR often requires surgical correction, which is useful for improving the prognosis and quality of life of the patients. Traditionally, MV surgery for mitral regurgitation consists mainly of MV replacement and MV repair. According to several lines of evidence from comparative studies, MV repair, which has been increasingly more often performed since 1980s, is preferred over MV replacement, and currently, more and more patients benefit from successful valve repair operations. However, whether to replace or repair severe MR, remains a controversial topic. Previously, the majority of surgeons believed that MV repair was of low surgical risk, with few near and long-term adverse events, and offered optimal survival environment and quality of life; therefore, and given its ability to preserve the heart's natural structure intact and achieve optimal cardiac functional reserve, it became the preferred surgical treatment modality for mitral valve disease. However, there are still questions about the durability of mitral valve repair due to conceptual, technical, and real-world limitations. Moreover, recent data comparing MV repair and replacement failed to demonstrate superiority of MR repair in ischemic MR patients. Altogether, these findings challenge the benefits and the superiority of MV repair over replacement.

The etiology of MR is heterogeneous and may lead to outcome bias after valve surgery. There are many causes of MR, including rheumatic fever, coronary heart disease, congenital valve malformations, and mitral valve degeneration. In addition, ischemic mitral valve insufficiency is a complex condition, with several associated issues as the need for revascularization, susceptibility to comorbid ventricular wall tumors or myocardial scars, and severe left heart dysfunction. In this study, we selected studies that included patients with non-ischemic mitral valve insufficiency. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis comparing clinical results of isolated MV surgery in patients with non-ischemic MR (NIMR).

Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) medical therapy — In symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with severe primary MR and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (Stages C2 and D) in whom surgery is not possible or must be delayed, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for systolic dysfunction is reasonable. In asymptomatic patients with primary MR and normal LV systolic function (Stages B and C1), vasodilator therapy is not indicated if the patient is normotensive.
