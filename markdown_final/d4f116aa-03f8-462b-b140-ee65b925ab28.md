## Question

octreotide in non-variceal GI bleed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether octreotide has a role in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and how to apply the evidence clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that distinguishes non-variceal from variceal bleeding. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about octreotide in non-variceal bleeding. Next, I will review direct clinical evidence for or against octreotide in non-variceal bleeding. After that, I need to consider any plausible but unproven scenarios where octreotide might still be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and dosing context for when octreotide is and is not appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic distinction, because mechanism matters for drug choice. Non-variceal upper GI bleeding is typically driven by mucosal ulceration, erosions, or arterial lesions where acid injury and vessel exposure are central, whereas variceal bleeding reflects elevated portal pressure and collaterals where splanchnic vasoconstriction lowers inflow and variceal pressure; octreotide's clinically meaningful effect is portal pressure reduction, not ulcer healing or acid suppression, so its mechanism does not obviously address the drivers of non-variceal bleeding [^114zZw6h].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. Hold on, let me verify the AGA update on non-variceal bleeding: it explicitly states that use of octreotide is not recommended in non-variceal upper GI bleeding, and that prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated either, which directly answers the question for routine cases [^114evqZF]. I should also confirm ACG guidance: for non-variceal ulcer bleeding, the emphasis is on early endoscopy with hemostasis and high-dose PPI therapy, with no role for octreotide in this pathway, reinforcing that recommendation [^115XebaE]. For completeness, I need to check the variceal side: multiple high-credibility sources endorse vasoactive agents like octreotide for suspected variceal hemorrhage, underscoring that the indication is portal hypertensive bleeding, not non-variceal etiologies [^111PEAPB] [^115aVUFf].

> Now, I will examine direct evidence in non-variceal bleeding. A retrospective cohort of 180 patients with non-variceal upper GI bleeding found no differences in hospital or ICU length of stay, rebleeding, or mortality when octreotide was added to PPI compared with PPI alone, suggesting no added benefit in routine non-variceal cases [^115BaWxM]. Wait, let me verify older randomized data as well: a prospective randomized trial of 110 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers showed no significant differences in rebleeding, surgery, mortality, transfusion requirements, or hospital stay with octreotide as adjunct to endoscopic therapy, aligning with the notion of no clinical advantage in this setting [^113DLdWi]. I should also note that a debate piece acknowledged uncertainty and cost concerns, but this is low-credibility opinion and does not overturn negative or neutral trial data and guidelines [^1167PeBM].

> But wait, what if there are edge cases where portal hypertensive physiology contributes despite a non-variceal label. Let me consider portal hypertensive gastropathy, which can bleed and is mechanistically responsive to portal pressure–lowering therapy. AASLD suggests vasoactive therapy such as octreotide can be considered for acute PHG bleeding, and that NSBBs are used for prevention, which is a niche where octreotide may be reasonable despite the general non-variceal category [^114rZFGp]. I should also double-check small-bowel angiodysplasia and obscure bleeding: long-acting somatostatin analogs have been used as palliative therapy to reduce transfusion needs in refractory cases, though this is off-label and supported by low-quality evidence, so it is not a blanket endorsement for acute non-variceal upper GI bleeding management [^112H5ovG] [^111sc6Po].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to ensure the practical algorithm is clear. For suspected non-variceal upper GI bleeding, the standard is prompt resuscitation, risk stratification, early endoscopy with hemostasis when indicated, and high-dose PPI therapy, with no routine role for octreotide; if there is uncertainty or suspicion of variceal bleeding, then octreotide should be started early alongside antibiotics, with endoscopy ideally within 12–24 hours to confirm the source and deliver definitive therapy, which is a different pathway entirely [^114evqZF] [^115XebaE] [^111PEAPB]. I should confirm dosing context for completeness: when octreotide is indicated for variceal bleeding, typical practice is a 50 mcg IV bolus followed by 50 mcg/h infusion for 2–5 days, but that regimen is not a recommendation for non-variceal bleeding in the absence of portal hypertensive physiology [^115i7KMC] [^1119ewtb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence and guidelines. Octreotide is not recommended for routine non-variceal upper GI bleeding because the pathophysiology does not align with its mechanism, high-quality guidelines advise against its use in this setting, and available clinical studies show no added benefit over standard care; reserve octreotide for suspected or confirmed portal hypertensive bleeding, including PHG, and avoid its routine use in straightforward peptic ulcer or other non-variceal sources where PPI-based therapy and endoscopic hemostasis are the evidence-based cornerstones [^114evqZF] [^115XebaE] [^115BaWxM] [^113DLdWi].

---

Octreotide is **not recommended for routine use** in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) because it does not improve clinically meaningful outcomes such as rebleeding, mortality, or hospital stay [^114evqZF] [^115BaWxM]. It may be considered only in **select cases of refractory bleeding** from diffuse mucosal vascular ectasias or angiodysplasia when standard endoscopic and medical therapies fail, but evidence is limited and use should be individualized [^111sc6Po] [^112H5ovG]. Routine use in NVUGIB is not supported by guidelines or robust evidence; **high-dose PPI remains the cornerstone of medical therapy** [^114evqZF] [^115XebaE].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to NVUGIB

Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, **reduces splanchnic blood flow** and inhibits secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, including gastrin, which decreases gastric acid secretion [^114zZw6h]. These effects are beneficial in variceal bleeding by lowering portal pressure and reducing gastric acid, but in NVUGIB — typically caused by peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis, or Mallory-Weiss tears — the primary pathophysiology involves mucosal injury and acid-mediated damage rather than portal hypertension [^112Yagkg]. Thus, the pharmacologic rationale for octreotide in NVUGIB is limited compared with variceal bleeding [^114evqZF].

---

## Clinical evidence for octreotide in NVUGIB

Several studies have evaluated octreotide in NVUGIB, but **evidence does not support routine use**:

- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**: In 110 patients with active or recent peptic ulcer bleeding, octreotide as adjunct to endoscopic therapy showed no significant benefit in rebleeding, surgery, or mortality compared with placebo [^113DLdWi].

- **Retrospective cohort study**: In 180 patients with NVUGIB, adding octreotide to PPI infusion did not reduce hospital stay, ICU stay, rebleeding, or mortality compared with PPI alone [^115BaWxM].

- **Meta-analyses**: No meta-analyses demonstrate significant benefit of octreotide in NVUGIB regarding rebleeding, mortality, or need for surgery.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Major society guidelines **do not recommend routine use** of octreotide in NVUGIB:

- **American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)**: Recommends against routine use of octreotide in NVUGIB; high-dose PPI is the standard medical therapy [^114evqZF].

- **American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)**: Emphasizes high-dose PPI as the cornerstone of medical therapy for NVUGIB, with no role for octreotide in routine management [^115XebaE].

- **Asia-Pacific Working Group**: Does not recommend octreotide for NVUGIB management [^notfound].

---

## Potential benefits and limitations

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced transfusion requirements** in select refractory cases (e.g. diffuse vascular ectasias), though evidence is limited [^112H5ovG]. It may also provide temporary hemostasis as a bridge to definitive endoscopic or interventional therapy in refractory bleeding [^113EjU33].

---

### Limitations

Limitations include **lack of proven benefit**, with no consistent improvement in rebleeding, mortality, or hospital stay in clinical trials [^113DLdWi]. Cost and resource utilization are higher than standard therapy without added benefit, and adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset, bradycardia, and hyperglycemia may occur, particularly with prolonged use.

---

## Comparison with standard therapies

| **Therapy** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High-dose PPI | High | Strongly recommended | Reduces rebleeding, surgery, and mortality [^112xWyp1] |
| Octreotide | Moderate | Not recommended routinely | No consistent benefit in NVUGIB [^113DLdWi] [^115BaWxM] |
| Endoscopic therapy | High | Strongly recommended | Reduces rebleeding and mortality [^notfound] |
| Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) | Moderate | Alternative for refractory cases | Effective in refractory NVUGIB [^112xWyp1] |

---

## Specific clinical scenarios for octreotide use

Octreotide may be considered in **select scenarios**:

- **Refractory bleeding**: Diffuse mucosal vascular ectasias or angiodysplasia unresponsive to standard endoscopic and medical therapy [^111sc6Po].

- **Bridge therapy**: Temporary control of bleeding pending definitive endoscopic or interventional radiology procedures [^115aVUFf].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Individualized use based on patient characteristics and clinician judgment, recognizing limited evidence [^113A8nA2].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Octreotide is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects include**:

- **Gastrointestinal**: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.

- **Cardiovascular**: Bradycardia, arrhythmias.

- **Metabolic**: Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia.

- **Injection site reactions**: Pain, irritation.

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Routine use of octreotide in NVUGIB is **not cost-effective** given its higher cost than standard therapy and lack of proven clinical benefit. Its use should be reserved for select refractory cases where potential benefits outweigh costs.

---

Octreotide is **not recommended for routine use** in NVUGIB due to lack of proven benefit. It may be considered in select refractory cases, but evidence is limited and use should be individualized. High-dose PPI remains the cornerstone of medical therapy for NVUGIB [^114Lkmqj] [^115XebaE].

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^116iTGCd]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive drug regimens are detailed as follows. Octreotide (somatostatin analogue): 50 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 50 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Somatostatin: 250 μg IV bolus, followed by continuous IV infusion at 250–500 μg/h; additional IV boluses can be given in case of ongoing bleeding; duration 2–5 d. Terlipressin (vasopressin analogue): Initial 48 h: 2 mg IV every 4 h until bleeding is controlled; Maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 h; duration 2–5 d. Although terlipressin has been evaluated for AVH and is one of the standard regimens outside of the United States, the FDA label does not include this indication.

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

### Lack of difference among terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide in the control of acute gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^113MNNYX]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Vasoactive drugs are recommended to be started as soon as possible in suspected variceal bleeding, even before diagnostic endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the therapeutic efficacies of the various vasoactive drugs used are comparable. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial was to characterize the effects of terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide when they are initiated before endoscopic treatment in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Patients with liver cirrhosis and significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomly assigned to receive early administration of terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide, followed by endoscopic treatment. Patients with nonvariceal bleeding were excluded after endoscopy. The primary endpoint was 5-day treatment success, defined as control of bleeding without rescue treatment, rebleeding, or mortality, with a noninferiority margin of 0.1. In total, 780 patients with variceal bleeding were enrolled: 261 in the terlipressin group; 259 in the somatostatin group; and 260 in the octreotide group. At the time of initial endoscopy, active bleeding was noted in 43.7%, 44.4%, and 43.5% of these patients, respectively (P = 0.748), and treatment success was achieved by day 5 in 86.2%, 83.4%, and 83.8% (P = 0.636), with similar rates of control of bleeding without rescue treatment (89.7%, 87.6%, and 88.1%; P = 0.752), rebleeding (3.4%, 4.8%, and 4.4%; P = 0.739), or mortality (8.0%, 8.9%, and 8.8%; P = 0.929). The absolute values of the lower bound of confidence intervals for terlipressin versus somatostatin, terlilpressin versus octreotide, and octreotide versus somatostatin were 0.095, 0.090, and 0.065, respectively.

Conclusion

Hemostatic effects and safety did not differ significantly between terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide as adjuvants to endoscopic treatment in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding.

### Pro / con debate: octreotide has an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin? [^1167PeBM]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Whether it is the primary reason for admission or a complication of critical illness, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is commonly encountered in the intensive care unit. In this setting, in the absence of endoscopy, intensivists generally provide supportive care (transfusion of blood products) and acid suppression (such as proton pump inhibitors). More recently, octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) has been used in such patients. However, its precise role in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not necessarily clear and the drug is associated with significant costs. In this issue of Critical Care, two expert teams debate the merits of using octreotide in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m 2] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70–90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Somatostatin, somatostatin analogues and other vasoactive drugs in the treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices [^115bEw51]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Somatostatin and its analogues have been compared with a variety of other treatments for the treatment of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Meta-analyses of studies comparing somatostatin or octreotide with vasopressin or terlipressin have shown that somatostatin is somewhat superior to vasopressin and equivalent to terlipressin in controlling bleeding and has significantly fewer side effects; no difference in mortality was observed. Octreotide was somewhat better than vasopressin and terlipressin in controlling bleeding, with similar mortality. Meta-analysis of trials comparing somatostatin or octreotide with endoscopic sclerotherapy shows that both drugs are equivalent to sclerotherapy for bleeding control, early rebleeding and survival. Complications are much less frequent with drug treatment. Nine trials have compared endoscopic therapy with therapeutic regimens combining endoscopic treatment with somatostatin, octreotide or vapreotide. Meta-analysis show that the combined regimens increase the 5 days bleeding control rate of endoscopic treatments by over 20%, although there is no difference in mortality. Comparisons of somatostatin and octreotide with combined regimens of sclerotherapy + somatostatin and sclerotherapy + octreotide have shown that the combined regimens were better than drug treatments alone in controlling bleeding and preventing early rebleeding, while complications were significantly less frequent with drug therapy.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension: new lights on old horizon [^111SyMUD]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

New clinical, endoscopic, and imaging modalities for diagnosing varices and predicting bleeding are being investigated. Transnasal endoscopy and ultrathin battery-powered esophagoscopes are being used to improve patient comfort and compliance. Patients who respond to portal pressure-reducing drugs not only have a reduced risk of bleeding, but also a reduced risk of developing other complications, with improved survival. Nitrates have been shown to have no definite role in primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding. The hemodynamic response to treatment has an independent prognostic value for the risk of variceal bleeding. Newer drugs have been investigated for reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient, but with little success. Survival after bleeding has increased due to improved patient care and technological advances. Combined radiographic and endoscopic management of gastric varices is evolving and appears to be promising. Nonvariceal bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is increasingly being recognized as a potential cause of bleeding in patients with portal hypertension, and pharmacotherapy with octreotide appears to be promising for the treatment of this condition. Variceal band ligation in children has been found to be as safe and effective as in adults.

### The effect of octreotide as an adjunct treatment in active nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113DLdWi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to determine the effect ofoctreotide on active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding from benign peptic ulcers.

Study

This is a prospective, randomized study including 110 patients with gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers presenting with active spurting or oozing bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessel. All patients were subjected to endoscopic hemostasis by injection of noradrenaline, and they were then randomized to either receive octreotide (55 patients) or placebo (55 patients). The groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, previous history of ulcer or bleeding, Helicobacter pylori infection, site, and severity of bleeding.

Results

The rebleeding rate was 36% in placebo and 32% in octreotide group, which does not present a statistically significant difference. Surgical intervention was required for 18 patients (32.7%) in the placebo group and for 16 patients (29%) in the octreotide group. The mortality rate was 2 patients (3.6%) in the placebo and 4 patients (7.2%) in the octreotide group. All the above presented no statistical difference. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the number of blood units transfused and hospital stay.

Conclusions

The use of octreotide as an adjunct treatment in patients with acutely bleeding benign peptic ulcer or/and visible vessel did not seem to offer significant benefits regarding their outcome.

### Octreotide for acute variceal bleeding [^113EjU33]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the use o f octreotide for acute variceal bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were obtained through computerized searches involving MEDLINE (from 1997 to October 2000). Additionally, several textbooks containing information on the diagnosis and management of acute variceal bleeding were reviewed. The bibliographies of retrieved publications and textbooks were reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection

All randomized studies and pharmacoeconomic evaluations that used octreotide therapy for acute variceal bleeding were considered. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses involving other therapies for treating variceal bleeding were also reviewed for possible inclusion.

Data Extraction

The primary outcomes extracted from the literature were persistent or recurrent bleeding, need for endoscopic intervention or balloon tamponade, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Although both endoscopic therapies and medications are used to control bleeding and rebleeding episodes, the endoscopic approach has the additional goal of obliterating the varix. Since rebleeding episodes are common as long as the varix is present, endoscopic and medication therapies cannot be considered interchangeable based on bleeding control alone. However, octreotide by continuous intravenous infusion has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements as both an initial intervention (until definitive sclerotherapy can be performed) or as adjunctive therapy to endoscopic measures. Octreotide can be started quickly, has a relatively rapid onset of action, and does not require someone with endoscopy training to initiate. Additionally, octreotide is relatively free of significant adverse effects.

Conclusions

While additional investigations are needed, particularly in the area of pharmacoeconomics, there is substantial evidence that octreotide is an efficacious therapy with relatively few adverse effects when used in the management of acute variceal bleeding.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^112TBySt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^114q2EUV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of variceal hemorrhage, vasoactive agents, ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend to administer octreotide in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage and continue for 3–5 days after endoscopy if variceal hemorrhage is confirmed.

### Octreotide for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^115gkiZN]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Studies of octreotide have not demonstrated a consistent benefit in efficacy or safety compared with conventional therapies. This study statistically pooled existing trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide for esophageal variceal hemorrhage.

Methods

We identified randomized trials of octreotide for variceal hemorrhage from computerized databases, scientific meeting abstracts, and the manufacturer of octreotide. Blinded reviewers abstracted the data, and a meta-analysis was performed.

Results

Octreotide improved control of esophageal variceal hemorrhage compared with all alternative therapies combined (relative risk [RR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.77); vasopressin/terlipressin (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42–0.81); or no additional intervention/placebo (among patients that received initial sclerotherapy/banding before randomization) (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32–0.67). Octreotide had comparable efficacy to immediate sclerotherapy for control of bleeding (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.55–1.62), fewer major complications than vasopressin/terlipessin (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11–0.87), and a complication profile comparable to no intervention/placebo (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72–1.55). No specific alternative therapy demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Conclusions

These results favor octreotide over vasopressin/terlipressin in the control of esophageal variceal bleeding and suggest it is a safe and effective adjunctive therapy after variceal obliteration techniques. Trials are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of octreotide treatment.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^112VKKuV]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

The two major classes of drugs that have been used in the control of acute variceal bleeding are vasopressin or its analogues (either alone or in combination with nitroglycerine) and somatostatin or its analogues. Terlipressin is the only agent that has been shown to reduce mortality in placebo-controlled trials. However, in trials comparing terlipressin, somatostatin and octreotide, no difference in efficacy was identified in a systematic reviewand in a recent large RCT. Prophylactic antibiotics can result in a similar survival benefit following acute variceal bleeding.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin reduces portal blood flow, portal systemic collateral blood flow and variceal pressure. It does, however, have significant systemic side effects such as an increase in peripheral resistance, and reduction in cardiac output, heart rate and coronary blood flow. In comparison with no active treatment, the pooled results of four randomised trials showed that it reduced failure to control variceal bleeding (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.43), although survival was unaffected. Meta-analysis of five trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin has shown a significant effect on reduction in failure to control bleeding (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97), with no effect on survival.

Vasopressin with nitroglycerine

The addition of nitroglycerine enhances the effect of vasopressin on portal pressure and reduces cardiovascular side effects. Meta-analysis of three randomised trials comparing vasopressin alone with vasopressin and nitroglycerine showed that the combination was associated with a significant reduction in failure to control bleeding (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72), although no survival benefit was shown.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^1141sshX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis

Guidance Statement 1. Terlipressin is recommended for the treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is one of serious complications of liver cirrhosis, and gastroesophageal varices are the most common source of gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. Terlipressin has been recommended as the first-line treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding. – In 1990, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for the first time explored the role of terlipressin for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Sixty patients were assigned to terlipressin (n = 29) and placebo (n = 31) groups. The rate of control bleeding was significantly higher in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving placebo (90% versus 59%, p < 0.01). Since then, several studies have also confirmed the efficacy of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding. Recently, a meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 3344 cases compared the efficacy and safety of terlipressin versus placebo, pituitrin, somatostatin, octreotide, endoscopic therapy, or balloon tamponade for the management of acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. Patients receiving terlipressin had a significantly higher rate of control bleeding and a lower mortality than those receiving placebo, but were not significantly different from those receiving pituitrin, somatostatin, or octreotide. The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in patients receiving terlipressin than those receiving pituitrin [odds ratio (OR) R = 0.15, p = 0.02], but higher than those receiving somatostatin (OR = 2.44, p = 0.04). Terlipressin alone had significantly higher 5-day treatment failure than endoscopic variceal ligation plus terlipressin (OR = 14.46, p = 0.01). Terlipressin group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality than balloon tamponade group (OR = 0.05, p < 0.01). In addition, terlipressin in combination with octreotide or somatostatin did not further reduce portal pressure. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend that the dosage of terlipressin is 2 mg/4 h by intravenous boluses for 2–5 days. Notably, recent evidence suggested that continuous infusion of terlipressin could reduce portal pressure stably and increase treatment success rate. Considering the use of terlipressin in our clinical practice, we recommend that the initial dosage of terlipressin is 1–2 mg/4 h by slowly intravenous boluses (> 1 min) or continuously intravenous infusion and that the maintenance dosage is 1–2 mg/6 h by continuously intravenous infusion. Generally, the maximum daily dosage is 120–150 μg/kg, and its duration is 3–5 days. Certainly, the dosage and duration of terlipressin can be adjusted according to the severity of variceal bleeding and patients' conditions.

### Changing compliance to the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage: a regional survey [^117KcpfG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

In mid-1997 the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) published guidelines for the management of varices. The aim of this study is to assess the change in regional practice patterns between early 1997 (preguidelines) and 2000 (postguidelines).

Methods

Gastroenterologists in Oregon and Southwestern Washington state were sent a self-reporting questionnaire regarding the management of varices in March 1997 (prior to the publication of the guidelines) and again in August 2000.

Results

Fifty-seven of 75 (76%) and 68 of 92 (74%) of the surveys were completed in 1997 and 2000, respectively. Fifty to 60% of the respondents saw between three and five cirrhotic patients per month. Significantly, more respondents followed the guidelines to screen and treat large varices to prevent initial variceal hemorrhage in 2000 than in 1997, 54% versus 18% (p < 0.005). Of the respondents who performed screening of EGDs, the majority treated large varices with beta-blocker therapy (93% in 1997 and 97% in 2000). All respondents used early endoscopy to treat variceal bleeding. Significantly, most of the respondents began pharmacologic therapy prior to endoscopy if active variceal hemorrhage was suspected (with most choosing octreotide) in 2000 than in 1997, 83% versus 56% (p < 0.005). The majority of the respondents pursued repeat endoscopic therapy after cessation of the initial variceal bleeding episode (96% in 1997 and 95% in 2000), and most performed surveillance EGD once the varices had been eradicated (72% in 1997 and 79% in 2000).

Conclusions

After the publication of the ACG guidelines, significantly more gastroenterologists screened for varices to prevent initial variceal hemorrhage and significantly more used pharmacologic therapy prior to endoscopic treatment for variceal hemorrhage.

Acute variceal hemorrhage — vasoactive agents and dosing are outlined, and only one of these four agents should be used. Octreotide is given as an initial IV bolus of 50 micrograms (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous IV infusion of 50 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Vasopressin is delivered as a continuous IV infusion 0.2–0.4 U/min; can be increased to 0.8 U/min, and it should always be accompanied by IV nitroglycerin at a starting dose of 40 μg/min, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 μg/min, adjusted to maintain a systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, with a duration of 24 hours. SMT (somatostatin) is given as an initial IV bolus 250 μg (can be repeated in the first hour if ongoing bleeding) and a continuous IV infusion of 250–500 μg/hr for 2–5 days. Terlipressin dosing is initial 48 hours: 2 mg IV every 4 hours until control of bleeding, then maintenance: 1 mg IV every 4 hours to prevent rebleeding for 2–5 days.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10 9 /L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

Other endoscopic measures

In an RCT, cyanoacrylate offered no benefit over VBL, with the additional risk of embolisation and trend towards increased rebleeding with cyanoacrylate.

Haemostatic powder (TC-325; Hemospray; Cook Medical, USA) has been described in a small study of nine patients who received endoscopic spray treatment for acute variceal bleeding. The study reported no rebleeding within 24 h and no mortality at 15 days.

Endoscopic therapy in combination with pharmacological therapy

The role of combining vasoactive drugs with endoscopic therapy (VBL or sclerotherapy) was reported in a meta-analysis of eight trials. Combination therapy resulted in better initial control of bleeding (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.23), and 5-day haemostasis (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.39), without any difference in survival. Adverse events were similar in both groups. Two RCTs have compared VBL with sclerotherapy in combination with vasoactive agents in acute variceal bleeding. Lo et al used vasopressin and found that VBL resulted in better 72 h haemostasis (97% vs 76%, p = 0.009), with fewer complications (5% vs 29%, p = 0.007). Villanueva et al used somatostatin, and reported lower failure to control acute bleeding with VBL (4% vs 15%, p = 0.02), with fewer serious complications (4% vs 13%, p = 0.04). Overall survival was similar in both trials.

Balloon tamponade

Balloon tamponade is highly effective and controls acute bleeding in up to 90% of patients although about 50% rebleed when the balloon is deflated. It is, however, associated with serious complications such as oesophageal ulceration and aspiration pneumonia in up to 15–20% of patients. Despite this, it may be a life-saving treatment in cases of massive uncontrolled variceal haemorrhage pending other forms of treatment. An appropriately placed Sengstaken–Blakemore tube allows for resuscitation, safe transportation and either repeat endoscopy or radiological shunting in a patient with a stable cardiovascular system. The oesophageal balloon is rarely required, must never be used on its own and should be used only if there is continuing bleeding despite an adequately inflated gastric balloon correctly placed and with appropriate tension. Placement of the tube endoscopically or over a guide wire might reduce the risk of complications, especially oesophageal rupture.

Drug treatment pre-endoscopy in suspected variceal bleeding

Antibiotic prophylaxis

Bacterial infections are identified in 35–66% of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleedingand patients with cirrhosis and UGIB are at increased risk of rebleeding and mortality. Empirical antibiotic treatment reduces this risk, with a meta-analysis of 12 trials and 1241 patients reporting reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.98), rebleeding (0.53, 0.38 to 0.74), and length of hospital stay. The choice of antibiotic should be determined by local resistance patterns and continued for up to seven days.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasopressors, including somatostatin, its analogue octreotide, and terlipressin, reduce portal pressures via splanchnic vasoconstriction. Two randomised controlled trials of 205 and 76 patients, have shown that these drugs improve bleeding control at the time of endoscopy (P = 0.012 and P = 0.034, respectively), reduce mortality and the need for rescue treatment in the first randomised controlled trial (P = 0.05), and reduce mortality at 15 days in the second randomised controlled trial (P = 0.035). No difference in control of bleeding has been identified between the different drugs. Current guidelines recommend commencing a vasoactive drug at presentation in suspected variceal bleeding with a suggested course of two to five days. Contraindications include cardiac or severe vascular disease.

### Bleeding caused by portal hypertension [^115fkhB2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the dreaded complications of portal hypertension. Patients who have suspected or proven cirrhosis should undergo diagnostic upper endoscopy to detect medium and large gastro-esophageal varices. Patients with medium and large gastro-esophageal varices should be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol), and these agents should be titrated to a heart rate of 55 beats per minute or adverse effects. If there are contraindications to or if patients are intolerant to beta-blockers, it is appropriate to consider prophylactic banding therapy for individuals with medium-to-large esophageal varices. When patients who have cirrhosis present with GI bleeding, they should be resuscitated and receive octreotide or other vasoactive agents. Endoscopy should be performed promptly to diagnose the source of bleeding and to provide endoscopic therapy (preferably banding). The currently available treatment for acute variceal bleeding provides hemostasis in most patients. These patients, however, are at significant risk for rebleeding unless secondary prophylaxis is provided. Although various pharmacological, endoscopic, radiological, and surgical options are available, combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy is the most common form of secondary prophylaxis. TIPS is a radiologically placed portasystemic shunt, and if placed in suitable patients, it can provide effective treatment for patients with variceal bleeding that is refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy.

Results

Twenty-nine patients were found to have presented with concomitant AVB and ACS over the study duration, predominantly male [19/29 (65.5%)] with a mean age of 58.7 ± 11.0 years. Twenty-five patients (86.0%), presented predominantly with UGB symptoms such as hematemesis and melena. Decompensated Cirrhosis was present in 19/29 (65.5%) patients and a total of 14/29 (48.3%) patients presented with Ascites, in which there was an equal distribution of 50% between mild-moderate and severe ascites. A majority of patients presented with NSTEMI [24/29 (82.8%)], followed by STEMI [5/29 (17.2%)]. Other baseline characteristics are presented in Tables 1 and 2. While patients were not administered Terlipressin secondary to the risk of Cardiovascular Ischemia, 24/29 (82.8%) patients received Octreotide (Somatostatin) as a complementary temporizing measure. Blood was also transfused to 27/29 (93.1%) patients, keeping a Hemoglobin threshold of < 10 for transfusion, with a median of 4.0 (1–14) units transfused; all patients then underwent a session of Esophageal Variceal Band Ligations (EVBL) at their initial admission.

M-H, Mantel-Haenszel; CI, confidence interval

In terms of trends, prior to the sensitivity analysis there were statistically insignificant trends towards increased rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality in the longer vasoactive duration group who underwent BL. Octreotide and somatostatin both had similar trends of increased rebleeding within 5 days associated with the longer treatment durations (Fig. 2A), with only 1 study pooled on each, whereas shortening terlipressin had no notable trend and more studies were pooled. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for all 14 studies, which revealed that 11 studies had some risk of bias. The sensitivity analysis, excluding studies with high CPCC distributions, revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations in patients who underwent BL. Conversely, including only studies with high-risk variceal features or high CPCC distribution revealed a trend towards more 5-day rebleeding and a trend towards greater mortality due to rebleeding at the EP.

### One versus five days of octreotide infusion for acute esophageal variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^112hJuyw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The optimal duration of octreotide infusion for esophageal variceal bleeding remains unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 1-day versus 5-day octreotide infusion combined with endoscopic therapy, with the primary outcome of early (5-day) re-bleeding under a non-inferiority framework and secondary outcomes of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

Methods

This nationwide, multicenter, non-inferiority, open-label, randomized, controlled trial included 220 patients with cirrhosis and acute esophageal variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic band ligation in five tertiary-care and three university-based hospitals across Thailand. They received a 1-day (n = 109) or 5-day (n = 111) regimen of continuous octreotide infusion after successful endoscopy. Re-bleeding, transfusion requirements, and mortality were assessed.

Results

The majority of participants were men (180/220), and the average age was 56 years. The 5-day re-bleeding (1.83% vs. 1.80%, p ≥ 0.99), 6-week re-bleeding (8.26% vs. 10.81%, p = 0.52), and 6-week all-cause mortality (5.50% vs. 6.31%, p = 0.80) rates were similar between the 1- and 5-day groups. The event-rate difference in early re-bleeding was 0.03%, indicating non-inferiority (95% CI, 3.50–3.56%). Patients in the 1-day group required significantly fewer blood transfusions and had a shorter time to oral diet and shorter hospital stay.

Conclusions

Following successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.

### Meta-analysis: efficacy of therapeutic regimens in ongoing variceal bleeding [^1148XoJo]. Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Variceal bleeding is a major cause of mortality in liver cirrhosis. Therapeutic options include medical (vasoconstrictive/vasoactive drugs) and endoscopic (sclerotherapy/ligation) treatments. Most studies evaluating acute esophageal bleeding have included patients with both ongoing and recent bleeding. Therefore therapeutic efficacy in ongoing bleeding may not have been adequately determined in these studies. A meta-analysis was performed for two reasons: first to compare directly the various treatments in the case of ongoing bleeding, as this would not be accomplished by a single trial, and secondly, to determine the success rates of each treatment option based on a larger number of patients.

Methods

An extensive Medline search identified 13 randomized controlled trials with precise statements of the number of patients with ongoing bleeding and their clinical outcomes. All studies followed a similar design and a Q test excluded heterogeneity of the studies. Data were pooled and cumulative success rates were calculated.

Results

Ligation appeared to be the most effective treatment (91.0%, 95% CI 82.4–96.3%); it was significantly more successful than vasoconstrictive treatment (vasopressin/terlipressin 68.7%, 61.7–75.2%; P < 0.002, chi-squared-test) or vasoactive treatment (somatostatin/octreotide, 75.9%, 68.1–82.6%; P < 0.02) treatment, but was not statistically better than sclerotherapy (81.1%, 71.7–88.4%). The latter therapy was not statistically superior to medical treatment options. Calculations of estimated true effects, which take into account the weight of each study, rendered similar results.

Conclusion

Ligation is the most effective treatment option. No significant difference was found between the efficacy of sclerotherapy and treatment with somatostatin or octreotide.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115fivdp]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Considerations

Patients with lesions found on endoscopy should be treated based on the appearance of the lesion. Lower-risk lesions should be treated medically. Higher-risk lesions should be treated with endoscopic intervention such as hemoclip or thermocoagulation. While there are no strict guidelines on the use of one modality over another, for Dieulafoy lesions, clinicians can consider the combined use of hemoclip and sclerosant injection for more definitive therapy, though there is not yet enough evidence to recommend this as standard therapy. Finally, Hemospray, a relatively novel mechanical hemostatic therapy, has some evidence to suggest it is a useful modality for non-variceal upper GI bleeding, especially in bleeding from wide-spread malignant lesions. However, even in jurisdictions where it is approved for use, consideration should be paid to more standard treatments first, until comparative trials of Hemospray to other modalities provides evidence for its non-inferiority or superiority compared to existing modalities.

### Response to the NCEPOD report: development of a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis-the first 24 H [^117VoWwe]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with suspected variceal bleeding, terlipressin (2 mg four times daily) should be administered intravenously as soon as possible to control bleeding. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that reduces portal pressure by inducing splanchnic vasoconstriction and has been shown to improve control of bleeding, as well as reduce all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis and with variceal bleeding. Significant adverse events with terlipressin are uncommon, but because of its vasoconstrictor activity it should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and those older than 65 years of age, making a baseline ECG mandatory. For patients who have a contraindication to terlipressin (or if terlipressin is unavailable), a continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide is an alternative. Once patients have been adequately resuscitated, endoscopy should be performed at the earliest opportunity (ideally within 6–12 h, but not more than 24 h) to determine the cause of bleeding and perform endotherapy as indicated. Bacterial infections, particularly SBP, are common in patients with cirrhosis in the first 7 days post-GI bleeding, occurring in 25%–65% of patients. Prophylaxis with antibiotics post-GI bleed have been shown to reduce short-term mortality, as well as the risk of rebleeding, septicaemia and SBP. It is, therefore, recommended that patients with cirrhosis and GI bleeding (variceal and non-variceal) receive prophylaxis with a broad spectrum antibiotic, such as cefotaxime or co-amoxiclav, as per hospital protocol, as soon as possible. Patients with advanced cirrhosis (any two of the following: ascites, severe malnutrition, encephalopathy or jaundice) are at highest risk of developing infection and should receive the antibiotics intravenously. Importantly, there appears to be no increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for variceal bleeding compared with the hospital medical population.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — guidance statements 48–51 outline management: Patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and should therefore be considered for prophylactic nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) to prevent decompensation; this intervention may also prevent hemorrhagic complications or iron-deficiency anemia from severe PHG. In acute bleeding from severe PHG, vasoactive therapy (e.g., somatostatin, somatostatin analogs such as octreotide, or terlipressin if available) for 2–5 days at doses used for variceal bleeding should be considered. NSBB are recommended to prevent rebleeding from PHG and PH-related polyps. If bleeding from PHG becomes transfusion-dependent despite NSBB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement should be considered.

The UK variceal bleed guidelines recommend administering terlipressin or somatostatin as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, for up to 5 days or until attainment of haemostasis, with octreotide as an alternative. The efficacy of intravenous terlipressin in variceal bleeding has been presented in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 1609). Seven studies (n = 443) compared terlipressin to placebo, of which five were considered to be high quality. This showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared with placebo (34% relative risk reduction), improved haemostasis and reduced transfusion requirement. Similar results were found in an updated meta-analysis in 2012. A more recent multicentre RCT (n = 780) reported non-inferiority of terlipressin compared with octreotide and somatostatin, with no difference in outcomes of haemorrhage control, rebleeding and mortality. The BSG/BASL cirrhosis bundle suggests caution in patients with known ischaemic heart disease or peripheral vascular disease and mandatory ECG assessment in patients aged over 65 years.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117TF9Cu]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Management of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding — NSBBs may be used for primary or secondary variceal bleeding prophylaxis, with propranolol favored in pregnancy, and EVL is preferred for medium or large esophageal varices and should continue until obliteration of varices. For active variceal hemorrhage, immediate resuscitation and stabilization of the mother and emergent endoscopic therapy are required; octreotide or somatostatin should also be initiated, but terlipressin should be avoided because it can cause uterine contractions and reduce uterine blood flow. For antibiotic prophylaxis in acute variceal bleeding, cephalosporins are preferred due to favorable pregnancy and lactation safety data. Options for recurrent or gastric variceal bleeding include cyanoacrylate with or without coiling depending on center expertise, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been used with success as rescue therapy for uncontrolled GEV bleeding and for decompression of abdominal wall varices before cesarean section when vaginal delivery was contraindicated. Secondary prophylaxis for variceal bleeding includes use of NSBBs and EVL, with the combination preferred.

### Terlipressin vs. octreotide in bleeding esophageal varices as an adjuvant therapy with endoscopic band ligation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^116ba79t]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Data are scarce on the head-to-head efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic management of variceal bleed. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of terlipressin with octreotide as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic variceal band ligation in patients with esophageal variceal bleeding.

Methods

Cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleed were randomized on admission to receive terlipressin (group A) or octreotide (group B) along with the placebo in the other arm in a double-blind fashion. The two groups were compared for efficacy, safety, overall survival, and length of hospital stay. "Control of variceal bleed" was the measure of efficacy of terlipressin and octreotide. Factors predicting length of stay were also assessed.

Results

A total of 324 patients were enrolled; 163 in the terlipressin group (group A) and 161 in the octreotide group (group B). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable for age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis, hemoglobin at presentation, and Child-Pugh class, except that active bleed was seen during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the time of enrollment in 26 (16%) and 41 (25.5%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.034). Overall sixteen patients died (three failure to control bleed and thirteen from causes other than variceal bleed); nine in group A (5.5%) and seven (4.3%) in group B (P = 0.626). In the intention to treat analysis, "control of variceal bleed" was noted in 305 patients (94.13%); 151 (92.63%) patients in group A and 154 (95.6%) patients in group B (confidence interval: 0.219–1.492). Packed cell transfusions in group A were 3.7 ± 2.3 units, whereas in group B there were 3.9 ± 2.5 units (P = 0.273). Length of hospital stay in groups A and B was 108.40 ± 34.81 and 126.39 ± 47.45 h, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). No cardiovascular side effects were observed in either group. High pulse, low hemoglobin, prothrombin time, blood in nasogastric aspirate, and portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) were predictors of prolonged hospital stay.

Conclusions

The efficacy of terlipressin was not inferior to octreotide as an adjuvant therapy for the control of esophageal variceal bleed and in-hospital survival. The length of hospital stay in the terlipressin group was significantly shorter but not of any clinical importance. The predictors of prolonged hospital stay were low hemoglobin, high pulse, prolonged prothrombin time, blood at nasogastric aspirate, and PSE.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^116sczUY]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

Somatostatin and octreotide

Somatostatin causes selective splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduces portal pressure and portal blood flow. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue. The mechanism of action of these two agents is not clear. Inhibition of glucagon increases vasodilatation rather than a direct vasoconstrictive effect and post-prandial gut hyperaemia is also reduced. The actions of octreotide on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics are transient, making continuous infusion necessary. Octreotide is given as a 50 μg bolus followed by an infusion of 25–50 μg/h. Somatostatin is given as a 250 mg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mg/h. Somatostatin and octreotide have been shown to be as effective as terlipressin in acute variceal bleeding in a meta-analysis. Seo et al in a large RCT of 780 patients comparing these three agents failed to show a difference in treatment success (range 83.8–86.2%), rebleeding (range 3.4–4.4%) and mortality (range 8–8.8%). A low systolic blood pressure at presentation, high serum creatinine level, active bleeding in the emergency endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding and Child–Pugh grade C were independent factors predicting 5-day treatment failure.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics that provide Gram-negative cover are one of the interventions which positively influence survival in variceal haemorrhage as shown in a Cochrane meta-analysis of 12 placebo-controlled trials (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). Antibiotics were also shown to reduce bacterial infections (RR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97) and early rebleeding (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74). Therefore, short-term antibiotics should be considered standard practice in all cirrhotic patients who have a variceal bleed, irrespective of the presence of confirmed infection. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (1 g IV, daily), have been shown to be more effective at reducing Gram-negative sepsis than oral norfloxacin, but choice of antibiotics must be dictated by local resistance patterns and availability.

### Variceal bleeding and portal hypertension: much to learn, much to explore [^114VCAzX]. Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

The newer diagnostic and therapeutic options continue to evolve and important developments have been made in the field of variceal bleeding and portal hypertension. A meeting was held at Baveno to update consensus on different terminologies in relation to portal hypertension. beta-blockers continue to be the mainstay for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is fast emerging as a strong contender. The role of vasoactive drugs in the management of variceal bleeding was assessed. Octreotide and terlipressin were shown to be as effective as sclerotherapy in achieving initial hemostasis, and octreotide was shown to be safe and efficacious in the prevention of rebleeding. EVL was superior to endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) for obliteration of esophageal varices. Sequential and simultaneous ligation and sclerotherapy were more effective than ligation alone, in reducing the recurrence rate after variceal obliteration. For gastric varices, cyanoacrylate glue continues to be the first line of treatment, and band ligation is being assessed further. Bleeding ectopic varices were dealt by appropriate endoscopic means. Endosonography has developed strongly in the assessment of variceal eradication and prediction of variceal recurrence. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) significantly reduces rebleeding rates compared to EVL.

### Descriptive analysis of common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients in kerman: a study from 2022 to 2023 [^111p89AP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management strategies in our study adhered to current best practices, emphasizing fluid resuscitation, pharmacological interventions, and endoscopic therapy. Blood transfusions were required in 31.67% of patients, particularly those with variceal bleeding and severe erosive disease. This aligns with recent guidelines, which advocate for transfusion in cases of significant hemoglobin depletion (< 8 g/dL) and hemodynamic instability. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) remain the cornerstone of pharmacological management for non-variceal bleeding, while vasoactive drugs like octreotide are essential for variceal bleeding, despite their off-label use in children.

Strengths and limitations

This study provides valuable region-specific data on pediatric UGIB, addressing a significant gap in the literature. The comprehensive inclusion of all eligible cases over a two-year period enhances the reliability of our findings. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. The retrospective design and reliance on medical records may introduce selection bias or incomplete data. Additionally, the single-center nature of the study limits the generalizability of the results to other regions. The relatively small sample size, particularly in certain age groups, reduces the statistical power to detect meaningful differences in UGIB etiology. Furthermore, the lack of follow-up data prevents assessment of long-term outcomes, such as recurrence rates or the efficacy of management strategies.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^116EgERE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of medical therapy is to reduce splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure. Drugs currently in use are vasopressin, somatostatin, and terlipressin. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs lowers portal pressure and potentially offers the endoscopist a clearer field to work in and it is the only non-invasive treatment for non-esophagogastric variceal sites of bleeding related to portal hypertension. There are no trials available regarding the use of these vasoactive drugs for the treatment of bleeding ARV, but these drugs are clearly beneficial when used for acute bleeding from gastro-esophageal varices and therefore can be considered for use in bleeding ARV. Vasopressin has a short half-life and should be given as a continuous iv infusion; furthermore, vasopressin has relevant side effects related to the important systemic vasoconstriction that could lead to mesenteric or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, vasopressin is not often used also because Terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analog with a longer half-life and less adverse effects, is effective in bleeding control and has a positive impact on survival. Both somatostatin and octreotide (a synthetic analog of somatostatin with longer half-life) have a good safety profile, and somatostatin is as effective as vasopressin in control of variceal bleeding. A literature review by Biecker analyzed all the studies regarding the use of these drugs for the medical treatment of acute bleeding from esophageal varices and concluded that the available data is most convincing for terlipressin; however, the direct comparison of terlipressin and octreotide revealed no superiority of terlipressin. All the studies mentioned so far regard bleeding from esophageal varices, we can try to extend these indications to the varices of other districts of the body, but the grade of recommendations is necessarily weak and further studies are needed to define the best medical approach to bleeding ARV.

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^114NBxKg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medico-surgical emergency. Although there has been a global decline in the mortality associated with UGIB, the incidence and mortality associated with GI bleeding remains high in limited income countries. In the United States, UGIB accounts for 300,000 admissions per year with approximately 5% mortality rate, whereas in several studies from sub-Saharan Africa, mortality ranges from 6 to 30%. It is not clear if the higher mortality seen in low and middle income countries (LIMC's) is due to patient demographics, severity on presentation, etiology or compliance with care standards. Esophageal varices has been implicated as the most common cause of UGIB in several African studies. Rather than being due to alcoholic liver disease as in high income countries (HIC's), varices in sub-Saharan Africa result from Schistosoma-related portal hypertension. This is in contrast to HIC where erosive gastritis has been commonly implicated. Other potential contributors to the higher mortality may be the severity of disease presentation, as there is little primary care in these settings, and many patients seek care very late in their disease.

Another potential contributor is failure to treat patients in accordance with management guidelines. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for those with suspected Non-variceal UGIB (NVUGIB), somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and antibiotics in suspected cases of variceal UGIB (VUGIB) and in those with clinical suspicion of liver disease, timely blood transfusion and early use of endoscopy may not occur in these settings due to lack of appropriate specialists, lack of resources or supply chain issues. A knowledge gap on the current UGIB management guidelines and recommendations amongst the health care providers may also contribute to inadequate management of UGIB cases. Prior studies in Tanzania studies demonstrate lack of appropriate care offered to patients with UGIB. Nearly half of the patients in one the studies did not receive endoscopic evaluation and treatment whereas 47.1% of the patients who required blood transfusion, did not receive blood transfusion in another study.

### Emergency sclerotherapy versus medical interventions for bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhotic patients [^114Bo6t5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency sclerotherapy is widely used as a first line therapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, although pharmacological treatment may stop bleeding in the majority of patients.

Objectives

To assess whether emergency sclerotherapy is superior to pharmacological treatment for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Electronic and manual searches were combined until April 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive treatments (vasopressin (plus minus nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers identified eligible trials and extracted data. Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, rebleeding before other elective treatments, 42-day rebleeding, mortality before other elective treatments, 42-day mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events. Data were analysed by a random effects model according to the vasoactive treatment. Sensitivity analyses included combined analysis of all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, fixed effects model analyses, type of publication, methodological quality, and adequacy of generation of the randomisation list and of allocation concealment.

Main Results

Twelve trials including 1146 patients (pts) were identified. One trial compared sclerotherapy with vasopressin, one with terlipressin, four with somatostatin, and six with octreotide. No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcomes. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were: failure to control bleeding (11 RCTs, 977 pts) -0.03 (-0.07 to 0.01); five-day failure rate (7 RCTs, 759 pts) -0.05 (-0.12 to 0.01); rebleeding (11 RCTs, 1082 pts) -0.01(-0.06 to 0.04); rebleeding before other elective treatments (9 RCTs, 975 pts) -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.03); mortality (12 RCTs, 1146 pts) -0.04 (-0.08 to 0.00); mortality before other elective treatments (5 RCTs, 474 pts) -0.02 (-0.07 to 0.04); transfused blood units (7 RCTs, 793 pts) (weighted mean difference) -0.17 (-0.52 to 0.19). Adverse events (11 RCTs, 1082 pts) and serious adverse events (5 RCTs, 602 pts) were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy: risk differences 0.08 (0.02 to 0.14) and 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08), respectively. Results were consistent across all the other sensitivity analyses.

Reviewer's Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs.

Initial management — pre-endoscopic pharmacologic adjuncts and nasogastric tube use for suspected NVUGIB emphasize that erythromycin or metoclopramide may be given intravenously before endoscopy to improve visualization, with data favoring erythromycin, but both should be used cautiously in patients with prolonged QT intervals. Use of octreotide is not recommended in NVUGIB, and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. The use of nasogastric tubes is controversial because use does not impact clinical outcomes; lavage can assist blood removal and suggests emergent endoscopy if continuous and copious bright red blood returns, but a negative lavage should not delay endoscopy, particularly if other parameters suggest active NVUGIB.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^117PPFAE]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) — epidemiology, severity markers, progression, and management: Several clinical grading systems have been proposed to identify features associated with high or low risk of complications, including the New Italian Endoscopic Club (NIEC) and Baveno III systems. Consensus among grading systems is that intramucosal hemorrhaging signs (cherry red spots, black-brown spots, or red point lesions) differentiate severe from mild PHG and that concomitant gastric antral vascular ectasia confers higher risk of hemorrhage. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, prevalence ranges from 49% to 80%, lower in those without varices (11%) or with small varices (35%) relative to those with medium or large varices (80%–97%), and development usually requires the presence of CSPH. Longitudinally, progression is frequent and regression rare; for example, in the HALT-C study, 97/170 (57%) without PHG developed PHG and 115/174 (66%) with baseline PHG worsened over 4 years of clinical follow-up. Acute bleeding is uncommon at 2.5%–5% and often ceases spontaneously in over half of cases; low quality data support intravenous octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin as safe initial therapy. Acute administration of NSBBs reduces gastric hyperemia and may attenuate acute PHG bleeding; prospective studies suggest a potential prophylactic role of NSBBs for reduction of first or recurrent acute PHG bleeding after exclusion of Helicobacter pylori. Chronic blood loss is typically defined as a 2 g/dL hemoglobin reduction over a 6‑month interval and is present in up to 4%–12% of cases; an RCT showed a clear benefit from propranolol in preventing recurrent bleeding, with additional nonrandomized data for argon plasma coagulation and case series describing hemostatic spray and high rates of bleeding control with portosystemic decompression.

The combination of vasoactive agents with endoscopic treatment is more effective for hemostasis than using either alone. Vasoactive agents (ie, vasopressin, somatostatin or octreotide) should be initiated as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected with a bolus (only somatostatin, octreotide) followed by continuous infusion (all agents) for duration 3–5 days, except vasopressin which should only be given for 24 hours. Consider infusion of erythromycin (250 mg given over 20–30 min) or metoclopramide as a promotility agent prior to endoscopy to clear gastric contents and assist with visualization.

Patients with UGIB in the setting of DC should be considered for endoscopy within 12 hours. Balloon tamponade as a bridge to TIPS should be considered as rescue therapy for patients with refractory variceal UGIB.

### Octreotide in the prevention of intra-abdominal complications following elective pancreatic resection… [^111a2cbb]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

analogues really work, however, remain a matter of debate, because the drugs act not only on pancreatic secretion but also on gastric, biliary, and jejunal secretions and intestinal motility. 4 We therefore undertook a large, prospective, multicenter randomized trial to determine whether octreotide acetate decreased the rate of patients with IACs and/or their severity7 and to highlight the patients at risk who might benefit most from this inhibitor of pancreatic secretion. Pancreatic fistula was defined either chemically9 as fluid obtained through drains or percutaneous aspiration containing at least 4 times normal serum values of amylase for 3 days, irrespective of the amount of output and the date of appearance, or clinically and radiologically as anastomotic leaks demonstrated by fistulography or upper gastrointestinal tract hydrosoluble contrast studies in the case of pancreatogastrostomy.

Acute pancreatitis was defined chemically as increased values of serum amylase, lipase, and urine amylase dosed every other day for 8 days and confirmed by CT. Digestive tract hemorrhage was defined as blood exiting through the nasogastric tube and confirmed on fibroendoscopy or arteriography and intra-abdominal hemorrhage by exteriorization of blood through drains on arteriography or both. In addition, there is no consensus regarding the exact definition of pancreatic fistula, 19 rendering comparisons confusing or impossible; octreotide acts on all secretions4 and therefore can reduce any of the IACs in relation to the secretion; and the IAC rate is better than the overall complication rate because most EACs are secondary to or associated with IACs. 6 Conversely, some EACs can occur without IACs and therefore are not related to technical considerations.

Normal consistency of pancreatic remnant was a significant risk factor in univariate analysis. In accordance with Sato et al, 29 octreotide significantly decreased the rate of complications in 4 controlled studies6–8, 11 when the pancreatic remnant consistency was normal rather than fibrotic, although in our study, this difference was not statistically significant.

### A clinical decision rule based on the AST-to-platelet ratio index improves adherence to published guidelines on the management of acute variceal bleeding [^115yGzzr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) depends on identifying a variceal versus nonvariceal etiology. An objective measure predicting etiology could guide early management pending endoscopy. The AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score has been studied as a marker of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, but has not been evaluated in the setting of acute UGIB.

Methods

In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we reviewed endoscopy reports and other data for patients with acute UGIB, and classified episodes as variceal bleeds or other. We assessed the diagnostic utility of the APRI score relative to other objective measures by Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. We constructed a clinical decision rule based on the APRI score, and assessed how it would have changed management.

Results

The APRI score performed well in predicting a variceal etiology of acute UGIB, with AUROC 0.89. We developed a clinical decision rule using an APRI score of 0.4 to guide early management of acute UGIB patients. Retroactively applying this to our cohort, adherence to published guidelines for administration of octreotide and antibiotics would have increased from 56% to 91%.

Conclusions

The APRI score is an objective metric that helps predict a variceal etiology of acute UGIB. Using our proposed decision rule could improve adherence to guidelines on management of acute variceal bleeding. Although we were unable to demonstrate a survival benefit, improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines serves as a metric related to this most important outcome measure. Prospective study to validate these findings is indicated.

### Treatment of variceal bleeding [^114JpZQB]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the most common cause of severe gastro-intestinal bleeding in childhood. Biliary atresia and portal venous obstruction are the most common causes. Each center should have a defined management protocol reflecting local practice and expertise. For patients with acute bleeding, pharmacotherapy with octreotide should be used immediately. All of these patients should undergo therapeutic endoscopy with band ligation or sclerotherapy. All children surviving variceal hemorrhage should undergo secondary prophylaxis with band ligation. No evidence supports the routine use of primary prophylaxis in children with esophageal varices.

### Bleeding' downhill'esophageal varices associated with benign superior vena cava obstruction: case report and literature review [^1144G7DL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Providers should be vigilant for bleeding "downhill" varices in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and clinical evidence of SVC obstruction because the pathophysiology of this disorder mandates a unique management compared to esophageal varices occurring in the usual setting of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Though data is lacking, traditional medical management would be unlikely to be of benefit in this population. Octreotide, as a splanchnic dilator would not decrease the pressure in "downhill" varices as they do not communicate directly with the portal system. Proton pump inhibitors would be unlikely to play a role as the upper esophagus is less likely to be influenced by gastric pH. The current literature only provides guidance for therapy by means of case reports and while firm recommendations cannot be made as to ideal therapy in this patient population, several methods of temporization seem to have been successful in halting bleeding until definitive decompression of the affected vessels can be performed. Further investigation is required to determine why benign, as opposed to malignant, causes of SVC obstruction result in bleeding from downhill varices at such a high rate, despite being a less common etiology of SVC obstruction in the general population.

### Risk of rebleeding from gastroesophageal varices after initial treatment with cyanoacrylate; a systematic review and pooled analysis [^1123oHT3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of portal hypertension which in turn, leads to portal hypertension and gastrointestinal varices. Up to 17% of liver cirrhosis patients will develop esophageal varices, while 15% will develop gastric varices. Up to 30%, gastroesophageal varices will bleed within 2 years. Bleeding from varices is one among gastrointestinal emergencies that account for the majority of mortalities and morbidities among portal hypertension patients despite the cause. About 50 to 80% of patients who survive the first episode of variceal hemorrhage will have a recurrent early or late rebleeding episode. Up to 20% of patients with a rebleeding episode will not survive.

From older literature, half of the variceal hemorrhages would stop spontaneously however, the risk of rebleeding and mortality increases significantly. Current studies, however, report that in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh of class C or with hepatic venous pressure of higher than 20 mm Hg are less likely to spontaneous stoppage of bleeding. These patients would require interventional hemostatic measures with pharmacological drugs such as octreotide, somatostatin and beta blockers; endoscopic sclerotherapy, band ligation, or tissue adhesives injection; and/or shunting by surgery or by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to achieve hemostasis. A selective combination of these approaches has also been reported. Different hemostatic approaches differ in terms of their success rates in achieving hemostasis, preventing rebleeding, and reducing mortality and morbidity. With advancing technology, each approach has evolved, and tissue adhesives have increasingly being used as the first line of therapy during the last decades.

### Diagnosis and management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding… [^112Yagkg]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

1 It has been associated with increasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. 2 Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is twice as common in men as in women and increases in prevalence with age. 3 Despite advances in therapy, the in-hospital mortality rate remains high and rebleeding is common. 4, 5 This article focuses on acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults, with a brief discussion of the management of variceal hemorrhage. Pathogenesis Upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes hemorrhage originating from the esophagus to the ligament of Treitz. Peptic ulcer bleeding causes more than 60 percent of cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas esophageal varices cause approximately 6 percent. 3 Other etiologies include arteriovenous malformations, Mallory-Weiss tear, gastritis and duodenitis, and malignancy.

Table 1 lists common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. In a meta-analysis of 16 studies involving 1, 633 participants taking NSAIDs, H. pylori infection and NSAID use increased the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, with this risk increasing further when both factors are present. Although a systematic review of six randomized controlled trials involving 2, 223 participants found no statistically significant differences in mortality, rebleeding within 30 days, or surgery between patients receiving PPIs and control treatment reduced overall mortality and risk of rebleeding.

31 A Cochrane review of 21 trials involving 2, 588 patients with active variceal hemorrhage found no difference in mortality rate or risk of rebleeding with somatostatin and its derivatives. 32 Octreotide is often administered to patients with variceal hemorrhage; however, its use is controversial.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114Lkmqj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstays of therapy include prompt resuscitation, early risk stratification, and appropriate access to endoscopy. Patients with high-risk endoscopic findings should receive endoscopic hemostasis with a modality of established efficacy. The pillar of post-endoscopic therapy is acid-suppression via proton pump inhibitors (PPI), although the optimal dose and route of administration are still unclear. Post-discharge management of patients with peptic ulcers includes standard oral PPI treatment and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. The risk of recurrent bleeding should be carefully considered and appropriate gastroprotection should be offered when non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-platelet agents, and/or anticoagulation need to be used. This review seeks to survey new evidence in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding that has emerged in the past 3 years and put it into context with recommendations from recent practice guidelines.

### Updated strategies in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage [^1134phDW]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article reviews the most recent studies regarding the management of acute esophageal variceal haemorrhage.

Recent Findings

New randomized control trials and meta-analyses confirmed the role of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage in Child-Pugh C (10–13) and B patients with active bleeding. A recent randomized controlled trial focused on the duration of vasoactive therapy showed no difference between 2 and 5 days of octreotide. A randomized trial showed decreased use of blood products for the correction of coagulopathy using a thromboelastography-guided approach (vs. conventional parameters) as well as decreased bleeding rates when compared with standard of care. A meta-analysis found that for rescue of variceal bleeding, self-expanding metallic stents were more efficacious and safer than balloon tamponade. In addition, studies showed that Child-Pugh C patients and those with hepatic vein pressure gradient more than 20 were at the highest risk of treatment failure, while model for end-stage liver disease was highly predictive of in-hospital mortality.

Summary

In patients with severe coagulopathy and uncontrolled bleeding, TEG-based transfusion strategies are recommended. Antibiotics should be used for all cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but should be tailored in accordance to local resistance patterns. Early TIPS for high-risk patients has been shown to have a significant survival benefit. Certain aspects of the management of variceal bleeding remain poorly studied such as the role of early TIPS in Child-B patients as well as strategies for rescue therapy in patients who are not TIPS candidates, and require further investigation.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^115ajoDZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Reject — agreement: 23%)

Recurrent bleeding occurs in 8–15% of patients with peptic ulcer bleeding and is associated with a two- to fivefold increase in mortality. The objective of routine second-look endoscopy, usually performed within 24 hours after index endoscopy, is to pre-emptively treat peptic ulcers with persistent stigmata of recent haemorrhage before they start bleeding again.

Second-look endoscopy was first investigated for its efficacy in prevention of peptic ulcer rebleeding by a few prospective randomised trials in the 1990s. The results from these randomised trials were conflicting. Some showed that second-look endoscopy and repeated endoscopic haemostasis were effective in preventing recurrent haemorrhagewhile others demonstrated no efficacy. The reasons for these conflicting results included recruitment of patients with different levels of rebleeding risk, a non-standardised method of primary haemostasis and variation in the performance of second-look endoscopy. A meta-analysis based on eight prospective randomised trials concluded that second-look endoscopy reduced rebleeding in the absence of high-dose PPI especially in patients at very high risk. Analysis of these pooled data also suggested that second-look endoscopy reduced the need for surgery but had no significant effect on mortality. However, after removing two trials that included patients with a high risk of rebleeding, no benefit from second-look endoscopy was found. A recent randomised trial compared intravenous PPI infusion with second-look endoscopy in patients after receiving endosocopic haemostasis for peptic ulcer bleeding. It demonstrated no difference in recurrent bleeding, need for surgery and mortality between the two treatment strategies. Furthermore, second-look endoscopy did not appear to be cost-effective when offered to all patients.

### Management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided treatments [^1113r6AJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

EUS-guided treatments are gaining popularity in the diagnostic and therapeutic fields. Thanks to its capacity to offer direct access to targeted lesions that are difficult to explore, treat lesions under visualizing guidance, detect the specific blood flow, and check the therapeutic effectiveness, EUS-guided therapies have been proved to be powerful tool in the treatment of various conditions. As mentioned in this review, EUS-guided treatment is a technique with promising therapeutic potential for NVUGIB, especially in cases where standard endoscopic treatments failed, as it has shown effectiveness with high safety profile in most cases. Meanwhile, concerns regarding the role of EUS-guided hemostasis for both variceal and non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding still exist, especially in case of active bleeding at the time of the treatment. Overall, we believe the application of EUS-guided therapies in NVUGIB will expand with the further development of EUS technology. However, the literature regarding this field is scarce and limits to case report and case series. Large randomized clinical controlled trials seem to be warranted.

### Long-acting somatostatin analogue therapy in obscure-overt gastrointestinal bleeding in noncirrhotic portal hypertension: a case report and literature review [^1147mFrk]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

We describe a case of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in a male with noncirrhotic portal hypertension who required multiple admissions and repeated blood transfusions over a 5-month period. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy failed to establish a cause for bleeding which was eventually ascribed to universal portal hypertensive stigmata in stomach, small bowel and colon, which were not amenable to endoscopic therapy. On account of extensive venous thrombosis, neither surgical shunting nor interventional radiology was an option. Initial management with prothrombotic agents failed. Our patient was successfully stabilized on long-acting somatostatin (SMS) analogue therapy using lanreotide, resulting in avoidance of further admissions and blood transfusion and restoration of his independence and quality of life. The use of short-acting SMS analogues is recognised in acute variceal haemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension in cirrhosis, and long-acting SMS analogue therapy has been described in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding though secondary to angiodysplasia. However, the potential role of long-term SMS analogues in noncirrhotic portal hypertensive bleeding of this type has not been reported earlier. This case supports its use in this scenario in the absence of surgical options and when only palliative approaches are available.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114UCxYn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The recommended duration of vasoactive drugs in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) spans 2–5 days. Prior meta-analyses of randomized trials include only a few studies that compared short vs. long vasoactive drug durations approximating this time range, including older management techniques, and only assessed variceal rebleeding at 5 days. We identified several additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing rebleeding at various durations, with updated management of EVB.

Methods

We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the effect of shortening the vasoactive drug duration by 48–72 h. The primary outcome was rebleeding within 5 days. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding, mortality due to rebleeding, and all-cause mortality within 4–6 weeks (extended period) with subgroup analysis by vasoactive drug and type of endoscopic therapy. Length of stay, blood transfusion requirements and terlipressin-related adverse events were additional secondary outcomes.

Results

Our comprehensive search strategy and screening process yielded 14 RCTs with 1060 patients (75.1% male): 7 trials used terlipressin, 4 octreotide, and 3 somatostatin. Shortened durations combined with band ligation led to similar rebleeding, with a trend towards less rebleeding when populations with more severe liver disease were excluded. There was greater rebleeding and mortality over an extended period when shorter durations were combined with sclerotherapy. Longer durations were associated with a longer hospital stay and, for terlipressin, more adverse events.

Conclusions

Shorter vasoactive drug durations combined with band ligation in selected populations appear safe. Higher powered RCTs are needed, involving patients with different degrees of severity of EVB and liver disease.

Gastrointestinal bleeding

How should gastrointestinal bleeding be managed in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Patients with DC with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should receive ceftriaxone and a vasoactive agent (vasopressin, somatostatin, or octreotide). Ventilated patients with upper GIB (UGIB) should receive a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Viscoelastic testing (VET) can guide use of VTE prophylaxis. Transfusion should be performed with goal hemoglobin (Hb) of 7–8 g/dL (70–80 g/L). Endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours and TIPS should be considered for recurrent or persistent variceal bleeding.

Discussion

Variceal hemorrhage is one of several disease-defining clinical features of DC. In the critically ill trauma or surgical patient presenting to the hospital for a separate indication, DC due to GIB results in a compounding of morbidity and mortality. The most common etiology of GIB in DC is portal hypertension, and spontaneously resolves in only 50% of cases. Failure of combination pharmacological therapy and endoscopy may occur in up to 20%, requiring advanced methods of hemostasis.

Ceftriaxone (1 g intravenous daily) reduces infectious complications, re-bleeding, and mortality in patients with UGIB, regardless of whether it is variceal or non-variceal. The duration of treatment is 7 days but discontinuation can be considered once hemorrhage has resolved and vasoactive drugs have been discontinued.

Mechanically ventilated patients receiving PPI rather than H 2 receptor blockade for prophylaxis experience fewer episodes of clinically important UGIB. Although this effect has not been specifically evaluated for prevention of variceal UGIB, both the American College of Gastroenterology and the European Association for the Study of the Liver recommend PPI for patients with cirrhosis requiring mechanical ventilation and suggest a possible benefit of PPI in reducing ulceration size following endoscopic band ligation. If not already initiated as prophylaxis, PPI therapy should be started to reduce recurrence for non-variceal GIB. While chemical VTE prophylaxis has not been shown to provoke GIB, patients with DC with recent GIB may be poor candidates for this, particularly in the setting of thrombocytopenia (< 50×10 9 /L). However, the coagulation profile of patients with DC as a predictor of bleeding risk is poorly understood and potentially better evaluated by VET over traditional assays. In blood product administration, there is no known benefit to achieving a higher Hb through transfusion in patients with DC as compared with balanced resuscitation with a restrictive red-cell transfusion strategy (Hb of 7–8 g/dL).

### Emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for bleeding oesophageal varices in cirrhotic patients [^1116Umec]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Emergency sclerotherapy is still widely used as a first line therapy for variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, particularly when banding ligation is not available or feasible. However, pharmacological treatment may stop bleeding in the majority of these patients.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of emergency sclerotherapy versus vasoactive drugs for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis.

Search Strategy

Search of trials was based on The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded through January 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs (vasopressin (with or without nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide) for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, rebleeding, mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events. Data were analysed by a random-effects model according to the vasoactive treatment. Sensitivity analyses included combined analysis of all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, type of publication, and risk of bias.

Main Results

Seventeen trials including 1817 patients were identified. Vasoactive drugs were vasopressin (one trial), terlipressin (one trial), somatostatin (five trials), and octreotide (ten trials). No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcome. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, the risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were failure to control bleeding -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), five-day failure rate -0.05 (-0.10 to 0.01), rebleeding 0.01 (-0.03 to 0.05), mortality (17 randomised trials, 1817 patients) -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), and transfused blood units (8 randomised trials, 849 patients) (weighted mean difference) -0.24 (-0.54 to 0.07). Adverse events 0.08 (0.03 to 0.14) and serious adverse events 0.05 (0.02 to 0.08) were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs. Vasoactive drugs may be safe and effective whenever endoscopic therapy is not promptly available and seems to be associated with less adverse events than emergency sclerotherapy. Other meta-analyses and guidelines advocate that combined vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy is superior to either intervention alone.

### Initial assessment and management of patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114VZvT6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a substantial clinical and economic burden, with an estimated mortality rate between 3% and 15%. The initial management starts with hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation. Blood transfusions may be needed in patients with low hemoglobin levels or massive bleeding, and patients who are anticoagulated may require administration of fresh frozen plasma. Patients with significant bleeding should be started on a proton-pump inhibitor infusion, and if there is concern for variceal bleeding, an octreotide infusion. Patients with UGIB should be stratified into low-risk and high-risk categories using validated risk scores. The use of these risk scores can aid in separating low-risk patients who are suitable for outpatient management or early discharge following endoscopy from patients who are at increased risk for needing endoscopic intervention, rebleeding, and death. Upper endoscopy after adequate resuscitation is required for most patients and should be performed within 24 hours of presentation. Key to improving outcomes is appropriate initial management of patients presenting with UGIB.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111CvEtw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (NVUGIB) is a common emergency, affecting 44 to 99 per 100,000 persons every year. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the principal cause of NVUGIB. Significant bleeding can result in major consequences, such as acute coronary syndromes. The mortality from NVUGIB remains high. A recent UK national audit found a 9.6% in-hospital mortality rate. Recurrence of bleeding occurs in 8–26% of patients, and is associated with an even higher mortality. Mortality is also increased in the elderly.

Such a serious disease inspires constant research in the hope of decreasing complications and mortality. A number of practice guidelines have been developed to help clinicians manage patients with NVUGIB, including those issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), an International Consensus meeting, and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Of note, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology held a national consensus meeting on NVUGIB in Athens on June 8, 2008; the recommendations have not been published, but were remarkably similar to the International Consensus recommendations that were formed a few months later. The principle components of management include resuscitation, risk-stratification, endoscopy for diagnosis and appropriate intervention, and post-endoscopic acid-suppression. All of these factors are the subject of constant revision and rigorous testing to improve outcomes and, in the last three years in particular, the literature has grown considerably. This review serves to survey the most recent evidence to emerge in the management of NVUGIB and put in into context with recommendations from the recent practice guidelines.

### No difference in mortality between terlipressin and somatostatin treatments in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding and renal functional impairment [^112N1khm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

About 30% of cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices will experience EVB during their lifetime. Mortality rates have been reduced because of improvements in the management of patients with EVB, but the risk of mortality is still high. This large population-based study showed a similar poor outcome because of EVB. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 17.6%.

Besides endoscopic treatment, prophylactic antibiotics and splanchnic vasoconstrictors (such as octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin, or vasopressin) are recommended as first-line treatment if patients are suspected of having acute variceal bleeding. Meta-analyses support the efficacy of vasoactive medications in patients who experience acute variceal bleeding. The use of vasoactive agents can lower the risk of 7-day mortality, improve the hemostatic effect, decrease transfusion requirements, and shorten the duration of hospitalization. However, the choice of splanchnic vasoconstriction agents for EVB remains an important issue.

To date, cumulative randomized prospective studies had been carried out to compare the effectiveness of terlipressin and octreotide for the control of acute variceal bleeding. All of them concluded that the efficiency of terlipressin and octreotide in controlling variceal bleeding was not different in terms of the hemostatic effect, safety, hospital stay, or mortality. In this national population-based study, we compared the mortality between two different vasoactive agents: terlipressin and somatostatin. There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality rate between patients treated with terlipressin versus those treated with somatostatin. We have also provided evidence on similar effects between terlipressin and somatostatin in terms of EVB after EVL. The choice of vasoactive drugs in cases of acute variceal bleeding, therefore, should be made on the basis of drug availability and the physician's experience.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^1156CfEd]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — hemostatic powder (TC-325/Hemospray) is available in North America and in most instances should be preferentially used as a rescue therapy and not for primary hemostasis, except in cases of malignant bleeding or massive bleeding with inability to perform thermal therapy or hemoclip placement. Technique considerations include that both 7F and 10F catheters are available for different-sized accessory channels, the channel can be preflushed with air (or using a 60-mL syringe) to avoid premature activation, and once at the lesion the spray is typically deployed from a distance of 1–2 cm away in short controlled bursts. Retrospective studies showed the powder remains present less than 24 hours; hence monotherapy with TC-325 is not recommended in ulcers with high-risk stigmata for rebleeding, and in these situations it should be used as a temporary measure to stop bleeding followed by another modality at the initial procedure or during a second-look endoscopy. Nonetheless, 2 pilot RCTs and a noncontrolled registry study have suggested a potential role for TC-325/Hemospray as monotherapy, raising the need for an appropriately powered clinical trial.

### Somatostatin receptor expression, tumour response, and quality of life in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with long-acting octreotide [^1122ZQ8Q]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Octreotide lowers portal pressure, and is routinely used to treat patients with variceal bleeding. Since prophylactic octreotide can prevent bleeding in high-risk patients, octreotide LAR might reduce morbidity and mortality through this mechanism. In our trial, gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in four patients (one peptic ulcer, three varices) with a total follow-up approaching 4000 patient-months. It is impossible to determine the effect of octreotide LAR on the rate of complications from portal hypertension without a randomly allocated control group; however, the rate in our study seems low compared with other series.

Although more patients rated improvements than deteriorations for some symptoms, these ratings were not strongly correlated with receptor status scores, and it is unclear whether these represent an effect of treatment. However, the fact that many patients reported improvements may partly explain the clinical impression of benefit in some patients. Determining the significance and cause of these changes requires a randomly allocated control group. Our findings support the feasibility and importance of incorporating measures of HRQL in future trials in advanced HCC.

This study has shown that octreotide LAR is well tolerated and may benefit some patients with HCC. We were unable to define, from octreotide scintigraphy or chromogranin A analyses, a subgroup more likely to benefit. There was little objective evidence of antitumour activity. A phase III study is advocated and indeed warranted given the conflicting findings with previous studies. However, careful attention should be paid to the selection of the primary end point and dose selection in the design of such a study. The potential impact on quality of life, survival, and cirrhosis-related morbidity, particularly variceal bleeding, justifies the performance of such a trial.

### Endoscopy for nonvariceal upper-GI bleeding… [^114v8Pfg]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is defined as blood loss originating near the Treitz ligament, is a common cause of hospitalization and mortality. Symptoms include hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, red blood return with nasogastric aspiration, melena, and hematochezia with heavy bleeding. The first step in managing upper GI bleeding is stabilizing the patient and obtaining a thorough medical history to identify potential causes of GI hemorrhage. Transfusion is appropriate if blood loss is significant. Intravenous or oral proton pump inhibitors can help reduce gastric lining irritation. Researchers have found that somatostatin and its analog octreotide reduced portal blood flow to the stomach and duodenum, resulting in decreased risk of continuous hemorrhage and surgical intervention. These actions may be considered temporary treatments before endoscopy.

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Practice Committee recently reviewed prospective trials, series reports, and expert opinions on the role of endoscopy in managing acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding. Endoscopy is most beneficial when initiated soon after upper GI bleeding begins and can decrease the duration of hospitalization and the need for transfusion. Intravenous erythromycin administered before endoscopy promotes gastric emptying and improves the diagnostic quality of the examination. Emergency department physicians can assess the risk for recurrent bleeding and recommend outpatient treatment or possible endoscopic treatment. Signs of high-risk bleeding include active arterial bleeding, nonbleeding visible vessels, nonbleeding adherent clots, and ulcer oozing. Peptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding.

Endoscopic therapy including laser treatment, electrocautery, heat probe, and epinephrine injection are all effective compared with placebo or no treatment. The success of these modalities usually is determined by the skill of the physician performing them. Physicians should test patients with upper GI bleeding for H. pylori through biopsy, because rapid urease tests have reduced sensitivity in this setting. Patients with positive test results should be treated to eradicate the infection. The ASGE Practice Committee concluded that endoscopy is effective in the diagnosis and treatment of upper GI bleeding, although the superiority between the individual endoscopic treatments has not been determined. The committee recommends that patients with a high risk of recurrent bleeding receive closer monitoring and possible repeat endoscopy.

### Pharmacological treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasias: a position paper of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) [^111sc6Po]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Angioectasias (AD) belong to benign vascular malformations of the gastrointestinal tract and are responsible for about 4–7% of upper non variceal bleeding, 30–40% of small bowel occult bleeding and 3–40% of colonic bleeding episodes. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage secondary to AD represents an important diagnostic and therapeutic problem that negatively impacts on the quality of life of patients and heath care costs. Endoscopic interventions are the mainstay in both diagnosis and treatment of vascular malformations. However, in a substantial percentage of the cases, age of the patients, comorbidities, clinical severity of anaemia and blood loss as well as size, site and number of lesions prevent this therapeutic approach. Hormonal therapy, thalidomide and somatostatin analogues have been investigated for their potential role as rescue therapies in controlling AD bleeding although, thus far, no recommendations have been provided on their use in this clinical setting. In order to implement appropriate prescription of pharmacological agents to manage gastrointestinal bleeding due to ADs, the Italian Society of Gastroenterology (SIGE) nominated a panel of experts who reviewed the available clinical literature and produced practical clinical recommendations.

Regarding medical management for variceal hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to general principles, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to perform early interventional endoscopy along with vasoactive agents producing splanchnic vasoconstriction (somatostatin, terlipressin, or octreotide) in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage.

### AGA clinical practice update on the use of vasoactive drugs and intravenous albumin in cirrhosis: expert review [^114zZw6h]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Variceal hemorrhage — initiation of vasoactive therapy is guided by Best Practice Advice 1, which states that vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is described as a major complication of cirrhosis with an in-hospital mortality rate of 4%–13% and a 6-week mortality rate of 7%–43% and accounts for approximately 70% of all upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Vasoactive drugs for AVH can be divided into somatostatin and its analogs (octreotide in most countries) and vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin); these agents work via vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation and thereby reduce portal pressure, can halt acute hemorrhage in up to 80% of cases, and are given intravenously.

Background: Literature indicating clinically relevant benefits of an adjunctive somatostatin analog to standard therapies in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is lacking. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to find the association between outcomes in patients with NVUGIB treated with octreotide and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; combination group) compared with those treated with a PPI alone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted within a 5-hospital health care system with a NVUGIB treated with a PPI continuous infusion with or without an octreotide infusion. Notable exclusion criteria included varices, history of cirrhosis without endoscopy, or active gastrointestinal cancer. The primary outcome was association of combination treatment versus PPI alone with hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: A total of 180 patients were included (combination group: n = 90; PPI: n = 90). In univariate analyses, the median hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS in the combination group versus PPI was 6.1 versus 4.9 days (P = 0.25) and 2.3 versus 1.9 days (P = 0.24), and rebleeding and mortality occurred in 9% versus 12% (P = 0.63) and 6.7% versus 5.6% (P = 1.00) of patients. Median units of packed red blood cells in the combination therapy versus PPI group was 3 vs 2 units (P = 0.43). After propensity score adjustment in multivariable analyses, hospital and ICU LOS, rebleeding, and mortality all remained nonsignificant. Conclusion and Relevance: Our study observed no difference in clinical end points. This suggests that octreotide provides no additional major clinical benefit in NVUGIB, and PPI therapy alone may be sufficient.

### The effect of shortening vasoactive drug durations alongside endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yJm1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, our subgroup analysis revealed that a shorter duration of vasoactive therapy combined with sclerotherapy was associated with more rebleeding and greater mortality in the extended period (EP). This makes intuitive sense, as sclerotherapy has been associated with acute rises in portal pressures lasting for 5 days, which may increase rebleeding risk; thus, longer vasoactive durations for up to 5 days to potentially counteract that effect should remain the standard of care whenever sclerotherapy is performed.

Finally, our sensitivity analysis by liver disease and variceal bleeding severity showed a trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer vasoactive durations in cases with less severity, and a trend for less 5-day rebleeding and lower mortality at the EP associated with longer durations in cases with higher severity. The trend that shortening durations alongside BL decreases rebleeding in patients with less severe bleeding, particularly with octreotide and somatostatin, but increases rebleeding in severe liver disease or variceal bleeding cases, warrants a cautious approach to shortening vasoactive durations in severe EVB, pending further investigation. It should be noted that the lower levels of rebleeding in shorter durations were more prevalent in the octreotide and somatostatin subgroups, which share similar mechanisms of action. Data suggest that longer durations of octreotide lead to tachyphylaxis and less sustained drops in portal pressures compared to terlipressin, although how this relates back to greater rebleeding is unclear. Additionally, the trend for more 5-day rebleeding with longer durations of octreotide/somatostatin, but not terlipressin, could just be due to the limited sample size for the former drugs.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^113KWSQL]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) epidemiology and initial management — NVUGIB is described as a serious clinical problem with an incidence of approximately 61–78 per 100,000 persons in the United States in 2009–2012 and mortality estimated to be between 2% and 10%. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment remains the clinical mainstay of care in hemodynamically stabilized patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, typically esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Although endoscopy is a cornerstone in the management of NVUGIB, it should come after triage, medical management, and stabilization.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^116QdxTx]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Each statement was then assessed for level of evidence by the following criteria: (a) high level of evidence; further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect, (b) moderate level of evidence; further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the recommendation and (c) low level of evidence; further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.

The conference was supported by an unrestrictive grant from the GI Research Fund of the Institute of Digestive Disease of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Industry support was not provided to avoid potential influence on the process of consensus development. Mandatory written disclosure of financial conflicts of interest within 24 months before the meeting was obtained from all voting participants.

In this updated consensus meeting, it was decided that the statements should focus on guiding clinical management of NVUGIB rather than on clarifying clinical concepts. There should be minimal overlap or repetition between this updated statement and the previous Asia-Pacific consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleedingunless new evidence had arisen that might change the recommendation. The panel also decided to report the statements that had not reached consensus as these are also considered useful in providing guidelines for the clinical management of such patients. Therefore, the first part of this report consists of consensus statements categorised under (1) pre-endoscopic management, (2) endoscopic management, (3) post-endoscopic management. The second part consists of statements that were rejected after deliberations and debate among panel members. These latter statements point towards new management concepts or strategies, but they are not accepted as recommendations because of insufficient evidence in the existing literature.

### The pharmacological therapy of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1132EBRb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The modern management of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes, in selected patients, the performance of timely multimodal endoscopic hemostasis followed by profound acid suppression. This article discusses the available data on the use of antisecretory regimens in the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, which are a major cause of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and briefly addresses other medications used in this acute setting. The most important clinically relevant data are presented, favoring fully published articles.

### Multidisciplinary management strategies for acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112xWyp1]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The modern management of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is centred on endoscopy, with recourse to interventional radiology and surgery in refractory cases. The appropriate use of intervention to optimize outcomes is reviewed.

Methods

A literature search was undertaken of PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials between January 1990 and April 2013 using validated search terms (with restrictions) relevant to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Results

Appropriate and adequate resuscitation, and risk stratification using validated scores should be initiated at diagnosis. Coagulopathy should be corrected along with blood transfusions, aiming for an international normalized ratio of less than 2·5 to proceed with possible endoscopic haemostasis and a haemoglobin level of 70g/l (excluding patients with severe bleeding or ischaemia). Prokinetics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be administered while awaiting endoscopy, although they do not affect rebleeding, surgery or mortality rates. Endoscopic haemostasis using thermal or mechanical therapies alone or in combination with injection should be used in all patients with high-risk stigmata (Forrest I-IIb) within 24h of presentation (possibly within 12h if there is severe bleeding), followed by a 72-h intravenous infusion of PPI that has been shown to decrease further rebleeding, surgery and mortality. A second attempt at endoscopic haemostasis is generally made in patients with rebleeding. Uncontrolled bleeding should be treated with targeted or empirical transcatheter arterial embolization. Surgical intervention is required in the event of failure of endoscopic and radiological measures. Secondary PPI prophylaxis when indicated and Helicobacter pylori eradication are necessary to decrease recurrent bleeding, keeping in mind the increased false-negative testing rates in the setting of acute bleeding.

Conclusion

An evidence-based approach with multidisciplinary collaboration is required to optimize outcomes of patients presenting with acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.
(g) EGD must be done within the first 12 h of admission and once the patient is hemodynamically stable. EVL is indicated when the source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is variceal, that is, in the presence of the following endoscopic findings:

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^115Z8Mc5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with anorectal varices, we suggest the use of non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers for prevention/prophylaxis of first and/or recurrent variceal bleeding (weak recommendation based on very low quality evidence, 2D). In case of acute bleeding, we suggest to temporarily suspended beta blockers (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with bleeding anorectal varices, we suggest to consider the use of vasoactive drugs, such as terlipressin or octreotide, to reduce splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

In patients with bleeding anorectal varices, we recommend a short course of prophylactic antibiotic (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).
