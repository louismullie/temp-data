## Question

Can letrozole cause cognitive changes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether letrozole can cause cognitive changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of aromatase inhibition affecting cognition. Then, I should verify what regulatory labeling says about cognitive adverse effects. Next, I will review randomized and observational clinical studies that specifically evaluated letrozole and cognition. After that, I should compare letrozole with other endocrine therapies, especially tamoxifen and other aromatase inhibitors, to contextualize relative risk. I will also examine indirect mechanisms such as sleep, fatigue, and mood that could mediate perceived cognitive problems. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence and outline practical clinical implications and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Letrozole inhibits aromatase, reducing estradiol synthesis; because estrogen receptors are abundant in brain regions critical for memory and executive function and estrogen modulates neuroplasticity and cholinergic activity, it is biologically plausible that sustained estradiol lowering could impair cognition, particularly verbal memory and processing speed, though the magnitude may vary by individual and context [^115n211B] [^113vVqBq] [^111RUSvs].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory signal. The FDA labeling for letrozole lists "memory impairment" among adverse reactions of unknown frequency, which supports a possible but uncommon association; I should be careful not to overinterpret this as a common or dose-dependent effect, but it does justify vigilance and patient counseling about cognitive symptoms during therapy [^113hudkn] [^111deKyD].

> Next, I should review direct evidence on letrozole and cognition. In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of healthy postmenopausal women on transdermal estrogen, adding letrozole did not significantly alter cognitive performance versus placebo over 16 weeks, suggesting no acute detrimental effect in that specific context, though the sample was small and the population was healthy rather than breast cancer patients [^116B2rR8]. In the BIG 1–98 trial, objective cognitive function improved one year after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy and there was no difference in the magnitude of improvement between women who ended on tamoxifen versus letrozole, which argues against a unique, persistent cognitive penalty attributable to letrozole compared with tamoxifen in that setting [^115kn6JN] [^116pDAhv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should compare across endocrine therapies. Several studies suggest tamoxifen is more consistently associated with measurable cognitive decrements than aromatase inhibitors. In a randomized neuropsychological substudy, tamoxifen users had worse verbal memory and executive function than healthy controls, whereas exemestane users did not, and tamoxifen users also had slower processing speed than exemestane users; importantly, exemestane did not differ from controls on any domain, supporting a relatively favorable cognitive profile for AIs compared with tamoxifen in that cohort [^112ZJ25a]. A cross-sectional comparison of anastrozole versus tamoxifen found worse verbal and visual learning and memory with anastrozole, but this was a small, nonrandomized study and conflicts with other AI data, so I should treat it cautiously [^116fq8KW]. A contemporary cross-sectional study using FACT-Cog found no worse perceived cognitive impairment with AIs versus tamoxifen, and in fact tamoxifen users reported more concentration complaints, reinforcing that AIs are not clearly inferior on patient-reported cognitive outcomes in routine practice [^116DK6EL].

> I need to check indirect mechanisms that could make patients feel cognitively impaired even if objective deficits are subtle. Aromatase inhibitors commonly cause hot flashes, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and mood symptoms, all of which can worsen perceived cognitive function; indeed, in the SOLE trial, intermittent letrozole was associated with modest improvements in hot flashes, sleep, and mood versus continuous therapy, and patient-reported cognitive problems correlated with fatigue and distress in related analyses, supporting a symptom-mediated pathway to perceived "brain fog" rather than a direct neurotoxic effect of letrozole per se [^112TGfh5] [^113X8aNk] [^1131KEtG].

> But wait, what about age and timing effects. In older women initiating endocrine therapy, a prospective cohort showed a small-to-moderate decline in verbal memory after one year of therapy, underscoring that age-related vulnerability may amplify treatment effects; however, the study did not isolate letrozole-specific effects and highlights the need for longer-term follow-up and stratification by agent and age [^111B1iL4]. Conversely, in a large epidemiologic analysis, tamoxifen — but not aromatase inhibitors — was associated with lower incident Alzheimer's disease, suggesting divergent brain effects across endocrine classes, though this is observational and should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^114YZchS].

> Let me synthesize the totality of evidence. The biological rationale for cognitive effects of letrozole is sound, but clinical data do not show a consistent, large, or unique cognitive penalty attributable to letrozole compared with other endocrine therapies; when differences are observed, they are typically small to moderate, often relate to subjective complaints rather than robust objective deficits, and may be mediated by sleep, fatigue, and mood rather than direct neurotoxicity; rare reports of memory impairment appear in labeling, consistent with a low-frequency signal that warrants awareness but not alarm [^112d9go8] [^113hudkn] [^111RUSvs].

> I should double-check practical implications for counseling and monitoring. Patients starting letrozole should be counseled that some notice "brain fog", often tied to hot flashes, poor sleep, or fatigue, and that these symptoms can be addressed with lifestyle and symptom management; routine screening for sleep disturbance, mood, and fatigue is reasonable, and if cognitive complaints persist or impair function, brief neuropsychological testing can help characterize deficits and guide interventions; exercise interventions may improve AI-related symptoms and quality of life, though direct effects on cognition require more study; importantly, the cognitive risks of letrozole appear lower than or comparable to tamoxifen in most comparative data, which can inform shared decision-making when choosing between endocrine options [^115YaAFD] [^116DK6EL] [^112d9go8].

> In conclusion, yes — letrozole can be associated with cognitive changes, but the best available evidence indicates these effects are generally mild, variably expressed, and often mediated by treatment-related symptoms rather than a direct, large-magnitude neurotoxic effect; rare reports of memory impairment are acknowledged in regulatory materials, and comparative studies frequently show less consistent or smaller cognitive decrements with AIs than with tamoxifen, supporting a cautious but reassuring stance for most patients [^113hudkn] [^112ZJ25a] [^115kn6JN] [^111RUSvs].

Letrozole can cause cognitive changes, including **memory impairment** [^113hudkn] and **cognitive complaints** [^112TGfh5], in some patients. These effects are generally mild to moderate [^114R5PmG] and often improve after stopping therapy [^115kn6JN]. The risk appears lower than with tamoxifen [^114BaJEq], and symptoms are typically manageable with lifestyle changes and supportive care [^116DK6EL].

---

## Evidence of cognitive changes associated with letrozole

- **Memory impairment**: The FDA label lists memory impairment as a potential adverse reaction, indicating a recognized but uncommon risk [^113hudkn].

- **Subjective cognitive complaints**: In the BIG 1–98 trial, subjective cognitive function remained stable during treatment and did not significantly change one year after stopping therapy, suggesting that persistent cognitive complaints are uncommon [^116pDAhv].

- **Comparison with tamoxifen**: Letrozole is associated with fewer cognitive complaints than tamoxifen, which consistently shows more pronounced cognitive effects [^114BaJEq].

---

## Mechanisms underlying cognitive changes

Letrozole reduces estrogen by inhibiting aromatase [^notfound]; estrogen is important for **cognitive function**, so this reduction may contribute to cognitive symptoms. Indirect effects via **fatigue, sleep disturbance, and mood changes** — common with letrozole — may also worsen cognitive complaints [^111RUSvs].

---

## Clinical significance and patient-reported impact

Cognitive changes with letrozole are generally **mild to moderate** [^112d9go8] and affect daily activities, work, and quality of life. Many patients report improvements after stopping therapy, indicating reversibility in most cases [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Older age may increase susceptibility to **cognitive changes** with letrozole [^notfound]. Prior chemotherapy may heighten risk or severity of cognitive impairment [^115TrdhJ]. Pre-existing cognitive impairment or mood disorders may also increase vulnerability [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Regular exercise, cognitive training, and sleep hygiene can improve cognitive function and quality of life [^116DK6EL].

- **Supportive care**: Addressing fatigue, mood disturbances, and sleep problems can reduce cognitive complaints [^notfound].

- **Medication adjustments**: Switching to tamoxifen or another endocrine therapy may be considered if cognitive symptoms are severe or persistent [^116dSv2r].

---

## Long-term cognitive outcomes

Long-term cognitive impairment from letrozole is **rare** [^112d9go8]; most cognitive changes are reversible after treatment ends [^115kn6JN]. Persistent symptoms may occur in a minority, particularly with additional risk factors [^114R5PmG].

---

Letrozole can cause **mild to moderate cognitive changes**, including memory impairment and cognitive complaints [^113hudkn]. These effects are generally reversible after stopping therapy [^115kn6JN], and management strategies can help mitigate symptoms [^112d9go8].

### Testosterone aromatization and cognition in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116B2rR8]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore whether inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to estradiol modifies the effects of testosterone on cognition in 61 healthy, estrogen-treated postmenopausal women.

Design

Seventy-six postmenopausal women using transdermal estrogen for at least 8 weeks, with a serum total testosterone less than 1.2 nmol/L participated in a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. All participants received transdermal testosterone, 400 muL of a 0.5% testosterone gel, daily and were randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg/day or an identical placebo tablet. The main outcome measure was cognition, evaluated using a comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests, at baseline and week 16.

Results

Thirty women in each group completed the study. Free testosterone increased from baseline in both groups, with no difference between groups. Free testosterone levels achieved were below the 90th centile for young women in 80% of the participants at week 16. Serum estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin levels did not differ from baseline or between groups during the study. No clinically significant effects of testosterone treatment were seen for attention and working memory, psychomotor speed, or executive function. Significant improvements were seen for immediate and delayed visual and verbal memory and for simple concentration with testosterone therapy, all of which were unaffected by the aromatase inhibitor.

Conclusions

We did not observe any effects of aromatase inhibition on cognition in healthy, estrogen-treated postmenopausal women treated with testosterone. This may be due to insufficient study power or a true lack of effect. However, our findings highlight that the detection of subtle changes in cognition in well women require the development of sensitive instruments and large randomized, controlled trials.

### Subjective cognitive complaints one year after ceasing adjuvant endocrine treatment for early-stage breast cancer [^116pDAhv]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background:

In the BIG 1–98 trial objective cognitive function improved in postmenopausal women 1 year after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer. This report evaluates changes in subjective cognitive function (SCF).

Methods:

One hundred postmenopausal women, randomised to receive 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, letrozole, or a sequence of the two, completed self-reported measures on SCF, psychological distress, fatigue, and quality of life during the fifth year of trial treatment (year 5) and 1 year after treatment completion (year 6). Changes between years 5 and 6 were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Subjective cognitive function and its correlates were explored.

Results:

Subjective cognitive function and the other patient-reported outcomes did not change significantly after cessation of endocrine therapy with the exception of improvement for hot flushes (P = 0.0005). No difference in changes was found between women taking tamoxifen or letrozole. Subjective cognitive function was the only psychosocial outcome with a substantial correlation between year 5 and 6 (Spearman's R = 0.80). Correlations between SCF and the other patient-reported outcomes were generally low.

Conclusion:

Improved objective cognitive function but not SCF occur following cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy in the BIG 1–98 trial. The substantial correlation of SCF scores over time may represent a stable attribute.

### Subjective cognitive complaints one year after ceasing adjuvant endocrine treatment for early-stage breast cancer [^113w4Wjz]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

We have previously reported results from the BIG 1–98 study on objective cognitive function. There was a statistically significant improvement in objective cognitive function after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy, with an effect size large enough to be considered clinically meaningful. In this report, we present the findings on SCF, psychological distress, fatigue, and QOL. Thus, objectives of the study reported here were (1) to evaluate changes in SCF, psychological distress, fatigue, and QOL 1 year after the cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer, who were randomised within a double blind controlled trial (BIG1–98) to receive adjuvant tamoxifen or letrozole alone or in sequence; (2) to evaluate whether there are differences in changes in SCF and other psychosocial outcomes 1 year after the cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy between women taking tamoxifen or letrozole for the last 3 of 5 years of trial treatment; and (3) to evaluate the relationship between cognitive function (objective and subjective), psychological distress, fatigue, and QOL while still on treatment and 1 year after cessation. In addition, subjective complaints of cognitive dysfunction and their correlates were explored.

### Cognitive effects of endocrine therapy for breast cancer: keep calm and carry on? [^113vVqBq]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

The number of breast cancer survivors is gradually increasing and a subset of these patients experience long-term adverse effects of adjuvant systemic therapy, including cognitive decline. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the long-term adverse effects of endocrine treatment on cognition. As 75% of all patients with breast cancer are eligible to receive hormonal treatment, understanding the potential neurocognitive adverse effects of such therapy is of utmost importance. Concerns about adverse cognitive effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy are timely, as recently updated guidelines recommend increasing the length of such therapy from 5 years to 10 years for a subset of patients. The decline of cognitive functions can have a detrimental impact on quality of life and might interfere with independent living. This Review discusses the tissue-selective side effects of endocrine therapies and specifically their impact on cognitive function, on the basis of clinical data; the neurobiological effects of endocrine therapies as observed in preclinical models are also discussed. We highlight the critical issues that need to be addressed in future preclinical and clinical studies in order to best assess the cognitive effects of endocrine treatment in patients with breast cancer.

### Effects of anastrozole on cognitive performance in postmenopausal women: a randomised, double-blind chemoprevention trial (IBIS II) [^114hS6XB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

Mild cognitive impairments have been recorded in cross-sectional studies of women with breast cancer receiving endocrine treatment. More comprehensive studies were warranted because aromatase inhibitors are being used increasingly in both chemoprevention and adjuvant settings. We report findings from the cognitive subprotocol of the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS II), a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of anastrozole in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer. We aimed to study and compare the effect of anastrozole versus placebo on memory and attention in these women.

Methods

Between Jan 3, 2003, and Dec 21, 2005, participants were recruited into the cognitive subprotocol from five UK centres. Cognitive assessments were done before randomisation, at 6 months, and at 24 months. 227 of 249 women approached completed a comprehensive set of standardised cognitive tasks at baseline and were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole (1 mg/day for 5 years) or placebo. Psychological morbidity, endocrine symptoms, and self-reported cognitive complaints were also measured. The main outcomes were cognitive task scores at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN31488319.

Findings

111 women were assigned to anastrozole and 116 women to placebo. At 6 months, ten women in each group were excluded from analysis, leaving a total of 207 of 227 (91%) women available for further assessments. At 24 months, 24 women were excluded from the anastrozole group and 32 from the placebo group, leaving 151 of 227 (67%) women. We did not note any significant differences between the groups for any of the cognitive tasks. By 6 months, 13 women in both groups reported changes to their memory and this had decreased to five women in the placebo group and three women in the anastrozole group by the 24-month assessment. Significantly more women in the anastrozole group complained of hot flushes at 24 months (23 of 76 [30%] vs 11 of 73 [15%], p = 0.032, not corrected for multiple comparison), but this was the only difference in reported endocrine symptoms.

Interpretation

These findings show little or no impairment of cognitive performance with the use of anastrozole compared with placebo in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer who were able to tolerate endocrine-related side-effects. Future studies assessing cognition should be done within randomised trials with baseline assessments to ascertain the true extent of the putative effects that treatments for breast cancer might have on memory and attention.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^114BaJEq]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The study results do not provide evidence that the addition of OFS to oral adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer affects objective global cognitive function in a clinically meaningful way over 1 year of endocrine treatment. However, the study did not have adequate power to detect a small to moderate effect on cognitive function. The only cognitive task for which performance of women randomised to OFS deteriorated significantly more than those randomised to tamoxifen alone was a test of verbal learning and memory, the ISLT. Some studies have suggested that verbal memory is particularly affected by OFS in non-oncological settings; however, we did not find a difference between the OFS and tamoxifen alone groups in terms of amount of deterioration in another measure of verbal memory, the delayed ISLT.

Previous studies in this field have focussed on tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors, nevertheless the impact of these drugs on cognitive function remains poorly understood. Most studies have been observational, with important differences between treatment groups that limits the interpretation of associations of particular endocrine treatments with cognitive changes. One randomised study tested postmenopausal patients before and 1 year after commencing endocrine therapy and compared those randomised to tamoxifen treatment with those randomised to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane and also included a healthy control group. It revealed that women randomised to tamoxifen had worse information processing speed after one year compared with those randomised to exemestane. In the non-randomised comparison with healthy controls exemestane did not seem to impact cognitive function adversely. The lack of impact of aromatase inhibitors on cognitive function is also supported by the results of the cognitive function substudy of the randomised IBIS II chemoprevention trial, which showed that postmenopausal women randomised to the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole had similar cognitive function after 2 years compared with those randomised to placebo. Similarly in the randomised BIG 1–98 study, postmenopausal women taking the aromatase inhibitor letrozole during year 5 of adjuvant endocrine therapy had better global cognitive function than those taking tamoxifen and cognitive function in both groups improved after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

### Menopausal symptoms and adjuvant therapy-associated adverse events [^113X8y5x]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are replacing tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer due to their superiority shown in several recent head-to-head trials. Healthy postmenopausal women normally experience age-related side effects, and in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, these symptoms may be exacerbated by adjuvant endocrine therapy. This review evaluates the current literature regarding bone health, lipid metabolism, cardiovascular disease, gynecologic health, and cognition in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy. The AIs — anastrozole, exemestane, and letrozole — are generally well tolerated: most adverse events are mild to moderate and common to menopause. Common short-term AI-associated toxicities are hot flushes, musculoskeletal complaints/arthralgia, and bone loss, all of which can be effectively managed. AIs may lack the cardioprotective and lipid-lowering effects of tamoxifen but, in contrast to tamoxifen, do not increase the risk of serious life-threatening thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events or endometrial cancer. Every patient should be individually assessed with respect to therapy risks and benefits. Lifestyle, comorbidities, and concomitant medications must be considered, and the importance of compliance to adjuvant therapy should be discussed before selecting a treatment regimen. The superior efficacy of adjuvant AI therapy will in most cases outweigh the risk of bothersome side effects that can be prevented or easily managed.

### A 3-year prospective study of the effects of adjuvant treatments on cognition in women with early stage breast cancer [^114Q7Wbu]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

At T1, 40 out of 43 (93%) nonchemotherapy patients had started endocrine therapy; 36 received tamoxifen and four anastrozole (one went on to have goserelin injections, six switched endocrine treatment during the study and one ceased endocrine treatment) and between T1 and T2 assessments, 36 out of 43 (84%) had completed a course of radiotherapy. By T2, 20 out of 85 (23%) chemotherapy patients had started endocrine therapy; 17 received tamoxifen, three letrozole and by T3, this had risen to 60 (71%); 46 tamoxifen, nine letrozole and five anastrozole (two patients switched from tamoxifen to anastrozole between assessments T2 and T3, and two received trastuzumab). Of the patients, 16 (19%) had started a course of radiotherapy by T2 and by T3, 71 (83.5%) had completed radiotherapy treatment. Out of 39, 32 premenopausal chemotherapy patients experienced a treatment-induced menopause.

Assessments

Cognitive assessments were made at baseline (T1), 4 weeks after the final chemotherapy session (six months in the other groups) (T2), and 12 months after the final chemotherapy session (18 months in the other groups) (T3).

The cognitive test battery assesses several broad areas of cognitive function as outlined in Figure 1. The tasks used are sensitive and have shown changes in a number of patient groups, including those suffering with AIDS, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and following cardiac surgery. They can provide information on a variety of cognitive processes including attention, learning, memory, planning and organisational strategies.

The tests were administered in the same order following the requirements of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III. All participants were screened for dementia, using the information and orientation subtest of the WMS III. The battery of standardised neuropsychological tests is briefly described below.

Intelligence

Intelligence was assessed using the National Adult Reading Test. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale FSIQ was predicted from this score.

Verbal memory

WMS III logical memory part 1 and 2 indicate: immediate and delayed recall of a short paragraph, respectively. Rey Auditory-verbal learning test is a word list-learning task consisting of five verbal presentations with recall of a 15-word list. Three scores are reported from this test: supraspan score (number of words recalled from the first presentation of the list), total recall score (total words recalled from the first five presentations) and delayed recall score (total words recalled after half an hour delay).

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^1158r21G]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Toxicity and tolerability

Differences in the side effect profile between tamoxifen and anastrozole are marked, and arguably more likely to influence the current prescribing practice than differences in efficacy. There is no difference between anastrozole and tamoxifen in terms of cataracts, ischaemic cardiovascular events, fatigue or asthenia, mood disturbances and nausea and vomiting. However, anastrozole was associated with fewer endometrial cancers, vaginal bleeding and discharge, cerebrovascular events, venous thromboembolic events and hot flushes. Tamoxifen caused fewer musculoskeletal disorders and fractures. These data have led the ASCO technical panel and the St Gallen Consensus panel to emphasise that anastrozole might have an important role for those at particular risk for severe tamoxifen side effects. On the other hand, anastrozole should be prescribed with caution in patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis. The increase in fracture risk associated with anastrozole was evident even at the first analysis, suggesting that the decline in bone strength may occur very rapidly in some patients, perhaps even before major changes in bone mineral density are detected. Arguably, all patients on adjuvant AI therapy should receive vitamin D and calcium supplements, be encouraged to exercise, and those with evidence for bone loss at baseline should also receive an oral bisphosphonate, until practice guidelines are established. The ASCO technical review and the St Gallen Consensus Panel continue to emphasise the lack of safety data regarding long-term oestrogen deprivation. For example, AIs have been reported to alter cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism with potentially deleterious effects on cardiovascular health. There are also concerns about the effects of long-term oestrogen deprivation on memory and risk for dementia. Regions of the brain such as the hippocampus and amygdala involved in learning and memory are rich in ER, as oestrogen regulates synapse formation and induces choline transferase and acetylcholinesterase, both critical to memory function. While tamoxifen has been implicated in decline in cognitive function, these data do not come from double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trials, and so the issue remains controversial. The positive influence of oestrogen on the general health, vitality, mental health, depressive symptoms, or sexual satisfaction has recently been seriously questioned, and so, while these issues need careful study, the potential of AIs to be unduly toxic in the long run should not be overstated.

### Subjective cognitive complaints one year after ceasing adjuvant endocrine treatment for early-stage breast cancer [^115V1BHi]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Of 135 women recruited to this study, 35 were ineligible for this analysis (see Figure 1 for reasons), leaving 100 women. The year-6 assessment was undertaken a median of 365.5 days (range 191–699 days) after ceasing protocol endocrine therapy.

Most patient and disease characteristics (i.e. age, history of head injury, neurological disorder, anxiety or depression, currently treated for anxiety, depression or mental disorder, alcohol consumption, ECOG status, chemotherapy received, hormone replacement therapy, ER/PgR status, tumour size, and local therapy) were balanced between women who had both assessments vs those who had only year-5 assessment (drop-outs N = 23; see Figure 1), except that women who had four or more positive nodes were more likely to drop out by the year-6 assessment (P = 0.01). No statistically significant differences were found for patient and disease characteristics between the women taking tamoxifen vs letrozole at year 5.

Differences between treatments groups at year 5

At year 5, no differences were found for SCF (P = 0.79), fatigue (P = 0.58), psychological distress (P = 0.16), or the QOL indicators between women taking tamoxifen or letrozole.

Changes from on- to off-treatment

Overall, no significant change was found from on-treatment to 1-year off-treatment for SCF or any of the patient-reported outcomes (Table 1), except for a significant decrease in hot flushes (mean change (s.d.) = −10.3 (30.87); median change (range) = −2 (−99, 100), P = 0.0005). Likewise, none of the changes in SCF and other patient-reported outcomes differed significantly between women taking tamoxifen compared with letrozole (data not shown).

Considerations for specific treatments

The effects of chemotherapy were initially a focus of cancer-related cognitive impairment research and have been the best studied, but research has increased into the cognitive effects of other common therapies and newer therapeutic agents. For instance, there is a complex interplay between reproductive hormones and cognitive function in men and women as well as the cognitive impact of menopausal changes related to endocrine and hormone treatments in women. For example, research on the impact of estrogen supplementation following oophorectomy showed improvements in patients randomly assigned to estrogen supplementation. In premenopausal women, chemotherapy can affect the ovaries, leading to decreased estrogen and estradiol levels, which contributes to irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea. Further, in those patients with hormone receptor–positive cancer, ovarian suppression (eg, luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone antagonists) also markedly reduces estradiol, which can be further exacerbated by tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Studies by Ganz and colleagues suggest that estradiol is an important biomarker that changes during treatment. Studies should consider monitoring estradiol or menopausal status and amenorrhea over the course of treatment and evaluate objective neuropsychological performance and perceived cognitive impairment.

The TAILORx study showed greater cancer-related cognitive impairment (measured using the FACT-Cog PCI scale) from baseline to 3-month follow-up (approximate end of chemotherapy) among women with breast cancer randomly assigned to chemoendocrine therapy compared with women randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone. At 12 months and beyond, however, the PCI scores converged for both groups. Women randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone reported greater cognitive impairments at long-term follow up compared with baseline, converging with cancer-related cognitive impairment among women randomly assigned to chemoendocrine therapy. Although PCI score trajectories by treatment appeared to be different for premenopausal vs postmenopausal women, suggesting that postmenopausal women receiving chemoendocrine therapy are more vulnerable to perceived cognitive impairment, tests of an interaction between menopausal status and treatment arm were not statistically significant. These findings indicate that endocrine therapy is also an important contributor to cancer-related cognitive impairment, even among women who do not receive chemotherapy.

### Subjective cognitive complaints one year after ceasing adjuvant endocrine treatment for early-stage breast cancer [^1131sqve]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this sub-study, SCF, fatigue, psychological distress, and QOL did not change between the fifth year on adjuvant endocrine therapy and 1 year after treatment cessation in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. The only exception was a significant decrease in hot flushes, which is expected on withdrawal of endocrine therapy. Similarly, the proportion of women who were at risk for a mental disorder was stable, with rates < 20% at year 5 and 6. Other studies on cognitive function in women with breast cancer using also the GHQ-12 to control for mental disorder have reported similar rates of risks for mental disorder in women receiving radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, but higher rates in women receiving chemotherapy.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on subjective cognitive changes in women after cessation of endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer within a randomised controlled trial setting. Most studies reporting on changes in SCF have focused on subjective cognitive changes after chemotherapy. In the study by Jenkins, one group of patients received radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy only. In this group no subjective cognitive changes were found over time, but patients were still taking endocrine treatment at the time of their follow-up assessment. In a randomised double-blind chemoprevention trial (IBIS II trial, postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer did not report changes in SCF (assessed with the CFQ) during the first two years on the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole.

### Hormone therapy linked to cognitive decline [^116m6jTf]. Cancer Discovery (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings from a subgroup of the TAILORx trial on early breast cancer reveal that endocrine therapy can contribute to extended cognitive decline, whether or not women receive initial chemotherapy. The results suggest that women taking hormone therapy should be periodically assessed for worsening cognitive symptoms over the course of treatment.

### Memory impairments with adjuvant anastrozole versus tamoxifen in women with early-stage breast cancer [^116fq8KW]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Hormones have been implicated as modulators of cognitive functioning. For instance, results of our previous work in women with breast cancer showed that cognitive impairment was more severe and involved more memory domains in those who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy compared with women who received chemotherapy alone or no adjuvant therapy. Recently aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole have been used in lieu of tamoxifen for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer. Plasma estrogen levels are significantly lower in women who receive anastrozole compared with those who receive tamoxifen. We hypothesized, therefore, that anastrozole would have a more profound effect on cognitive function than tamoxifen, a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist.

Design

To test this hypothesis we compared cognitive function in women with early-stage breast cancer who received tamoxifen with those who received anastrozole therapy in a cross-sectional study. We evaluated cognitive function, depression, anxiety, and fatigue in 31 postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who were between the ages of 21 and 65 years and treated with tamoxifen or anastrozole for a minimum of 3 months.

Results

The results showed that women who received anastrozole had poorer verbal and visual learning and memory than women who received tamoxifen.

Conclusions

Additional, prospective studies are needed to validate and confirm the changes in cognitive function associated with hormone therapy for breast cancer.

### Quality of life under extended continuous versus intermittent adjuvant letrozole in lymph node-positive, early breast cancer patients: the SOLE randomised phase 3 trial [^112TGfh5]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In general, our results show less worsening of symptom-specific and global QoL in patients assigned to intermittent letrozole compared with those assigned to continuous letrozole. Differences in hot flushes, vaginal problems, musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbances, physical well-being and mood were a result of small improvements in the intermittent group during the first or the second letrozole break, respectively. Changes over time and treatment differences did not reach clinical relevance. Our findings are in line with those of MA.17 showing statistically significant but small treatment differences in favour of the placebo group for physical functioning at 12 months, bodily pain and vitality at 6 months, vasomotor symptoms up to 24 months, and sexual problems at 12 and 24 months.

In SOLE, after completing 4–6 years of prior adjuvant endocrine therapy, two-thirds of patients had a treatment-free period of less than one month. The impact of treatment on symptom-specific QoL after restarting endocrine therapy is expected to be less substantial than in a first-time administration. The baseline scores for some symptoms (hot flushes, vaginal problems, musculoskeletal pain, cognitive problems, weight gain assessed by the BCPT scale) were worse than those of reference data from a sample of 208 women at risk but without a diagnosis for breast cancer, suggesting that patients started extended therapy with some severity of key symptoms. A deterioration on this level, even if small, can be detrimental to QoL. Our QoL response analysis showed, regardless of treatment, that approximately 25 to 30% of patients indicated a substantial worsening depending on symptom or QoL scale. In MA.17, 29% of patients on extended letrozole reported a clinically-relevant worsening for vasomotor symptoms vs. 22% on placebo on at least one occasion during the five years on letrozole. Corresponding proportions of a clinically-relevant worsening were 43% (for letrozole) vs. 38% (for placebo) for the physical domain, 39 vs. 37% for the psychosocial domain, and 32 vs. 29% the sexual domain. Differences in the proportions of patients who experienced a relevant worsening in QoL between extended letrozole and placebo were between 2 and 7% depending on QoL scale. In SOLE, we observed slightly higher differences in these proportions between the intermittent and continuous letrozole groups (4–8% depending on scale), with all favouring the intermittent group. The proportions of patients with a clinically-relevant symptom burden in the MA.17 are not directly comparable to our results due to different QoL instruments used.

### Special considerations in early-stage breast cancer patients and survivors [^114Daz9H]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Long-term outcomes for early-stage breast cancer have continued to improve, and more patients are becoming long-term survivors. In addition to patients' concern about risk of developing recurrent disease, they are also concerned about potential toxicities of treatment. Current guidelines for long-term follow-up are reviewed. Potential toxicities of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are reviewed. Management of menopausal symptoms, cancer-related fatigue, and cognitive function is discussed.

### Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review [^112L7Zm7]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Across the included reviews, memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed were the most affected cognitive domains. This pattern was found for both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy recipients and is in line with the current literature These observations define a frontal-subcortical cognitive network, which is further corroborated by neuroimaging studies demonstrating brain alterations post-chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Notably, the presence of similar impairment profiles in both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy-treated patients suggests a transversal etiology of CRCI. Nonetheless, chemotherapy may have endocrine effects in pre-menopausal patients and chemotherapy recipients often undergo endocrine therapy as well, making it challenging to isolate individual effects.

Our results also showed that CRCI was particularly enhanced in those treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and tamoxifen. As taxanes can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain they have been associated with molecular changes in the central nervous system. This has been linked to destabilization of the neuronal structure (ie, alteration in hippocampal functions, loss of spines, and dendritic arborization) and impaired neurotransmission, resulting in impaired cortex-based task performance. As regards tamoxifen, studies generally indicate that it is often associated with worsening cognitive functioning. However, despite the well‐known link between estrogen and brain tissue functioning, evidence is mixed, with some studies showing no effects on cognition. As tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, it can act both as an agonist and antagonist in various parts of the body, therefore giving rise to heterogeneous patterns of cognitive changes.

Statistical considerations

Changes in SCF and each of the patient-reported outcome measures from year 5 to year 6 were evaluated by subtracting year 5 from year 6 scores. Higher scores reflect a poorer condition; thus, a negative change in the score indicates an improvement. Owing to the skewness in the distribution of responses for the BFI, GHQ, and QOL measures at the year 5 assessment, analyses were performed using nonparametric methods. The stratified Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate changes 1 year after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy (regardless of the type of endocrine therapy received). The Van Elteren Wilcoxon rank-sum test, stratified on language, was used to test the difference in the changes from year 5 to year 6 between women taking tamoxifen and women taking letrozole at year 5. Spearman's correlation coefficients (R) were obtained for pairwise associations among the CogState Battery composite score and the self-reported measures.

Where available, cut-offs were applied to identify women with mental disorders or severe fatigue. A widely accepted convention to define a case of mental disorder using the GHQ-12 is a score ⩾3. A score ⩾31 is considered as cut-off for screening of mental disorder for the QOL mood scale. A BFI score ⩾8 represents severe fatigue. In the absence of an established cut-off for the CFQ total score, we used a distribution-based measure and focused on women who reported the highest 33% of CFQ total scores at year 5.

In order to characterise women who reported the highest 33% of CFQ total scores at year 5 (still on treatment), relationships between CFQ scores and their year-5 BFI, GHQ and mood scores, age at this time, and year 6-CFQ scores were explored graphically (scatter plots). These variables were chosen a priori because of research showing strong associations between SCF and fatigue, depression, anxiety and mood, and because of age being considered an important covariate of cognitive function. Women who reported the highest 33% of CFQ total scores at year 5 were further characterised with regard to specific complaints (on CFQ individual item level) by exploring the relationship between individual complaints at year 5 and year 6.

### Subjective cognitive complaints one year after ceasing adjuvant endocrine treatment for early-stage breast cancer [^113X8aNk]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Subjective cognitive complaints and their correlates

For women with CFQ scores in the highest third, the lowest score was 40 at the year-5 assessment. Thirty-eight women (38%) at year 5 and 36 women (36%) at year 6 had a CFQ score of ⩾40.

Figure 2A–D shows plots of CFQ scores by GHQ, BFI, mood scores, and age at year 5 for all patients. Whereas there seems to be some tendency for women who reported the highest 33% of SCF scores (vertical line represents the cut-off) to have worse BFI and mood scores, this is not seen with the GHQ score or age. Women with more cognitive complaints at year 5 (i.e. still on treatment) also reported more complaints at year 6 (i.e. after ceasing endocrine treatment; R = 0.80), as shown in Figure 3. In contrast, correlations between on- and off-treatment scores were lower for BFI (R = 0.53), GHQ (R = 0.39) or the various QOL indicators (ranging from R = 0.32 to 0.62).

There were moderate-to-high correlations between responses at year 5 and those at year 6 for individual CFQ items (ranging from R = 0.24 to 0.77). When the individual complaints of women with the highest 33% of CFQ total scores at year 5 were explored (Figure 4), four items pertaining to memory lapses (i.e. 'forgetting reason for going from one part of house to the other', 'forget where you put things', 'forget people's names', 'cannot remember something (on tip of tongue)'), had high responses for both years 5 and 6, suggesting that these were the most bothersome specific complaints in this particular subgroup of women, and that they remained a problem during treatment (year 5) and 1 year after treatment cessation (year 6).

In summary, although objective cognitive function improved 1 year after treatment completion in the BIG 1–98 Trial, hot flushes reduced, and SCF and the other psychosocial measures remained stable with no difference between women taking tamoxifen and letrozole.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^112zfErq]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy with the selective oestrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen reduces mortality and has long been a standard of care for premenopausal women with potentially curable hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Two recent randomised trials, TEXT and Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT), have shown that ovarian function suppression (OFS), in combination with either the aromatase inhibitor exemestane or tamoxifen, provides additional benefit over tamoxifen alone. On the basis of these results, OFS will be increasingly used as part of the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

In choosing the most appropriate adjuvant endocrine therapy for an individual woman, side-effect profile is a major consideration. It has been shown that women who experienced more side-effects required a greater survival benefit to accept adjuvant endocrine therapy. Cognitive dysfunction is a much feared potential side-effect of breast cancer treatment. Studies suggest that all components of cancer treatment may impair cognition and that impairment may also be present in some women prior to cancer treatment. It is clear that oestrogen has an important role in cognitive functioning but few studies have examined the effect of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer on cognitive function and none has assessed the impact of OFS. OFS results in very-low circulating oestrogen levels and some, but not all data from non-oncological settings suggest that OFS with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH) agents impair cognition and that this impairment can be reversed with add-back oestrogen. It has also been reported that surgical menopause adversely affects cognition.

We conducted a cognitive function substudy of the SOFT. The primary objective of this Co-SOFT substudy was to compare changes in cognitive function, measured objectively over 1 year in premenopausal patients with breast cancer who received adjuvant endocrine therapy with OFS (either tamoxifen+OFS or exemestane +OFS) against those who received tamoxifen alone. It was hypothesised that, because of greater oestrogen deprivation, women who received OFS would have greater deterioration in cognitive function than those who received tamoxifen alone.

### Understanding the impact of breast cancer adjuvant endocrine therapy on cognitive function: a work in progress [^114JgXVU]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women throughout the world and is associated with extended, long-term survival as a result of the effective application of chemotherapy and endocrine adjuvant therapies. The majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive and thus endocrine therapies play a critical role in reducing the risk of both distant and local recurrence of the primary cancer. Surgical ovarian ablation was among the earliest approaches to adjuvant therapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients; however, the success of tamoxifen in treatment of metastatic breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women eventually led to its introduction as the main form of endocrine adjuvant therapy in premenopausal breast cancer patients in the latter decades of the twentieth century. Since that time, a variety of investigations have asked the question of whether or not ovarian function suppression (OFS) (either with surgery or with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist) added to either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor would improve the durability of disease-free survival and overall survival in premenopausal women. The recently completed SOFT and TEXT trials are the most ambitious studies to date to address this question.

### Candidate mechanisms for chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes [^117SKkmA]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

The mechanism(s) for chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes are largely unknown; however, several candidate mechanisms have been identified. We suggest that shared genetic risk factors for the development of cancer and cognitive problems, including low-efficiency efflux pumps, deficits in DNA-repair mechanisms and/or a deregulated immune response, coupled with the effect of chemotherapy on these systems, might contribute to cognitive decline in patients after chemotherapy. Furthermore, the genetically modulated reduction of capacity for neural repair and neurotransmitter activity, as well as reduced antioxidant capacity associated with treatment-induced reduction in oestrogen and testosterone levels, might interact with these mechanisms and/or have independent effects on cognitive function.

### Understanding the impact of breast cancer adjuvant endocrine therapy on cognitive function: a work in progress [^111TdGdd]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The primary comparison in Co-SOFT was the change in the Composite Score of the CogState tasks, which was the measure used to assess neurocognitive function. Unfortunately, this test battery omitted the verbal fluency domain that is often affected by changes in oestradiol levels. Furthermore, a global composite score might not be as sensitive an indicator of cognitive dysfunction in this setting, since patients who experience cognitive changes with cancer therapy rarely exhibit global impairments, and have more often been noted to have subtle deficits in specific neurocognitive domains, such as verbal and visual memory, along with processing speed. Although self-reported cognitive complaints were a secondary outcome in this study, the patients receiving OFS reported a substantially greater perceived decline in functioning compared to the tamoxifen-alone group. While the CogState composite score did not correlate with the self-reported functioning, in a recent study we found that women who initiated endocrine therapy for breast cancer with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor had worse performance on a cognitive assessment of psychomotor speed, and this was associated with specific aspects of verbal fluency. The small sample size in the Co-SOFT study, as well as the focus on global assessment of cognitive function, likely limited the ability to detect true objective neurocognitive deficits associated with the use of OFS.

Nevertheless, Phillips et al should be congratulated for the effort they made to coordinate a comprehensive cognitive function assessment study within this important international adjuvant treatment trial. As with many ancillary studies, they are often difficult to conduct because of a lack of resources, and as a result their initiation is delayed and accrual may be limited. Future studies of cognitive decline must incorporate evaluations from inception of the trial so that adequate sample size and power are present to determine whether or not cancer treatments impact cognitive function. In particular, if self-reported cognitive function can reliably detect treatment-associated impairments, then this may be a more efficient way to universally assess cancer treatment-related cognitive impairment in the setting of randomised clinical trials.

### A 3-year prospective study of the effects of adjuvant treatments on cognition in women with early stage breast cancer [^113ZmiRV]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The potential effect of endocrine therapy on cognitive function is more difficult to assess because of confounding factors. Women with breast cancer who receive only endocrine treatment tend to be postmenopausal and therefore older than those who receive chemotherapy. One cross-sectional study of cognitive function in women who participated in the Arimidex and Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial noted that verbal memory and processing speed were impaired compared to healthy postmenopausal women. Another study reported that tamoxifen users consulted their physician about memory problems more often than nonusers, but as yet no study has reported longitudinal data on the effects of either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors on memory and attention.

Establishing the prevalence, clinical significance and impact on quality of life of cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments is important. At the moment, the literature is too confusing to permit clear discussion. There is also some concern that the problems have been overestimated, particularly in the light of a recent meta-analysis, which suggests that although statistically significant, the magnitude of effect sizes previously reported is small to moderate ranging from −0.03 to −0.51 of a standard deviation below controls. This report presents results from a prospective longitudinal study of the impact of breast cancer treatments on the cognitive functioning of 128 women at three time points.

### Understanding the impact of breast cancer adjuvant endocrine therapy on cognitive function: a work in progress [^113smyTY]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

While improved survival is a central goal of adjuvant endocrine therapy, one must have respect for both the short-term and long-term complications of these treatments, especially in younger women, who are likely to have extended years of survival. The short-term side effects of endocrine therapy include vasomotor, vaginal and sexual difficulties, with musculoskeletal complaints being more frequent with aromatase inhibitors. Long-term risks include diminished bone density/fracture, thromboembolic events, uterine cancer, and potentially increased cardiac disease. Until recently there has been limited examination of the potential for cognitive difficulties associated with initiation of endocrine adjuvant therapy, as most earlier attention has focused on the potential for cognitive decline in association with chemotherapy.

There is emerging evidence that endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients is associated with cognitive difficulties, which is not surprising given the critical role of oestrogens in maintaining neural plasticity. Numerous studies in healthy women demonstrate diminished verbal memory and verbal fluency in association with surgical or medical ovarian suppression, as well as increased risk for dementia with premature menopause. Decline in these same domains of neurocognitive function has also been noted in association with tamoxifen therapy. In their recent review, note that most studies of cognitive function in association with endocrine treatment of breast cancer have been small observational studies, and they call for more comprehensive assessments of the impact of this therapy on cognition. They also emphasise the importance of obtaining cognitive function assessments in clinical trials, as well as the critical need for long-term follow-up, as women with breast cancer are expected to have extended survival times in which cognitive decline might emerge as an important late consequence of treatment.

With this background, we need to consider the strengths and limitations of the report byin this issue of the British Journal of Cancer, describing an evaluation of cognitive function in women participating in the SOFT trial. The Co-SOFT substudy had an initial planned enrollment goal of 321 SOFT study participants who would be recruited at one of the 26 sites that were participating in the SOFT trial. The planned primary outcome for Co-SOFT was a comparison of objective cognitive function before the initiation of endocrine therapy and then 1 year later, across the three separate SOFT trial treatment groups. Additional questionnaires were administered to assess self-reported cognitive function, psychological distress, fatigue, insomnia and quality of life. Overall, this was a well-designed and comprehensive approach to assessing cognitive function/decline as part of an important randomised clinical trial.

### Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review [^111RUSvs]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the evidence concerning the cognitive impact of various BC therapies. A secondary aim is to examine how objective cognitive deficits, and subjective cognitive concerns, alongside other psycho-physical factors, contribute to the development and persistence of CRCI. While research into the cognitive effects of cancer treatments is expanding, evidence remains scattered due to differences in study methodologies, limited data on new therapies, and long-term effects in life-long treated patients. Addressing these issues would help to uniformly address the unmet needs of patients with BC dealing with CRCI.

Cognitive impairment following breast cancer therapies

Overall, results suggest that chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are often associated with CRCI in BC patients with BC. Although possible pathophysiological mechanisms are still under investigation, chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment is believed to have a multifactorial etiology: different molecular mechanisms may result in blood-brain barrier disruption, systemic and chronic inflammation, accelerated cellular senescence, and neuronal stem cell abnormalities, all of which can potentially lead to cognitive impairment. Regarding endocrine therapy, it appears that verbal memoryand executive functionsare particularly sensitive to the effects of estradiol, likely due to the distribution of estrogen receptors in the brain. Endocrine therapy might therefore directly affect cognition by influencing oestradiol signaling but could also have indirect effects on cognition mediated by the presence of other side effects such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Overall, these findings suggest that cancer therapies can influence cognition potentially through a combination of direct and indirect effects on the nervous system.

### Quality of life under extended continuous versus intermittent adjuvant letrozole in lymph node-positive, early breast cancer patients: the SOLE randomised phase 3 trial [^111SexAL]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The BCPT scales were complemented with further symptom-specific QoL scales related to endocrine treatment used in previous IBCSG trials, including tiredness, sleep disturbance, loss of sexual interest and difficulties becoming aroused. – Global QoL was assessed with scales for physical well-being, mood, – coping effort, and overall treatment burden. These additional scales were single-items in the linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) format. The clinical relevance of global LASA indicators has been confirmed in breast cancer trials in the adjuvant setting examining adjuvant standard chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy. As a reference measure for the BCPT hot flushes scale, we included the hot flushes LASA scale used in previous trials. –,

For comparative purposes, we transformed all scales so that each score ranged from 0 to 100, with higher numbers reflecting a better condition. For interpretative purposes, hypotheses-related absolute BCPT scores are also presented in the original scale format. For the BCPT and IBCGS LASA scales, no established anchor-based cut-offs for a minimally-important difference (MID), defined as the smallest change in a QoL score considered important to patients, is available. Therefore, MIDs were calculated by using a one-half standard deviation of each scale in either direction based on the data of this study cohort, i.e. based on all observations of change from baseline to each time point (Table S2 shows MID of each BCPT symptom and LASA QoL scale).

Patients completed the QoL forms at the clinic, before diagnostic procedures (exception: baseline) or treatment was given and regardless of disease status, at baseline and every six months up to two years after randomisation. Sub-study eligibility exceptions were cognitive or physical impairment that interfered with the QoL assessment, or inability to read any of the languages available on the forms.

Prospectively-defined hypotheses

Primary

Twelve months after randomisation (i.e. after a 3-month break and before patients in the intermittent group start letrozole again) hot flushes will be worse in patients receiving continuous compared with those receiving intermittent letrozole.

Secondary

Twelve months after randomisation, both musculoskeletal and vaginal problems will be worse in patients receiving continuous compared with those receiving intermittent letrozole.
Starting and stopping treatment repeatedly over 2 years for patients randomised to receive intermittent letrozole is more burdensome on a global QoL level compared with patients receiving continuous letrozole.

### Unraveling the bidirectional link between cancer and dementia and the impact of cancer therapies on dementia risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YZchS]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This comprehensive meta‐analysis of cohort studies indicated a negative bidirectional link between cancer and dementia, with cancer treatment modifying dementia risk to some extent. The pooled estimates indicated that tamoxifen (for breast cancer) and chemotherapy (for ACC) reduced the risk of AD by 21% and 18%, respectively. Tamoxifen acts as an estrogen receptor modulator (Figure S23 in supporting information). In the mammary tissues, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist, blocking estrogen receptors to prevent cell proliferation and protect against breast cancer. In contrast, in the brain tissue, tamoxifen functions as an agonist on estrogen receptors, promoting pro‐estrogenic effects that inhibit amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation, providing neuroprotection and potentially reducing the risk of AD. However, it must be noted that only tamoxifen but not other endocrine therapies such as aromatase inhibitors or raloxifene, has such an influence on the breast cancer–AD association. The exact mechanism by which chemotherapy reduces the risk of AD remains unclear. Cramer et al.found that bexarotene promotes Aβ clearance in multiple transgenic mouse models of AD, and Chu et al.noted that imatinib could prevent the accumulation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylation of tau in 3×Tg AD mice. The impact of these chemotherapies on AD pathology in humans is yet to be investigated. Intriguingly, ADT increased the risk of ACD (26%) and AD (9%) in prostate cancer patients. ADT may suppress testosterone production, which subsequently increases the levels of beta‐site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and decreases the activity of the Aβ catabolizing enzyme neprilysin (NEP). These changes promote Aβ accumulation, potentially increasing the risk of AD(Figure S24 in supporting information). ADT is often administered over 12 to 18 months; the long‐term use of ADT depletes androgen levels, which could contribute to cognitive impairment, given the neuroprotective effect of androgen.

### Long-term assessment of quality of life in the intergroup exemestane study: 5 years post-randomisation [^111HFA1R]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are very few long-term reports of QoL using patient-reported outcomes from standardised measures in women who have had hormone therapy for breast cancer for 5 years. The persistence of different endocrine symptoms, which although not life threatening can be detrimental to QoL, are largely unknown compared with acute short-term side-effects.

The IES on-treatment results are consistent with the findings from the other main AI trials with patient-reported outcomes in that AIs are well tolerated with good overall QoL. The TEAM trial published self-reported neuropsychological outcomes and showed that neither tamoxifen nor exemestane increased the reports of cognitive failures compared with healthy controls. However, little data are available on the post-treatment impact on QoL in these studies. Therefore, IES is the only major study reported to date showing the decline in patient-reported symptoms following AI or tamoxifen treatment. It is important to note, however, that compliance of questionnaire completion post treatment was significantly reduced, particularly in countries where questionnaires were completed in clinics before appointments. Higher completion rates were achieved when questionnaires were sent out by post, directly to the patient, as was the case in UK, suggesting that this may be the method of choice for future studies.

### Association between hormone-modulating breast cancer therapies and incidence of neurodegenerative outcomes for women with breast cancer [^11616L4v]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Previous reports have typically focused on a single drug and disease outcome, which limits the scope of the translational outcomes. We have included all HMTs used in breast cancer treatment as well as multiple age-associated NDDs. These treatments generally fall into 2 classes: SERMs and aromatase inhibitors. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors exhibited the strongest association with reducing the incidence of AD and related dementia. The protection associated with the SERMs was exclusively due to tamoxifen and not to raloxifene. This finding might explain why previous studies using SERMs were not found to be effective because raloxifene was the focus of several of these AD trials. Mechanistically, tamoxifen and raloxifene are known to act in a tissue-specific manner. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are known estrogen receptor antagonists in breast tissue but show divergent actions in uterine tissue, and brain tissue. Aromatase inhibitors are known to act systemically to decrease the amount of estrogen. However, a recent study suggests that there also may be divergent actions of aromatase inhibitors in specific brain regions. Alternatively, upstream precursors of estrogen, such as testosterone and androstenedione, which may be increased by aromatase inhibitors, can be associated with cognition. If tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are acting to increase estrogen-related actions in brain tissue, the argument for the protective association of estrogen with AD-related outcomes is strengthened.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^116jCWHk]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical considerations

The protocol-specified primary comparison was the change in the composite score of the CogState tasks over 1 year for women randomised to tamoxifen +OFS vs tamoxifen alone. Due to low accrual to the substudy, this was modified, prior to any analysis, to compare the pooled tamoxifen+OFS and exemestane+OFS groups with the tamoxifen alone group. The observed sample size provided 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.76 with two-sided α = 0.05. Cognitive test scores were transformed, standardised according to age-specific norms, and the resulting Z -scores averaged to calculate the composite score. Individual Z -scores more than 1.96 s.d. below the norm were defined as 'impaired'.The change in composite scores between T0 and T1 were calculated; a negative change in composite score indicated deterioration in cognitive function. Changes in composite score and individual tasks were compared between treatment groups using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Effect sizes for the comparison of treatments were calculated as mean change in OFS groups minus mean change in tamoxifen alone group divided by the pooled s.d. of the change for the composite score and each task. According to convention, effect sizes of + 0.2 was considered small, + 0.5 moderate and + 0.8 large. Sensitivity analyses compared treatment groups using regression modelling, adjusting for patient, disease and treatment characteristics at baseline: language and treatment assignment, age, family history of breast cancer, body mass index, menstruation status, history and/or treatment of anxiety/depression, nodal status and prior chemotherapy and use of HER2-targeted treatment. Characteristics were compared between treatment groups using Fisher's exact tests. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated between composite score and patient-reported outcome measures.

### Cognitive complaints during breast cancer endocrine therapy: aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen [^116DK6EL]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2022). High credibility.

Objective

Previous data hypothesise that women receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs) exhibit worse cognitive functioning than patients on tamoxifen (TAM) since their oestrogen levels are lower. We aimed to compare cognitive complaints in both groups.

Methods

From September 2020 to January 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional study on patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing adjuvant endocrine therapy for at least 6 months. Cognitive complaints were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive V.3 questionnaire with higher scores indicating better outcomes.

Results

We included 108 female patients, 60 on AI and 48 on TAM. Mean age at diagnosis was 52 (44 in the TAM group vs 58 in the AI group, p < 0.001). Assessment of 'perceived cognitive impairment-20 subscale' did not identify a significant difference between the two groups (mean score: patients on AI = 63/80 vs patients on TAM = 58/80, p = 0.198). Patients on TAM scored significantly worse than patients on AI (p < 0.001) on the concentration complaints, while for the verbal domain, memory, multitasking, speed and functional interference, no significant difference between the two groups was observed. The difference in concentration complaints was maintained after adjustment to age, educational level, physical activity, prior exposure to chemotherapy, and living alone or with others. Finally, a favourable impact of regular physical activity on concentration scores was observed in both groups (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Despite age difference, patients on AI did not demonstrate worse complaints than patients on TAM. Patients on TAM exhibited significantly increased concentration complaints. Oncologists should carefully screen their patients for mental fog and educate them on the importance of regular exercise.

### What is the nature and impact of cognitive difficulties following hormonal treatments for prostate cancer? an interpretative phenomenological analysis [^115hzoXb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Our respondents were unclear regarding the aetiology of cognitive changes following hormonal treatment, as these changes were co-occurring with other potential causal factors including other cancer treatments, ageing, co-morbid illnesses and psychological factors (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress). For instance, ageing-related decreases in testosterone levels have been associated with decline in memory functioning, processing speed, visuospatial skills and visuomotor abilities in older men, which are consistent with neuroanatomical areas containing androgen receptor expression (hippocampus, amygdala, etc.). Development of CRCI is likely multifactorial associated with the cancer itself, cancer treatments, exposure to hormonal treatments, genetic susceptibilities and other medical comorbidities. Cancer and its treatments have also been associated with chronic neuroinflammation, DNA-damage, endothelial dysfunction, all increasing risk of brain ageing. Moreover, our data highlighted the perceptions of accelerated brain ageing following treatment, which support preliminary neuroimaging data. Additionally, we explored how clusters of co-occurring, interrelated symptoms (e.g. hot flashes, sleep problems, insomnia, fatigue and depression) may lead to cognitive deficits. Causal relationships, however, are currently speculative, requiring further investigation. Furthermore, older individuals are likely more sensitive to declines in androgen levels, treatment-related toxicities and disturbances in physical and psychological functioning, increasing the risk of CRCI.

### Cognitive effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy in older women treated for early-stage breast cancer: a 1-year longitudinal study [^111B1iL4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Evidence suggests endocrine therapy (ET) for breast cancer (BC) has adverse cognitive effects, but its specific effects on older women are unknown. This is despite the fact that older women are at increased risk of both breast cancer (BC) and cognitive decline relative to younger women. This study prospectively examined the cognitive effects of ET in a cohort of older BC patients. Our primary outcome measure was change in verbal memory, the cognitive domain most consistently affected by estrogen deprivation.

Methods

Forty-two chemotherapy-naïve women age 60+, without dementia and recently diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive BC, completed neuropsychological tests at the time of ET initiation and after 1 year of treatment. Change in age-standardized verbal memory performance was examined using paired t tests. To assess a broader range of potential cognitive effects, we also examined changes in visual memory, processing speed, frontal executive function, and perceptual reasoning.

Results

Participants exhibited significant decline from baseline to 1 year in verbal memory (p = 0.01). This decline was small to moderate in effect size (d = -0.40). Performance on other domains did not change significantly over the year (all p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest potentially detrimental effects of ET on verbal memory in older women after just 1 year of treatment. Given that ET is prescribed for courses of 5 to 10 years, additional studies examining longer-term effects of treatment in older women are critical.

### Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review [^117FGQ9b]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

Advances in breast cancer treatments have significantly extended patient survival. However, with a growing number of patients experiencing cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), clinicians must now account for the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and newer therapies. Integrating comprehensive cognitive assessments into routine cancer care can aid in early detection. Furthermore, recognizing CRCI's impact on daily functioning and its complex association with psychological well-being, fatigue, and overall quality of life, can help clinicians develop personalized interventions and preventive approaches. This would facilitate bridging the gap between cancer care and cognitive health in a holistic patient-centered approach.

### Effects of tamoxifen on cognitive function in patients with primary breast cancer [^112DnEAe]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tamoxifen may adversely affect cognitive function by interfering with estrogen action in the brain. Despite growing evidence for a relationship between tamoxifen and cognitive problems, findings remain inconclusive. While some tamoxifen-related side effects seem exposure-dependent with concentrations of tamoxifen or its main metabolite, endoxifen, this has never been investigated for cognitive function. We investigated cognitive function after two years of tamoxifen and its association with tamoxifen and endoxifen exposure.

Methods

135 women with breast cancer completed the Amsterdam Cognition Scan (ACS), an online neuropsychological test battery, after two years of tamoxifen. Test scores were converted to standardized Z-scores based on a matched 'no-cancer' control group. Tamoxifen and endoxifen concentrations and tamoxifen dose were regressed separately on cognitive functioning.

Results

Patients reported mild cognitive complaints and had worse verbal learning, processing speed, executive functioning, and motor functioning compared to matched controls. After correcting for age, mean tamoxifen and endoxifen levels, as well as tamoxifen dose, were associated with worse performance on several cognitive domains.

Conclusion

Tamoxifen is adversely associated with objective as well as self-reported cognitive function, which may depend on the level of exposure to tamoxifen and endoxifen. Further research is warranted to confirm this hypothesis.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114EnKPE]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy — safety signals and cognitive outcomes: In women with prior hysterectomy, CE alone for 6.8 years produced a statistically significant increase in stroke and deep venous thrombosis, while breast cancer, coronary heart disease, total venous thromboembolism (VTE), and pulmonary embolism were not statistically increased. In the WHI Memory Study, a statistically significant increase in probable dementia was observed in women aged 65 to 79 years who received EPT for a mean of 4.0 years, whereas after a mean follow-up of 5.2 years there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased probable dementia in women allocated to ET. Subgroup analyses suggest more favorable benefit-risk when hormone therapy is initiated in women aged 60 years and younger and within 10 years of menopause.

### Understanding the impact of breast cancer adjuvant endocrine therapy on cognitive function: a work in progress [^111AFkX5]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, due to low accrual at the substudy participating centres and early closure of the parent trial, the sample recruited for Co-SOFT was substantially smaller than expected. The protocol was then revised to compare the tamoxifen sample to the combined OFS arms of the study, and we are told that the observed sample size (86 enrolled and 74 evaluable, in a two-group design) provided 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.76 with a two-sided α = 0.05. This is a large effect size for comparison of two endocrine therapies with overlapping toxicities and mechanisms of action. The authors do not report the original effect size that the study had been planned to detect, and it is likely that it was much smaller. Thus, the comparison presented in this analysis is underpowered to detect a likely difference of a small to medium effect between tamoxifen alone and the two OFS groups.

Additional concerns about the current report include the fact that while patients were randomly assigned to the three SOFT trial arms before being approached for Co-SOFT, the substudy inclusion required that patients could not have initiated endocrine therapy prior to randomisation (true for ∼70% of patients enrolled during the period of recruitment). However, use of endocrine therapy prior to randomisation was not a trial stratification factor, and thus those who were eligible for the Co-SOFT study may not have been randomly allocated. Further undermining the likelihood that the final Co-SOFT sample reflects the trial random assignments is the fact that only 86 of 102 eligible patients joined the substudy during the recruitment period, and only 74 were assessed at two time points (before treatment and 1 year later). Thus, the treatment arms compared in this report reflect an observational cohort study design, with the sample being drawn from the parent SOFT trial.

### Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop [^115VRQuw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction may occur in some patients who receive chemotherapy. We provide a summary of an April 2003 workshop on this topic, that included medical oncologists, radiologists, clinical and experimental psychologists, and patient advocates. Current studies indicate that cognitive deficits are often subtle, although they are observed consistently in a proportion of patients, may be durable, and can be disabling. Deficits have been observed in a range of cognitive functions. Underlying mechanisms are unknown, although preliminary studies suggest there may be genetic predisposition and that cognitive impairment may be accompanied by changes in the brain detectable by neuroimaging. The following priorities were established for future research: (1) large-scale clinical studies that use both a longitudinal design and concurrent evaluation of patients with cancer who do not receive chemotherapy-such studies should address the probability and magnitude of cognitive deficits, factors that predict them, and underlying mechanisms; (2) exploration of discrepancies between subjective reports of cognitive dysfunction and the objective results of cognitive testing; (3) studies of cognitive function in patients receiving treatment for diseases other than breast cancer, and in both men and women, to address the hypothesis that underlying mechanisms relate to changes in serum levels of sex hormones and/or to chemotherapy-induced menopause; (4) development of interventions to alleviate these problems; and (5) development of animal models and the use of imaging techniques to address mechanisms that might cause cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy.

### The national cancer institute clinical trials planning meeting to address gaps in observational and intervention trials for cancer-related cognitive impairment [^1131KEtG]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient-reported outcome measures

Patient-reported outcome measures are important for assessing perceived cognitive function and impact related to daily function. Patient-reported outcomes–assessed cognitive symptoms of cancer-related cognitive impairment may reflect subtle changes in cognitive function that are noticeable to patients but may go undetected on formal neuropsychological assessment; these symptoms may reflect the daily functional experience of patients and family members and thus are an important element of cancer-related cognitive impairment research findings. Patient-reported outcomes–assessed cognitive symptoms of cancer-related cognitive impairment may also reflect the presence of other symptoms, such as mood disturbance, sleep disturbance, and fatigue, offering other targets for intervention.

Four main patient-reported outcomes addressing cognitive concerns that have been used in studies of cancer-related cognitive impairment are the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognition, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL measure. In several studies, a distribution-based method for estimating clinically meaningful change identified a threshold for meaningful change scores in self-reported cancer-related cognitive impairment. For example, Wagner et al. and others have used 0.5 of the SD of baseline FACT-Cog Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) subscale scores to longitudinally categorize patients as improved, worsened, or stable from baseline. Thus, patient-reported outcomes measures of cancer-related cognitive impairment can enable researchers to detect a perceived problem or change from the patient's perspective; even subtle changes can be important to the patient with regard to impact on functioning and health-related QOL. Forms completed by informants who know the patient well can provide complementary information about the patient's overall cognitive functioning.

Adding cognitive patient-reported outcomes as secondary endpoints for existing clinical treatment trials yields valuable opportunities to improve understanding of the longitudinal trajectory of cancer-related cognitive impairment, and randomization offers the opportunity evaluate the contribution of cancer treatments to cancer-related cognitive impairment, given that baseline characteristics are comparable between treatment arms. For example, the Hormone Therapy With or Without Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Women Who Have Undergone Surgery for Node-Negative Breast Cancer (TAILORx) trial (identifier NCT00310180) randomly assigned women with early-stage breast cancer to chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy vs endocrine therapy alone, allowing the research team to quantify the extent to which chemotherapy was associated with cancer-related cognitive impairment compared with endocrine therapy alone. Thus, NCTN treatment trials offer opportunities to use randomization to assess cognitive changes in patients receiving different treatments with low assessment burden.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^116SoPdP]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Table 3 shows the number of women that met the definition for impairment on each cognitive task at each timepoint. The task for which the largest proportion of women changed from normal to impaired status between T0 and T1 was the learning task; for which 22% of those on OFS and 15% of those on tamoxifen went from normal to impaired and conversely 7% of those on OFS and 20% of those on tamoxifen went from impaired to normal. It has to be noted that the numbers in the various subgroups are too small for a conclusive interpretation.

Table 4 shows the patient reported outcome data. The change in self-reported cognitive function between T0 and T1 indicated greater decline in patients receiving OFS vs those receiving tamoxifen alone (mean ± s.d. 7.8 ± 13.1 vs 1.1 ± 9.7, effect size = 0.53). Note that higher CFQ scores indicate worse self-reported cognitive function, thus a positive change score indicates deterioration. No correlation was observed between objective cognitive function (CogState composite cognitive function score) and self-reported cognitive function (r = −0.12), fatigue (r = −0.05), psychologic distress (r = 0.06) or quality of life indicators (range, r = −0.09 to 0.16) including insomnia (r = 0.11), at year 1. However, self-reported cognitive function was moderately and positively correlated with fatigue (r = 0.55) and psychologic distress (r = 0.53) and was low to moderately correlated with quality of life indicators (range, r = −0.13 to −0.45), including insomnia (r = −0.31), at year 1.

### The effect of exercise on the alleviation of side effects induced by aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal breast cancer patients [^115YaAFD]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are effective in treating postmenopausal women suffering from estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (BC). However, AIs are also commonly associated with a number of side effects which decrease the quality of life (QoL) of the patients. This review focuses on the effects of exercise interventions on reducing the side effects commonly experienced by BC patients on AI treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent studies in the literature support that exercise interventions are feasible and improve body composition, aromatase inhibitor-induced Arthralgia (AIIA), and the overall QoL of BC patients. Successful implementation of longitudinal exercise interventions is expected to improve the QoL of BC patients on AI treatment. Future studies should therefore be carried out with a larger number of postmenopausal BC patients on AI treatment to (a) investigate the effects of exercise interventions on depression, cognitive decline, and cardiotoxicity and (b) address the motivation that should be used to keep BC survivors engaged in exercise intervention programs.

A key question that follows from these observations is whether alterations in brain structure and function can be reversed, reducing the risk of future cognitive decline. Interestingly, 1 study in PCOS suggested improvement in a single cognitive measure (verbal fluency), after combined treatment with an antiandrogen plus estrogen. Based on the current results, both insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are potential targets, and advanced MRI has a potential role as a biomarker of treatment effect.

### Effects of estrogen deprivation due to breast cancer treatment [^117BKtVD]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is one of the main life-threatening diseases that a woman may have to face during her lifetime. The increasing incidence of breast neoplasia reported over the last few decades has led to widespread screening of women resulting in early diagnosis. One common but challenging question for most doctors, after the surgical excision of the lesion, is determination of the ideal adjuvant therapy for their patients for the achievement of maximum life expectancy with the best quality of life. Since the beginning of the last century, the knowledge that breast cancer arises from hormone-responsive tissues has long made use of hormone-blocking agents in the beneficial treatment of breast neoplasia. The discovery of new molecules with endocrine actions has rendered the use of adjuvant therapy in a tailor-made pattern too complicated, as these agents have a different mode of action, different adverse effects and probably different indications. The aim of the present review is to clarify these issues, analyzing the mechanism of action of available drugs and their actions on specific areas of uncertainty: cognitive function, cardiovascular system, urogenital tract, bone metabolism, weight gain, hot flushes and premature menopause. Regarding the efficacy of adjuvant therapy, there has been particular focus on the multiple hormonal-induced consequences of each regimen in order to provide the clinician with the available data for choosing the ideal therapy for the patient.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^114zgQ7m]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The strengths of our study include the longitudinal design with a well-defined and homogenous sample of SOFT patients who had not commenced endocrine therapy, defined type and duration of endocrine therapy that was randomly assigned and the ability to control for potential confounding factors. Small sample size is the main limitation of our study, which resulted in limited power to detect a small, but potentially meaningful, effect, as might be anticipated when comparing two groups of patients receiving endocrine therapies. There is potential for sampling bias, as substudy centres enrolled only 84% of eligible patients, and the possibility that the treatment assignment was part of the decision cannot be excluded. In the future, consideration perhaps should be given to incorporating measures of cognitive function in the main study protocol, as is often done for quality of life measures, in order to avoid having uninformative data on the effects of new treatments on cognition. Other limitations include the absence of a control group not treated with any endocrine therapy and the lack of hormone testing to confirm the functional gonadal status of the women, particularly those in the tamoxifen arm, some of whom may have had chemotherapy-induced hypogonadism at T1. Also, our cognitive function test battery did not include a measure of verbal fluency and cognitive function was assessed only over the first year of adjuvant endocrine therapy, which perhaps allowed time for development of some compensation for any cognitive dysfunction related to the endocrine therapy.

Given the importance of this clinical question for women, the strong biological basis for a potential effect of OFS on cognitive function, and the limitations of our study, we believe further study of the impact of adjuvant OFS on cognitive function in breast cancer patients is warranted.

### Long-term effects on cognitive function of postmenopausal hormone therapy prescribed to women aged 50 to 55 years [^114c8WLU]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Postmenopausal hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) may adversely affect older women's cognitive function. It is not known whether this extends to younger women.

Objective

To test whether prescribing CEE-based hormone therapy to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years has longer-term effects on cognitive function.

Design

Trained, masked staff assessed participants with an annual telephone-administered cognitive battery that included measures of global and domain-specific cognitive functions. Cognitive testing was conducted an average of 7.2 years after the trials ended, when women had a mean age of 67.2 years, and repeated 1 year later. Enrollment occurred from 1996 through 1999.

Setting

Forty academic research centers.

Participants

The study population comprised 1326 postmenopausal women, who had begun treatment in 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hormone therapy when aged 50 to 55 years.

Intervention

The clinical trials in which the women had participated had compared 0.625 mg CEE with or without 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate over a mean of 7.0 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was global cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were verbal memory, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and working memory.

Results

Global cognitive function scores from women who had been assigned to CEE-based therapies were similar to those from women assigned to placebo: mean (95% CI) intervention effect of 0.02 (−0.08 to 0.12) standard deviation units (P = .66). Similarly, no overall differences were found for any individual cognitive domain (all P > .15). Prespecified subgroup analyses found some evidence that CEE-based therapies may have adversely affected verbal fluency among women who had prior hysterectomy or prior use of hormone therapy: mean treatment effects of −0.17 (−0.33 to −0.02) and −0.25 (−0.42 to −0.08), respectively; however, this may be a chance finding.

Conclusions and Relevance

CEE-based therapies produced no overall sustained benefit or risk to cognitive function when administered to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years. We are not able to address whether initiating hormone therapy during menopause and maintaining therapy until any symptoms are passed affects cognitive function, either in the short or longer term.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111UGMeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Androgens and cognition in women — Premenopausal women with higher salivary testosterone (T) scored better on spatial/mathematical testing than those with lower levels; in 38 postmenopausal women, verbal memory performance correlated with both estradiol and T levels; quality research clinical trial data for the effects of T on cognitive performance in women are lacking, although improvements in visuospatial memory have been reported after a single dose of T resulting in supraphysiological plasma levels; in hyperandrogenemic polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), 29 women compared with 22 controls performed worse on multiple cognitive tests, and in a follow-up of 19 women with PCOS, hormone suppression with estrogen and cyproterone improved only verbal fluency; a separate trial (n = 50) reported a negative effect on immediate but not delayed verbal memory over 24 weeks with T undecanoate as an oral therapy.

### The role of reproductive hormones in maintaining cognition [^1167mCqm]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article briefly reviews the impact of hormones on cognition. Estrogen has the most profound impact on brain functioning. Testosterone also seems to have significant brain-related benefits, whereas progesterone seems to have minor or possibly even adverse effects. As the field of neuroscience progresses, more definitive conclusions will follow. As the focus is shifted, however, from extending life to improving the quality of life, the existing data are very compelling. The brain is a target for the sex steroid hormones. Clearly, this is an exciting and dynamic area for further study. Although skeptics may believe that more definitive proof is necessary before recommending hormone replacement for their patients to preserve their cognitive health, it seems prudent to discuss the evidence available to empower the patient further to guide their own treatment options and validate their symptoms. For those who still subscribe to the menopause-is-natural philosophy this question is posed, "why does the brain naturally have sex hormone receptors if they are not necessary?"

### Neuropsychological dysfunction associated with cancer and cancer therapies: a conceptual review of an emerging target [^115n211B]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

HORMONAL THERAPY

Principle: Abrupt alteration of an individual's hormonal milieu has been associated with neurocognitive and neurobehavioural impairments. The effects of more insidious and less direct hormonal alterations are largely unknown.

Oestrogen receptors have been discovered in many areas of the brain important for cognitive functioning including the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, amygdala, and CA1 of the hippocampus. Human and animal studies have elucidated several possible mechanisms through which oestrogen affects neurocognitive and neurobehavioural function including: (1) increasing cholinergic activity through its actions on choline acetyltransferase; (2) maintenance of dendritic spine density on CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus; (3) facilitating induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus; (4) increasing serotonergic and cholinergic activity, thereby maintaining neural circuitry; (5) altering lipoprotein; and (6) decreasing the risk of cerebral ischaemia.

The effects of hormonal challenges in women (e.g. antioestrogens) have been examined with both neuroimaging and neurocognitive probes. In summary, a pattern of relative hypometabolism in prefrontal cortex has been demonstrated with PET, and neurocognitive impairments in memory, executive function, and motor coordination have been reported. The severity of these impairments varies, but has occasionally been reported to result in impairments of daily living and vocational function.

Tamoxifen is a widely used selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the treatment of breast cancer. It is estimated that approximately 11% of women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Moreover, in the United States, it is estimated that based on year 2000 census data more than 2 million women could benefit from prophylactic use of TAM, highlighting the importance of understanding the potential neurocognitive side effects of this agent. TAM is known to have both agonist and antagonist effects in the periphery and in the brain. It has also been reported to influence the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF) that are associated with cognitive dysfunction. Retrospective investigations examining the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy on neurocognitive function in breast cancer patients have not found differences between women who either received or did not receive TAM subsequent to chemotherapy (Schagen et al, 1999). However, PET imaging has demonstrated greater prefrontal hypometabolism in women with treatment histories that included both chemotherapy and TAM compared to women treated with chemotherapy alone.

### Cognitive effects of estradiol after menopause: a randomized trial of the timing hypothesis [^116LVtBt]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that effects of estrogen-containing hormone therapy on cognitive abilities differ between postmenopausal women near to, and further from, menopause.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, healthy women within 6 years of menopause or 10+ years after menopause were randomly assigned to oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg/d or placebo. Women with a uterus received cyclic micronized progesterone vaginal gel or placebo. The primary outcome assessed at 2.5 and 5 years, compared between treatment groups, was change in a standardized composite of neuropsychological test scores assessing verbal episodic memory. Secondary outcomes assessed executive functions and global cognition.

Results

A total of 567 women were included in modified intention-to-treat analyses after a mean treatment duration of 57 months. For verbal memory, the mean estradiol minus placebo standardized difference in composite scores (-0.06, 95% confidence interval -0.22 to 0.09) was not significant (2-tailed p = 0.33). Differences were similar in early and late postmenopause groups (2-tailed interaction p = 0.88). Interactions between postmenopause groups and differences between treatment groups were not significant for executive functions or global cognition.

Conclusions

Estradiol initiated within 6 years of menopause does not affect verbal memory, executive functions, or global cognition differently than therapy begun 10+ years after menopause. Estradiol neither benefits nor harms these cognitive abilities regardless of time since menopause.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class I evidence that estradiol initiated within 6 years of menopause does not affect cognition at 2.5 years differently than estradiol initiated 10+ years after menopause.

### An evaluation of analytical approaches for understanding change in cognition in the context of aging and health [^111CGHnD]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

In this article, we discuss the importance of studying the relationship between health and cognitive function, and some of the methods with which this relationship has been studied.

Methods

We consider the challenges involved, in particular operationalization of the health construct and causal inference in the context of observational data. We contrast the approaches taken, and review the questions addressed: whether health and cognition are associated, whether changes in health are associated with changes in cognition, and the degree of interdependency among their respective trajectories.

Results

A variety of approaches for understanding the association between cognition and health in aging individuals have been used. Much of the literature on cognitive change and health has relied on methods that are based at least in part on the reorganization of between-person differences (e.g., cross-lag analysis) rather than relying more fully on analysis of within-person change and joint analysis of individual differences in within-person change in cognition and health.

Discussion

We make the case for focusing on the interdependency between within-person changes in health and cognition and suggest methods that would support this.

### The expanding use of third-generation aromatase inhibitors: what the general internist needs to know [^116dSv2r]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer patients represent the largest group of adult cancer survivors in the US. Most breast cancers in women 50 years of age and older are hormone receptor positive. Third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the newest class of drugs used in treating hormone responsive breast cancer. It is often during start of adjuvant hormone therapy that the breast cancer patient establishes (or reestablishes) close follow-up with their general internist.

Objective

Given the large numbers of breast cancer patients in the US and the increasing use of third generation AI's, general internists will need to have a clear understanding of these drugs including their benefits and potential harms. Currently there are three third generation aromatase inhibitors FDA approved for use in the US. All have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in disease free survival (DFS) in the treatment of both metastatic and early breast cancers.

Results

While the data on side effects is limited, AI (compared to tamoxifen) may result in higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures, more arthralgias, and increased vaginal dryness and dysparuenia. Limited information on their effects on the cardiovascular system and neuro-cognitive function are also available. Patient's receiving adjuvant hormone therapy are generally considered disease free or disease stable and require less intensive monitoring by their breast cancer specialist.

Conclusions

In situations where patients experience significant negative side effects from AI therapy, discussions to discontinue treatment (and switch to an alternative endocrine therapy) should involve the cancer specialist and take into consideration the patient's risk for breast cancer recurrence and the impact of therapy on their quality of life. In some cases, patients may choose to never initiate AI treatment. In other cases, patients may choose to prematurely discontinue therapy even if therapy is well tolerated. In both settings increased knowledge by the general internists will likely facilitate discussions of risks versus benefits of therapy and possibly improve compliance to adjuvant hormone therapy.

### Effects of tamoxifen and exemestane on cognitive functioning of postmenopausal patients with breast cancer: results from the neuropsychological side study of the tamoxifen and exemestane adjuvant multinational trial [^112ZJ25a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the influence of adjuvant tamoxifen and exemestane on cognitive functioning in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer (BC).

Patients and Methods

Neuropsychological assessments were performed before the start (T1) and after 1 year of adjuvant endocrine treatment (T2) in Dutch postmenopausal patients with BC, who did not receive chemotherapy. Patients participated in the international Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational trial, a prospective randomized study investigating tamoxifen versus exemestane as adjuvant therapy for hormone-sensitive BC.

Results

Participants included 80 tamoxifen users (mean age, 68.7 years; range 51 to 84), 99 exemestane users (mean age, 68.3 years; range, 50 to 82), and 120 healthy controls (mean age, 66.2 years; range, 49 to 86). At T2, after adjustment for T1 performance, exemestane users did not perform statistically significantly worse than healthy controls on any cognitive domain. In contrast, tamoxifen users performed statistically significantly worse than healthy controls on verbal memory (P < .01; Cohen's d = .43) and executive functioning (P = .01; Cohen's d = .40), and statistically significantly worse than exemestane users on information processing speed (P = .02; Cohen's d = .36). With respect to visual memory, working memory, verbal fluency, reaction speed, and motor speed, no significant differences between the three groups were found.

Conclusion

After 1 year of adjuvant therapy, tamoxifen use is associated with statistically significant lower functioning in verbal memory and executive functioning, whereas exemestane use is not associated with statistically significant lower cognitive functioning in postmenopausal patients with BC. Our results accentuate the need to include assessments of cognitive effects of adjuvant endocrine treatment in long-term safety studies.

### Cancer and cancer-therapy related cognitive dysfunction: an international perspective from the venice cognitive workshop [^114R5PmG]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

A subset of survivors has cognitive impairment after cancer treatment. This is generally subtle, but may be sustained. In October 2006, the second international cognitive workshop was held in Venice. The workshop included neuropsychologists, clinical and experimental psychologists, medical oncologists, imaging experts, and patient advocates. The main developments since the first Cognitive Workshop in 2003 have been the following. (i) studies evaluating cognitive function in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancers other than breast cancer, and in patients receiving hormonal therapy for cancer. (ii) The publication of longitudinal prospective studies which have shown that some patients already exhibit cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing before receiving chemotherapy, and some patients have deterioration in cognitive functioning from pre- to postchemotherapy. (iii) Studies of the underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairment both in patients and in animal models. (iv) Use of structural and functional imaging techniques to study changes in brain morphology and activation patterns associated with chemotherapy. (v) At present cognitive research in cancer is limited by methodological challenges and the lack of standardization in neuropsychological studies. The current workshop addressed many of these issues and established an international task force to provide guidelines for future research and information on how best to manage these symptoms.

### Cognitive function and reproductive hormones in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer: a critical review [^1167thd4]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

Deterioration in cognitive function-particularly learning, memory, and attention-has been reported by women with breast cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Deficits in cognitive function reported by women with breast cancer are similar to those experienced by women as a consequence of natural or surgical menopause. The basis of these deteriorations may include reductions in reproductive hormone levels, particularly estrogens and progesterones, that occur as a result of adjuvant chemotherapy. This paper critically examines the literature related to the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy and reproductive hormone changes on cognitive function in women with breast cancer and suggests direction for future research in this area. The paper proposes a framework for investigation of the problem and discusses the challenges associated with the conduct of this research.

### Effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene on memory and other cognitive abilities: cognition in the study of tamoxifen and raloxifene [^1173jvzn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effects of two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and raloxifene, on global and domain-specific cognitive function.

Patients and Methods

The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project's Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) study was a randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen 20 mg/d or raloxifene 60 mg/d in healthy postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. The 1,498 women who were randomly assigned in STAR were age 65 years and older, were not diagnosed with dementia, and were enrolled onto the Cognition in the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (Co-STAR) trial, beginning 18 months after STAR enrollment started. A cognitive test battery modeled after the one used in the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) was administered. Technicians were centrally trained to administer the battery and recertified every 6 months. Analyses were conducted on all participants and on 273 women who completed the first cognitive battery before they started taking their medications.

Results

Overall, there were no significant differences in adjusted mean cognitive scores between the two treatment groups across visits. There were significant time effects across the three visits for some of the cognitive measures. Similar results were obtained for the subset of women with true baseline measures.

Conclusion

Tamoxifen and raloxifene are associated with similar patterns of cognitive function in postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer. Future comparisons between these findings and patterns of cognitive function in hormone therapy and placebo groups in WHISCA should provide additional insights into the effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene on cognitive function in older women.

### Effects of hormone therapy on brain structure: a randomized controlled trial [^113B1uF6]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Among older women who received estrogen treatment in the WHIMS-MRI, lower regional brain volume was associated with greater cognitive decline or dementia. By contrast, we observed a change in brain structure over 4 years of hormone therapies that did not correlate with changes in cognitive function of recently menopausal women. The interpretation of this absence of an association between imaging findings and cognitive findings remains uncertain. On one hand, it is possible that the women who experienced structural brain changes with hormone therapies early in menopause will develop cognitive decline during an extended follow-up, and if proven, the imaging findings would be useful early surrogates of future clinical events. On the other hand, it is possible that these brain changes will subside after cessation of hormone therapy, and women who had structural brain changes during the 4 years of postmenopausal hormone therapy will not have an increased risk of cognitive decline over a longer follow-up. In the WHIMS-MRI studies, even though the brain volumes were smaller in women who received CEE therapies compared to placebo years after the end of the treatment phase, the rates of decline in brain volumes remained similar to the placebo group in the years following the cessation of CEE therapies. Thus, the short-term effects of estrogen treatment on the vascular system and on the brain may be different from long-term effects, and even opposed. Participants of the KEEPS-MRI study are being followed to determine whether these changes in brain structure are persistent after 4 years of hormone treatment and whether women with structural brain changes will develop clinically detectable cognitive decline.

### Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review [^115AWShn]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective cognitive functioning

Eleven systematic reviews exclusively investigated objective cognitive functioning as assessed by standardized tests. Six reviews investigated the cognitive effects of chemotherapy.

One reviewshowed that compared to baseline assessments or healthy control data, attention, concentration, and executive functions were significantly impaired in patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy.

Similarly, Huehnchen et alfound evidence that combinations of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and taxanes were associated with cognitive impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Another reviewfound the presence of cognitive impairment in Patients with BC treated with chemotherapy, especially concerning verbal memory, processing speed, and executive functioning.

In the same line, Di Iulio et alfound that chemotherapy, alone and combined with hormonal therapy, influenced in particular fluency, memory, executive function, and motor speed.

Similarly, Cerulla-Torrente et alfound cognitive impairment in attention, memory, executive functions, and processing speed. Cognitive impairment was frequent at the end of chemotherapy, and it seemed to gradually improve 1–2 years after treatment.

Finally, Yao et alfocused on executive functioning (ie, inhibition, shifting, and updating), finding that inhibition appears spared from the effects of chemotherapy, whereas impairments in shifting and updating were more commonly found across studies.

Four systematic reviews focused on endocrine therapy. Lee et alfound that endocrine therapy was associated with impaired performance in learning/memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and language.

Another reviewrevealed that endocrine therapies were accompanied by altered cognitive abilities, including verbal memory, fluency, motor speed, attention, and working memory. Tamoxifen was related to decreased cognitive performances compared with aromatase inhibitors.

Similarly, Jebahi et alfound that tamoxifen negatively affected cognitive performance on immediate verbal memory and processing speed.

In another review, patients undergoing endocrine therapy performed worse than control groups on verbal and visual learning/memory, executive function, and processing speed. In this case, tamoxifen patients performed better than non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor recipients.

Finally, Dijkshroon et al, compared the effects of chemotherapy to the effects of hormonal therapy on cognition. Patients undergoing chemotherapy seemed to have a higher chance of cognitive decline.

Summarizing, all systematic reviews found significant cognitive impairment following chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in patients with BC, particularly in those treated with taxanes and tamoxifen. Memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed were the most affected cognitive domains.

### The effect of non-pharmacological interventions on cognitive function in cancer: an overview of systematic reviews [^113eEGX3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 75% of cancer survivors (i.e. any individual living with, or beyond, a cancer diagnosis), report experiencing cognitive impairments that can impact their ability to think clearly, make decisions, and perform daily activities. This is commonly referred to as cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). CRCI is related to a range of notable negative outcomes for cancer survivors, and can significantly impact daily activities, occupational functioning, mental health, and social functioning.

CRCI can present prior to the commencement of cancer therapies, suggesting the cancer itself may directly contribute toward CRCI. Neuroimaging has shown reduced white matter volume in breast cancer survivors prior to treatment, and some have suggested peripheral inflammatory cytokines, commonly elevated as a result of cancer, may stimulate inflammation in the brain and impact cognitive functioning. Furthermore, cancer treatments have long been understood to contribute toward CRCI. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, endocrine therapy, and surgery have all been found to be related to CRCI. Cancer therapies may be causal in the development and maintenance of CRCI through pathways such as neurotoxicity, inflammation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor changes, estrogen and androgen depletion, and immune system dysregulation. Psychosocial challenges have also been proposed to be a bidirectional causal factor in the development and maintenance of CRCI. Cognitive impairment is a key domain of mental health challenges, including depression and anxiety, which are particularly common in cancer survivorship.

Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of hormones are apparent in healthy individuals, aligning with the "healthy cell bias".E2-based MHTs may be most effective as prophylactic measures rather than treatments for existing cognitive deficits. Our study provides clarity on inconsistencies in the literature, highlighting the influence of route of administration of MHT and cognitive domain tested. An understanding of how MHT factors influence cognitive health is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate long-term neurologic risks in women.

### What is the nature and impact of cognitive difficulties following hormonal treatments for prostate cancer? an interpretative phenomenological analysis [^111vEoij]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) and its impact on individuals and families are gaining attention in cancer survivorship. In prostate cancer, one of the most common malignancies worldwide reported cognitive side-effects from hormonal treatments are not uncommon. Prevalence ranges between 10 and 69% of prostate cancer survivors (PCS). Hormonal treatments for prostate cancer involve suppressing production of androgens (e.g. testosterone, estradiol) to reduce tumour growth. This can be achieved by decreasing androgen production (e.g. luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, orchiectomy, CYP17 inhibitors), and/or blocking androgen in the body (e.g. anti-androgens, androgen receptor antagonists). Hormonal treatments are often combined with other treatment modalities (radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy) and can be administered continuously or intermittently.

Increasingly research supports the role of sex hormones, such as androgens, in cognitive functioning. Androgens and their metabolites have been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in maintaining cognitive functions. Cognitive changes following hormonal treatments for prostate cancer often occur in the context of an ageing population already at risk of developing cognitive impairments (mean age at diagnosis is around 65 years), where a myriad of age- and treatment-related factors (e.g. biological, psychological, socio-environmental, cancer and accumulated toxicities from treatment) likely contribute to cognitive changes. Other factors may include cancer stage, comorbid health conditions or impacts of hot flashes, fatigue, sleep disturbances and psychological morbidity (e.g. depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress).

CRCI is often mild to moderate in nature and can be transient or more persistent. The complex interplay of aforementioned factors underlying CRCI in PCS likely contributes to reported brain fog and disruptions to attentional processes leading to declines in other cognitive domains such as memory and higher-order executive functions. These cognitive difficulties may significantly impact quality of life, interpersonal, psychological, role and occupational functioning, as well as autonomy and safety, especially in older individuals. Moreover, PCS on hormonal treatments often report increased emotional lability, irritability and anger. Challenges with emotional and/or behavioural regulation likely impact relationship dynamics. However, little is known about any possible interaction between CRCI and relationship dynamics in PCS.

There is limited research exploring PCS experiences of CRCI following hormonal treatment and the impact of these changes on their lives and their families. This study aims to qualitatively explore the nature and impact of cognitive changes following hormonal treatments in PCS from the perspective of PCS and their partners.

### Impact on quality of life of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer [^1128Qn7z]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Late toxicities of adjuvant chemotherapy and side effects of endocrine therapy may cause long-term quality-of-life impairments for some individuals who have been treated for breast cancer. Chemotherapy has been associated with durable effects on cognitive function and fatigue and with the induction of menopause. Endocrine therapies can increase menopausal and sexual symptoms and can contribute to weight gain. Overall, however, quality of life is good for the majority of breast cancer survivors who have received adjuvant systemic therapy. Behavioral interventions that target fatigue and sleep disturbance may further enhance quality of life.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cognition and mood [^111qhreH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

The above studies serve to show the difficulties in reaching firm conclusions when analysing data generated from studies which utilised a variety of different cognitive function assessment tools and in which there is a range of HRT regimes, ages, medical comorbidities and menopausal status of participants. Moreover, the healthy user bias, whereby women of generally better health are more likely to opt to start HRT, confounds observational studies. RCTs seek to overcome the limiting factors such as healthy user bias posed by observational studies. As exemplified above the findings from these are conflicting.

Discussion

The longitudinal effects of ET on HRQoL that have been described. – Table 3 summarizes published literature and notes differential pattern on QoL by type of ET prescribed. – The NSAS BC 03 trial comparing Tam with Anastrozole observed that among younger postmenopausal women, the Tam group had better FACT-B, FACT-G, and the FACT-ES scores compared with the anastrozole group (p = 0.042, 0.038, and 0.005, respectively). Results of the randomized National Surgical Adjuvant Study of Breast Cancer (N-SAS BC) trial on women aged ≥ 60 years, who had received definitive surgery for hormone receptor-positive BC and ET, reported significantly worse diarrhea and headache in the AI group compared with the Tam group. The NSAS BC 04 trial that includes a smaller number of patients (n = 166) compared Tamoxifen to exemestane and reported that the FACT-B scores improved after treatment began and remained significantly higher in the tamoxifen group than in the exemestane or anastrozole groups for 1 year (p = 0.045). The Tam Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial compared Tam to exemestane and reported that exemestane users experienced more insomnia compared with those taking Tam. Our study, focused exclusively on older postmenopausal BC patients who receive both endocrine therapy and radiation following breast conservation surgery, and our observations illustrate a differential impact of the type of ET on HRQoL. Findings from our study suggest that AI was associated with more symptoms of insomnia compared to Tam. Similar observations have been reported in TEAM trial. Based on the PROs, we note a greater decline in cognitive functioning over time within the Tam group, which raises concerns about potential cognitive side effects associated with Tam, particularly concerning in an older population already at risk for cognitive decline. In contrast, the AI group retained a relatively stable cognitive functioning, which may be a consideration for clinicians when determining treatment options.

### Cognitive impairment following breast cancer treatments: an umbrella review [^113QRcEn]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) refers to a cognitive decline associated with cancer or its treatments. While research into CRCI is expanding, evidence remains scattered due to differences in study designs, methodologies, and definitions. The present umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the impact of different breast cancer therapies on cognitive functioning, with a particular focus on the interplay among objective cognitive deficits (ie, measured with standardized tests), subjective cognitive concerns, (ie, self-reported), and other mediating psycho-physical factors.

Methods

The search was made in Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus for articles published until July 2023, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis protocol.

Results

Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy appear consistently associated with CRCI in patients with breast cancer, primarily affecting memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed. Subjective cognitive concerns were often found weakly or not associated with neuropsychological test results, while overall CRCI seemed consistently associated with psychological distress, fatigue, sleep quality, and inflammatory and biological factors.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that CRCI is common after chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. However, heterogeneity in study designs and the scarcity of studies on more recent treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, highlight the need for more systematic and harmonized studies, possibly taking into account the complex and multifactorial etiology of CRCI. This may provide valuable insights into CRCI's underlying mechanisms and potential new ways to treat it.

### Longitudinal assessment of cognitive changes associated with adjuvant treatment for breast cancer: impact of age and cognitive reserve [^112epqf6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the impact of age and cognitive reserve on cognitive functioning in patients with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant treatments.

Patients and Methods

Patients with breast cancer exposed to chemotherapy (n = 60; mean age, 51.7 years) were evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological and psychological tests before treatment and at 1, 6, and 18 months after treatment. Patients not exposed to chemotherapy (n = 72; mean age, 56.6 years) and healthy controls (n = 45; mean age, 52.9 years) were assessed at matched intervals.

Results

Mixed-effects modeling revealed significant effects for the Processing Speed and Verbal Ability domains. For Processing Speed, a three-way interaction among treatment group, age, and baseline cognitive reserve (P < .001) revealed that older patients with lower baseline cognitive reserve who were exposed to chemotherapy had lower performance on Processing Speed compared with patients not exposed to chemotherapy (P = .003) and controls (P < .001). A significant group by time interaction for Verbal Ability (P = .01) suggested that the healthy controls and no chemotherapy groups improved over time. The chemotherapy group failed to improve at 1 month after treatment but improved during the last two follow-up assessments. Exploratory analyses suggested a negative effect of tamoxifen on Processing Speed (P = .036) and Verbal Memory (P = .05) in the no-chemotherapy group.

Conclusion

These data demonstrated that age and pretreatment cognitive reserve were related to post-treatment decline in Processing Speed in women exposed to chemotherapy and that chemotherapy had a short-term impact on Verbal Ability. Exploratory analysis of the impact of tamoxifen suggests that this pattern of results may be due to a combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen.

### Cognitive function in postmenopausal women treated with raloxifene [^111ewBfF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In postmenopausal women, estrogen may have a beneficial effect on cognition or reduce the risk of decline in cognitive function. Whether raloxifene, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, might have similar actions is not known.

Methods

As part of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation trial, we studied 7478 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (mean age, 66 years), who were enrolled at 178 sites in 25 countries. The women were randomly assigned to receive raloxifene (60 mg or 120 mg) or placebo daily for three years. We compared the mean scores of the groups on six tests of cognitive function, which were administered at base line and at six months and one, two, and three years. Women were classified as having a decline in cognitive function if the change in their scores at three years was in the worst 10 percent.

Results

The mean cognitive scores in the three groups of women were similar at base line. The scores improved slightly in all three groups during the three-year study period, with no significant differences among the groups. The risk of decline in the cognitive function, as measured by four of the six tests, did not differ significantly between the two raloxifene groups combined and the placebo group, but there was a trend toward less decline in the combined raloxifene group on the two tests of verbal memory (relative risk, 0.77) and attention, (relative risk, 0.87). Newly reported or worsening hot flashes did not negatively influence test scores or the effect of treatment on test performance.

Conclusions

Raloxifene treatment for three years does not affect overall cognitive scores in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

### Association of second-generation antiandrogens with cognitive and functional toxic effects in randomized clinical trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115arr6m]. JAMA Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The use of second-generation antiandrogens (AAs) in the treatment of prostate cancer is increasing. Retrospective evidence suggests an association between second-generation AAs and adverse cognitive and functional outcomes, but further data from prospective trials are needed.

Objective

To examine whether evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in prostate cancer supports an association between second-generation AAs and cognitive or functional toxic effects.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus (inception to September 12, 2022).

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of second-generation AAs (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide) among individuals with prostate cancer that reported cognitive toxic effects, asthenic toxic effects (eg, fatigue, weakness), or falls were evaluated.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Study screening, data abstraction, and bias assessment were completed independently by 2 reviewers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research reporting guidelines. Tabular counts for all-grade toxic effects were determined to test the hypothesis formulated before data collection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk ratios (RRs) and SEs were calculated for cognitive toxic effects, asthenic toxic effects, and falls. Because fatigue was the asthenic toxic effect extracted from all studies, data on fatigue are specified in the results. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to generate summary statistics.

Results

The systematic review included 12 studies comprising 13 524 participants. Included studies had a low risk of bias. An increased risk of cognitive toxic effects (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.30–3.38; p = 0.002) and fatigue (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.54; P < .001) was noted among individuals treated with second-generation AAs vs those in the control arms. The findings were consistent in studies that included traditional hormone therapy in both treatment arms for cognitive toxic effects (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12–2.79; p = 0.01) and fatigue (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10–1.58; p = 0.003). Meta-regression supported that, across studies, increased age was associated with a greater risk of fatigue with second-generation AAs (coefficient, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.04–0.12; P < .001). In addition, the use of second-generation AAs was associated with an increased risk of falls (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.27–2.75; p = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that second-generation AAs carry an increased risk of cognitive and functional toxic effects, including when added to traditional forms of hormone therapy.

### Pharmacologic interventions to prevent cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and clinical Alzheimer-Type dementia: a systematic review [^115hrUKF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment to prevent or delay cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia is uncertain.

Purpose

To summarize current evidence on the efficacy and harms of pharmacologic interventions to prevent or delay cognitive decline, MCI, or dementia in adults with normal cognition or MCI.

Data Sources

Several electronic databases from January 2009 to July 2017, bibliographies, and expert recommendations.

Study Selection

English-language trials of at least 6 months' duration enrolling adults without dementia and comparing pharmacologic interventions with placebo, usual care, or active control on cognitive outcomes.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently rated risk of bias and strength of evidence; 1 extracted data, and a second checked accuracy.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-one unique trials were rated as having low to moderate risk of bias (including 3 that studied dementia medications, 16 antihypertensives, 4 diabetes medications, 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or aspirin, 17 hormones, and 7 lipid-lowering agents). In persons with normal cognition, estrogen and estrogen-progestin increased risk for dementia or a combined outcome of MCI or dementia (1 trial, low strength of evidence); high-dose raloxifene decreased risk for MCI but not for dementia (1 trial, low strength of evidence); and antihypertensives (4 trials), NSAIDs (1 trial), and statins (1 trial) did not alter dementia risk (low to insufficient strength of evidence). In persons with MCI, cholinesterase inhibitors did not reduce dementia risk (1 trial, low strength of evidence). In persons with normal cognition and those with MCI, these pharmacologic treatments neither improved nor slowed decline in cognitive test performance (low to insufficient strength of evidence). Adverse events were inconsistently reported but were increased for estrogen (stroke), estrogen-progestin (stroke, coronary heart disease, invasive breast cancer, and pulmonary embolism), and raloxifene (venous thromboembolism).

Limitation

High attrition, short follow-up, inconsistent cognitive outcomes, and possible selective reporting and publication.

Conclusion

Evidence does not support use of the studied pharmacologic treatments for cognitive protection in persons with normal cognition or MCI.

### Is cognitive functioning detrimentally affected after early, induced menopause? [^113zkU2R]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Investigations into the cognitive effects of surgically and chemically induced menopause are frequently combined with naturally occurring menopause and hormone therapy. However, there is some evidence that women who undergo surgical menopause may experience more cognitive decline post surgery as well as more benefit from subsequent hormone therapy use than women who experience naturally occurring menopause. Little is known about the effects of chemically induced menopause on cognitive function. The aim of this review was to examine whether premature menopause affects cognitive functioning.

Design

PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO searches of the literature published from 1988 to 2007 pertaining to the understanding of the relationships between induced menopause and cognitive dysfunction were reviewed. Those combining induced menopause with natural menopause, those involving a disease process (eg, dementia), and animal studies were excluded.

Results and Conclusions

Although smaller prospective studies have found that surgical menopause is associated with specific deficits in the memory (visual and verbal) and verbal fluency domains, larger randomized, controlled trials have generally found no effect of surgical menopause on cognitive functioning. The effects of chemical menopause are harder to assess as only three prospective trials have explicitly investigated the effect of induced menopause in the context of breast cancer treatment, and the results remain inconclusive. However, as surgical and chemical menopause both comprise the abrupt withdrawal of estrogen, there is the potential that this process may exert neurobiological effects that are different from those occurring with natural menopause and further prospective investigations comprising pre- and postsurgical/chemotherapy neuropsychological assessments are warranted.

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) refers to a cognitive decline associated with cancer or its treatments. While research into CRCI is expanding, evidence remains scattered due to differences in study designs, methodologies, and definitions. The present umbrella review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the impact of different breast cancer therapies on cognitive functioning, with a particular focus on the interplay among objective cognitive deficits (ie, measured with standardized tests), subjective cognitive concerns, (ie, self-reported), and other mediating psycho-physical factors.

Methods

The search was made in Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus for articles published until July 2023, following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis protocol.

Results

Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy appear consistently associated with CRCI in patients with breast cancer, primarily affecting memory, attention/concentration, executive functioning, and processing speed. Subjective cognitive concerns were often found weakly or not associated with neuropsychological test results, while overall CRCI seemed consistently associated with psychological distress, fatigue, sleep quality, and inflammatory and biological factors.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that CRCI is common after chemotherapy and endocrine therapy for breast cancer. However, heterogeneity in study designs and the scarcity of studies on more recent treatments such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, highlight the need for more systematic and harmonized studies, possibly taking into account the complex and multifactorial etiology of CRCI. This may provide valuable insights into CRCI's underlying mechanisms and potential new ways to treat it.

### Adjuvant ovarian function suppression and cognitive function in women with breast cancer [^117XenPa]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Although no previous study has examined the impact of adjuvant OFS on cognitive function, several studies have attempted to assess the impact of chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian insufficiency with mixed results. Recently a longitudinal neuroimaging study showed that women who had chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea showed increases in brain activation from pre to post-chemotherapy, suggesting compensatory neural activation; no increases were seen in women who did not have chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea or healthy controls.

In our study, there was greater deterioration in self-reported cognitive function in the OFS group compared with the group that received tamoxifen alone. This was an unplanned exploratory analysis and needs further prospective evaluation; however, many previous studies have found that subjective cognitive complaints are often worse than would be expected from objective cognitive function testing. There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy, but studies that have incorporated functional brain imaging suggest that patients that complain of cognitive dysfunction may reach normal performance on objective cognitive function tests by activating other brain areas not usually directly related to the cognitive task, and this may be perceived as greater effort. Our finding that self-reported cognitive function was moderately correlated with fatigue and psychologic distress is consistent with most previous studies.

### Association between menopause age and estradiol-based hormone therapy with cognitive performance in cognitively normal women in the CLSA [^112PtDQK]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Menopause is associated with reductions in ovarian hormones and with various brain changes, including an increase in estrogen receptor (ER) density across certain regions. Estrogens play a critical role in cognition and neuroplasticity. Therefore, the menopausal transition is an important period for cognitive and brain changes.

The menopausal transition is generally associated with reductions in episodic memory performance, but equivocal findings in working memory performance, which may be due to the brain region recruited during the memory test, and/or menopause-related characteristics, such as age or type of menopause. Earlier age at menopause is associated with greater cognitive decline, increased dementia risk, and greater Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology compared with a later age at menopause. Other dementia risk factors may interact with age at menopause to increase AD risk, such as APOE ε4, the greatest genetic risk factor of late-onset sporadic AD. Together, these findings suggest that menopause age can influence brain health and should be investigated in the context of evaluating interventions such as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).

MHT typically consists of exogenous estrogens and progestogens to treat menopause-related symptoms. However, its efficacy in protecting against cognitive symptoms remains debated.MHT comes in varied forms that likely exert different effects on the brain and cognition, depending on composition of hormones and administration routes. Estradiol (E2, greatest potency) and estrone (E1) decline significantly over the course of the menopausal transition, with E1 levels exceeding E2 levels after menopause.E2 dose-dependently influences neuroplasticity and certain cognitive domains in both animal models and human female individuals, including spatial and nonspatial working memory and verbal memory. However, E1 can reduce hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognition depending on dose. These findings suggest that MHT formulations, which vary by estrogen type and dose, may influence cognition differently.

### Subcutaneous testosterone-letrozole therapy before and concurrent with neoadjuvant breast chemotherapy: clinical response and therapeutic implications [^112uQgv3]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Neurotoxicity and cardiac toxicity are possible side effects of this patient's chemotherapy regimen. Both taxanes and platin compounds are listed as frequent causes of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, which can be a major dose-limiting factor.T is both neuroprotective and cardioprotective, and therefore has the potential to reduce these major side effects of chemotherapy. - T improves memory and has been used to treat peripheral nerve pain and numbness. In addition, T has been used to treat congestive heart failure (cardiac toxicity), an uncommon but serious side effect of docetaxel and both trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Even though this patient had smoked for 30 years, there were no adverse effects to her heart as documented by serial echocardiograms. In addition, there were no persistent neurological changes or complications including memory loss or peripheral neuropathy.

Testosterone reduces inflammation. Inflammation is a key factor in the etiology and progression of breast cancer, resistance to endocrine therapy, and also cardiac and neurologic side effects of chemotherapy including "chemo brain".,- T protects and stimulates the bone marrow. Its therapeutic effects in various hematologic diseases including aplastic anemia, anemia of renal failure, cyclic neutropenia, and chemotherapy-induced depression of bone marrow have been reported. Although this patient received pegfilgrastim after each chemotherapy treatment, T may have also helped maintain her blood counts. Novel cancer therapeutic strategies focus on supporting the immune system. Androgens, including T, are candidates for such treatments since they modulate immune function.-

### Male-and female-specific reproductive risk factors across the lifespan for dementia or cognitive decline: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112GDdK6]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively examined associations between sex-specific reproductive factors and dementia or cognitive decline. The findings support hormone-related mechanisms underlying links between reproductive factors and cognition. Further high-quality research is needed to elucidate the role of individual risk factors and enable precise, personalized approaches to dementia prevention.

### Adjuvant breast cancer treatment and cognitive function: current knowledge and research directions [^111pbm2t]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence is mounting that potentially curative systemic adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer may result in cognitive impairment. Five published studies have investigated cognitive function in this setting, and the consistent results of all five studies suggest an adverse effect of adjuvant chemotherapy. These studies are reviewed with particular attention to their methodologic limitations. For example, all five studies used cross-sectional designs, none controlled for possible confounding hormonal factors, and three examined patients who had not received a uniform chemotherapy regimen. The potential roles of chemotherapy-induced menopause and of adjuvant hormonal therapy in cognitive impairment are also discussed. Priorities for future research include confirmation of an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in a study with a longitudinal design, closer examination of the potential contribution of hormonal factors, and similar studies on the effect of adjuvant therapy on cognitive function in other cancer types. If an effect of systemic adjuvant therapy on cognitive function is confirmed, such an effect will have implications for informed consent. It may also result in incorporation of objective measures of cognition in clinical trials of adjuvant therapy and in the investigation of preventive interventions that might minimize the impact of cognitive dysfunction after cancer treatment.

### Patient-reported cognitive impairment among women with early breast cancer randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone versus chemoendocrine therapy: results from TAILORx [^115TrdhJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is common during adjuvant chemotherapy and may persist. TAILORx provided a novel opportunity to prospectively assess patient-reported cognitive impairment among women with early breast cancer who were randomly assigned to chemoendocrine therapy (CT+E) versus endocrine therapy alone (E), allowing us to quantify the unique contribution of chemotherapy to CRCI.

Methods

Women with a 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 enrolled in TAILORX were randomly assigned to CT+E or E. Cognitive impairment was assessed among a subgroup of 552 evaluable women using the 37-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) questionnaire, administered at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The FACT-Cog included the 20-item Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) scale, our primary end point. Clinically meaningful changes were defined a priori and linear regression was used to model PCI scores on baseline PCI, treatment, and other factors.

Results

FACT-Cog PCI scores were significantly lower, indicating more impairment, at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months compared with baseline for both groups. The magnitude of PCI change scores was greater for CT+E than E at 3 months, the prespecified primary trial end point, and at 6 months, but not at 12, 24, and 36 months. Tests of an interaction between menopausal status and treatment were nonsignificant.

Conclusion

Adjuvant CT+E is associated with significantly greater CRCI compared with E at 3 and 6 months. These differences abated over time, with no significant differences observed at 12 months and beyond. These findings indicate that chemotherapy produces early, but not sustained, cognitive impairment relative to E, providing reassurance to patients and clinicians in whom adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated to reduce recurrence risk.

### Cognitive impairment after cancer treatment: mechanisms, clinical characterization, and management [^112d9go8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a debilitating side effect experienced by patients with cancer treated with systemically administered anticancer therapies. With around 19.3 million new cases of cancer worldwide in 2020 and the five year survival rate growing from 50% in 1970 to 67% in 2013, an urgent need exists to understand enduring side effects with severe implications for quality of life. Whereas cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy is recognized in patients with breast cancer, researchers have started to identify cognitive impairment associated with other treatments such as immune, endocrine, and targeted therapies only recently. The underlying mechanisms are diverse and therapy specific, so further evaluation is needed to develop effective therapeutic interventions. Drug and non-drug management strategies are emerging that target mechanistic pathways or the cognitive deficits themselves, but they need to be rigorously evaluated. Clinically, consistent use of objective diagnostic tools is necessary for accurate diagnosis and clinical characterization of cognitive impairment in patients treated with anticancer therapies. This should be supplemented with clinical guidelines that could be implemented in daily practice. This review summarizes the recent advances in the mechanisms, clinical characterization, and novel management strategies of cognitive impairment associated with treatment of non-central nervous system cancers.

### Examining the relationship between neurosteroids, cognition, and menopause with neuroimaging methods [^1128sW1q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Previous literature has shown inconsistent findings regarding the effects of neurosteroids on the brain in postmenopausal women. The goal of this paper is to examine how and whether advances in neuroimaging have helped elucidate the relationship between the withdrawal of and/or treatment with neurosteroids and cognition at menopause.

Recent Findings

Neuroimaging techniques such as structural and functional MRI have been used in recent studies to examine the relationship between neurosteroids and brain structure and functioning. However, the recent literature shows that different formulations of postmenopausal hormones given at different times, through different routes of administration, and in different combinations with progestins result in a variety of relationships with the brain outcomes. We suggest that still further research is needed to understand how the structural changes resulting from estrogen withdrawal or therapy at menopause can influence cognitive functioning. However, imaging studies are time-, resource-, and expertise-intensive. We believe that this information will help uncover the mechanisms and relationships that can aid in the explanation of the individual differences in the effects of menopause on the brain as well as how this menopause-related hormone change influences risk for pathological aging.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1133o6H1]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency and premature or early menopause — In the absence of contraindications, hormone therapy is recommended at least until the average age of menopause (approximately age 52 y), with an option for use of oral contraceptives in healthy younger women, and results of the WHI trials in older women do not apply to women with POI or premature or early menopause. Women with POI and premature or early menopause may be at increased risk for fracture, CVD, heart failure, DM, overall mortality, persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive and mood changes, increased risk of dementia, open-angle glaucoma, depression, and poor quality of life. Unless contraindications are present, ET is indicated for women who have had BO before the average age of menopause to treat VMS, improve BMD, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, and younger women may require higher doses to relieve symptoms and protect against bone loss. In women with BO before the average age of menopause, early initiation of ET, with endometrial protection if the uterus is preserved, reduces VMS, genitourinary symptoms, risk for osteoporosis and related fractures, and likely CVD and overall mortality, with benefit seen in observational studies for CV mortality and cognitive impairment or dementia. Contraceptives may be an alternative to hormone therapy, because spontaneous pregnancy may occur in about 5% of women with POI, vaginal estrogens are effective in treating symptoms of GSM, fertility preservation and counseling should be explored for young women at risk for POI, and ovarian conservation is recommended when hysterectomy is performed for benign indications in premenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer.

### Estrogen therapy and cognition: a review of the cholinergic hypothesis [^113kgy1S]. Endocrine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The pros and cons of estrogen therapy for use in postmenopausal women continue to be a major topic of debate in women's health. Much of this debate focuses on the potential benefits vs. harm of estrogen therapy on the brain and the risks for cognitive impairment associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease. Many animal and human studies suggest that estrogens can have significant beneficial effects on brain aging and cognition and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's-related dementia; however, others disagree. Important discoveries have been made, and hypotheses have emerged that may explain some of the inconsistencies. This review focuses on the cholinergic hypothesis, specifically on evidence that beneficial effects of estrogens on brain aging and cognition are related to interactions with cholinergic projections emanating from the basal forebrain. These cholinergic projections play an important role in learning and attentional processes, and their function is known to decline with advanced age and in association with Alzheimer's disease. Evidence suggests that many of the effects of estrogens on neuronal plasticity and function and cognitive performance are related to or rely upon interactions with these cholinergic projections; however, studies also suggest that the effectiveness of estrogen therapy decreases with age and time after loss of ovarian function. We propose a model in which deficits in basal forebrain cholinergic function contribute to age-related changes in the response to estrogen therapy. Based on this model, we propose that cholinergic-enhancing drugs, used in combination with an appropriate estrogen-containing drug regimen, may be a viable therapeutic strategy for use in older postmenopausal women with early evidence of mild cognitive decline.

### What is the nature and impact of cognitive difficulties following hormonal treatments for prostate cancer? an interpretative phenomenological analysis [^114chD6F]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results highlight the nuanced and diverse range of perceived cognitive difficulties experienced by PCS undergoing hormonal treatments. They indicated impacts on self-perception, daily functioning and interpersonal dynamics. There was general interest and specific feedback regarding the potential for a neuropsychological intervention, suggesting PCS and their partners would engage with such an intervention.

The diverse nature of cognitive difficulties and their associated challenges reflect previous research. Decline in attention, processing speed, verbal/language skills, memory, visuospatial and visuomotor skills and executive functioning have been identified in PCS on objective neuropsychological tests following hormonal treatments. Although findings have been inconsistent, this suggests a subset of PCS may be more vulnerable to experiencing cognitive changes following hormonal treatments. Moreover, as our qualitative data demonstrate, cognitive decline may remain undetectable to others despite self-reported challenges of PCS in participating in daily activities (e.g. driving, social engagement) and reduced productivity. Reported difficulties on more cognitively demanding tasks add to earlier findings indicating hormonal treatments likely disrupt complex information processing (i.e. using higher-order executive processes) rather than specific cognitive domains. Such deficits may manifest more evidently in ecologically valid contexts (e.g. work environment) over standard neuropsychological testing conditions. This is important given cognitive complaints may increase the likelihood of early retirement in older cancer survivors. Therefore, addressing cognitive complaints may play an important role in effective return to work and optimising productivity, impacting both personal wellbeing (i.e. quality of life, mental health and financial stability) and societal economic health more generally.

### Memory mayhem: hormone therapy causing brain fog in patients with DCIS… [^112Bg9am]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract 575 Background: Long term hormonal therapy in ductal carcinoma in situ have been studied without consistent evidence to cause cognitive side effects. Here we evaluate the relation of using hormonal therapy in patients with DCIS with cognitive effects. Methods: TrinetX, a global federated research network that provides a dataset of electronic medical records from different healthcare organizations, was utilized. Initial query was made to isolate patients who had an ER positive DCIS. Two groups were made based on the receipt of hormone therapy. Results: 64, 266 patients were identified with ER positive DCIS, of whom 63. 18% received HT. Patients who received HT were older, and predominantly Caucasian. Before PSM, it was seen that 7. 55% patients had cognitive side effects compared to only
5.

044% in group that did not receive HT, p < 0. 0001). After PSM, both groups had 15, 801 cases. The odds of developing cognitive impairment was higher in HT group, p = 0. 0003). But Log-Rank Test for Kaplan-Meier curve did not show any significant difference). Conclusions: Our study shows that HT significantly increases the odds of developing cognitive impairment. The limitation of the study is the duration of follow up. Usually, patients with DCIS live much longer and can have cognitive effects beyond the window of this study; hence a prospective long-term follow-up study is required to ascertain the relation of HT and cognitive side effects. Patients when starting the treatment should be counselled about the risk of developing cognitive side effects in future.

### Changes in cognitive function in postmenopausal women 1 year after completing adjuvant letrozole or tamoxifen in the breast international group (BIG) 1–98 trial… [^115kn6JN]. ASCO (2010). Low credibility.

Abstract 527 Background: Endocrine therapy for breast cancer may affect cognition. Methods: In BIG 1–98, postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, early-stage BC were randomized to receive either A) tamoxifen for 5 years, B) letrozole for 5 years, C) TAM for 2 years followed by LET for 3 years, or D) LET for 2 years followed by TAM for 3 years, as adjuvant endocrine treatment. During the 5th year of trial treatment and 1 year after treatment completion, objective cognitive function was evaluated by computerized tests. Scores for each domain and time point were standardized according to age-specific norms.

The primary objectives of this prospective analysis were to evaluate if there is improvement in cognitive function 1 year after cessation of adjuvant endocrine therapy, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test; and if there is a difference in change in cognitive function 1 year after cessation. of adjuvant endocrine therapy between patients taking TAM for the last 3 of 5 years of the trial versus patients taking LET for the last 3 of 5 years of the trial, using 2-way ANOVA controlling for language. Results: There was a significant improvement in the change in composite score from year 5 to year 6 for all patients. This improvement was significant for each performance task, and within both TAM and LET cohorts. The difference in the change in composite score between treatments was not significant. Conclusions: For postmenopausal patients who received either adjuvant LET or TAM, cognitive function appears to improve 1 year after cessation of treatment. The change from year 5 to 6 does not differ according to treatment.
