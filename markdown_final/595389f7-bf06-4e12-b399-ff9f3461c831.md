## Question

When is it best to do a lap chole for a patient with gallstone pancreatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with gallstone pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity stratification because timing hinges on disease severity. Then, I should verify the evidence and guideline consensus for mild disease and whether "early" means within 24–48 hours or simply during the index admission. Next, I will examine the evidence and guidance for moderate to severe disease, including the role of peripancreatic collections and ERCP. After that, I need to check special scenarios like cholangitis, pregnancy, and resource constraints. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and ensure it aligns with high-quality guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: gallstone pancreatitis spans a spectrum from mild, self-limited disease to severe necrotizing pancreatitis, and the timing of cholecystectomy must be individualized to severity, comorbidities, and local expertise. I should double-check that contemporary guidelines explicitly anchor timing to severity, which they do, with strong recommendations for same-admission cholecystectomy in mild disease and deferral in severe disease with collections until stabilization [^113iKkiK] [^116YLRQE] [^114TTh3j].

> Now, for mild gallstone pancreatitis, I need to verify the strength of evidence for same-admission cholecystectomy. The AGA gives a strong recommendation for cholecystectomy during the initial admission, and WSES recommends same-admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy with high-grade support, while BSG advises within 2 weeks but preferably during the same admission, all converging on early definitive management to prevent recurrence [^113iKkiK] [^11733uaF] [^115apfLq].

> Wait, let me verify how "early" is defined in trials. Randomized studies show that performing cholecystectomy within 24–48 hours of admission reduces length of stay and readmissions without increasing serious complications, with the Annals of Surgery RCT showing a 2.3-day reduction in hospital stay and the Gallstone PANC trial demonstrating fewer ERCPs and shorter 30-day LOS when surgery is within 24 hours. A meta-analysis of RCTs confirms a marked reduction in recurrent biliary events with early cholecystectomy, reinforcing the benefit of not waiting for full biochemical normalization if the patient is clinically improving [^112YbyzW] [^1122i44b] [^114s6PB4].

> Hold on, I should verify that this does not increase operative risk. Pooled analyses and contemporary cohorts indicate no increase in conversion to open, bile duct injury, or major complications with early same-admission cholecystectomy in mild disease, and cost-effectiveness modeling supports early surgery, though feasibility depends on local resources and weekend access to MRCP or ERCP when needed [^114s6PB4] [^114Pm17Q] [^114TTh3j].

> Next, I will examine moderate to severe gallstone pancreatitis. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize from mild disease, because here the balance shifts toward delayed cholecystectomy until systemic inflammation and local complications resolve. WSES recommends deferring cholecystectomy when peripancreatic fluid collections are present until they resolve or stabilize, and a large 2023 cohort study found increased mortality and morbidity with early cholecystectomy in moderate to severe disease, arguing for interval cholecystectomy after clinical recovery [^116YLRQE] [^113QgGmA].

> But wait, what if the patient has cholangitis or persistent biliary obstruction? I should confirm that urgent ERCP with sphincterotomy is indicated in cholangitis or high suspicion of retained CBD stones, and that cholecystectomy should follow later once the patient is stabilized, as emphasized by endoscopy and surgical guidelines, with MRCP or EUS used selectively based on risk stratification for choledocholithiasis [^117HPEjb] [^114LoUFB] [^114TTh3j].

> I need to check special populations. In pregnancy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and preferred, ideally in the second trimester, and same-admission cholecystectomy in pregnant patients with biliary pancreatitis significantly reduces readmissions. In elderly or high anesthetic risk patients with complications, EASL advises cholecystectomy as soon as the general status allows, which often means after initial stabilization rather than immediate early surgery [^113ZJGRh] [^112WALYq].

> Let me consider implementation barriers. Real-world data show that only about half of patients undergo same-admission cholecystectomy despite strong recommendations, with lower adherence in smaller, non-teaching, and rural hospitals, underscoring the need for dedicated pathways, early surgical consultation, and access to imaging and endoscopy to meet early targets [^116J6rDm] [^114NrLXp].

> I should double-check the ductal evaluation strategy. Routine preoperative ERCP is not indicated in mild gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, and intraoperative cholangiography or laparoscopic ultrasound can be used selectively based on liver tests and imaging, with single-stage strategies for choledocholithiasis favored where expertise exists to reduce length of stay and staged procedures [^117HPEjb] [^112ynN4k] [^116Zu6WV].

> Putting this together, my final, risk-stratified recommendation is as follows: for mild gallstone pancreatitis, proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the index admission as soon as the patient is clinically improving, ideally within 24–48 hours if feasible, because this reduces length of stay and recurrent biliary events without increasing complications. For moderate to severe disease or when peripancreatic collections are present, delay cholecystectomy until systemic and local inflammation have resolved, typically 4–6 weeks or longer, and prioritize supportive care, ERCP when indicated, and definitive surgery only after stabilization. Throughout, tailor decisions to comorbidities, local expertise, and patient-specific factors, and ensure reliable follow-up to mitigate the risk of interval biliary complications [^113iKkiK] [^116YLRQE] [^114jb1Ca] [^114TTh3j].

---

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed during the **index admission** [^113iKkiK] for mild gallstone pancreatitis, ideally within **24–48 hours** [^112YbyzW] after clinical stabilization, to reduce recurrent biliary events [^114s6PB4] and length of stay without increasing complications [^112YbyzW]. For severe or necrotizing pancreatitis, **delay surgery** [^116YLRQE] until inflammation resolves and fluid collections stabilize, typically 4–6 weeks or more [^notfound]. Early cholecystectomy is contraindicated in ongoing organ failure, cholangitis, or unstable collections; ERCP is reserved for persistent biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^113vga7w].

## Indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated in gallstone pancreatitis to prevent recurrence and complications [^113iKkiK]. The **indications include**:

- **Mild gallstone pancreatitis**: Patients without organ failure or local complications [^113SQPSG].

- **Moderately severe or severe pancreatitis**: After clinical stabilization and resolution of acute inflammation [^116YLRQE].

- **Recurrent gallstone pancreatitis**: To prevent further episodes [^117Jbrru].

---

## Timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy

The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy **depends on disease severity** and clinical stability:

| **Severity** | **Timing of cholecystectomy** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Within 24–48 hours after clinical stabilization [^notfound] | High |
| Moderately severe | Delayed until resolution of acute inflammation and stabilization of fluid collections (typically 4–6 weeks) [^116YLRQE] | Moderate |
| Severe | Delayed until complete resolution of acute inflammation and stabilization of fluid collections (typically 4–6 weeks or more) [^112hV9m8] | Moderate |

---

## Benefits of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the index admission offers **several benefits**, including:

- **Reduced recurrent biliary events**: Lower risk of recurrent pancreatitis, biliary colic, and cholangitis [^114s6PB4].

- **Shorter hospital stay**: Decreased total length of stay and healthcare costs [^112YbyzW].

- **No increased operative risk**: Similar rates of conversion to open surgery and complications compared to delayed surgery [^114s6PB4].

---

## Risks and complications of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy

While early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe, **potential risks and complications** include:

- **Increased operative difficulty**: Due to edema and inflammation [^1158gAui].

- **Higher conversion rate**: Potential for conversion to open cholecystectomy [^112QkqwQ].

- **Postoperative complications**: Such as bile leak, infection, and pancreatitis recurrence [^1122i44b].

---

## Contraindications to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy **should be avoided** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe acute pancreatitis**: With ongoing organ failure or unstable fluid collections [^116YLRQE].

- **Cholangitis**: Requiring urgent ERCP and biliary drainage [^116xNUhz].

- **Unstable patient**: With significant comorbidities or hemodynamic instability [^112xTWJq].

---

## Role of ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis

ERCP is indicated in gallstone pancreatitis **only when** there is persistent biliary obstruction, cholangitis, or retained common bile duct stones [^114TTh3j]. Routine ERCP is not recommended in mild gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of obstruction [^113vga7w].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from major societies **recommend**:

- **Mild gallstone pancreatitis**: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the index admission [^113iKkiK] [^11733uaF].

- **Moderately severe or severe pancreatitis**: Delayed cholecystectomy until resolution of acute inflammation and stabilization of fluid collections [^116YLRQE].

- **ERCP**: Reserved for patients with persistent biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^114TTh3j].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Mild gallstone pancreatitis**: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 24–48 hours after clinical stabilization [^112hV9m8].

- **Moderately severe or severe pancreatitis**: Delayed cholecystectomy until resolution of acute inflammation and stabilization of fluid collections (typically 4–6 weeks) [^112hV9m8].

- **ERCP**: Indicated only in cases of persistent biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^114TTh3j].

---

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment for gallstone pancreatitis, with timing tailored to disease severity and clinical stability. Early surgery in mild cases reduces recurrence and length of stay without increasing complications, whereas **severe cases require delayed surgery** until inflammation resolves [^112hV9m8].

SAGES laparoscopic biliary surgery guidelines — gallstone pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones is an important indication for cholecystectomy, and its incidence due to gallstones appears to be increasing. One large state's discharge data showed one-third of adult cases are caused by gallstones, with an incidence of gallstone pancreatitis of approximately 14.5 per 100,000, translating into 31,500 cases per year nationally. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred to remove the source of stones, the timing of cholecystectomy and of procedures to evaluate and clear common bile duct stones remain controversial, particularly in mild, self-limited disease. There is agreement that severe pancreatitis with ongoing multi system organ failure requires immediate clearing of any biliary obstruction, usually with ERCP.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: are patients with biliary pancreatitis at increased operative risk? [^112QkqwQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in patients with biliary pancreatitis suggested increased operative difficulty, high rates of conversion, and greater morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Between 1990 and 1997, LC was performed for biliary pancreatitis in 63 patients (Group I) and for other causes in 829 patients (Group II).

Results

Patients with biliary pancreatitis were significantly older (median age 57 vs 50 years, p = 0.009), with greater co-morbidity (ASA III/IV 24% vs 11%, p = 0.008). The groups were comparable with respect to the frequency of previous abdominal operations, acute inflammation of the gallbladder, and the frequency of bile duct calculi detected by intraoperative cholangiography. Moderate to severe adhesions involving the gallbladder were significantly more frequent in patients with biliary pancreatitis (46% vs 29%, p = 0.004). No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to intraoperative (1.5% Group I vs 6.0% Group II, p = 0.109) or postoperative complications (10% vs 8%, p = 0.426), conversion rate (0 vs 2.7%, p = 0.181), or duration of operation (median 92 vs 85 min, p = 0.33).

Conclusion

Despite increased age and co-morbidity and more frequent adhesions, our data showed no evidence that intraoperative or postoperative complications were more frequent in patients with biliary pancreatitis than in other patients undergoing LC.

### Protocol for a randomized trial of the effect of timing of cholecystectomy during initial admission for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis at a safety-net hospital [^1166oBnH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Study population

Patients are considered to have gallstone pancreatitis if they have: (1) upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric tenderness, (2) the absence of ethanol abuse, (3) elevated plasma lipase level above the upper limit of normal (≥ 370 U/L), and (4) imaging confirming gallstones or sludge. This definition is consistent with guidelines recommending the combination of clinical features with elevation of plasma concentrations of pancreatic enzymes (lipase over amylase) for diagnosis. Only patients with predicted mild pancreatitis based on the Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score (0–2 points, < 2% mortality) are screened for enrollment. Inclusion criteria include: patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy prior to discharge, age ≥ 18 years, lack of any very strong indicator for choledocholithiasis based on the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines (table 2), and clinical stability as denoted by admission to a non-monitored floor bed. Exclusion criteria include: pregnancy, severe preexisting medical comorbidities precluding surgery, organ failure, local or systemic complications of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, native language other than English and Spanish, and refusal to participate.

Table 2
American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines

Using these criteria, patients were enrolled and randomized from June 27, 2016 to May 18, 2017. Subsequently, due to concerns regarding the accuracy of BISAP to predict mild acute gallstone pancreatitis, the criteria were changed to prevent potentially operating on a patient who had progression of their pancreatitis. Starting on August 16, 2017, patients were enrolled but not randomized until there was no evidence of clinical deterioration after at least 12 hours after enrollment. Clinical deterioration is defined by new onset tachycardia, hypotension requiring fluids or vasopressors, decreased urine output, indication for further imaging to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis, transfer to the ICU, or clinical judgement of the treating physician.

Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding

Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines are being followed. Patients are randomized using variable permuted blocks using a computer-generated random sequence. Patients are randomized by a research coordinator not involved in the study using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Patients are stratified based on the ASGE risk for choledocholithiasis (intermediate vs high likelihood, table 2). Data analysts, but not patients and healthcare providers, are blinded. A blinded outcome adjudication committee will review the outcomes.

### Gallstone pancreatitis: admission versus normal cholecystectomy-a randomized trial (gallstone PANC trial) [^1122i44b]. Annals of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early cholecystectomy shortly after admission for mild gallstone pancreatitis has been proposed based on observational data. We hypothesized that cholecystectomy within 24hours of admission versus after clinical resolution of gallstone pancreatitis that is predicted to be mild results in decreased length-of-stay (LOS) without an increase in complications.

Methods

Adults with predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis were randomized to cholecystectomy with cholangiogram within 24hours of presentation (early group) versus after clinical resolution (control) based on abdominal exam and normalized laboratory values. Primary outcome was 30-day LOS including readmissions. Secondary outcomes were time to surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) rates, and postoperative complications. Frequentist and Bayesian intention-to-treat analyses were performed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the early (n = 49) and control (n = 48) groups. Early group had fewer ERCPs (15% vs 29%, P = 0.038), faster time to surgery (16h vs 43h, P < 0.005), and shorter 30-day LOS (50h vs 77h, RR 0.68 95% CI 0.65–0.71, P < 0.005). Complication rates were 6% in early group versus 2% in controls (P = 0.613), which included recurrence/progression of pancreatitis (2 early, 1 control) and a cystic duct stump leak (early). On Bayesian analysis, early cholecystectomy has a 99% probability of reducing 30-day LOS, 93% probability of decreasing ERCP use, and 72% probability of increasing complications.

Conclusion

In patients with predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis, cholecystectomy within 24hours of admission reduced rate of ERCPs, time to surgery, and 30-day length-of-stay. Minor complications may be increased with early cholecystectomy. Identification of patients with predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis in whom early cholecystectomy is safe warrants further investigation.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^11165hbW]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Design

CHISPA is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, superior clinical trial. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 72 hours after randomization) or interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy (30 ± 5 days after randomization). All data and interventions will be recollected and performed in Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi, a fourth-level high-complexity hospital in Bogotá Colombia. We followed the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines to report this protocol.

Study objective

To establish whether there is a difference in surgical outcomes comparing patients diagnosed with severe or moderately severe pancreatitis on which early cholecystectomy was performed versus performing interval cholecystectomy.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint will be to evaluate major complications, defined as a Clavien-Dindo score greater than or equal to III/V.

Secondary endpoints include evaluating minor complications (defined as a Clavien-Dindo score I/II), biliary disease recurrence (defined as either acute cholecystitis, biliary colic, acute pancreatitis, jaundice, or cholangitis diagnosis), postoperative hospital stay length and postoperative stay length in an intensive therapy unit to those who apply.

This will be further classified into short-term (≤ 30 days) complications and long-term (> 30 days) complications.

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, diagnosis of pancreatitis according to Atlanta guidelines, moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score ≥ 8 on admittance), biliary pancreatitis diagnosed on imaging (be it ultrasound, MRI and/or CT), recovery of pancreatitis by oral intake (defined as 24 hours of food consumption of any consistency without emetic episodes and pain defined as < 4/10 on the Visual Analog Score of pain) and written informed consent. If the patient's scholarity does not allow them to properly read the written informed consent, it will be read aloud by a member of the research team in order to affirm the subject's understanding and consent to the study.

Exclusion criteria

Exclusion criteria are: pregnancy, history of cholecystectomy, planned open cholecystectomy, pancreatitis-associated complication before laparoscopic cholecystectomy (compartment syndrome, bleeding and/or need for peripancreatic collection drainage), chronic pancreatitis, more than one episode of pancreatitis, active malignant disease, septic shock, choledocholithiasis not resolved by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), post-ERCP perforation and post-ERCP concomitant pancreatitis.

Introduction

Worldwide, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common abdominal surgical procedure, accounting for over 750 000 operations in the USA and approximately 70 000 operations in the UK each year. A recent studyof National Health Service data showed that the total number of cholecystectomies annually increased by 72.2 per cent between 2000 and 2019 (from 39 022 to 67 204). Although the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies has increased over recent decades, international guidelineshave provided no reason to broaden the indication for surgery. The 5 per cent increase in the prevalence of gallbladder stones, from 15 to 20 per cent, does not explain the exponential increase in cholecystectomy numbers.

In Europe, approximately one-fifth of the population has gallbladder stones. The majority of gallbladder stones consist primarily of cholesterol (over 90 per cent), whereas a minority are black (bilirubin) and brown (bacterial products) pigmented stones. Predisposing factors include obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but only one in five develops symptoms. Symptomatic patients mostly suffer from typical symptoms of biliary colic. Frequent episodes of biliary colic or complicated gallstone disease (such as choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) are accepted indications for cholecystectomy. However, in most patients, gallstones remain without symptoms and are not the primary cause of abdominal pain. Patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are confronted with two options: wait and see or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, there is lack of consensus regarding selection of those who do or do not benefit from surgery, as 10–40 per cent of patients have persistent abdominal pain after operation. This provides the clinical equipoise to suggest an alternative strategy for better selection of patients for cholecystectomy.

The present review aimed to provide an overview of different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis; to summarize outcomes after cholecystectomy; and to give personalized advice on treatment decisions in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Planned early discharge-elective surgical readmission pathway for patients with gallstone pancreatitis… [^115Togpi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Sherry Wren, MD, Palo Alto, California: The timing of surgery after mild pancreatitis has been debated by multiple authors and studies with a scarcity of true evidence-based medical guidelines to direct our practice in this area. The most common practice is to do a cholecystectomy in the same admission after normalization of abdominal tenderness with or without laboratory value normalization. This usually translates into an in-hospital stay of 5 or more days. This specific study takes place in a large urban public city hospital with resource allocation issues that may not be applicable in other hospital systems. The authors compared 2 pathways in the treatment of mild GSP and looked at the effect on overall LOS, recurrent disease, and the number of patients lost to follow-up. The hypothesis of the study was that commitment to an early readmit protocol, defined as cholecystectomy within 14 days of discharge, would diminish the overall total LOS in their hospital.

This is unusual for a group of healthy patients with mild GSP. If patients had been discharged in a more typical fashion such as same day or the next morning, this would have made the overall LOS between the control and prospective groups almost equivalent. It is also interesting that the pathway was defined as readmission within 14 days for cholecystectomy and failure was defined as deviation from the pathway for any reason. In their 2007 article, 26 they compared a prospective group of 43 similar patients with mild GSP to a retrospective control group. Their approach was to perform a cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission. Their average LOS in the conventionally managed group was 7 days and only 4 days in the experimental group. As far as the postoperative LOS, it is true the patients postoperatively in the control group should have been discharged on the day of surgery, and yet many were not.

This is related to a philosophy that the hospital and residents have in that the patients treated as outpatients tend to have a planned and expected early discharge, whereas the patients who are already in-house tend to have a less well-defined discharge plan. It is possible that if the patients in the control group were discharged on the same day of surgery as the comparable outpatient cholecystectomy patients, it most probably would decrease the LOS and not make the difference as significant. You will notice that most of the recurrences did occur at about 10 days to 3 weeks, so I suppose the ideal would be to readmit these patients within 1 week of discharge. Another option is to do what Dr Stabile and his group have done, and that is to do the surgery as an emergency or schedule them as soon as they come in.

Hypothesis We assessed outcomes in patients with gallstone pancreatitis managed using a readmission pathway of discharge from the index admission with early readmission cholecystectomy and compared these with conventional management. We hypothesized that the pathway would decrease hospital length of stay. Design Prospective cohort study. Conclusion Use of the readmission pathway's early discharge protocol decreased overall LOS and in this study population was not associated with any increase in morbidity compared with conventional management. There has been considerable debate during the past several decades as to what constitutes safe and practical timing of cholecystectomy in the management of patients with gallstone pancreatitis. The emphasis during the past 10 years has been focused on the timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which if indicated is only a bridge to the definitive management of cholecystectomy.

### Clinical update on acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis: between certainties and Grey areas [^114hUydb]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) and acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) are significant complications of gallstone disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current management practices for ACC and ABP. The Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) as the treatment of choice for ACC. High-risk patients may benefit from alternative treatments like biliary drainage, with emerging techniques such as endoscopic drainage showing promise. ABP requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. The Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC) criteria are used for diagnosis, with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy as primary treatments. Minimally invasive approaches are preferred for managing complications like infected pancreatic necrosis, with the endoscopic step-up method showing superior outcomes. The management of ACC and ABP continues to evolve. Future research is needed to refine guidelines further and address existing controversies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in these acute biliary conditions.

### Costs and quality of life of small-incision open cholecystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy-an expertise-based randomised controlled trial [^112ct7yY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Details concerning surgical teams and surgical techniques including intra-operative cholangiogram have been described earlier. Primary outcomes were costs and health related quality of life, reported in the current paper, and pain. Secondary outcomes were complications within 30 days, operative time, length of hospital stay, conversion rate, frequency of ambulatory surgery and readmissions within 30 days, which together with pain have been reported earlier. In short, SIOC was performed via a transverse incision over the right rectus muscle and laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a four-trocar technique. If the SIOC incision exceeded 8 cm, the operation was classified as an open cholecystectomy as this was the cut-off in the Swedish registry for gallstone surgery (GallRiks). Two hospitals participated in the trial, Umeå University Hospital and Lycksele County Hospital. The study was designed as a randomised pragmatic expertise-based trial, where participating surgeons were asked to join one of two teams, performing either SIOC or LC, according to their personal preferences. Team members performed their specific method (SIOC or LC) as a first-choice operation, but converted to OC when necessary, and even began the operation using OC when neither LC nor SIOC were considered possible.

Patients

Eligible patients were asked to enrol in the trial at the time when cholecystectomy was decided. Written informed consent was obtained before randomisation. The trial was not blinded.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients aged 18 years or older with biliary disease where cholecystectomy was considered the best treatment according to published recommendations were asked to participate in the trial. Both elective and emergency patients were enrolled. Patients with acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, jaundice, pancreatitis, obesity and co-morbidity were included if cholecystectomy was considered the best treatment. The exclusion criteria were: inability to understand given information, surgeons from either the LC team or the SIOC team unavailable for emergency cholecystectomy, cholecystectomy performed for malignant disease or suspicion of malignancy, and cholecystectomy performed as part of another operation.

Randomisation

Randomisation was made using an internet-based system with computer-generated random numbers. Patients were automatically stratified at three levels: hospital, age (< or ≥ 70 years), and degree of priority (elective, emergent, or surgery for life-threatening disease). The patients were randomised when the decision for surgery was made.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^113tzy56]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is the recurrent reason for gastrointestinal admission in a clinical urgent setting, it happens secondary to a wide array of pathologies out of which biliary disease stands as one of the most frequent causes for its presentation. Approximately 20% of pancreatitis are of moderate or severe severity. Currently, there is not a clear recommendation on timing for cholecystectomy, either early or delayed. CHISPA is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, superior clinical trial. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. It seeks to evaluate differences between patients taken to early cholecystectomy during hospital admission (72 hours after randomization) versus delayed cholecystectomy (30 ± 5 days after randomization). The primary endpoint is major complications associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy defined as a Clavien-Dindo score of over III/V during the first 90 days after the procedure. Secondary endpoints include recurrence of biliary disease, minor complications (Clavien-Dindo score below III/V), days of postoperative hospital stay, and length of stay in an intensive therapy unit postoperatively (if it applies). The CHISPA trial has been designed to demonstrate that delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces the rate of complications associated to an episode of severe biliary pancreatitis compared to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Trial registration number: NCT06113419.

### Early cholecystectomy safely decreases hospital stay in patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis: a randomized prospective study [^112YbyzW]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 48 hours of admission for mild gallstone pancreatitis, regardless of resolution of abdominal pain or abnormal laboratory values, would result in a shorter hospital stay.

Summary Of Background Data

Although there is consensus among surgeons that patients with gallstone pancreatitis should undergo cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence, the precise timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild disease remains controversial.

Methods

Consecutive patients with mild pancreatitis (Ranson score ≤ 3) were prospectively randomized to either an early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (within 48 hours of admission) versus a control laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (performed after resolution of abdominal pain and normalizing trend of laboratory enzymes). The primary end point was hospital length of stay. Secondary end point was a composite of rates of conversion to an open procedure, perioperative complications, and need for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. The study was designed to enroll 100 patients with an interim analysis after 50 patients.

Results

At interim analysis, 50 patients were enrolled at a single university-affiliated public hospital. Of them, 25 patients were randomized to the early group and 25 patients to the control group. Patient age ranged from 18 to 74 years with a median duration of symptoms of 2 days upon presentation and a median Ranson score of 1. There were no baseline differences between the groups with regards to demographics, clinical presentation, or the presence of comorbidities. The hospital length of stay was shorter for the early cholecystectomy group (mean: 3.5 [95% CI, 2.7–4.3], median: 3 [IQR, 2–4]) compared with the control group (mean: 5.8 [95% CI, 3.8–7.9], median: 4 [IQR, 4–6] [P = 0.0016]). Six patients from the early group required endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, compared with 4 in the control group (P = 0.72). There was no statistically significant difference in the need for conversion to an open procedure or in perioperative complication rates between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

In mild gallstone pancreatitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 48 hours of admission, regardless of the resolution of abdominal pain or laboratory abnormalities, results in a shorter hospital length of stay with no apparent impact on the technical difficulty of the procedure or perioperative complication rate.

### Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of early versus delayed cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis [^114s6PB4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gallstones account for 30–50 per cent of all presentations of acute pancreatitis. While the management of acute pancreatitis is usually supportive, definitive treatment of gallstone pancreatitis is cholecystectomy. Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology suggest definitive treatment on index admission or within 2weeks of discharge, whereas joint recommendations from the International Association of Pancreatology and the American Pancreatic Association recommend definitive treatment on index admission. Evidence suggests that uptake of these guidelines is low.

Methods

Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for RCTs investigating early versus delayed cholecystectomy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of mild gallstone pancreatitis. The pooled synthesis was undertaken using a random-effects meta-analysis of the primary outcome of recurrent biliary complications causing hospital readmission. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and postoperative complications, and total length of hospital stay (LOS). All analyses were performed using RevMan5 software.

Results

Five RCTs were identified, which included 629 patients (318 in the early cholecystectomy (EC) group and 311 in the delayed cholecystectomy (DC) group). Recurrent biliary events that required readmission were reduced in patients undergoing EC compared with the number in patients having DC (odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95 per cent c.i. 0.09 to 0.33). There was no difference in the rate of intraoperative (OR 0.58, 0.17 to 1.92) or postoperative (OR 0.78, 0.38 to 1.62) complications.

Conclusion

EC following mild gallstone pancreatitis does not increase the risk of intraoperative or postoperative complications, but reduces the readmission rate for recurrent biliary complications.

### Solve study: a study to capture global variations in practices concerning laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113LM4ec]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of published data on variations in practices concerning laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The purpose of this study was to capture variations in practices on a range of preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative aspects of this procedure.

Methods

A 45-item electronic survey was designed to capture global variations in practices concerning laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and disseminated through professional surgical and training organisations and social media.

Results

638 surgeons from 70 countries completed the survey. Pre-operatively only 5.6% routinely perform an endoscopy to rule out peptic ulcer disease. In the presence of preoperatively diagnosed common bile duct (CBD) stones, 85.4% (n = 545) of the surgeons would recommend an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) before surgery, while only 10.8% (n = 69) of the surgeons would perform a CBD exploration with cholecystectomy. In patients presenting with gallstone pancreatitis, 61.2% (n = 389) of the surgeons perform cholecystectomy during the same admission once pancreatitis has settled down. Approximately, 57% (n = 363) would always administer prophylactic antibiotics and 70% (n = 444) do not routinely use pharmacological DVT prophylaxis preoperatively. Open juxta umbilical is the preferred method of pneumoperitoneum for most patients used by 64.6% of surgeons (n = 410) but in patients with advanced obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m², only 42% (n = 268) would use this technique and only 32% (n = 203) would use this technique if the patient has had a previous laparotomy. Most surgeons (57.7%; n = 369) prefer blunt ports. Liga clips and Hem-o-loks® were used by 66% (n = 419) and 30% (n = 186) surgeons respectively for controlling cystic duct and (n = 477) 75% and (n = 125) 20% respectively for controlling cystic artery. Almost all (97.4%) surgeons felt it was important or very important to remove stones from Hartmann's pouch if the surgeon is unable to perform a total cholecystectomy.

Conclusions

This study highlights significant variations in practices concerning various aspects of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after severe and / or necrotic pancreatitis in the setting of modern minimally invasive management of pancreatic necrosis [^113fZdnC]. Pancreas (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The trend toward minimally invasive procedures (MIP) in necrotizing pancreatitis is increasing. The optimal timing and technique of cholecystectomy in severe/necrotizing pancreatitis is unclear. This study aims to determine the role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after severe/necrotizing pancreatitis in the context of MIP.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a prospective database was performed for consecutive patients after cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis between January 2011 and January 2018 at Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia.

Results

Three hundred fifty-five patients with gallstone pancreatitis underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 2 conversions. Patients with severe pancreatitis were older (P = 0.002), with a more even sex distribution when compared with mild pancreatitis. Females predominated in the mild pancreatitis group. Patients with moderate/severe pancreatitis (P = 0.002) and necrosis (P > 0.001) were more likely to have delayed cholecystectomy compared with mild pancreatitis. There was no increase in biliary presentations while awaiting cholecystectomy. Length of stay for patients with severe/necrotizing pancreatitis (P = 0.001) was increased, surgical complications appeared similar.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely and effectively for pancreatitis, irrespective of severity. The paradigm shift in the management of severe necrotizing pancreatitis away from open necrosectomy toward MIP can be extended to encompass laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy: factors influencing same-day discharge [^1159Es18]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) should be the procedure of choice in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease. This article assesses feasibility, patient outcome and predictive factors for successful day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Method

A retrospective analysis of our prospective database of 176 patients following laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a day-surgery unit was performed. A telephone interview was conducted within 24 h after discharge and again after 3 weeks.

Results

Of the 176 cases included in this study, 74% had biliary colic, cholecystitis (16%), pancreatitis (8%), and jaundice (2%). In addition to LC, nine patients (5.1%) underwent laparoscopic bile duct exploration and ten (5.7%) had an additional procedure performed. Eighty-six percent of the patients were discharged the same day. Multivariate analysis identified risk factors affecting same-day discharge, including age greater than 50 years and intraoperative complications. Bile duct exploration reduced the odds of discharge but did not reach significance. Postoperative telephone interviews identified high patient satisfaction with 86% of respondents recommending LC as a day-surgery procedure.

Conclusion

Day-surgery LC is a safe procedure with an acceptable rate of patient discharge. However, intraoperative complications or age over 50 years adversely affected the same-day discharge rate and as such should be taken into consideration when planning day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### 5 mm versus 10 mm umbilical port during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: do outcomes justify broader use in obese patients? A randomized controlled trial [^114qD3rN]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

Between January 2023 and April 2024, all patients ≥ 18 years with symptomatic gallstone disease were screened for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) < 30 kg/m², acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC), gallstone disease complicated by common bile duct (CBD) stones, acute cholangitis or acute pancreatitis at time of presentation, presence of paraumbilical hernia, and history of prior midline or upper abdominal surgery.

All patients with uncomplicated chronic calcular cholecystitis eligible for enrollment were assessed for fitness to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on the guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). They were then randomly allocated into 2 groups based on the size of the umbilical port used: standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SLC) group using 10 mm umbilical port and 10 mm telescope, and mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MLC) group using 5 mm umbilical port and 5 mm telescope. Randomization was performed using the sequentially numbered opaque and sealed envelope (SNOSE) technique.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of Alexandria University Faculty of Medicine (IRB No. 00012098, FWA No. 00018699) and registered with serial number 0306192. Every participant provided a signed informed consent document after thorough explanation of the procedure and outcomes while addressing all patient concerns in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Preoperative assessment

Patients' demography, associated comorbidities, and history of prior lower abdominal/pelvic surgeries were collected. Preoperative laboratory investigations included total and direct serum bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet count, total leukocyte count (TLC), and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) count. Abdominal ultrasound was routinely performed to achieve the diagnosis of chronic calcular cholecystitis with focus on the number and size of gallstones. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed whenever elevated bilirubin or abnormal liver enzymes were encountered to exclude CBD obstruction.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^116iSQbg]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Results

We retrieved a total of 6494 studies through our initial and updated search, out of which 40 studies were included for systematic review, as shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1). We had excluded one study from the meta-analysis since no information on complications was reported. Therefore, 39 studies with 4483 patients with gallstone disease (intervention — EC, n = 2265 and comparator (CM/DC), n = 2218) were included in meta-analysis. Characteristics of included studies are provided in online supplemental table 4.

Patient's mean age was 53.47 years and 54.41 years in intervention and comparators, respectively. Sample sizes in individual studies ranged from 15 to 314 patients. In total, 6, 3 and 31 studies that compared EC versus OM, EC versus EMand EC versus DC, respectively, were analysed. Among the 32 studies, which reported gender proportions, 26 studies (81.25%) had a higher proportion of female participants. Only 9 out of 40 included studies for systematic review were multicentric RCTs, and the rest were conducted in single centres. The baseline gallstone complications reported were acute cholecystitis, CBD stones, gallstone pancreatitis and uncomplicated gallstones in 20, 12, 7 and 1 study, respectively. Out of the 40 studies included in systematic review, open cholecystectomy was reported among 9 studies and cholecystectomy was performed laparoscopically among the rest. Duration of symptoms was reported only in seven studies, in which duration varied from 35.1 to 96 hours. In all the included EC versus DC studies, EC was performed within 7 days of randomisation and DC was performed after 6 weeks of randomisation.

Risk of bias assessment

Out of 40 studies included in systematic review, 31 (77.5%) studies adequately followed the randomisation process. None of the included studies reported that patients and caregivers were blinded for the intervention under study, which might be due to the involvement of surgical intervention. Nine (22.5%) studies had shown deviations from the intended intervention. There were seven (17.5%) studies under the missing outcome data domain, one study (2.5%) in each domain for measurement of outcome data and selection of the reported results were assessed as high risk of bias. The overall risk of bias was estimated as low in 22 (55.0%), some concerns in 6 (15.0%) and high in 12 (30.0%) studies (online supplemental figure 1).

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^115YB9yw]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Gallstone pancreatitis — laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the preferred approach for removing the source of stones in cases acute pancreatitis due to gallstones (Level II, Grade B), and when pancreatitis caused by gallstones is mild and self limited, urgent cholecystectomy should be performed after symptoms have subsided and laboratory values have normalized, usually during the same hospital admission (Level II, Grade B). Severe pancreatitis with ongoing multi system organ failure requires immediate clearing of any biliary obstruction followed by supportive care until the patient recovers sufficiently to tolerate cholecystectomy (Level I, Grade A). In practice, the majority of surgeons advocate and perform cholecystectomy urgently, when symptoms have subsided and laboratory values have normalized, usually during the same hospital admission, though patients with mild pancreatitis generally do not benefit from preoperative ERCP. A recent meta-analysis showed no difference in morbidity and mortality when endoscopic removal of common bile duct stones with cholecystectomy was compared to cholecystectomy with intraoperative removal of common bile duct stones, and the authors stated that treatment should be determined by local resources and expertise.

### Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration [^115ikB6v]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Choledocholithiasis management — epidemiology and procedural context indicates that choledocholithiasis complicates the management of 10–15% of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for uncomplicated, symptomatic cholelithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often used before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with suspected or confirmed common bile duct (CBD) stones, but disadvantages include an up to 86% normal exam rate when performed routinely and short-term complications such as pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis, with potential long-term sequelae from division of the sphincter of Oddi including ampullary stenosis, duodenobiliary reflux, and recurrent stone formation. The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy into clinical practice in 1989 and subsequent refinements in technique and improvements in equipment have provided the tools necessary for surgeons with advanced laparoscopic training to effectively treat choledocholithiasis in a single-stage, laparoscopic procedure.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis… [^1137ftf5]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Gallstone pancreatitis is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis. Observations The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation.

Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^114jb1Ca]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Traditionally, interval cholecystectomy has been considered the ideal surgical choice in cases of pancreatitis because it is thought that early cholecystectomy is potentially more demanding due to poorer patient condition and local inflammation, however, data supporting this statement is lacking and in cases of mild pancreatitis, this procedure holds evidence in being technically less demanding and reduces the incidence of recurrent gallbladder disease and as a result diminishes the risk of further episodes of acute biliary pancreatitis. In severe pancreatitis, the presence of peripancreatic collections may difficult cholecystectomy and as a result a deferred procedure after resolution of pancreatitis and stabilization of present collection(s) is the preferred recommendation in most guidelines with low grades of evidence.

The lack of evidence in a moment of cholecystectomy calls to provide convincing level I evidence to support this decision in habitual clinical practice, and as a result a randomized controlled trial is the preferred option. A double-blinded controlled trial would be optimal. However, because of the difference in timing of controlled cholecystectomy, blinding is not possible.

To compensate for the impossibility of a blinded assessment, early cholecystectomy will be performed in a semi-urgent setting by an experienced surgeon that is not part of the research team in the following 72 hours after the patient is admitted into the study. Interval cholecystectomy will be scheduled 4 weeks after the clinical resolution of pancreatitis considering most guidelines and recent studies looking to evaluate interval cholecystectomy uses this measure of time when comparing it to early cholecystectomy.

For the proper time of randomization, the patient must have a resolution of the pancreatitis episode consisting of two criteria: 24-hour oral tolerance defined by food consumption without vomiting and controlled pain (< 4 on the pain Visual Analog Scale). This is considering that patients with severe pancreatitis may not recover quickly and as a result there is a variation between onset of pancreatitis and resolution and between resolution and performing the procedure. This variation depends on the patient's individual clinical evolution. Due to randomization, there should not be a significant difference between both study arms.

The primary endpoint seeks to evaluate morbidity in severe pancreatitis. This endpoint was chosen because the study aims to present strong evidence that interval cholecystectomy reduces the rate of complications considering other studies that have yielded similar results with lower grades of evidence.

The CHISPA trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to show a reduction in the primary endpoint of incidence of major complications following interval cholecystectomy compared with early cholecystectomy in patients with a first episode of moderately severe and severe biliary acute pancreatitis.

### The bad gallbladder [^1158gAui]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a common operation; approximately 20 million Americans have gallstones, the most common indication. Surgeons who operate on the biliary tree must be familiar with the presentations and treatment options for acute and chronic biliary pathology. We focus on the difficult "bad" gallbladder. We explore the available evidence as to what to do when a gallbladder is too inflamed, too technically challenging, or a patient is too sick to undergo standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We discuss whether or not open cholecystectomy is a relevant tool and what can be done to manage common bile duct stones found unexpectedly intraoperatively.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^111KAmy6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Indications for laparoscopic biliary tract surgery — The indications for laparoscopic operations on the gallbladder and biliary tree have not changed since the 1992 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Statement and remain similar to open surgery, with relative and absolute contraindications noted. As stated in the NIH report, "most patients with symptomatic gallstones are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, if they are able to tolerate general anesthesia and have no serious cardiopulmonary diseases or other co-morbid conditions that preclude operation". Indications include but are not limited to symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, acute cholecystitis, and complications related to common bile duct stones including pancreatitis, and asymptomatic gallstones are generally not an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The guideline assigns these indications an evidence rating of "Level II, Grade A".

### Leveraging access to technology and enhanced surgical technique (LATEST) in laparoscopic bile duct exploration (LBDE) [^111Y37gj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Common bile duct (CBD) stones are present in up to 15% of patients with symptomatic gallstones. Single-stage management of choledocholithiasis with concomitant gallstones consists of performing either laparoscopic bile duct exploration (LBDE) or intra-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) at the same time as laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). In the United Kingdom, surgical clearance of the bile duct, if needed, is recommended at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy provided the laparoscopic expertise are available. In a recent meta-analysis including nearly three thousand patients, LC-intra-operative ERCP and LC-LBDE exhibited similar efficacies when clearance rate, overall post-operative complications, conversion to laparotomy and operative time were compared. When compared to two-staged approaches (LC with either pre- or post-operative ERCP), single-stage management has been proven to be the superior strategy. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that single-stage management is associated with reduced hospital stay and hospital costs. Currently, however, there is no evidence to demonstrate that single-stage management results in less post-operative morbidity. We have previously provided a possible explanation for this finding. The pooled patients who underwent LBDE within historical randomised controlled trials and included in more recent systematic reviews mostly received transductal LBDE via choledochotomy, with less than one-third having received an attempted transcystic LBDE. There is overwhelming evidence that transductal LBDE is associated with significantly higher post-operative morbidity, mainly in the form of bile leak (and post-operative pancreatitis if the bile duct was closed over an antegrade stent), longer operative times and longer hospital stay. When approximately only a third of patients undergoing LBDE within prospective RCTs received transcystic LBDE, it is likely that the pooled morbidity associated with bile leak (and pancreatitis) from the LBDE arm is an overestimate of the true morbidity associated with transcystic LBDE. For surgeons performing LBDE, the primary goal should therefore be to achieve high rates of transcystic exploration, and performing choledochotomy for transductal access only when it is unavoidable and absolutely necessary.

### The 2023 MANCTRA acute biliary pancreatitis care bundle: a joint effort between human knowledge and artificial intelligence (chatGPT) to optimize the care of patients with acute biliary pancreatitis in Western countries [^1175f8Ym]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Response: In patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis, since the timing of the operation is a risk factor for mortality and major complications, if the patient's clinical conditions allow, any interventional strategy (preferably endoscopic or minimally invasive step-up approach) should be delayed beyond 4 weeks (MANCTRA panel GRADE assessment: QoE, high; SoR, strong). Delayed intervention beyond 4 weeks may be beneficial in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, particularly if the patient's clinical conditions allow. However, it is important to note that the evidence is not consistent, and the optimal timing of intervention may depend on various factors, such as the severity of the disease and the presence of infection (ChatGPT GRADE assessment: QoE low to moderate, SoR weak).

Research question 10. Should early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during index admission (or within 14 days) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after hospital discharge be used for patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis?

Nine studies were analyzed, including 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs, 2 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs and n-RCTs, and 4 RCTs. The synthesis of the evidence (Supplemental Digital Content Fig. 10,) showed that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (performed during the same hospitalization or within 14 days of the acute episode) after mild acute biliary pancreatitis reduces the readmission rate for recurrent biliary complications (6 RCTs, high certainty). Recent RCTs comparing different time intervals have concluded that in mild cases, laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 2 to 3 days of hospital admission is safe, feasible, and cost-effective. Compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is equally safe and feasible in the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications (6 RCTs, high certainty) and is associated with a reduction in the length of hospital stay (6 RCTs, high certainty). Furthermore, compared with delayed cholecystectomy, early cholecystectomy is not associated with a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy (5 RCTs, high certainty). No difference was found between the two strategies in terms of duration of surgery (4 RCTs, moderate certainty). Early cholecystectomy is also associated with lower recurrence rates of acute biliary pancreatitis (6 RCTs, high certainty), lower hospital management costs (1 RCT, moderate certainty), and better patient-reported quality of life and pain (1 RCT, high certainty).

### Comparative safety of robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114QedZ9]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The extent to which the pattern of moving away from open surgery is further driven by the adoption of robotic-assisted surgery, with the potential to allow more difficult operations to be performed in a minimally invasive fashion, is unclear. Our findings do not suggest that the growth of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy is being driven by these more complex cases that would have otherwise been performed by an open approach. First, we found that robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was more likely to be elective and performed for biliary colic or gallstone pancreatitis rather than for acute or chronic cholecystitis. This finding may suggest that surgeons are using this technique for lower-risk cholecystectomy procedures while they are learning the technique. Furthermore, if robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was being performed on candidates who were not laparoscopic cholecystectomy candidates, the rates of bile duct injury in the open group would increase over time as only the highest-risk patients would remain. Instead, rates of bile duct injury continued to decrease for both laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy approaches. Finally, overall complication rates between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic surgical procedures were similar. As a result, it is plausible that at least some of the robotic-assisted cholecystectomy procedures are replacing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This has been observed in other clinical domains. For example, the adoption of robotic-assisted colectomy was associated with a 2:1 replacement of laparoscopic surgical procedures (already minimally invasive) over open ones. Beyond clinical justifications, industry marketing and patient preferences (eg, assumptions that new technology renders superior outcomes) have also been implicated in the expansion of robotic-assisted surgery across a range of clinical specialties.

### Impact of hospital characteristics on best-practice adherence for gallstone pancreatitis: a nationwide analysis [^116J6rDm]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend cholecystectomy during the index admission for gallstone pancreatitis, and a growing body of evidence indicates that patients benefit from cholecystectomy within the first 48 h of admission. We examined the impact of hospital characteristics on adherence to these data-driven practices.

Methods

We queried the National Inpatient Sample for patients admitted for gallstone pancreatitis between October 2015 and December 2018. Patients who underwent same-admission cholecystectomy were identified by procedure codes. Cholecystectomies within the first two days were classified as early cholecystectomies. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between hospital characteristics and adherence to these practices.

Results

Of 163,390 admissions for gallstone pancreatitis, only 90,790 (55.6%) underwent cholecystectomy before discharge. Mean time from admission to cholecystectomy was 2.9 days; 27.0% of patients (44,005) underwent early cholecystectomy. Odds of same-admission cholecystectomy were highest in large hospitals (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.28), urban teaching centers (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.21–1.46), and the South (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.57–1.83). Odds of early cholecystectomy did not vary with hospital size, urban-rural status, or teaching status but were highest in the West (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.80–2.18).

Conclusion

Best-practice adherence for cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis remains low despite an abundance of evidence and clinical practice guidelines. Active interventions are needed to improve delivery of surgical care for this patient population. Implementation efforts should focus on small hospitals, rural areas, and health systems in the Northeast region.

### SAGES guidelines for the use of intraoperative imaging of the common bile duct [^112ynN4k]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

SAGES intraoperative common bile duct (CBD) imaging guidelines — scope, methods, and panel composition are described as follows: these imaging tools have the potential to identify CBD stones at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, allowing concomitant cholecystectomy and treatment of CBD stones rather than an additional procedure or readmission for choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, or delayed-onset cholangitis. The aim is to assist surgeons who are deciding which intraoperative imaging technique, if any, should be used during laparoscopic cholecystectomy; the guidelines are also intended to provide education, inform advocacy, and describe potential future areas for research, while noting that distinct patient needs, comorbidities, resource limitations, and other unique situations may require adjustments, and that they can serve as a resource for patients to promote discussion with their physicians. Methods state development according to the SAGES Guidelines Taskforce Standard Operating Procedure with a systematic review of the literature, and recommendations were developed and graded employing the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the GRADE guideline development tool, and the Essential Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare checklist. The panel is described as an expert panel from within the SAGES Guidelines Committee with participation by the Safe Cholecystectomy Task Force, oversight of the systematic review by a methodologist with systematic review expertise, composition of practicing surgeons from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, facilitation by the Guidelines Committee fellow as a non-voting member, and use of the GRADE methodology to assess evidence and judge certainty and strength of recommendations. Funding is reported as provided by SAGES for the librarian, the systematic review statistician, and the Guidelines Committee Fellow, with part of this funding coming from a SAGES Education & Research Foundation grant.

### Can laparoscopic cholecystectomy prevent recurrent idiopathic acute pancreatitis? a prospective randomized multicenter trial [^112R4aw7]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present trial was to ascertain whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCC) can prevent recurrent attacks of idiopathic acute pancreatitis (IAP).

Summary

Up to 50% to 75% of IAP may be due to microlithiasis, which is undetectable by conventional imaging methods.

Methods

This randomized, prospective trial included 85 patients (39 in the LCC and 46 in the control group) in 8 hospitals in Finland. We included adult patients (over 18 years) with their first attack of IAP. The diagnosis of IAP was based on the exclusion of common etiological reasons for acute pancreatitis (AP), whereafter the patients were randomized into conservative watchful waiting (controls) or LCC group. The primary end point was the number of patients with recurrent AP during the follow-up. All recurrent attacks of AP after an initial IAP episode were registered.

Results

During a median follow-up of 36 (5–58) months, the recurrence of IAP was significantly higher in the control group than in LCC group (14/46 vs. 4/39, P = 0.016), as was also the number of recurrences (23/46 vs. 8/39, P = 0.003). In the subgroup of patients with at least 24 months' follow-up, the recurrence was still higher among controls (14/37 vs. 4/35, P = 0.008). In patients with normal liver function, recurrence was also significantly higher in the control than in the LCC group (13/46 vs. 4/39, P = 0.026). During surgery, 23/39 (59%) of the gallbladders were found to contain biliary stones or sludge.

Conclusions

LCC can effectively prevent the recurrence of IAP when all other possible etiologies of pancreatitis are carefully excluded. A total of 5 patients needed to be treated (NNT-value) to prevent 1 IAP.

### Protocol for a randomized trial of the effect of timing of cholecystectomy during initial admission for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis at a safety-net hospital [^113SQPSG]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence-based consensus for laparoscopic cholecystectomy during index admission for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis, defined by the absence of organ failure and of local or systemic complications. However, the optimal timing for surgery within that admission is controversial. Early cholecystectomy may shorten hospital length of stay (LOS) and increase patient satisfaction. Alternatively, it may increase operative difficulty and complications resulting in readmissions.

Methods

This trial is a single-center randomized trial of patients with predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis comparing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) at index admission within 24 hours of presentation versus after clinical resolution on clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The primary endpoint is 30-day LOS (hours) after initial presentation, which includes the index admission and readmissions. Secondary outcomes are conversion to open, complications, time from admission to cholecystectomy, initial hospital LOS, number of procedures within 30 days, 30-day readmissions, and PROs (change in Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index).

Discussion

The primary goal of this research is to obtain the least biased estimate of effect of timing of cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis on clinical and PROs; the results of this trial will be used to inform patient care locally as well as to design future multicenter effectiveness and implementation trials. This trial will provide data regarding PROs including health-related quality of life that can be used in cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses.

### Paediatric cholecystectomy: shifting goalposts in the laparoscopic era [^112QZSUF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice in symptomatic paediatric cholelithiasis. However, controversy exists about its role in asymptomatic cholelithiasis and biliary dyskinesia. We have reviewed the experiences of two UK paediatric centres with laparoscopic cholecystectomy over an 8.5 year period and critically evaluated the indications and outcomes of surgery.

Methods

Patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy by a single surgeon at the Royal Aberdeen and Royal Alexandra Hospitals between May 1996 to August 2003 and September 2003 to December 2005, respectively, were studied. Information was extracted from prospectively held databases and analysed.

Results

A total of 27 cholecystectomies were performed during the period of study. The mean age of patients was 11.7 years with a female preponderance. Symptomatic idiopathic cholelithiasis was the main indication for surgery (14). Cholecystectomy was also performed for haemolytic disease (3), acute recurrent pancreatitis of unknown cause (2), gallbladder trauma (1), and for asymptomatic calcific non-resolving stones (7). All patients were investigated with ultrasound scans with four patients undergoing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones. A standard four-port approach was used with the gallbladder extracted through the umbilical port. The mean operative time in the latter 13 cases was 105 minutes with a median postoperative stay of one day for the whole series. Histology revealed chronic cholecystitis in all but three cases. All patients were discharged after a six-month follow-up period.

Conclusions

The advent of laparoscopy has resulted in an expansion of the traditional indications for cholecystectomy. MRCP is a useful investigation in selected children to exclude choledocholithiasis and avoid intraoperative cholangiography. There appears to be no clear correlation between histology and presenting symptoms. The natural history of asymptomatic gallstones in children is not known although a consensus is emerging to support cholecystectomy for all calcific non-resolving gallstones.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113NB7Ht]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with clinical surveys suggesting prevalence rates of 6% to 25% and a tendency to increase with age. Gallstones are more common in women. A clinical ultrasound survey in the UK reported prevalence rates of 12% and 22% among men and women older than 60 years, respectively.

In the UK and North America, the number of surgical procedures for gallstone disease increased steadily between the 1950s and 1990s, reflecting the rise in prevalence and prompt identification of gallstone disease and the use of cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Rates of surgical procedures stabilised in these countries towards the end of the 20th century. In England, about 61 000 episodes cost the NHS > £200m in 2018/19.

The natural course of gallstones is benign; most people remain asymptomatic and show a relatively low progression to symptomatic disease. A systematic review published in 2007 reported the range for disease progression as 10% to 25% in studies that followed-up patients after initial diagnosis (≤ 15 years of follow-up). The annual risk of developing symptoms has been estimated at 2–4%.

Most people with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease do not develop complications; reported annual rates of developing complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis obstructive jaundice) have been as low as 1–3%. The Italian Group for the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cholelithiasis study reported an annual incidence for complications of 0.7% in patients with symptoms.

Mortality from gallstone disease is rare — typically less than 1% from gallstone related causes.

### Benefits and risks of using laparoscopic ultrasonography versus intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QqtvG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and study assessments

For included studies, data on design and methodology were extracted, as well as data regarding participant and intervention characteristics. Number of events or measures of effect were also extracted. Data were independently extracted by two authors, with discrepancies resolved in consensus. We did not request additional data from the study investigators. The outcome procedural failure was defined as the opposite to procedural success, i.e. (i) that the imaging technique could not be applied, or (ii) that the biliary tree could not be visualised from confluence of the hepatic ducts to the pancreatic ampulla. Conversions to open surgery were not included in the analysis of procedural failure.

At least two authors independently appraised the included studies using checklists used by HTA-centrum, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, modified from checklists developed by the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services. Consensus discussions were then performed to decide on the domains directness, study limitations (risk of bias), and precision, in the categories + (plus; no or minor problems),? (question mark; some problems), and – (minus; major problems). The assessments were performed at the outcome level. As decided beforehand, studies without major risk of bias formed the basis for the conclusions. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Statistical analysis

When two or more studies provided poolable data, we performed random effects meta-analyses using the software Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4.1 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) to obtain the risk ratio (RR), the risk difference, and the mean difference, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Regarding the outcome procedural failure, we required studies to report both application and visualisation failures to be included in the meta-analysis; otherwise, they were considered to have major study limitations regarding this outcome. Studies with inter- and intra-individual comparisons were considered adequate to pool regarding the outcomes procedural failure and operation time including imaging time.

IAC is also associated with an overall reduction in cost per patient and improved patient satisfaction levels, albeit at the cost of a longer operating time as reported by some studies. An additional benefit to IAC is that it negates the 9.7–20% risk of re-presentation with recurrent symptoms when patients with acute cholecystitis are discharged with a plan for interval cholecystectomy. These findings are supported by two meta-analyses. Wang et al. analysed the safety of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) vs. delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) for cholecystitis with intercurrent mild pancreatitis. Of 426 patients (328 ELC and 98 DLC), hospital stay was significantly shorter and preoperative biliary events were less in the ELC group. Zhong et al. analysed ten randomised controlled trials including a total of 1646 patients noting a significantly reduced risk of gallstone-related events in ELC compared to DLC (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.07–0.44; P = 0.0003). The risk of interval complications leading to admission before LC is performed appears to be common to all presentations of gallstone disease.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^116eAYYX]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The CHISPA trial is designed to answer the question of whether interval cholecystectomy leads to a reduction in major complications in the management of the patient coursing with a first episode of acute biliary pancreatitis.

Most guidelines' recommendations on when to perform cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe and severe pancreatitis are weak considering the lack of evidence on the subject. In table 2 we include a summary of the recommendations and grade of evidence in most guidelines regarding the moment of cholecystectomy.

Table 2
Recommendations and grade of evidence for when to perform cholecystectomy in cases of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis

The strongest evidence supporting the recommendations given in most guidelines is based on a retrospective study published in 2004 that included 187 patients coursing with moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis. Out of these patients, 5.5% of those taken to deferred cholecystectomy presented complications versus 44% in the early cholecystectomy group.

Recently, in 2020, a retrospective study comparing surgical outcomes in patients taken to cholecystectomy with mild, moderate, and severe pancreatitis was published. Complication rates in all three groups did not present statistically significant differences, however, in patients with severe pancreatitis there was a statistically significant difference when considering the time interval between pancreatitis diagnosis and performing cholecystectomy. This study's conclusions were that laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be performed safely in pancreatitis regardless of its severity. Limitations of this study were the sample size and its retrospective nature.

A systematic review of the literature which hoped to review the optimal time of cholecystectomy in patients with moderate-to-severe acute biliary pancreatitis concluded that there is currently a marked variation between guidelines about definitive treatment of moderate and severe pancreatitis and a disparity for defining moment of cholecystectomy. A small number of guidelines proposed a specific time period for performing cholecystectomy with low-quality evidence, however, deferring the procedure was associated to a decrease in morbimortality rates and as a result this must be the optimal treatment route until level I evidence is available in current literature.

### Protocol for a randomized trial of the effect of timing of cholecystectomy during initial admission for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis at a safety-net hospital [^113Ni4v9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with mild acute gallstone pancreatitis (table 1), evidence-based guidelines recommend cholecystectomy during index admission but do not specify further. Based on a randomized trial from the 1980s, surgeons have traditionally waited until clinical and laboratory resolution of mild acute gallstone pancreatitis before performing cholecystectomy. This management strategy has recently been challenged. A systematic review reported that early (within 3 days of admission regardless of whether pain or laboratory values had resolved) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallstone pancreatitis resulted in decreased length of stay (LOS) without increased complications. However, the review included only a single randomized trial which was stopped after interim analysis.

Table 1
International, consensus-based definitions of severity of acute pancreatitis

Safety-net hospitals perform approximately 12% of emergency general surgery cases nationwide; they have increased LOS and complications. A systematic review of the quality of surgical care in safety-net hospitals suggests that interventions to improve timeliness and patient centeredness, among other domains of quality, would have a substantial impact among underserved and vulnerable patients.

The proposed trial is a pilot randomized trial of early cholecystectomy for predicted mild gallstone pancreatitis within 24 hours of presentation regardless of symptoms or laboratory values versus after clinical resolution during index admission at a safety-net hospital. The objectives are (1) to analyze the feasibility of early cholecystectomy at a safety-net hospital and (2) to obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of early cholecystectomy on hospital LOS, complications, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We hypothesized that early cholecystectomy is feasible and results in shorter 30-day total hospital LOS.

### Management of gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114TTh3j]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gallstone pancreatitis (GSP) is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Without appropriate and timely treatment, patients are at increased risk of disease progression and recurrence. While there is increasing consensus among guidelines for the management of mild GSP, adherence to these guidelines remains poor. In addition, there is minimal evidence to guide clinicians in the treatment of moderately severe and severe pancreatitis.

Observations

The management of GSP continues to evolve and is dependent on severity of acute pancreatitis and concomitant biliary diagnoses. Across the spectrum of severity, there is evidence that goal-directed, moderate fluid resuscitation decreases the risk of fluid overload and mortality compared with aggressive resuscitation. Patients with isolated, mild GSP should undergo same-admission cholecystectomy; early cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission has been supported by several randomized clinical trials. Cholecystectomy should be delayed for patients with severe disease; for severe and moderately severe disease, the optimal timing remains unclear. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only useful for patients with suspected cholangitis or biliary obstruction, although the concomitance of these conditions in patients with GSP is rare. Modality of evaluation of the common bile duct to rule out concomitant choledocholithiasis varies and should be tailored to level of concern based on objective measures, such as laboratory results and imaging findings. Among these modalities, intraoperative cholangiography is associated with reduced length of stay and decreased use of ERCP. However, the benefit of routine intraoperative cholangiography remains in question.

Conclusions and Relevance

Treatment of GSP is dependent on disease severity, which can be difficult to assess. A comprehensive review of clinically relevant evidence and recommendations on GSP severity grading, fluid resuscitation, timing of cholecystectomy, need for ERCP, and evaluation and management of persistent choledocholithiasis can help guide clinicians in diagnosis and management.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^117HPEjb]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — operative timing and special scenarios recommends that same-admission cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis. We suggest that pre-operative or post operative ERCP or laparoscopic treatment be performed for patients at high risk of choledocholithiasis or positive intraoperative cholangiopancreatography depending on local surgical and endoscopic expertise. For patients with Mirizzi syndrome, per-oral cholangioscopic therapy may be an alternative to surgical management depending on local expertise; however, gallbladder resection is needed regardless of strategy. For hepatolithiasis we suggest a multidisciplinary approach including endoscopy, interventional radiology, and surgery. Plastic and covered metal stents may facilitate removal of difficult choledocholithiasis but require planned exchange or removal.

### Gallstone pancreatitis: a review [^114wzfdN]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is the most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the Western world. In most cases, gallstone pancreatitis is a mild and self-limiting disease, and patients may proceed without complications to cholecystectomy to prevent future recurrence. Severe disease occurs in about 20% of cases and is associated with significant mortality; meticulous management is critical. A thorough understanding of the disease process, diagnosis, severity stratification, and principles of management is essential to the appropriate care of patients presenting with this disease. This article reviews these topics with a focus on surgical management, including appropriate timing and choice of interventions.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^113vga7w]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — role of surgery and biliary management: Key concepts state that patients with mild acute biliary pancreatitis "should undergo cholecystectomy early, preferably before discharge", that "Minimally invasive methods are preferred to open surgery for debridement and necrosectomy in stable patients with symptomatic pancreatic necrosis", and that "We suggest delaying any intervention… in stable patients with pancreatic necrosis, preferably 4 weeks, to allow for the wall of necrosis to mature". Supporting evidence indicates that in mild gallstone pancreatitis, same-admission cholecystectomy decreases recurrent gallstone-related complications with low risk; across 8 cohort studies and 1 randomized trial describing 998 patients, 95 (18%) were readmitted for recurrent biliary events (18% vs 0%, P < 0.0001), including recurrent biliary pancreatitis (n = 38, 8%). In biliary AP, routine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not appropriate unless there is high suspicion of a persistent common bile duct stone with elevated bilirubin; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can be used preoperatively in low to moderate risk but routine use is unnecessary. Patients unable to undergo surgery can receive biliary sphincterotomy to prevent recurrent biliary AP, and when biliary pancreatitis is complicated by pancreatic necrosis, cholecystectomy is typically delayed during prolonged hospitalization or after discharge.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115c85rB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Choosing wisely

A shared decision regarding cholecystectomy between physician and patient is crucial, and most important for patients with concomitant FD and/or IBS. The patient should be aware of the high chance of persistent symptoms (divided into biliary colic and other non-biliary symptoms) after cholecystectomy, especially in patients with gallstones and FD and/or IBS.

Based on the available literature, the authors advise that the doctor should focus on patient characteristics, pain characteristics, and symptom severity during the first outpatient clinic visit. According to these pain characteristics and symptom severity, physicians should make the distinction between biliary colic and functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment. However, when the most important symptoms match those of a functional abdominal disease, an evaluation after approximately 3 weeks is advised. In the meantime, the patient should register their symptoms. If, at the time of the evaluation, functional abdominal symptoms appear to be the main problem, these should be treated first. Expectant management is considered safe as the complication rate (development of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) is very low.

### Cholecystectomy in Sweden 2000–2003: a nationwide study on procedures, patient characteristics, and mortality [^111WCEm9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

A decade after the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 28% of all patients with benign biliary disease had their cholecystectomy completed as an open procedure. Patients in the open group were more likely to have an acute admission for cholecystectomy, they were ten years older than patients in the laparoscopic group, and they were more likely to have complications of gallstone disease (acute pancreatitis and common bile duct stones). They had spent more time in hospital before index admission, indicating that they were more fragile than patients in the laparoscopic group. Hospital stay at cholecystectomy was longer in the open compared to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Mortality of patients in the open group was increased fourfold within three months of index admission, but close to that of the corresponding general population during the following nine months. Patients having laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a reduced mortality over the year following index admission, indicating that they were healthier than the Swedish population in general. In both cholecystectomy groups, one third of all deaths within 90 days of index admission were due to biliary causes.

Information was retrieved from a database covering all patients having inpatient cholecystectomy in Sweden 2000–2003. We lack information on cholecystectomy done as a day-case procedure, estimated to be some 13% of all cholecystectomies performed in Sweden during 2002. In population-based studies such as the present one, conversion to open cholecystectomy comprises some 10% of all laparoscopic cholecystectomies. These are classified as open cholecystectomies making it impossible to study the relative merits of open and laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an intention to treat basis. However, our study raises questions concerning cholecystectomy incidence, selection of patients for laparoscopic versus open cholecystectomy, and technique used for open cholecystectomy.

We observed an incidence of 116 per 100000 inhabitants per year for gallbladder disease, demonstrating that cholecystectomy rate in Sweden has prevailed at a significantly higher level than before the introduction of the laparoscopic technique. There is no consensus as to which or how many patients with gallstone disease should be offered cholecystectomy. The proportion of gallstone patients having cholecystectomy varies in defined populations from 5% to 55%. On the basis of a recent randomised controlled trial it was concluded that watchful waiting may be a safe option for patients with symptomatic non-complicated gallstone disease. It has been shown that the prevalence of abdominal pain is significantly higher in cholecystectomised subjects than in subjects with a normal gallbladder. Obviously, there is a need for further studies to gain firm evidence on which to base advice to patients with gallstones and abdominal symptoms concerning cholecystectomy.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all the gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, persons who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other imaging of the abdomen. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year). Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, is usually moderate to severe in intensity, is located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated. The management of acute biliary colic mainly involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, with a shorter hospital stay and shorter convalescence period than open cholecystectomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is an alternative for patients who are critically ill with gallbladder empyema and sepsis.

### Cost-effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild acute gallstone pancreatitis [^114Pm17Q]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A recent Cochrane review suggested that laparoscopic cholecystectomy carried out early following mild gallstone pancreatitis was safe. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, during the same admission but after more than 3 days, or electively in a subsequent admission.

Methods

A model-based cost-utility analysis was performed estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient in the UK National Health Service with a 1-year time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources for mild gallstone pancreatitis, including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

Results

The costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 3 days of admission, beyond 3 days but in the same admission, and electively in a subsequent admission were € 2748, € 3543 and € 3752 respectively; the QALYs were 0.888, 0.888 and 0.884 respectively. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy had a 91 per cent probability of being cost-effective at the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the UK. It is acknowledged that many hospitals do not have access to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, especially at weekends, and that implementing a 3-day target is unrealistic without allocating new resources that could erode the cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

Performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for mild gallstone pancreatitis within 3 days of admission is cost-effective, but may not be feasible without significant resource allocation. After 3 days there is little financial advantage to same-admission operation.

### Patient-reported outcomes for acute gallstone pathology [^117LhRT5]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A number of prominent surgical trials and clinical guidelines regard length of hospital stay and rates of daycase surgery as being of upmost importance following cholecystectomy. However, it is unclear whether these outcomes also matter to patients. This study aimed to identify the factors patients regard as most important when admitted with acute gallstone pathology.

Methods

A 41-item survey was produced by combining outcomes assessed in recent clinical trials with results from a preliminary patient questionnaire. This was then given out prospectively to patients presenting with acute gallstone pathology, prior to their cholecystectomy. Patients were asked to read an information sheet about laparoscopic cholecystectomy and then complete the survey, scoring each item out of 100 in terms of importance to them.

Results

Fifty-six patients completed the survey (43 females; median age 51 years). Diagnoses were: cholecystitis (28 patients), biliary colic (13), pancreatitis (10), common bile duct stones (3) and cholangitis (2). The top-scoring survey item was "long-term quality of life after surgery", with a median value of 97 out of 100. Other high-scoring items included "cleanliness of the ward environment" and "pain control after surgery" (both 96). The lowest-scoring item was "being treated as a daycase" (54).

Conclusion

Patients with acute gallstone pathology view long-term quality of life after surgery as the most important factor and daycase surgery as the least important. These results should be considered when planning future surgical trials and clinical guidelines.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112hV9m8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Statements (timing of cholecystectomy)

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy during index admission is recommended in mild acute gallstone pancreatitis (1A).
When ERCP and sphincterotomy are performed during the index admission, the risk for recurrent pancreatitis is diminished, but same admission cholecystectomy is still advised since there is an increased risk for other biliary complications (1B).
In acute gallstone pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid collections, cholecystectomy should be deferred until fluid collections resolve or stabilize and acute inflammation ceases (2C).

Discussion

Two different systematic reviews state that index admission cholecystectomy for mild AGP is safe. In order to decrease the length of stay and the overall costs, cholecystectomy may be performed as early as the second hospital day, as long as the patient is clinically improving. Routine intraoperative cholangiography seems to be unnecessary in patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis and normalizing bilirubin levels. If ERCP was performed during the index admission, the risk for recurrent biliary events, especially recurrent AGP, was diminished but still higher than same-admission cholecystectomy. A multicenter RCT with 266 patients concluded that interval cholecystectomy resulted in more gallstone-related complications, especially recurrent pancreatitis and colics, without increased cholecystectomy-related complications. There is a single retrospective study of timing of cholecystectomy in patients with moderate to severe AGP with peripancreatic fluid collections. This study reported more complications after early cholecystectomy.

Open abdomen

Questions
Which are the indications for open abdomen in case of severe acute pancreatitis?
What is the best temporary abdominal closure system for open abdomen?
What is the correct timing for dressing changes?
What is the correct timing for abdominal closure?

Statements (open abdomen)

In patients with severe acute pancreatitis unresponsive to conservative management of IAH/ACS, surgical decompression and use of open abdomen are effective in treating the abdominal compartment syndrome (2C).
We suggest that clinicians should be cautious not to over-resuscitate patients with early SAP and measure intra-abdominal pressure regularly (1C).
We suggest that the open abdomen (OA) be avoided if other strategies can be used to mitigate or treat severe intra-abdominal hypertension in SAP (1C).
We recommend not to utilize the OA after necrosectomy for SAP (unless severe IAH mandates OA as a mandatory procedure) (1C).
We recommend not to debride or undertake early necrosectomy if forced to undertake an early OA due abdominal compartment syndrome or visceral ischemia (1A).

### The incidence, operative difficulty and outcomes of staged versus index admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration for all comers: a review of 5750 patients [^111uBrCu]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Index admission versus delayed cholecystectomy

Most patients with gallstone complications in this study (44.5%) underwent a cholecystectomy during an emergency index admission, with 79% of all cholecystectomies performed in one admission. The rate of "delayed" cholecystectomies of 20.1%, with more than a quarter of the previous episodes having occurred under the care of other hospitals or physicians, compares favourably with 36.8% of delayed cholecystectomies reported by the prospective CholeS study which captured current practice in 170 hospitals in the UK and Ireland during a two-month period in 2014. LC during an emergency admission was performed in only 15.8% in the CholeS cohort compared to the 44.5% in this study. The design of this biliary service, with a high workload of biliary emergencies, demonstrates the feasibility of IAC and optimises the clinical and cost outcomes within the recommended time frame of national guidelines. The feasibility of this policy was limited only by clinical fitness and by theatre availability in a small number of cases. Offering routine IOC (90% vs. 12% in CholeS) with CBD exploration (23.3% of all patients vs. 2.9% in the CholeS study) abolishes the delays associated with obtaining pre-operative MRCP, which was recorded in 5.5% and/or ERCP in 2.6% (vs. 26.1% and 10.8% in CholeS, respectively). Importantly, most of the pre-operative MRCP/ERCP observed in this study were obtained prior to referral to the biliary service. This study shows that IAC has a lower incidence of perioperative ERCP when compared to delayed cholecystectomy (0.9% vs. 8.9%) and this is consistent with the results of the Zhong et al. meta-analysis (2433 patients in 17 studies addressing ERCP usage). The safety of this single-stage approach with a high-volume emergency workload has previously been demonstrated.

Most patients with previous episodes had originally been admitted with biliary colic. These patients may require hospitalisation, in part, due to greater levels of pain in the context of reactive inflammatory processes. Therefore, effort should be concentrated on performing IAC in all suitable patients admitted with symptomatic gallstone disease, not only those with infective complications, pancreatitis or bile duct stones.

### Optimising the outcomes of index admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration for biliary emergencies: a service model [^117VQoTx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Gallstone related admissions represent nearly one third of emergency general surgery admissions in the United Kingdom — e.g. 15,000 in England in 2013–2014. Urgent cholecystectomy rates (within 10 days of first admission) for acute cholecystitis range from 0.2 to 35% across England. Sinha et al. and Harrison et al. reported wide variations in the management and outcomes of cholecystectomy in England and Scotland respectively. This led to the establishment of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on the management of gallstone diseases. In part, the guideline recommends early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 1 week of diagnosis) in the setting of acute cholecystitis and surgical bile duct clearance at the time of cholecystectomy. However, the rate of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains low partly due to logistic and financial constraints. Shabanzadeh et al. reported some 20% of patients with incidentally diagnosed gallstones will eventually develop symptoms or complications including acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, acute cholangitis and acute pancreatitis. While guidelines are specific to the individual biliary emergencies, these presentations occasionally overlap which may result in over-investigation and delays in non-specialist units.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a service model of index admission cholecystectomy including implementation and potential benefits of maximising index admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy and optimising resource utilisation.

### Timing of cholecystectomy after moderate and severe acute biliary pancreatitis… [^113QgGmA]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Is performing early cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe and severe acute biliary pancreatitis safe. Findings This cohort study of 3696 patients hospitalized for ABP found that early cholecystectomy in those with moderately severe and severe ABP had an increased risk of mortality and morbidity compared with patients with mild ABP undergoing early cholecystectomy and with patients with moderately severe and severe ABP undergoing delayed cholecystectomy. Meaning This study suggests that older and more fragile patients with severe complications of moderately severe and severe ABP should not be considered for early cholecystectomy. Importance Considering the lack of equipoise regarding the timing of cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe and severe acute biliary pancreatitis, it is critical to assess this issue. Objective To assess the outcomes of early cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe and severe ABP.

Design, Settings, and Participants. A total of 3696 patients who were hospitalized for ABP and underwent cholecystectomy were included in the analysis; of these, 1202 underwent EC, defined as a cholecystectomy performed within 14 days of admission. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify prognostic factors of mortality and morbidity. Data analysis was performed from January to February 2023. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study's findings suggest that EC should be considered carefully in patients with moderately severe and severe ABP, as it was associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity. However, older and more fragile patients manifesting severe complications related to ABP should most likely not be considered for EC. Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas; gallstones and biliary sludge are the most common cause of the disease, accounting for approximately 50% of the cases.

1 Although AP follows a mild and self-limited course in approximately 80% of cases, it can progress to moderately. Several aspects of the definitive treatment for ABP have been debated during the past decades, and credible evidence has started to emerge only recently. 18, 19 The multicenter PONCHO randomized clinical trial19 showed that same-admission cholecystectomy reduced the rate of recurrent gallstone-related complications in patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis, with a very low risk of postoperative complications, compared with delayed cholecystectomy. There are conflicting data, 5, 20, 21 based on a few small retrospective studies, 22–28 as reflected by a previous systematic review of current guidelines, 29 which demonstrated that current recommendations are based on a quality of evidence not above level 2C, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine.

30 Therefore, considering the lack of equipoise on the timing of cholecystectomy in patients with moderately severe and severe ABP, it is critical to assess the safety and outcomes of EC in such patients. A retrospective analysis was performed on all consecutive patients hospitalized between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, with a diagnosis of AP who subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. The exclusion criteria included the following: age younger than 16 years, AP with a cause other than gallstones, history of chronic pancreatitis, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Early cholecystectomy was defined as a cholecystectomy performed within 14 days of hospital admission, whereas DC was defined as a cholecystectomy performed more than 14 days after hospital admission. 36 Comorbidities were assessed on admission using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, 37.

### Monitoring patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis… [^116uGbyz]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Gallstones that obstruct the ampulla are responsible for initiating and maintaining biliary pancreatitis. The duration of the ampullary obstruction is directly linked to the severity of the illness. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has been suggested as the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic tool for use in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis. In most patients, gallstones migrate spontaneously within 48 hours, resolving the problem and making ERCP unwarranted. Acosta and associates evaluated the value of ordinary clinical and laboratory data in establishing the diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis and in predicting the course of the obstruction during the initial phases of the disease. Patients were eligible for the study if they presented with the appropriate clinical picture of acute pancreatitis and if cholelithiasis was evident on ultrasonogram at the time of admission, or if the patient had undergone prior cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis.

Other inclusion criteria included admission within 48 hours after onset of symptoms, bile-free gastric aspirate, increased serum amylase and bilirubin levels, and no history of alcohol abuse. The severity of the pancreatitis was established by applying the Ranson criteria at the time of admission, before treatment and again at 48 hours after admission. Monitoring of ampullary obstruction was conducted by using three parameters: the severity of the disease, particularly the severity of abdominal pain, which was checked every four to six hours; the presence of bile in the gastric aspirate, which was checked every six hours; and serial bilirubin levels determined at admission and every six hours thereafter. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by surgical exploration with intraoperative cholangiography or ERCP. After admission, 132 patients were assumed to have acute gallstone pancreatitis. Of these patients, 109 showed signs of ampullary decompression. Eleven of these 109 patients underwent successful treatment by conservative measures only and were excluded from the study. The remaining 98 patients formed the elective surgery group. The 23 patients in the other group showed signs of persistent ampullary gallstone obstruction. These patients comprised the urgent surgery group. Surgical and endoscopic findings revealed gallstones in 93 patients and cholesterolosis in two patients in group A. The remaining three had undergone prior cholecystectomy. Common duct stones were detected in 17 patients in this group. In group B, gallstones were found in 21 patients and cholesterolosis in one patient. The remaining patient had undergone a previous cholecystectomy. Common duct stones were detected in 17 patients, 14 of whom had a stone impacted at the ampulla.

The clinical impression using the three parameters previously mentioned had high sensitivity and specificity in predicting those with or without ampullary obstruction. When tests were positive for acute gallstone pancreatitis and patients underwent surgery, 95 percent showed clear signs of the suspected condition. The authors conclude that the diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis can be made using clinical evaluation and easily obtainable laboratory data. In addition, using these criteria can identify patients with persistent signs and symptoms who will require ERCP or surgical intervention to decompress the ampullary obstruction but spare those in whom the procedures are unnecessary.

### Management of gallstone cholangitis in the era of laparoscopic cholecystectomy… [^115oww3z]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Flow chart of management of 184 patients with gallstone cholangitis. IV indicates intravenous; ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; CBD, common bile duct; OCBDE, open common bile duct exploration; PTBD, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage; LC, laparoscopic cholecystectomy; and LCBDE, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration. Interventions The main treatments were endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by interval LC. Open or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was used when ERCP or ES failed. Main Outcome Measures. Conclusions Endoscopic sphincterotomy for biliary drainage and stone removal, followed by interval LC, is a safe and effective approach for managing gallstone cholangitis. Patients with gallbladder left in situ after ES have an increased risk of recurrent biliary symptoms.

Laparoscopic cholescystectomy should be recommended after endoscopic management of cholangitis except in patients with prohibitive surgical risk. All patients were admitted under the care of a single hepatobiliary surgical team and managed according to a standard protocol. Patients began fasting and were given intravenous fluid after admission. After routine blood tests including blood culture, a broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic, ticarcillin clavulanate, was administered immediately after a clinical diagnosis of acute cholangitis was made. Urgent ultrasonography was performed in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology to confirm the diagnosis. For patients with severe cholangitis, emergency ERCP was performed after initial stabilization within the same day of admission. For clinically mild cholangitis, ERCP was performed the next day after admission in most cases, and in any case not later than 72 hours after admission.

For patients in whom endoscopic clearance of CBD stones was successful, an interval LC was performed in 6 to 12 weeks. For elderly patients with comorbid illnesses, LC was offered unless the operative risk was considered prohibitive. High-risk patients, such as those with severe cardiopulmonary disease, and patients who refused surgery were managed conservatively with regular follow-up to monitor for any recurrent biliary symptoms. For patients in whom ERCP or endoscopic stone clearance failed, the management was governed by the severity of cholangitis. Patients with severe cholangitis were managed by emergency OCBDE or percutaneuous transhepatic biliary drainage if the patients were considered too unstable for an emergency operation. Patients with mild cholangitis that subsided with antibiotic treatment were managed by early elective OCBDE. Nine patients had post-ERCP pancreatitis, which resolved with conservative management. Two patients developed postsphincterotomy bleeding, both managed successfully by endoscopic hemostasis. There was no other morbidity or any mortality related to ERCP or ES. Among the 9 patients in whom ERCP failed, 3 underwent emergency OCBDE, 3 underwent early elective OCBDE after control of cholangitis with antibiotics, and 3 patients with septic shock underwent emergency percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. Two patients subsequently agreed to LC and underwent the operation uneventfully. Three patients with biliary colic were managed conservatively. This study documented for the first time the efficacy of the combined endoscopic and laparoscopic approach in a series of patients with acute gallstone cholangitis. The results of endoscopic management in this study corroborate data from other reports in which endoscopic decompression was employed for the management of acute cholangitis.

### Timing of CHolecystectomy in severe PAncreatitis (CHISPA): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^111F55ci]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2024). High credibility.

Background

Acute pancreatitis is an important cause of morbidity with growing incidence rates. Pancreatitis severity is classified according to Atlanta's revised criteria into mild, moderately severe, or severe. The etiology for acute pancreatitis is mostly of biliary origin and as a result performing cholecystectomy is part of the treatment to avoid recurrent episodes.

In mild acute pancreatitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended during the same hospital admission (also referred to as early cholecystectomy) due to evidence that reports it as a safe procedure associated with a reduction in complications relating to biliary disease. Modern guidelines for the management of mild acute pancreatitis recommend early cholecystectomy with a Grade 1A recommendation.

However, in the approximately 20% of cases classified as moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis there is not a clear current recommendation on timing of cholecystectomy. The WSES guidelines (World Journal of Emergency Surgery) recommend delayed cholecystectomy on patients diagnosed with pancreatitis with peripancreatic collections until they are resolved or when the patient is clinically and hemodynamically stable and inflammation subsides, with a Grade 2C recommendation (very weak recommendation; other alternatives may be equally reasonable). This recommendation was included based on a study that compared early versus delayed cholecystectomy on patients with moderately severe or severe pancreatitis and peripancreatic collections, finding a higher rate of complications in the early cholecystectomy group. A recently published retrospective study on which surgical outcomes for laparoscopic cholecystectomy after pancreatitis were compared evidenced that performing cholecystectomy is a safe procedure regardless of the severity of pancreatitis.

There is not any current evidence that dictates clear recommendations on an ideal timing for performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients diagnosed with severe pancreatitis. The aim of this study is to establish whether there is a difference in surgical outcomes between patients diagnosed with severe pancreatitis on which cholecystectomy was performed during the same hospital admission versus patients on which interval cholecystectomy was performed (4 weeks after recovery of pancreatitis).

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (UPGRADE trial) [^111h77RC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The number of bariatric interventions for morbid obesity is increasing worldwide. The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the bariatric intervention performed most often, although the sleeve gastrectomy is gaining popularity. Rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery is a major risk factor for the development of gallstones. Two population-based studies showed that patients who underwent bariatric surgery have a 5.5-fold increased risk of undergoing a cholecystectomy when compared to the general population. The incidence is highest between 7 and 24 months after bariatric surgery. Overall, 8–15% of patients with an intact gallbladder undergoing bariatric surgery will develop symptomatic gallstone disease within two years after surgery. The increased risk of gallstone development involves several determinants. Rapid weight loss leads to a change in cholesterol metabolism and consequently increases the concentration of cholesterol in the bile to a level at which not all cholesterol can be dissolved by the bile salts. The undissolved cholesterol is prone to crystallize into stones, especially in the presence of calcium and mucin, a glycoprotein that stimulates cholesterol crystal aggregation. The concentration of mucin in the bile increases 10–20 fold after bariatric surgery. The exact mechanism behind this increase is unknown. The risk of gallstone formation is also increased by incomplete and slower emptying of the gallbladder, causing stasis of bile. Symptomatic gallstone disease can lead to biliary colics, and severe complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis and pancreatitis. The risk of acute (biliary) pancreatitis is 50-fold increased in patients who underwent bariatric surgery, compared to the general population. In case of cholangitis, biliary pancreatitis or pain due to symptomatic bile duct stones, conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) cannot be performed due to the altered anatomy after RYGB. Therefore more invasive procedures, such as an ERCP via double balloon enteroscopy or a surgically created gastrostomy, or percutaneous transhepatic drainage need to be performed in these patients. Most patients with gallstone disease have milder disease and only suffer from biliary colics. These patients are treated with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which requires hospital admission and can be difficult due to adhesions caused by the previous bariatric surgery. In general, the chance of conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy is up to three times higher after previous abdominal surgery. Conversion to open cholecystectomy increases the risk of postoperative complications and the hospital costs. Another severe complication of cholecystectomy is bile leak due to bile duct injury.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of 4 combinations of laparoscopic and intraoperative techniques for management of gallstone disease with biliary duct calculi: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Zu6WV]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Several techniques are used for surgical treatment of gallstone disease with biliary duct calculi, but the safety and efficacy of these approaches have not been compared.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of 4 surgical approaches to gallstone disease with biliary duct calculi.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI-Web of Science databases, articles published between 1950 and 2017 and searched from August 12, 2017, to September 14, 2017. Search terms used were LCBDE, LC, preoperative, ERCP, postoperative, period, cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic, retrograde, rendezvous, intraoperative, one-stage, two-stage, single-stage, gallstone, gallstones, calculi, stone, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, surgery, surgical, procedures, clinical trials as topic, random, and allocation in several logical combinations.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing at least 2 of the following strategies: preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (PreERCP) plus laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC); LC with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCDBE); LC plus intraoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (IntraERCP); and LC plus postoperative ERCP (PostERCP).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis was performed. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to show the probability that each approach would be the best for each outcome.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were the safety to efficacy ratio using overall mortality and morbidity rates as the main indicators of safety and the success rate as an indicator of efficacy. Secondary outcomes were acute pancreatitis, biliary leak, overall bleeding, operative time, length of hospital stay, total cost, and readmission rate.

Results

The 20 trials comprised 2489 patients (and 2489 procedures). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus IntraERCP had the highest probability of being the most successful (SUCRA, 87.2%) and safest (SUCRA, 69.7%) with respect to morbidity. All approaches had similar results regarding overall mortality. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus LCBDE was the most successful for avoiding overall bleeding (SUCRA, 83.3%) and for the shortest operative time (SUCRA, 90.2%) and least total cost (SUCRA, 98.9%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus IntraERCP was the best approach for length of hospital stay (SUCRA, 92.7%). Inconsistency was found in operative time (indirect estimate, 19.05; 95% CI, 2.44–35.66; p = 0.02) and total cost (indirect estimate, 17.06; 95% CI, 3.56–107.21; p = 0.04). Heterogeneity was observed for success rate (τ, 0.8), operative time (τ, > 1), length of stay (τ, > 1), and total cost (τ, > 1).

Conclusions and Relevance

The combined LC and IntraERCP approach had the greatest odds to be the safest and appears to be the most successful. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy plus LBCDE appears to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis but may be associated with a higher risk of biliary leak.

### Indications of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease [^1161nQJr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies showed new insights in the indication and timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease. This review will provide an overview.

Recent Findings

Considerable variations in indication for gallbladder surgery have been noticed leading to a significant number of unnecessary cholecystectomies. As a consequence, up to 33% of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease have persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. On the other hand, studies showed that certain patients with acute cholecystitis, common bile duct stones and biliary pancreatitis benefit from same admission instead of delayed cholecystectomy.

Summary

A critical view on indications for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease prevents unnecessary cholecystectomies. In patients with mild-to-moderate complicated symptomatic gallstone disease, same-admission cholecystectomy reduces the risk of recurrent complications.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated biliary colic [^115ZN5BN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated biliary colic is one of the commonest indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several months of waiting if performed electively. However, people can develop life-threatening complications during this waiting period.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with uncomplicated biliary colic due to gallstones.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. We sought to include data on short-term mortality (30-day mortality or in-hospital mortality), bile duct injury, other serious adverse events, quality of life, conversion to open cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, operating time, and return to work. We planned to calculate the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan and based on intention-to-treat analysis when data were available. Since only one trial contributed data to this review, Fisher's exact test was used for binary outcomes. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Main Results

Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), contributed information to this review. The trial had a high risk of bias. Information on the outcome mortality was available for the 75 participants. Information on serious adverse events was available for 68 participants (28 people in the early group and 40 people in the delayed group). The other outcomes were available for 28 participants in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 35 participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. There were no deaths in the early group (0/35) (0%) versus 1/40 (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (P > 0.9999). There was no bile duct injury in either group. There were no serious adverse events related to the surgery in either group. During the waiting period, complications developed in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. The complications that the participants suffered included pancreatitis (n = 1), empyema of the gallbladder (n = 1), gallbladder perforation (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 2), obstructive jaundice (n = 2), and recurrent biliary colic (requiring hospital visits) (n = 5). In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these admissions occurred in the delayed group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the early group. The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was 0/28 (0%) in the early group, which was significantly lower than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group 9/40 (22.5%) (P = 0.0082). This trial did not report quality of life or return to work. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the early group 0/28 (0%) compared with the delayed group (6/35 or 17.1%) (P = 0.0743). There was a statistically significant shorter hospital stay in the early group than in the delayed group (MD -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45). There was a statistically significant shorter operating time in the early group than the delayed group (MD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting time 4.2 months), the hospital stay, and operating time. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings, and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^112RfRRj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Mild gallstone pancreatitis — same admission cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with mild gallstone pancreatitis, with supporting evidence that in a small (n = 50) randomized trial early < 48 hours cholecystectomy among patients with mild acute gallstone pancreatitis (Ranson's score < 3) shortened mean hospitalization by 2 days compared with later cholecystectomy during the initial admission; a literature review from 1992 to 2010 reported 948 patients, including 483 who underwent same admission cholecystectomy and 515 managed with interval cholecystectomy a median of 40 days (IQR, 19–58) after discharge, with among the latter group 95 patients (18%) readmitted before cholecystectomy — 43(8%) for recurrent pancreatitis, 35(7%) for biliary colic, and 17(3%) for acute cholecystitis — and there were no differences in adverse events or conversion to open procedure among those who underwent index hospitalization or interval cholecystectomy; additionally, in the PONCHO trial 266 patients from 23 Dutch centers with mild gallstone pancreatitis were randomized to same admission versus interval cholecystectomy, with the primary outcome defined as gallstone-related adverse events including cholangitis, biliary obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, biliary colic, or mortality.

### Treatment of gallstone pancreatitis: six-year experience in a single center [^116ogAi2]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a complicated disease in 20% to 25% of cases and carries a mortality of 8% to 15%. Etiologically, the most frequent form is acute biliary pancreatitis. Treatment of such an entity is still controversial, but minimally invasive techniques undoubtedly play an important role. We retrospectively analyze our cases of AP observed from January 1992 to May 1998. Etiology was biliary in 95/125 (76%) cases. In 90 cases we evaluated the patient within a few hours of the onset of symptoms. According to the Ranson criteria, we observed a mild form in 74/90 (82.2%) cases and a severe form in 16/90 (17.8%) cases. Our standard policy was to perform urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In particular clinical settings, other modalities of treatment were employed, such as percutaneous cholecystostomy and percutaneous drainage of fluid collections. Successful ERCP was performed in 86/90 cases (95.5%). The procedure was performed in an emergency setting (within 48 hours) in 62/90 cases (68.9%). Whenever the patient was a candidate for surgery, cholecystectomy was performed, laparoscopically in 67/90 cases (74.4%) and via laparotomy in 7/90 cases (7.8%). In only two cases was pancreatic necrosectomy necessary. Globally, we observed a low procedure-related morbidity (6.7%) and no mortality. In the setting of acute biliary pancreatitis, regardless of the severity of the attack, an urgent ERCP + endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and could enable successful management of the patient. Associated morbidity and mortality were low. In addition, when indicated, it is possible to treat a great number of concomitant complications with percutaneous ultrasound-guided drainage.

### Clinical update on acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis: between certainties and Grey areas [^1137biYQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) and acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) are significant complications of gallstone disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of current management practices for ACC and ABP. The Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines recommend early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) as the treatment of choice for ACC. High-risk patients may benefit from alternative treatments like biliary drainage, with emerging techniques such as endoscopic drainage showing promise. ABP requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. The Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC) criteria are used for diagnosis, with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy as primary treatments. Minimally invasive approaches are preferred for managing complications like infected pancreatic necrosis, with the endoscopic step-up method showing superior outcomes. The management of ACC and ABP continues to evolve. Future research is needed to refine guidelines further and address existing controversies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in these acute biliary conditions.

### Two-week target for laparoscopic cholecystectomy following gallstone pancreatitis is achievable and cost neutral [^111S9a78]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends that all patients with gallstone pancreatitis should undergo cholecystectomy within 2 weeks. This study assessed whether these guidelines are feasible and cost-effective.

Methods

Admissions for gallstone pancreatitis between January 2006 and January 2008 were reviewed. Readmissions for subsequent pancreatitis or biliary pathology were noted together with additional investigations, severity scores, hospital stay and time to cholecystectomy. The costs of readmission and theoretical costs of developing a dedicated operating list were provided by independent accountants.

Results

During the 2 years, 153 patients were admitted. Twenty-one patients (13.7 per cent) had further attacks requiring 40 readmissions. There were no deaths. Additional hospital costs related to readmissions were 172,170 pound sterling, including bed occupancy (67,860 pound sterling), investigations (12,510 pound sterling) and 153 cholecystectomies on an existing theatre list (91,800 pound sterling). The estimated cost of staffing a half-day theatre list every fortnight, performing 153 cholecystectomies, was 170,391 pound sterling.

Conclusion

Instigating a dedicated theatre for cholecystectomy after biliary pancreatitis has many potential benefits. The costs of readmissions and ad hoc operating are balanced by those of a dedicated theatre list in the long term. Implementation of the guidelines would save approximately 900 pound sterling annually and be cost neutral.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^113ZJGRh]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Gallstone disease in pregnancy — surgical timing and outcomes: Best Practice Advice 9 states, Cholecystectomy is safe during pregnancy; a laparoscopic approach is the standard of care regardless of trimester, but ideally in the second trimester. GD is the second leading cause (after acute appendicitis) of need for nonobstetric surgery in pregnancy and can cause significant surgical morbidity and mortality. Elective surgery is usually avoided in the first and third trimesters and is ideally performed in the second trimester to reduce the risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm labor, respectively. Recurrent biliary symptoms develop in 60% of pregnant patients with GD treated conservatively. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered superior to conservative management in the first or second trimester for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, and same-admission cholecystectomy in pregnant patients with acute biliary pancreatitis has been found to reduce the odds of early readmission by 85%. For biliary pain presenting late in the third trimester, postponing surgical intervention until delivery may be reasonable, if postponement does not pose a risk to maternal or fetal health. In a study of 1245 pregnant women with biliary pancreatitis, a significantly higher 30-day readmission rate was seen in patients who did not undergo index cholecystectomy (33.7% vs 5.3%; P < .01).

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallstone pancreatitis [^111nrRp4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones and alcohol account for more than 80% of acute pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment for gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred route for performing cholecystectomy. The timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after an attack of acute biliary pancreatitis is controversial.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in people with acute biliary pancreatitis. For mild acute pancreatitis, we considered 'early' laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within three days of onset of symptoms. We considered all laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed beyond three days of onset of symptoms as 'delayed'. For severe acute pancreatitis, we considered 'early' laparoscopic cholecystectomy as laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within the index admission. We considered all laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in a later admission as 'delayed'.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, issue 12), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until January 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, irrespective of language or publication status, comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute biliary pancreatitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted data. We planned to analyse data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2011). We calculated the risk ratio (RR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

We identified one trial comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with mild acute pancreatitis. Fifty participants with mild acute gallstone pancreatitis were randomised either to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 48 hours of admission irrespective of whether the abdominal symptoms were resolved or the laboratory values had returned to normal) (n = 25), or to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgery after resolution of abdominal pain and after the laboratory values had returned to normal) (n = 25). This trial is at high risk of bias. There was no short-term mortality in either group. There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.81). Health-related quality of life was not reported in this trial. There were no conversions to open cholecystectomy in either group. The total hospital stay was significantly shorter in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (MD -2.30 days; 95% CI -4.40 to -0.20). This trial reported neither the number of work-days lost nor the costs. We did not identify any trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after severe acute pancreatitis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of increased risk of complications after early laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy may shorten the total hospital stay in people with mild acute pancreatitis. If appropriate facilities and expertise are available, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears preferable to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in those with mild acute pancreatitis. There is currently no evidence to support or refute early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with severe acute pancreatitis. Further randomised controlled trials at low risk of bias are necessary in people with mild acute pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^114BcThD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year (the majority due to biliary colic but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and of need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes the people to gallstone-related complications.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regards to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the meta-analyses. A total of 488 participants with acute cholecystitis and fit to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) (244 people) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) (244 people) in the six trials. Blinding was not performed in any of the trials and so all the trials were at high risk of bias. Other than blinding, three of the six trials were at low risk of bias in the other domains such as sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. The proportion of females ranged between 43.3% and 80% in the trials that provided this information. The average age of participants ranged between 40 years and 60 years. There was no mortality in any of the participants in five trials that reported mortality. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who developed bile duct injury in the two groups (ELC 1/219 (adjusted proportion 0.4%) versus DLC 2/219 (0.9%); Peto OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.05 to 4.72 (5 trials)). There was no significant difference between the two groups (ELC 14/219 (adjusted proportion 6.5%) versus DLC 11/219 (5.0%); RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.61 to 2.72 (5 trials)) in terms of other serious complications. None of the trials reported quality of life from the time of randomisation. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy (ELC 49/244 (adjusted proportion 19.7%) versus DLC 54/244 (22.1%); RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25 (6 trials)). The total hospital stay was shorter in the early group than the delayed group by four days (MD -4.12 days; 95% CI -5.22 to -3.03 (4 trials; 373 people)). There was no significant difference in the operating time between the two groups (MD -1.22 minutes; 95% CI -3.07 to 0.64 (6 trials; 488 people)). Only one trial reported return to work. The people belonging to the ELC group returned to work earlier than the DLC group (MD -11.00 days; 95% CI -19.61 to -2.39 (1 trial; 36 people)). Four trials did not report any gallstone-related morbidity during the waiting period. One trial reported five gallstone-related morbidities (cholangitis: two; biliary colic not requiring urgent operation: one; acute cholecystitis not requiring urgent operation: two). There were no reports of pancreatitis during the waiting time. Gallstone-related morbidity was not reported in the remaining trials. Forty (18.3%) of the people belonging to the delayed group had either non-resolution of symptoms or recurrence of symptoms before their planned operation and had to undergo emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy in five trials. The proportion with conversion to open cholecystectomy was 45% (18/40) in this group of people.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no significant difference between early and late laparoscopic cholecystectomy on our primary outcomes. However, trials with high risk of bias indicate that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during acute cholecystitis seems safe and may shorten the total hospital stay. The majority of the important outcomes occurred rarely, and hence the confidence intervals are wide. It is unlikely that future randomised clinical trials will be powered to measure differences in bile duct injury and other serious complications since this might involve performing a trial of more than 50,000 people, but several smaller randomised trials may answer the questions through meta-analyses.

### Emergency laparoscopy – current best practice [^115ueipo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis

There are many causes of acute pancreatitis but gallstones and excess alcohol consumption are by far the commonest. Similarly, there is a large spectrum of clinical presentation and thus assessment of severity is key to successful management. However, laparoscopy for diagnostic or prognostic reasons is unnecessary, as this is obtainable through clinical presentation, appropriate imaging, and severity scores such as the Imrie score, the APACHE II score and Ranson's Criteria.

The surgical management of acute pancreatitis is heavily dependent upon the aetiology and severity of the episode. Unless there is an urgent indication such as haemorrhage or abdominal compartment syndrome, surgery should be delayed until the patient is adequately resuscitated and there is sufficient demarcation of any necrosis that may develop. If acute surgical exploration is unavoidable, laparoscopic surgery has been advocated for exploration, irrigation, drainage and necrosectomy but in the absence of any high quality evidence, the open approach remains the gold standard. If necrosis has organised, dependent upon it's type and location, three laparoscopic operative approaches have been reported: infracolic debridement, retroperitoneal debridement and transgastric pancreatic necrosectomy. Whilst no randomized studies performed, infracolic debridement has been most favourably reported, with patient survival of 85%. Acute pancreatitis, or an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis can lead to pseudocyst formation. Internal drainage is indicated 6 weeks after the first documentation of a pseudocyst and this can be performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopic pseudocyst gastrostomy, cyst jejunostomy, or cyst duodenostomy may all be indicated, depending on the size and location of the lesion.

In gallstone pancreatitis, bile duct clearance and cholecystectomy are essential to prevent disease recurrence. Thus all patients with biliary pancreatitis should undergo definitive management of their gallstones during the same hospital admission or at the very least, within two weeks. In mild cases, the best approach to this is laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography, as opposed to postoperative Endoscopic Retrograde CholangioPancreatography (ERCP). However, intraoperative laparoscopic bile duct exploration requires a significant amount of surgical expertise, and if this is not available pre-operative bile duct clearance must be ensured, either by ERCP or Magnetic Resonance CholangioPancreatography (MRCP). MRCP allows detection of choledocholithiasis with sensitivity and specificity bother over 90%, and thus in most patients a clear preoperative MRCP is enough to avert intra-operative bile duct exploration.
