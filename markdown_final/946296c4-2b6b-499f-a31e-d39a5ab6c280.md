## Question

What is the recommended treatment for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and baseline evaluation. Then, risk stratification for stroke, bleeding, and symptoms. Next, acute and chronic rate control, followed by anticoagulation strategy. After that, candidate selection and timing for rhythm control including cardioversion and ablation. I should then address lifestyle and risk factor modification, special populations such as HFrEF and postoperative AF, and finally monitoring, adherence, and follow-up with a brief synthesis and self-check against contemporary guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline status before I anchor any treatment plan, and wait, I should verify that we do not miss reversible precipitants. Diagnosis must be confirmed with a 12-lead ECG, and initial workup should include transthoracic echocardiography to assess chamber size and function, plus labs including CBC, metabolic panel, renal and hepatic function, and thyroid studies; concomitant conditions like hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, and heart failure should be actively screened because they shape both rhythm and stroke strategies [^115TCGPH] [^116QXbLS] [^115bhQ8N].

> I need to check stroke and bleeding risks and, hold on, I should also quantify symptom burden because it pivots rhythm decisions. Use CHA2DS2-VASc to determine anticoagulation candidacy and a bleeding risk tool such as HAS-BLED to flag modifiable bleeding risks; importantly, a higher bleeding score is not a reason to deny indicated anticoagulation but a prompt to mitigate risk and monitor closely, while symptom assessment (palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue) guides whether rate control alone suffices or rhythm control is prioritized [^115TCGPH] [^112gUYx7].

> For acute rate control in hemodynamically stable patients, I should confirm left ventricular function first; wait, let me verify the contraindications. Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil) are first-line if LVEF is preserved, but avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs when LVEF is under 40%; in critically ill or decompensated HF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable if beta-blockers and CCBs are contraindicated or ineffective [^111Sdrky] [^113RkMLE] [^113wfZqX] [^114m34W5].

> For ongoing rate control, let me reconsider target heart rates; lenient control is often acceptable initially, but I should aim tighter if symptoms persist. A lenient resting heart rate target under 110 bpm is reasonable at first, with escalation to stricter control if symptoms or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy concerns remain; continued beta-blocker or CCB therapy should be individualized to comorbidities and tolerance, reassessing periodically for AF progression or symptom change [^115yL76f] [^1111A18w] [^116cQg1a].

> Now stroke prevention: I should double-check thresholds and agent choice, and hold on, I must acknowledge real-world underuse and adherence gaps. Initiate oral anticoagulation when CHA2DS2-VASc is at least 2 in men or 3 in women, preferring DOACs over warfarin for non-valvular AF due to favorable safety and convenience, while ensuring warfarin in mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis; despite strong indications, inpatient initiation is often missed, and long-term adherence is suboptimal, so plan proactive follow-up and education, and remember specific reversal like idarucizumab for dabigatran in life-threatening bleeding when needed [^115TCGPH] [^112gUYx7] [^115P3Riz] [^117J6uXZ] [^115Z6nqd].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially said "rate control is first-line for most", but I should correct that in light of contemporary evidence favoring early rhythm control in selected patients. Early rhythm control can reduce arrhythmia burden and progression, with catheter ablation as a first-line option for symptomatic paroxysmal AF in appropriate patients, and cryoballoon ablation has been shown to lower progression to persistent AF compared with antiarrhythmic drugs; pharmacologic cardioversion with ibutilide is reasonable if LVEF is not depressed, amiodarone is preferred in heart failure, and electrical cardioversion is first-line in hemodynamic instability [^112gUYx7] [^111xPLCQ] [^114qAMhN] [^116ueM4P] [^116MWexS] [^115TCGPH].

> But wait, what about timing of ablation in newly diagnosed AF; I need to check whether earlier is better for persistent AF. Very early ablation within approximately 4 months may confer better AF-free outcomes in newly persistent AF and can reduce events with earlier intervention, though patient selection and substrate differ between paroxysmal and persistent cohorts, so shared decision-making with anatomy, comorbidity, and patient preferences remains essential [^113ExYdu].

> Next, I should review upstream therapy and lifestyle, since failing to address these undermines every other strategy. A comprehensive program targeting weight reduction, structured physical activity consistent with guideline-recommended volumes, optimal blood pressure control with ACE inhibitors or ARBs as appropriate, glycemic control, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol intake improves rhythm outcomes and reduces AF progression and complications, and I need to ensure these are embedded early rather than as an afterthought [^111EkyUk] [^116f6Zd2] [^113uEcsm].

> Special populations require tailored choices, and hold on, I should verify heart failure guidance to avoid harm. In HFrEF, initiate guideline-directed HF therapy and avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs for rate control; amiodarone is preferred when long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is needed for rhythm maintenance in HFrEF due to safety in reduced EF, and in postoperative AF, consider short-term prophylactic beta-blockers or amiodarone in high-risk cardiac surgery patients and posterior left pericardiotomy when undergoing CABG or valve procedures to reduce POAF incidence [^112mKRzj] [^113wfZqX] [^113c3brM] [^117U4T1R].

> Monitoring and follow-up cannot be an afterthought; I should confirm a plan for rhythm surveillance, adherence, and contingency strategies. Reassess symptoms, ECG rhythm, and AF progression regularly, reinforce anticoagulation adherence given known drop-offs, and if AV nodal ablation with pacemaker is pursued for refractory rate control, program the initial lower pacing rate to 80–90 bpm to mitigate sudden death risk during the early post-ablation period, with periodic re-optimization thereafter [^117J6uXZ] [^112CNSQK].

> One more self-check before concluding: I almost assumed that initiating anticoagulation in the emergency department after TIA would necessarily reduce 90-day stroke or TIA recurrence, but the observed data did not show a clear reduction with ED initiation, so timing should be individualized within the broader imperative to anticoagulate when indicated and safe, with expedited outpatient follow-up to avoid therapeutic inertia [^115PmgWA].

> Pulling it together, the core principle is an early, comprehensive, and personalized approach: confirm AF and substrate, quantify risk and symptoms, initiate appropriate rate control, deliver risk-adjusted anticoagulation, consider early rhythm control including first-line ablation in suitable symptomatic patients, and aggressively modify risk factors, which together reflect the shift from a passive rate-first paradigm to proactive disease modification supported by recent guideline recommendations and randomized evidence on early ablation and rhythm control strategies [^112gUYx7] [^115yL76f] [^114qAMhN] [^116fUqam] [^115omCVK].

For newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF), the priority is to assess hemodynamic stability [^115TCGPH] and initiate anticoagulation based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc to prevent stroke. For stable patients, start **rate control** with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [^111Sdrky]; use IV amiodarone [^114m34W5] if rapid ventricular response occurs with heart failure or if first-line agents are contraindicated [^116MWexS]. Rhythm control is for symptomatic patients or those with heart failure [^112gUYx7], using antiarrhythmics or cardioversion; consider **catheter ablation** early [^114qAMhN] in selected patients [^111xPLCQ]. Address reversible causes [^115FLPdu], optimize comorbidities [^112mKRzj], and provide lifestyle counseling [^111EkyUk]; arrange close follow-up [^116sNzgF] to monitor rhythm, anticoagulation, and symptoms [^114nRVuW].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic workup

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Immediate assessment; unstable patients need urgent electrical cardioversion [^112gUYx7].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Confirm AF and document rhythm [^115bhQ8N].

- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**: Evaluate cardiac structure, function, and thrombus risk [^116QXbLS].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, metabolic panel, thyroid function; add targeted tests as indicated [^116QXbLS].

- **Stroke and bleeding risk assessment**: Use CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS-BLED to guide anticoagulation.

---

## Acute management strategies

### Rate control

- **First-line agents**: Beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) for stable patients [^111Sdrky].

- **Heart failure considerations**: Avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs if LVEF < 40% [^113RkMLE].

- **IV amiodarone**: Use for rapid ventricular response with heart failure or when first-line agents are ineffective or contraindicated [^114m34W5] [^116MWexS].

- **Target heart rate**: Initial lenient control < 110 bpm; stricter targets if symptoms persist [^115yL76f].

---

### Rhythm control

- **Indications**: Symptomatic patients, heart failure, or when rate control fails [^112gUYx7].

- **Pharmacological cardioversion**: Ibutilide or amiodarone; consider flecainide or propafenone in selected patients [^116ueM4P] [^113wfZqX].

- **Electrical cardioversion**: For symptomatic or persistent AF, especially if pharmacological methods fail [^1139n1hJ].

- **Catheter ablation**: Consider early in symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF, particularly in younger patients with few comorbidities [^111xPLCQ] [^112gUYx7] [^114qAMhN].

---

## Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation is indicated for CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, with consideration at 1 in men or 2 in women. For nonvalvular AF, **direct oral anticoagulants** are preferred [^115TCGPH], while warfarin is used for valvular AF or when DOACs are contraindicated. Bleeding risk should be assessed, with mitigation guided by **HAS-BLED** [^112mKRzj].

---

## Management of underlying conditions and risk factors

Identify and treat **reversible causes** such as hyperthyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute illness [^115FLPdu]; **optimize comorbidities** including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and other cardiovascular conditions [^112mKRzj]; and implement **lifestyle modifications** addressing obesity, inactivity, alcohol, smoking, and diet [^111EkyUk] [^116f6Zd2].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should monitor **rhythm, rate control, anticoagulation, and symptoms**. Patient education should emphasize adherence, symptom recognition, and when to seek care [^115TCGPH]. Long-term management entails adjusting therapy based on symptoms, comorbidities, and patient preference.

### Association of atrial fibrillation burden with cardiovascular outcomes in new-onset atrial fibrillation complicating myocardial infarction [^115i5Eoh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Low credibility.

The outcomes studied included a composite of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, reinfarction, or ischemic stroke, its components, and all-cause death (major adverse cardiac events [MACEs]). All deaths without a definite non-cardiovascular cause were considered cardiovascular deaths. HF hospitalization was defined as a minimum of an overnight hospitalization for a patient presenting with symptoms and signs of HF or requiring intravenous diuretics. Reinfarction was defined according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Ischemic stroke was defined as the occurrence of a new focal neurologic deficit considered to be ischemic in origin, with signs or symptoms lasting more than 24 hours.

All patients were followed from the index discharge to the date of the presence of an outcome of interest, death, or last follow-up (September 2023), whichever came first. Follow-up data were obtained through direct or telephone interviews with patients themselves, their family, or through medical records by trained physicians. All clinical outcomes were adjudicated by physicians who were blinded to AF burden data.

### Early ablation of newly diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (NEWPaAF) versus newly diagnosed persistent atrial fibrillation (NEWPeAF): Comparison of patient populations and ablation outcomes [^113ExYdu]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). High credibility.

Little is known about very early atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation after the first AF detection. We evaluated patients with AF ablation within less than four months from newly diagnosed paroxysmal AF (NEWPaAF) and newly diagnosed persistent AF (NEWPeAF). We compared the two patient populations and assessed their ablation outcomes against those undergoing later ablation.

Ablation was performed within four months from AF diagnosis in 353 patients (135 with paroxysmal and 218 with persistent AF). Early ablation outcome was superior for patients with NEWPaAF compared to those with NEWPeAF for initial ablation (p = 0.030) but not for final ablation outcomes (p = 0.102). Despite recent AF diagnosis in both groups, they were clinically quite different.

Patients with NEWPaAF were younger (64.3 ± 13.0 years vs. 67.3 ± 10.9 years, p = 0.0020), had failed fewer drugs (0.39 vs. 0.60, p = 0.007), and displayed smaller left atrial size (4.12 ± 0.58 cm vs. 4.48 ± 0.59 cm, p < 0.0001). Additionally, they showed lower BMI (28.8 ± 5.0 vs. 30.3 ± 6.0, p = 0.016) and less prevalence of coronary artery disease (3.7% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.007), cardiomyopathies (2.2% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.0001), hypertension (46.7% vs. 67.4%, p < 0.0001), diabetes (8.1% vs. 17.4%, p = 0.011), and sleep apnea (20.0% vs. 30.3%, p = 0.031).

For patients with NEWPaAF, the AF-free outcome of early ablation was no different from that of later ablation (p = 0.314). However, for those with NEWPeAF, AF-free outcomes were significantly better with early ablation than with later ablation (p < 0.0001). Delaying ablation led to an increased occurrence of strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in both AF types (paroxysmal p = 0.014, persistent p < 0.0001).

In conclusion, patients undergoing early ablation for newly diagnosed persistent AF present with more comorbidities and have poorer initial ablation outcomes than those with NEWPaAF.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112CNSQK]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to atrioventricular nodal ablation and pacemaker placement, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend setting the initial pacemaker lower rate programming at 80–90 bpm. This is advised to reduce the risk of sudden death in patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response undergoing atrioventricular node ablation.

### New-onset atrial fibrillation is associated with cardiovascular events leading to death in a first time myocardial infarction population of 89,703 patients with long-term follow-up: a nationwide study [^111zTxsK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Our study suffers the limitations of any analysis of longitudinal registry data. However, the completeness of data, which enabled comprehensive follow-up for 10 years, adds strength to this study. The Danish National Patient Registry keeps records on discharge diagnosis from all hospitals in Denmark, thus avoiding the selection bias that may be present in surveys based on selected centers. Furthermore, both the Danish National Patient Registry and the national prescription registry have been shown to be accurate. The Danish healthcare system is government-financed, ensuring equal access to healthcare for all inhabitants free of charge, regardless of socioeconomic status.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The present study based on registries did not include clinical data and certain comorbid statuses, most importantly, hypertension, ejection fraction, myocardial infarction (MI) severity, and heart failure, which are associated with the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, MI, and death. This was a limitation. Additionally, we could not subdivide AF patients into groups according to the severity or persistence of the arrhythmia, which would have allowed us to distinguish between patients with low risk and those with a worse prognosis.

- **Addressing issues**: We addressed issues of potential bias and baseline imbalances between the groups by performing three different sensitivity analyses:
	1. A multiple model adjusting for potential confounders.
	2. Time-dependent variable analysis.
	3. A propensity score-matched analysis.

New-onset AF, whether paroxysmal or persistent, was assessed in this study.

### Atrial fibrillation [^112nr5od]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) results from the chaotic depolarization of atrial tissue and is the most common dysrhythmia diagnosed in United States (US) emergency departments. AF affects more than 1% of the general population, with a peak prevalence of 10% in those over 80 years of age. By 2050, it is estimated that nearly 16 million US patients will suffer from AF. AF has significant health effects and places a considerable economic burden on the health care system. This article discusses recommendations derived from a combination of existing guidelines, additional evidence, and consensus.

### Heart rate is associated with progression of atrial fibrillation, independent of rhythm [^114J3YgF]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Factors associated with progression in paroxysmal versus persistent AF: All but one of the risk factors had a similar impact on patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline, with the exception being the influence of anemia (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90, p = 0.0031 vs. OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32, p = 0.89). The p-value for the interaction was 0.0273, indicating that the impact of anemia was stronger in patients with paroxysmal AF.

### Clinical outcomes of Asian patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation: Insights from the CODE-AF registry [^112m1TV5]. Heart Rhythm (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) may have different clinical features in its early phase. The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics and clinical outcomes of early-phase AF with later-phase AF using a large multicenter prospective registry (CODE-AF [Comparison study of Drugs for symptom control and complication prevention of Atrial Fibrillation]).

- **Methods**: Patients enrolled between June 2016 and March 2021 were divided into two groups based on AF duration: (1) newly diagnosed (AF duration ≤ 90 days) and (2) previously diagnosed (AF duration > 90 days). Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared.

- **Results**: Among the 10,001 study participants (mean age 67.0 ± 14.5 years; 64% men), 22% were defined as newly diagnosed and 78% as previously diagnosed. Newly diagnosed patients had fewer comorbidities and more unhealthy social behaviors. Despite lower prescription rates of oral anticoagulants, direct oral anticoagulants were more frequently used. The newly diagnosed group also had a higher composite clinical outcome risk within 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.30–2.53, P < .001), and revealed a higher risk of all bleeding and heart failure admission within 90 days. No significant differences remained between the groups over the 36-month follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with early-stage AF were younger and had fewer comorbidities. Although there was a higher risk of heart failure admissions and minor bleeding, the risks of death, stroke, and major bleeding were not significantly increased.

### New antiarrhythmic drugs for treatment of atrial fibrillation [^111NKxiM]. Lancet (2010). Low credibility.

Inadequacies in therapies for atrial fibrillation have made new drug development crucial. Conventional antiarrhythmic drugs increase the risk of ventricular proarrhythmia. In drug development, the focus has been on favorable multichannel-blocking profiles, atrial-specific ion channels, and novel non-channel targets (upstream therapy). Molecular modification of the highly effective multichannel blocker, amiodarone, to improve safety and tolerability has produced promising analogues such as dronedarone, although this drug seems less effective than amiodarone. Vernakalant, an atrial-selective drug with reduced proarrhythmic risk, might be useful for cardioversion in atrial fibrillation.

Ranolazine, another atrial-selective agent initially developed as an antianginal, has efficacy for atrial fibrillation and is being tested in prospective clinical trials. So-called upstream therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-receptor inhibitors, statins, or omega-3 fatty acids and fish oil that target atrial remodeling could be effective but needs further clinical validation.

The focus is on the basic and clinical pharmacology of newly emerging antiarrhythmic drugs and non-traditional approaches such as upstream therapy for atrial fibrillation.

### A programme for early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation: A multi-centre study in primary care [^113UVMv5]. Family Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a morbid disease whose complications can be prevented if promptly and correctly treated.

- **Objective**: To assess the usefulness of an early AF diagnosis programme in at-risk individuals in primary care centres.

- **Methods**: In an open-label, multi-centre, controlled interventional study, individuals with one or more risk factors for AF but without known AF were enrolled. They were allocated to intervention and control groups in a 1:2 ratio. Participants in the intervention group had three clinical and educational visits (0, 6, and 12 months). In intervention subgroup A, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed at each visit, and in subgroup B, only if arrhythmia was detected on auscultation. After 2 years, the medical records of all participants were reviewed. Participants diagnosed with AF were followed for two additional years.

- **Results**: Of the total 2231 participants enrolled, 1503 (67.36%) were allocated to the control group, and 728 (32.63%) to the intervention groups (355 in subgroup A, 373 in subgroup B). The groups showed similar clinical characteristics. New-onset AF was diagnosed in 38 patients. Early detection in subgroup B was similar to subgroup A and superior to the control group (3.2% versus 1.2%, hazard ratio 3.149, 95% confidence interval 1.503–6.597, P = 0.002). AF patients in subgroups A and B had similar long-term complications and a tendency for fewer complications than AF patients in the control group.

- **Conclusions**: An intervention programme consisting of health education, systematic auscultation, and opportunistic ECG by a primary care team can effectively facilitate early diagnosis of AF in at-risk populations.

### Trends in drug spending of oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, 2014–2021 [^113vbdZ3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This study documents cost trends in oral anticoagulants (OACs) in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: Using MarketScan databases, the mean annual patients' out-of-pocket costs, insurance payments, and the proportion of patients initiating OACs within 90 days from atrial fibrillation diagnosis were calculated from July 2014 to June 2021. Costs of OACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) and the payments by three insurance types (commercial payers, Medicare, and Medicaid) were calculated. Patients' out-of-pocket costs and insurance payments were adjusted to 2021 prices. Joinpoint regression models were used to test trends of outcomes, and average annual percent changes (AAPC) were reported. Data analyses were performed in 2022–2023.

- **Results**: From July 2014 to June 2021, the mean annual out-of-pocket costs of any OAC increased for commercial insurance (AAPC 3.0%) and Medicare (AAPC 5.1%) but decreased for Medicaid (AAPC −3.3%). The mean annual insurance payments for any OAC significantly increased for all insurance groups (AAPC 13.1% [95% CI 11.3–15.0] for Medicare; AAPC 11.8% [95% CI 8.0–15.6] for commercial insurance; and AAPC 16.3% [95% CI 11.3–21.4] for Medicaid). The initiation of any OAC increased (AAPC 7.3% for commercial insurance; AAPC 10.2% for Medicare; AAPC 5.3% for Medicaid).

There was a substantial increase in the overall cost burden of OACs and OAC initiation rates in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation from 2014 to 2021. These findings provide insights into the associated economic challenges.

### Progression of atrial fibrillation after cryoablation or drug therapy [^114qAMhN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a chronic, progressive disorder, and persistent forms of atrial fibrillation are associated with increased risks of thromboembolism and heart failure. Catheter ablation as initial therapy may modify the pathogenic mechanism of atrial fibrillation and alter progression to persistent atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We report the 3-year follow-up of patients with paroxysmal, untreated atrial fibrillation who were enrolled in a trial in which they had been randomly assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation or to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. All the patients had implantable loop recorders placed at the time of trial entry, and evaluation was conducted by means of downloaded daily recordings and in-person visits every 6 months. Data regarding the first episode of persistent atrial fibrillation (lasting ≥ 7 days or lasting 48 hours to 7 days but requiring cardioversion for termination), atrial tachyarrhythmia (defined as atrial fibrillation, flutter, or tachycardia lasting ≥ 30 seconds), the burden of atrial fibrillation (percentage of time in atrial fibrillation), quality-of-life metrics, health care utilization, and safety were collected.

- **Results**: A total of 303 patients were enrolled, with 154 patients assigned to undergo initial rhythm-control therapy with cryoballoon ablation and 149 assigned to receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Over 36 months of follow-up, 3 patients (1.9%) in the ablation group had an episode of persistent atrial fibrillation, compared with 11 patients (7.4%) in the antiarrhythmic drug therapy group.

### Ninety-day stroke or transient ischemic attack recurrence in patients prescribed anticoagulation in the emergency department with atrial fibrillation and a new transient ischemic attack or minor stroke [^115PmgWA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

For patients with atrial fibrillation seen in the emergency department (ED) following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, the impact of initiating oral anticoagulation immediately rather than deferring the decision to outpatient follow-up is unknown.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a planned secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort of 11,507 adults in 13 Canadian EDs between 2006 and 2018. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with a final diagnosis of TIA or minor stroke with previously documented or newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. The primary outcome was subsequent stroke, recurrent TIA, or all-cause mortality within 90 days of the index TIA diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included stroke, recurrent TIA, or death and rates of major bleeding. Of the 11,507 subjects with TIA/minor stroke, atrial fibrillation was identified in 11.2% (1,286, mean age, 77.3 [SD 11.1] years, 52.4% male). Over half (699; 54.4%) were already taking anticoagulation, and 89 (6.9%) were newly prescribed anticoagulation in the ED. By 90 days, 4.0% of the atrial fibrillation cohort had experienced a subsequent stroke, 6.5% a subsequent TIA, and 2.6% died. Results of a multivariable logistic regression indicate no association between prescribed anticoagulation in the ED and these 90-day outcomes (composite odds ratio, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.74–2.52]). Major bleeding was found in 5 patients, none of whom were in the ED-initiated anticoagulation group.

- **Conclusions**: Initiating oral anticoagulation in the ED following new TIA was not associated with lower recurrence of stroke or TIA within 90 days.

### Atrial fibrillation: Common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation.

Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or another recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line therapy.

### A randomized clinical trial of early invasive intervention for atrial fibrillation (EARLY-AF) - methods and rationale [^115omCVK]. American Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

The ideal management of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unknown. Practice guidelines recommend a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) prior to considering an invasive ablation procedure; however, earlier ablation offers an opportunity to halt the progressive patho-anatomical changes associated with AF, as well as impart other important clinical benefits.

The aim of this study is to determine the optimal initial management strategy for patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic atrial fibrillation. The EARLY-AF study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02825979) is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial with a blinded assessment of outcomes. A total of 298 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to first-line AAD therapy or first-line cryoballoon-based pulmonary vein isolation. Patients with symptomatic treatment-naïve AF will be included. Arrhythmia outcomes will be assessed by implantable cardiac monitor (ICM). The primary outcome is time to first recurrence of AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia (AF/AFL/AT) between days 91 and 365 following AAD initiation or AF ablation. Secondary outcomes include arrhythmia burden, quality of life, and healthcare utilization.

The EARLY-AF study is a randomized trial designed to evaluate the optimal first management approach for patients with AF. We hypothesize that catheter ablation will be superior to drug therapy in the prevention of AF recurrence.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^1139n1hJ]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

In this study of a large sample of patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation who were followed up for two years, a small number received cardioversion at baseline. Importantly, we found that patients treated with baseline cardioversion appeared to have a significantly lower mortality risk during follow-up after adjustment for known confounders (event rates per 100 patient years 2.52 vs. 3.87, weighted hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.85, P < 0.001). Our analyses show that most patients treated with cardioversion receive a direct approach. Event rates for all-cause mortality in these patients, given differences in baseline risk, appear similar to those for patients who received pharmacological cardioversion.

Of the 44,201 patients included in the analysis of cardioversion versus no cardioversion at baseline, an attempt was made to restore sinus rhythm in only 14.9%. Given that the study population consisted of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, this number seems low. Studies suggest that recent onset atrial fibrillation responds favorably to rhythm control because a long duration of atrial fibrillation could make cardioversion less likely to succeed. Additionally, patients may experience symptom relief after rhythm control even when not obviously symptomatic before cardioversion. Therefore, international guidelines suggest a rhythm control strategy should be considered with the aim of reducing atrial fibrillation-related symptoms and improving quality of life.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control and maintenance therapy, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend initiating amiodarone in patients with AF and HFrEF who require long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy to prevent the recurrence and progression of AF. This should be done with careful consideration and monitoring for extracardiac toxicity.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning initial evaluation, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess cardiac structure. Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. Additionally, when clinical suspicion exists, targeted testing should assess other medical conditions associated with atrial fibrillation to determine stroke and bleeding risk factors and identify underlying conditions that will guide further management in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

In 2011, key trials with oral factor Xa inhibitors in patients with atrial fibrillation highlighted promising data on these novel anticoagulants. Patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors can be considered for oral anticoagulation. These novel, fixed-dose drugs are given without monitoring, so clinicians must learn to balance stroke and bleeding risks.

### Atrial fibrillation [^115VXHxe]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia resulting from the chaotic depolarization of atrial tissue. It is the most common sustained cardiac dysrhythmia and the most frequently diagnosed dysrhythmia in US emergency departments. All patients with AF must have their cardioembolic risk assessed, even if sinus rhythm is restored. Novel oral anticoagulants may be considered instead of vitamin K antagonists for anticoagulation in patients with nonvalvular AF.

### Risk stratification tools to guide a personalized approach for cardiac monitoring in embolic stroke of undetermined source [^117T2689]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Recommendations support a personalized sequential approach for cardiac rhythm monitoring to detect atrial fibrillation after embolic stroke of undetermined source. Several risk stratification scores have been proposed to predict the likelihood of atrial fibrillation after embolic stroke of undetermined source. This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the field by identifying risk scores proposed for this purpose, assessing their characteristics and the cohorts in which they were developed and validated, and scrutinizing their predictive performance.

We identified 11 risk scores, of which 4 were externally validated. The most frequent variables included were echocardiographic markers and demographics. The areas under the curve ranged between 0.70 and 0.94. The three scores with the highest area under the curve were the Decryptoring (0.94 [95% CI, 0.88–1.00]), newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (0.87 [95% CI, 0.79–0.94]), and AF‐ESUS (Atrial Fibrillation in Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) (0.85 [95% CI, 0.80–0.87]), of which only the latter was externally validated.

Risk stratification scores can guide a personalized approach for cardiac rhythm monitoring after embolic stroke of undetermined source.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness of population-based atrial fibrillation screening using contemporary modalities: A decision-analytic model [^111BjnEy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We constructed a microsimulation model to replicate the clinical course of atrial fibrillation (AF) using an individual-level state-transition approach. The model was developed using C++ and simulated a cohort of 50 million people. The age and comorbidity distribution of this cohort matched the 2019 U.S. population aged 65 years and older, which is the age at which AF screening is guideline-recommended. We assumed that only individuals at sufficient stroke risk to merit oral anticoagulation (OAC) based on the CHA2DS2-VASC score, in the presence of an AF diagnosis, would be screened.

Both the natural history (no screening) and 45 unique screening approaches were simulated. Health states in our model were characterized by the historical profile of clinical events that occurred in each simulated individual's life course up to that time. Factors included event acuteness, number and types of events, patient demographics (e.g. age and sex), AF status (including presence, burden, symptomatology, and diagnosis), presence of CHA2DS2-VASC risk factors, and use of antithrombotic treatment, each governing transition probabilities into future states. The time between state transitions was one month.

Given the greater risk for recurrent events and mortality observed after more recent clinical events, we modeled the recency of clinical events into three categories: acute (0–30 days), subacute (31 days to 1 year), and remote (> 1 year). To fully encompass the potential long-term consequences of screening, we adopted a lifetime horizon, ending simulation at death or age 100.

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: A clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. These recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care.

- **Recommendation 1**: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality, and may be inferior in some patient subgroups. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on specific considerations such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A.

- **Recommendation 2**: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (such as thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, or alcoholism). Grade: 1A.

- **Recommendation 3**: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended.

### Clinical prediction model for time in therapeutic range while on warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^115QhPFR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Though warfarin has historically been the primary oral anticoagulant for stroke prevention in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, several new direct oral anticoagulants may be preferred when anticoagulation control with warfarin is expected to be poor. This study developed a prediction model for time in therapeutic range among newly diagnosed patients on newly initiated warfarin as a tool to assist decision-making between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants.

- **Methods and results**: This electronic medical record–based, retrospective study included newly diagnosed, nonvalvular patients with no recent warfarin exposure, receiving primary care services through a large healthcare system in rural Pennsylvania. Time in therapeutic range was estimated as the percentage of time international normalized ratio measurements were between 2.0 and 3.0 during the first year following warfarin initiation. Candidate predictors were chosen from data elements collected during usual clinical care. A prediction model was developed and temporally validated, and its predictive performance was compared with the e-2 R² score (sex, age, medical history, treatment, tobacco, race) using R² and c-statistics. A total of 7877 newly diagnosed patients met study inclusion criteria. Median (interquartile range) time in therapeutic range within the first year of starting warfarin was 51% (32, 67). Of 85 candidate predictors evaluated, 15 were included in the final validated model with an R² of 15.4%. The proposed model showed better predictive performance than the e-2 R² score (R² = 3.0%).

- **Conclusions**: The proposed prediction model may assist in decision-making between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients.

### Effectiveness of early rhythm control in improving clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NaPHT]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, characterized by a rapidly rising incidence and prevalence. It is associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic complications, heart failure (HF), and other cardiovascular events, leading to an increased rate of mortality and disability. Rhythm and rate control therapy are two fundamental therapeutic strategies for AF, as part of an integrated approach to AF care. Both rhythm and rate control strategies improve the health-related quality of life in patients with recent-onset AF. However, no differences in long-term clinical outcomes have been observed between these two strategies. Moreover, patients with AF undergoing rhythm-control therapy have a higher risk of safety events than those with a rate-control strategy. As a result, guidelines generally recommend rhythm-control therapy only for symptomatic AF patients to improve their symptoms and quality of life. Nevertheless, the long-term prognostic outcomes of rhythm control in comparison with rate control remain inconclusive.

More recently, several studies have highlighted the superiority of early rhythm control over rate control in patients with recent-onset AF. The Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4), which included 2,789 patients with AF diagnosed up to one year before enrollment, suggested that early rhythm control, compared with rate control, significantly reduced the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, a subanalysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial

### Artificial intelligence-guided screening for atrial fibrillation using electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm: a prospective non-randomised interventional trial [^115y6orn]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Previous atrial fibrillation screening trials have highlighted the need for more targeted approaches. We conducted a pragmatic study to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm-guided targeted screening approach for identifying previously unrecognized atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: For this non-randomised interventional trial, we prospectively recruited patients with stroke risk factors but with no known atrial fibrillation who had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in routine practice. Participants wore a continuous ambulatory heart rhythm monitor for up to 30 days, with the data transmitted in near real time through a cellular connection. The AI algorithm was applied to the ECGs to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. In a secondary analysis, trial participants were propensity-score matched (1:1) to individuals from the eligible but unenrolled population who served as real-world controls.

- **Findings**: 1003 patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 8.8) from 40 US states completed the study. Over a mean 22.3 days of continuous monitoring, atrial fibrillation was detected in six (1.6%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7.6%) of 633 with high risk (odds ratio 4.98, 95% CI 2.11–11.75, p = 0.0002). Compared with usual care, AI-guided screening was associated with increased detection of atrial fibrillation (high-risk group: 3.6% [95% CI 2.3–5.4] with usual care vs. 10.6% [8.3–13.2] with AI-guided screening, p < 0.0001).

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative AF, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering the administration of short-term prophylactic β-blockers or amiodarone.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^116DFXb1]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

After anticoagulation treatment for stroke prevention has been prescribed to appropriate patients (those with increased risk of stroke), there are two main treatment approaches for atrial fibrillation. One approach is to try and restore sinus rhythm, which can be achieved by direct or pharmacological cardioversion. Rhythm control can potentially relieve symptoms and prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and left atrial remodeling.

The other treatment option is to allow atrial fibrillation to continue but to control the ventricular rate (rate control). Several randomized controlled trials have shown that this treatment strategy is non-inferior to rhythm control when considering endpoints such as stroke rates and mortality. Previous studies also indicate that rates of hospital admission for rate control are lower than those for rhythm control.

Guidelines in Europe and America support both strategies, but stress the need for better knowledge about their efficacy and safety. However, the recently reported Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) showed that early rhythm control was superior to guideline-mandated management, which consisted largely of rate control until or unless symptoms became refractory.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF (GARFIELD-AF) is a worldwide prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The registry includes information on baseline patient characteristics, rate of interventions such as cardioversions, and clinical outcomes.

### Towards a new classification of atrial fibrillation detected following a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack [^113qYdwE]. The Lancet Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Globally, up to 1.5 million individuals with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack can be newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation per year. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated supporting the notion that atrial fibrillation first detected following a stroke or transient ischaemic attack differs from atrial fibrillation known before the occurrence of a stroke. Atrial fibrillation detected after stroke is associated with a lower prevalence of risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and atrial cardiomyopathy than atrial fibrillation known before stroke occurrence. These differences might explain why it is associated with a lower risk of recurrence of ischaemic stroke than known atrial fibrillation.

Patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack can be classified into three categories: no atrial fibrillation, known atrial fibrillation before stroke occurrence, and atrial fibrillation detected after stroke. This classification could harmonise future research in the field and help to understand the role of prolonged cardiac monitoring for secondary stroke prevention. This would allow for the application of a personalised risk-based approach to the selection of patients for anticoagulation.

### Trajectories of oral anticoagulation adherence among Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation [^117J6uXZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, by applying group‐based trajectory models to Medicare claims data on newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, we described four trajectories of adherence to oral anticoagulation (OAC) and observed that less than 45% of newly diagnosed AF patients belonged to the trajectory group characterized by continuous OAC adherence. Trajectories of OAC adherence were associated not only with demographics and clinical characteristics but also with regional factors. Some predictors of OAC use were also associated with the timing of the OAC initiation and the likelihood of discontinuation.

### Atrial fibrillation [^1124KDUb]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and its prevalence increases with age and the number of cardiovascular comorbidities. AF is characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat that can be asymptomatic or lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea, and dizziness. The condition can also be associated with serious complications, including an increased risk of stroke.

Important recent developments in the clinical epidemiology and management of AF have informed our approach to this arrhythmia. This primer provides a comprehensive overview of AF, including its epidemiology, mechanisms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and management. Management strategies, including stroke prevention, rate control, and rhythm control, are considered. We also address quality of life issues and provide an outlook on future developments and ongoing clinical trials in managing this common arrhythmia.

### Recent-onset atrial fibrillation: challenges and opportunities [^116fUqam]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly diagnosed early, close to its first occurrence due to several factors: (i) increased public awareness with self-screening; (ii) healthcare initiatives, including population screening and opportunistic case finding; and (iii) increased use and surveillance of implantable cardiac devices. At its onset, AF is often low burden, and cardiovascular co-morbidities may be absent or at an early stage. Thus, the management of recent-onset AF has become an issue of growing importance.

Professional guidelines have traditionally focused on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis, generally recommending a cautious approach to rhythm control, and priority has been given to rate control to alleviate symptoms. In recent guidelines, the importance of managing lifestyle and co-morbidities has increased. The AF-SCREEN collaboration suggests that a vigorous approach to active management of recent-onset AF may be warranted. This includes addressing co-morbidities and promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent the emergence or progression of AF and associated cardiovascular disease.

The initiation of active rhythm control with or without anticoagulation aims to prevent AF-related morbidity and mortality, including stroke and heart failure (HF). Intuitively, intervention early after AF onset would be beneficial since lifestyle and co-morbidity management, plus rhythm control and anticoagulation, are important contributors to improved outcomes in patients with established AF. However, robust evidence is lacking for recent-onset AF. There is a delicate balance between achieving favorable outcomes and the need for further evidence in this area.

### Initiation of oral anticoagulation in US older adults newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation during hospitalization [^115P3Riz]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke among older adults and is often first detected during hospitalization, given the frequent use of cardiac telemetry.

- **Methods**: In a 20% national sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, we identified patients aged 65 or older who were newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation while hospitalized in 2016. Our primary outcome was an oral anticoagulant claim within 7 days of discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed relationships between anticoagulation initiation and thromboembolic and bleeding risk scores while controlling for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, and hospitalization characteristics.

- **Results**: Among 38,379 older adults newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation while hospitalized (mean age 78.2 [SD 8.4]; 51.8% female; 83.3% white), 36,633 (95.4%) had an indication for anticoagulation, and 24.6% (9,011) of those initiated an oral anticoagulant following discharge. A higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc score was associated with a small increase in oral anticoagulant initiation (predicted probability 20.5% [95% CI, 18.7%-22.3%] for scores < 2 and 24.9% [CI, 24.4%-25.4%] for ≥ 4). An elevated HAS-BLED score was associated with a small decrease in the probability of anticoagulant initiation (25.4% [CI, 24.4%-26.4%] for score < 2 and 23.1% [CI, 22.5%-23.8%] for ≥ 3). Frailty was associated with a decreased likelihood of oral anticoagulant initiation (24.7% [CI, 23.2%-26.2%] for non-frail and 18.1% [CI, 16.6%-19.6%] for moderately-severely frail). Anticoagulant initiation varied by the primary reason for hospitalization.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke, and myocardial infarction. Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological changes that predispose individuals to the induction and maintenance of AF. Progress has been limited by the realization that AF is a complex arrhythmia resulting from various pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients and species.

In this focused review article, we aim to succinctly summarize for the non-specialist the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF, and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may contribute to the development of AF. Finally, we outline the translational implications for future rhythm control strategies in patients with AF.

### The impact of new and emerging clinical data on treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation [^116oTzWj]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

The Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Exchange Group, an international multidisciplinary group concerned with the management of AF, was convened to review recent advances in the field and the potential impact on treatment strategies.

- **Methods**: Issues discussed included epidemiology and the impact of the rising incidence of AF on healthcare systems; developments in pharmacological and surgical interventions in the management of arrhythmias and thromboprophylaxis; the potential to affect treatment strategies; and barriers to implementing them.

- **Results**: The incidence of AF and the associated burden on healthcare systems are increasing with aging populations, prevalence of comorbidities, and more effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Advances in available medical treatments, particularly dronedarone and dabigatran, with other products in development, offer the possibility of changes in treatment paradigms and a greater emphasis on reducing hospitalizations and improving long-term outcomes instead of a symptom/safety-driven approach where the priority is symptom suppression without provoking drug toxicity. Developments in catheter ablation techniques may mean that, in experienced centers, ablation may be offered as first-line treatment in selected patient populations. Barriers to optimal treatment include underdiagnosis, lack of recognition as a serious condition and as a risk factor for stroke, limited access to care, inadequate implementation of guidelines, and poor adherence to treatment.

- **Conclusions**: The focus of the management of AF may be changing.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116ueM4P]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control and pharmacological cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of ibutilide for pharmacological cardioversion in patients with AF who do not have depressed left ventricular function (LVEF < 40%).

### Individual and combined risk factors for incident atrial fibrillation and incident stroke: An analysis of 3 million at-risk US patients [^111YDBEz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The most recently revised AF guideline from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation/Heart Rhythm Society highlights clinical risk factors associated with increased risks for AF but has not incorporated risk assessment schema for the identification and management of patients at risk for AF. As the management of common cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure and ischemic heart disease, has moved to a stratified approach based on risk level, we anticipate the management of AF and stroke to follow a similarly expanded framework. Observations from our study have relevant implications with respect to risk stratification of the population.

Our data underscore the importance of age ≥ 75, especially when combined with hypertension, as a prevalent and high-risk combination for both incident AF and incident stroke. In this particularly vulnerable and prevalent cohort, more proactive measures to screen for incident AF and other modifiable risk factors may be warranted. The use of longer-term, external electrocardiographic monitoring devices could provide a particular benefit in this population, especially if symptoms are present. Given that AF is underdiagnosed and may even present as incident stroke, earlier identification of subclinical AF in this high-risk cohort may permit earlier introduction of preventive measures, such as thromboprophylaxis where indicated. The value and optimal methodology for screening for AF in this cohort are incompletely understood and require further study.

### Trends in excess mortality associated with atrial fibrillation over 45 years (Framingham Heart Study): Community based cohort study [^114686DV]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

We observed a temporal trend in the association between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and cause-specific mortality. There was a decrease in cardiovascular mortality over time among all participants. The lifetime risk of cardiovascular death was 35% (95% confidence interval: 32% to 39%) during time period 1 and decreased to 16% (13% to 18%) in period 3. In contrast, non-cardiovascular mortality remained similar across the three time periods. Across all periods, atrial fibrillation had a stronger association with cardiovascular death than with non-cardiovascular death. There was no evidence of change over time in the association between atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular death. However, the strength of the association between atrial fibrillation and non-cardiovascular death decreased over time (hazard ratio of 3.2 in time period 1 compared to 2.0 in time period 3). We also employed a matched cohort approach to estimate the association between atrial fibrillation and cause-specific mortality. The results were consistent with the main analyses.

- **Table 3: Association between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and cause-specific mortality**: Data are presented as hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) from an illness-death model. Cause-specific proportional hazards models were fitted with time-dependent atrial fibrillation. Models 2 and 3 were adjusted for clinical covariates listed in table 1. Linear trends across time periods were tested using meta-regression models of log hazard ratios.

The findings underscore the importance of monitoring atrial fibrillation's impact on mortality over prolonged periods.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: The 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^116sNzgF]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the evolving epidemics in cardiovascular medicine. AF is projected to develop in 25% of currently 40-year-old adults, provokes many often severe strokes, is associated with increased mortality, and often leads to heart failure or sudden death even in well-anticoagulated patients. The last few years have seen the development of new approaches to detect and treat patients with AF, from ECG screening to surgical procedures to prevent recurrence of AF. While these improvements provide tools to improve outcomes and quality of life in affected patients, they often require multidisciplinary input into patient management. Therefore, it seems timely that the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) issued new AF guidelines in August 2016.

### A proposal for new clinical concepts in the management of atrial fibrillation [^117AP3To]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a growing public health burden. It is a complex condition involving several etiologic factors and arrhythmia mechanisms associated with atrial remodeling. Greater understanding of these mechanisms may improve therapy. Current AF classification schemes are limited by their simplicity. Several risk factors predict AF onset, and additional factors are being evaluated in registry studies. Doppler imaging and Holter monitoring in high-risk patients to predict the onset of AF and progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF are promising.

There is a need for a novel multifactorial classification model encompassing AF duration, symptoms, markers of atrial remodeling, and a risk score for AF onset, persistence, progression, and complications to guide treatment and prognostication. Preventing AF onset with upstream therapy is of great interest, but data are conflicting. More study is needed to optimize rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs and targeted ablation to specific patient populations at an earlier stage. There is little consensus on optimal rate control, and no information relates to optimum rate control in specific populations. This article highlights new concepts in AF and directions for future research.

### Ten-year trend of oral anticoagulation use in postoperative and nonpostoperative atrial fibrillation in routine clinical practice [^114nRVuW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The study aimed to describe the patterns and trends of initiation, discontinuation, and adherence of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), and compare them with patients newly diagnosed with non-POAF.

- **Methods and results**: This retrospective cohort study identified patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or flutter between 2012 and 2021 using administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. The POAF cohort included 118,366 patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or flutter within 30 days after surgery. The non-POAF cohort included the remaining 315,832 patients who were newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or flutter but not within 30 days after surgery. OAC initiation increased from 28.9% to 44.0% from 2012 to 2021 in POAF, and from 37.8% to 59.9% in non-POAF. Twelve-month medication adherence increased from 47.0% to 61.8% in POAF, and from 59.7% to 70.4% in non-POAF. The median time to OAC discontinuation was 177 days for POAF, and 242 days for non-POAF. Patients who saw a cardiologist within 90 days of the first atrial fibrillation or flutter diagnosis, regardless of POAF or non-POAF, were more likely to initiate OAC (odds ratio, 2.92 [95% CI, 2.87–2.98]; P < 0.0001), adhere to OAC (odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04–1.13]; P < 0.0001), and were less likely to discontinue (odds ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.82–0.85]; P < 0.0001) than patients who saw a surgeon or other specialists.

- **Conclusions**: The use of and adherence to OAC were higher in non-POAF patients than in POAF patients, but they increased over time.

### Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation linked to wake-up stroke and TIA: Hypothetical implications [^113BXKF9]. Neurology (2013).

Based on the higher frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during night and early morning hours, we sought to analyze the association between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and wake-up ischemic cerebrovascular events.

- **Methods**: We prospectively assessed every acute ischemic stroke and TIA patient admitted to our hospital between 2008 and 2011. We used a forward step-by-step multiple logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and wake-up ischemic stroke or TIA, after adjusting for significant covariates.

- **Results**: The study population comprised 356 patients; 274 (77.0%) were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke, and 82 (23.0%) with TIA. A total of 41 (11.5%) of these events occurred during night sleep. A newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation was detected in 27 of 272 patients without known atrial fibrillation (9.9%). We found an independent association between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and wake-up ischemic stroke and TIA (odds ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2–7.7, p = 0.019).

- **Conclusions**: The odds of detecting a newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation were 3-fold higher among wake-up cerebrovascular events than among non-wake-up events. The significance of this independent association between newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation and wake-up ischemic stroke and TIA, and the role of other comorbidities should be investigated in future studies.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Z6nqd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning the management of bleeding, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend administering idarucizumab to rapidly reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran in patients with atrial fibrillation who develop life-threatening bleeding while on dabigatran. If idarucizumab is unavailable, consider administering activated prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran.

### Chapter 1: The evolving atrial fibrillation landscape: Importance of early diagnosis and treatment [^11395Rb5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Chapter 1 begins with data that show the rising prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is increasing in tandem with the growing number of older adults, the increased survival of people who have cardiovascular (CV) disorders, and the expanding use of wearable and insertable/implantable devices capable of detection. Together, these increases will result in healthcare providers seeing more patients with AF who present at earlier stages of the disease.

The panel discussion covers information regarding symptoms that are common to patients with AF as well as information about the important adverse outcomes that may occur in patients with AF, including heart failure, hospitalization, thromboembolism, and death. Notably, these events may reflect either the comorbidities commonly underlying AF, AF itself, or a combination of these conditions.

The chapter also introduces the four pillars of therapy: "upstream therapy", rate control, rhythm control, and embolic prevention — with an emphasis on early rhythm control as being optimal.

Chapter 1 is summarized as follows.

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: What should we do [^116hUKbN]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Managing concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) presents significant challenges. Clinicians often focus on treatment aspects that have evidence supporting either HFrEF or AF independently. Researchers are examining whether treatment efficacy differs in patients with concurrent diseases, but current data remains limited.

In this overview, we summarize treatment evidence and propose a clinical mnemonic for managing newly diagnosed concomitant HF and AF. The CAN-TREAT HFrEF + AF algorithm differentiates management for these patients from those with sinus rhythm.

- **Urgent cardioversion (C)**: Address haemodynamic instability promptly.
- **Anticoagulation (A)**: Initiate to prevent thromboembolism.
- **Diuretic therapy (N)**: Normalize fluid balance and reduce HF symptoms.

Subsequent therapies should aim to:

- **Target (T)**: Achieve an initial heart rate < 110 b.p.m and initiate RAAS antagonism (R), recognizing limited efficacy data.
- **Early rhythm control (E)**: For symptoms unresponsive to rate control.
- **Advanced HF therapies (A)**: Consider options such as cardiac resynchronization therapy.
- **Aggressive treatment (T)**: Address other concurrent cardiovascular diseases, particularly ischemia and hypertension.

These steps are crucial in differentiating the management of patients with HFrEF and AF from those with sinus rhythm.

### Rapid access arrhythmia clinic for the diagnosis and management of new arrhythmias presenting in the community: a prospective, descriptive study [^111SFfGT]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate whether a rapid access approach is useful for the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of a new cardiac arrhythmia, a prospective, descriptive study was conducted. The setting was a secondary care-based rapid access arrhythmia clinic in West London, UK.

Participants included patients referred by their general practitioner or the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of a new cardiac arrhythmia.

- **Main outcome measures**: Number of patients with a newly diagnosed significant arrhythmia, number of patients with diagnosed atrial fibrillation, and number of eligible, moderate, and high-risk patients treated with warfarin.

Over a 25-month period, 984 referrals were assessed. The mean age was 55 years (range 20–90 years) and 56% were women. The median time from referral to assessment was one day. A significant cardiac arrhythmia was newly diagnosed in 40% of patients referred to the RAAC. The most common arrhythmia was atrial fibrillation, with 203 new cases (21%). Of these, 74% of eligible patients over 65 were treated with warfarin. Other arrhythmias diagnosed were supraventricular tachycardias (127, 13%), conduction disorders (43, 4%), and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (21, 2%). Vasovagal syncope was diagnosed for 53 patients (5%). The most frequent diagnosis was symptomatic ventricular and supraventricular extrasystoles (355, 36%).

In conclusion, a rapid access arrhythmia clinic is an innovative approach to the diagnosis and management of new cardiac arrhythmias in the community. It provides a rapid diagnosis, stratifies risk, and leads to efficient management of patients.

### Clinical prediction model for time in therapeutic range while on warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^111Egx9R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Out of 20,183 new atrial fibrillation diagnoses between 2003 and 2014, 10,652 patients (53%) were taking warfarin within 90 days of diagnosis, while 1,267 (6%) were taking a DOAC. Among warfarin users, 7,877 (74%) met the definition for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, had no documentation of warfarin use before diagnosis, and had at least 4 INR measurements within 1 year following warfarin initiation. The median (interquartile range) time in therapeutic range (TTR) within the first year following warfarin initiation was 51% (32, 67), and beyond the first year was 61% (44, 74). The distribution of first-year TTRs is shown in Figure 1. The linear regression model containing all 85 candidate predictors (the full model) had an R² of 19.5%.

- **Figure 1**: Distribution of percent time in therapeutic range on warfarin among newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients within the first year of starting warfarin.

- **Development set**: The development set contained 5,173 patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation before May 1, 2011, and had a median first-year TTR of 52% (33, 67). After applying the forward stepwise variable selection algorithm, 32 of the original 85 candidate predictors met the development set model inclusion criteria. The 10 strongest predictors of TTR in descending rank order according to F statistic magnitude were as follows: (1) any antiarrhythmic; (2) aspirin; (3) valve disease; (4) lung disease; (5) myocardial infarction; (6) anemia; (7) gastrointestinal bleeding; (8) albumin; (9) venous thromboembolism; and (10) stroke — hemorrhagic. The R² for this model was 18.3%.

### Contemporary prevalence estimates of undiagnosed and diagnosed atrial fibrillation in the United States [^112eCTAf]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Several limitations are present in this analysis. First, our back-calculation method assumes that patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnosed following a stroke had AF for 1 or 2 years before the stroke event. While this is likely given that AF is a chronic condition, it is possible that patients could have had undetected AF for varying lengths of time before diagnosis, impacting the results of the back-calculation and extrapolated prevalence.

Second, for the 2-year estimate, we only required baseline enrollment for at least 1 year, so patients may have been diagnosed with AF before their health plan enrollment. However, 71% of patients had 2 years of medical enrollment before their AF diagnosis.

Third, our back-calculation method is novel and only previously implemented once; as such, further validation of the method is needed to determine the accuracy of estimating undiagnosed AF.

Fourth, it was assumed that the stroke rate in each database (1%–4%) was consistent for all patients and was accurately estimated.

Fifth, the estimates rely on diagnosis codes and the accuracy of the back-calculation method; therefore, screening studies would provide a better estimate of diagnosed and undiagnosed AF.

Sixth, the back-calculation relied on a diagnosis of AF after their stroke and may underestimate undiagnosed patients. Patients could die before being diagnosed with AF, may not be symptomatic after their stroke and remain undiagnosed, or could have dominating neurologic issues that would make recording an AF diagnosis a passing thought. Lastly, the prevalence calculation was based on insured populations, which may not fully represent the general population.

### Trends in drug spending of oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, 2014–2021 [^1125jGKg]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This study documents cost trends in oral anticoagulants (OAC) in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: Using MarketScan databases, the mean annual patients' out-of-pocket costs, insurance payments, and the proportion of patients initiating OAC within 90 days from atrial fibrillation diagnosis were calculated from July 2014 to June 2021. Costs of OACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin) and the payments by three insurance types (commercial payers, Medicare, and Medicaid) were calculated. Patients' out-of-pocket costs and insurance payments were adjusted to 2021 prices. Joinpoint regression models were used to test trends of outcomes and average annual percent changes (AAPC) were reported. Data analyses were performed in 2022–2023.

- **Results**: From July 2014 to June 2021, the mean annual out-of-pocket costs of any OAC increased for commercial insurance (AAPC 3.0%) and Medicare (AAPC 5.1%) but decreased for Medicaid (AAPC -3.3%). The mean annual insurance payments for any OAC significantly increased for all insurance groups (AAPC 13.1% [95% CI 11.3–15.0] for Medicare; AAPC 11.8% [95% CI 8.0–15.6] for commercial insurance; and AAPC 16.3% [95% CI 11.3–21.4] for Medicaid). The initiation of any OAC increased (AAPC 7.3% for commercial insurance; AAPC 10.2% for Medicare; AAPC 5.3% for Medicaid).

- **Conclusions**: There was a substantial increase in the overall cost burden of OACs and OAC initiation rates in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation from 2014 to 2021. These findings provide insights into the trends in drug spending during this period.
