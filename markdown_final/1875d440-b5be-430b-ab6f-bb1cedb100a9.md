## Question

What is the etiology of a chyle leak?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the etiology of chyle leak. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and core pathophysiology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should categorize etiologies into iatrogenic, traumatic, and non-traumatic causes. Next, I will detail the most common iatrogenic sources by operation and mechanism, followed by the traumatic and pathological categories. After that, I should verify risk factor hierarchies and reconcile conflicting evidence. Finally, I will align the etiologic understanding with ISGPS grading and synthesize a coherent pathophysiological cascade that explains clinical variability [^112aVrXc] [^114ZWt51] [^116fC8xW].

> Let me first confirm the definition and fundamental pathophysiology. A chyle leak after pancreatic surgery is defined by ISGPS as the output of milky fluid from a drain, drain site, or wound on or after postoperative day 3 with triglycerides ≥ 110 mg/dL, and graded A to C by clinical consequence; mechanistically this reflects disruption of lymphatic conduits transporting triglyceride-rich, lymphocyte-laden chyle from intestinal lacteals via cisterna chyli and thoracic duct into the venous system, with injury, obstruction, or failed lymphatico-venous drainage driving extravasation into surgical fields or serous cavities [^112aVrXc].

> Hold on, I should verify the top-level etiologic categories before diving deeper. The evidence consistently groups causes into iatrogenic (predominant, especially after thoracic, abdominal, and neck oncologic resections), traumatic non-surgical (blunt and penetrating), and non-traumatic pathologic processes including malignancy, congenital lymphatic disorders, and systemic infections or idiopathic obstruction; I need to ensure I do not conflate the proportion for postoperative cohorts with population-level chylothorax where malignancy dominates, as postoperative series are overwhelmingly iatrogenic while general chylothorax often cites lymphoma as the leading single cause [^114ZWt51] [^116fC8xW] [^114F4Coz].

> I will now examine iatrogenic etiologies in detail, starting with pancreatic surgery because high-quality nationwide data exist. Wait, let me verify the incidence and risk factors after pancreatoduodenectomy: grade B/C chyle leak occurs in about 7.0% overall with grade C being extremely rare (0.1%), and multivariable analyses repeatedly flag venous vascular resection and open approach as independent predictors, likely reflecting more extensive dissection around the cisterna chyli and main abdominal lymphatic trunks near the pancreatic head and neck, while arterial resection has not emerged as an independent risk factor in these cohorts [^114fsGvX] [^115dAAzP] [^114BBBYt] [^112aVrXc].

> Next, I should review esophagectomy, where chylothorax is a recognized complication. Let me check the range first: reported incidence is approximately 1–9%, higher with transthoracic approaches and extensive nodal dissection; risks seem to vary by technique and surgeon experience, with three-hole and some robotic series showing higher rates, and prophylactic duct ligation does not fully eliminate risk, underscoring anatomic variability of the thoracic duct crossing around T4–T5 and vulnerability during mediastinal mobilization and celiac dissections that can also injure the cisterna chyli [^114F4Coz] [^1125y7hT] [^111juxfQ].

> Now, let me consider neck surgery, especially level IV dissection. I almost said the right side carries higher risk, but wait, I should double-check laterality; the prospective series shows an overall incidence of about 4.7% with higher rates on the left versus right (6.2% vs 3.0%), and a fourfold increase when dissecting around the internal jugular–subclavian junction where the thoracic duct terminates, with endocrine pathology and intraoperative visualization of chyle further increasing postoperative leak risk, consistent with the thoracic duct's usual left-sided venous confluence and its variable tributaries [^114BiwHL] [^114ZeaGP].

> Let me not forget less frequent iatrogenic sources. Axillary node dissection can rarely cause chyle leak, typically left-sided and managed conservatively; central venous catheterization and vascularized lymph node transfer donor-site dissections have also been implicated, though these remain uncommon and highly context-dependent, so I should emphasize rarity and the importance of imaging confirmation when suspected [^112Z12uT] [^116vWXXU] [^113yrux9].

> I should confirm traumatic mechanisms next. Traumatic chylothorax comprises roughly a quarter of chylothorax cases overall, with blunt hyperextension injuries causing thoracic duct rupture near T3–T4, thoracic spine fractures or subluxations disrupting the duct's course, and rare penetrating trauma; interestingly, forceful coughing or vomiting has been described as a shearing trigger at the diaphragmatic crus, so I need to keep an index of suspicion in appropriate trauma trajectories and biomechanics [^116vWXXU] [^115MoBTh] [^114XRY5v].

> But wait, what if there is no trauma or surgery; I should consider non-traumatic or pathological causes. Malignancy, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is the most common non-iatrogenic cause due to infiltration or extrinsic compression causing obstruction and distal ductal rupture; congenital lymphangiectasia and anatomical variations can predispose to spontaneous leaks; and infections such as filariasis or granulomatous disease may obstruct lymphatics, though geographic epidemiology matters, so I need to align differentials with patient context and imaging [^116fC8xW] [^114ZWt51].

> Next, I should review hierarchy of risk factors with the strongest data. Independent predictors after pancreatoduodenectomy include venous vascular resection and open approach, while extended nodal dissection and additional resections show associations in univariable analyses; surgeon experience appears relevant in esophagectomy cohorts with variability in leak rates, which I should be careful to interpret alongside case complexity and learning curves [^115dAAzP] [^114BBBYt] [^111juxfQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions regarding minimally invasive surgery being protective; patient selection likely confounds observed differences because minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy cohorts often exclude vascular involvement and very high BMI, and early enteral feeding may increase detection rather than true causation, so I should frame these as risk modifiers with potential selection and ascertainment biases rather than definitive causal determinants [^114BBBYt] [^111bSmC9].

> I need to ensure the grading system aligns with clinical impact. The ISGPS grading distinguishes biochemical grade A from clinically consequential grades B and C; across high-quality pancreatic datasets, grade C is exceptionally rare, supporting that most chyle leaks are manageable with nutritional modulation and selective interventions, though morbidity such as prolonged hospitalization is consistently observed and should not be minimized [^112aVrXc] [^114fsGvX] [^1174hSjN].

> Let me consider broader outcomes to avoid overstating lethality. In large esophagectomy series, chyle leak increases critical-care needs and pulmonary complications but does not appear to worsen long-term survival, whereas timely escalation from conservative to definitive therapies for high-output leaks remains prudent to prevent malnutrition and immunosuppression, reinforcing the importance of output-based decision algorithms [^112eb7kA] [^114F4Coz].

> I should confirm the anatomic context that underpins vulnerability. The cisterna chyli typically lies posteromedial to the aorta near the renal arteries, with the thoracic duct ascending on the right, crossing to the left around T4–T5, and draining at the left jugulo-subclavian confluence; however, significant variability exists in 40–60% of patients, including multiple collaterals and variant terminal drainage patterns, which can frustrate both prevention and operative control and explains failures of prophylactic ligation in some series [^114XRY5v] [^114ReEMq].

> Now, synthesizing the pathophysiologic cascade, I should distinguish immediate and delayed presentations. Direct transection or clip failure yields immediate high-output leaks once enteral fat is introduced, while upstream obstruction from tumor or scarring elevates lymphatic pressure and ruptures collaterals with more insidious onset, and mixed mechanisms are plausible after neoadjuvant therapy with fibrotic distortion of planes, so timing relative to feeding and operative field should inform suspicion and localization strategies [^114ZWt51] [^116fC8xW].

> Let me reconsider if any earlier statements need refinement. I initially emphasized malignancy as a dominant cause of chylothorax, which is true in heterogeneous populations, but I should reiterate that in the postoperative setting the primary etiology is iatrogenic lymphatic disruption during complex oncologic resections, particularly pancreatoduodenectomy, esophagectomy, and left-sided level IV neck dissections, where risk is modulated by vascular resection, surgical approach, extent of nodal dissection, and surgeon experience within the bounds of anatomic variability [^114BBBYt] [^115dAAzP] [^114BiwHL] [^1125y7hT].

> In final synthesis, the etiology of chyle leak is best understood as a multifactorial process in which operative trauma to central lymphatics is the principal precipitant in surgical cohorts, trauma is the second major path, and malignancy with other systemic conditions drives non-iatrogenic cases; anatomical variation, disease burden, and technical factors determine whether the clinical phenotype remains a low-consequence biochemical leak or progresses to high-output, life-threatening chylothorax or chyloperitoneum requiring invasive intervention, which I should always contextualize within ISGPS grading and evidence-supported risk hierarchies [^112aVrXc] [^114fsGvX] [^114F4Coz] [^116fC8xW].

Chyle leak is most commonly caused by **iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct or its tributaries during surgery** [^114ZWt51] [^112eb7kA], particularly during neck dissection [^114BiwHL], esophagectomy [^112eb7kA], or pancreatic procedures [^112aVrXc] [^114BBBYt]. Other causes include **trauma to the thoracic duct** [^117AVjBq], malignancy (notably lymphoma) [^116fC8xW], and congenital lymphatic anomalies [^114djMYP]. Risk increases with **extensive lymphadenectomy** [^111bSmC9], **vascular resection** [^112aVrXc] [^115dAAzP], and **open surgical approaches** [^114BBBYt] [^114TZyre]. Diagnosis and localization typically rely on imaging such as **lymphangiography** [^112zbyRQ], **CT**, or **MRI** [^116c8GY2].

---

## Anatomical basis of chyle leak

The **thoracic duct** is the main lymphatic channel, transporting chyle from the intestines to the venous circulation. It originates from the cisterna chyli at the level of L1-L2 [^114ReEMq], ascends through the thorax, and drains at the venous junction of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins [^114XRY5v]. Injury or disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries results in **chyle leakage** [^116fC8xW].

---

## Traumatic causes

---

### Iatrogenic (surgical) trauma

- **Neck dissection**: Injury to the thoracic duct during cervical lymph node dissection is a common cause of chyle leak [^114BiwHL] [^116xSrKa].
- **Esophagectomy**: Thoracic duct injury during esophageal surgery is a well-documented cause of chylothorax [^112eb7kA] [^114F4Coz].
- **Pancreatic surgery**: Extensive lymphadenectomy or vascular resection during pancreatic surgery can disrupt abdominal lymphatics, leading to chyle leak [^112aVrXc] [^115dAAzP].
- **Axillary lymph node dissection**: Rarely, chyle leak can occur after axillary node clearance in breast cancer surgery [^112Z12uT] [^115vJRpq].

---

### Non-iatrogenic trauma

Blunt or penetrating chest or abdominal trauma can directly injure the **thoracic duct** [^117AVjBq], resulting in **chyle leak** [^116vWXXU].

---

## Non-traumatic causes

---

### Malignancy

**Lymphoma** is a common non-traumatic cause of chyle leak due to lymphatic obstruction or infiltration [^116fC8xW]. Metastatic involvement of the lymphatic system can also lead to chyle leak [^116HnzE1].

---

### Congenital lymphatic anomalies

**Lymphangiectasia**, a congenital dilation of lymphatic vessels, can lead to spontaneous chyle leak [^114djMYP]. **Lymphangiomatosis**, a diffuse lymphatic malformation, can cause chronic chyle leakage [^114djMYP].

---

### Inflammatory or infectious conditions

**Tuberculosis** can cause lymphatic obstruction resulting in chyle leak [^116fC8xW]. **Sarcoidosis** causes granulomatous inflammation that leads to lymphatic obstruction and chyle leak [^114ZWt51].

---

## Risk factors associated with chyle leak

Several risk factors increase the likelihood of **chyle leak**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Extensive lymphadenectomy | Increased risk due to disruption of lymphatic channels [^111bSmC9] [^112aVrXc] |
| Vascular resection | Higher risk due to proximity to major lymphatic vessels [^112aVrXc] [^115dAAzP] |
| Open surgical approach | Greater risk compared to minimally invasive surgery [^112aVrXc] [^114BBBYt] |
| High tumor stage | Associated with increased risk in neuroblastic tumors [^113QgS7s] |
| Male sex and age > 45 years | Associated with increased risk in thyroid cancer surgery [^114kWmJq] |

---

## Diagnostic methods for identifying chyle leak

Accurate diagnosis and localization are essential for **effective management**:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Milky drainage from surgical wounds or drains, especially after initiation of enteral feeding, is suggestive of chyle leak [^116fC8xW].
- **Biochemical analysis**: Elevated triglyceride levels (> 110 mg/dL) [^112aVrXc] and presence of chylomicrons in fluid samples confirm chyle leak [^114XRY5v].
- **Imaging techniques**: Lymphangiography [^112zbyRQ], CT, MRI, and lymphoscintigraphy [^114djMYP] are valuable for localizing the site of leakage [^116c8GY2].

---

## Conclusion

Chyle leak is most commonly due to **iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct or its tributaries during surgery** [^112eb7kA] [^112aVrXc], with other causes including trauma, malignancy, and congenital lymphatic anomalies. Risk factors include **extensive lymphadenectomy, vascular resection, and open surgical approaches** [^115dAAzP]. Accurate diagnosis and localization are essential for **effective management** [^116c8GY2].

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^114BBBYt]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Vascular resection and open surgery were identified as risk factors for chyle leak (CL) in the present study. Vascular resection is a commonly identified predictor and can easily explain the higher rate of CL. In an extensive operation, there is more risk of damage to the main abdominal lymphatic vessels. Only venous resections are identified as significant risk factors, and arterial resections are not, although there was only a limited number of arterial resections performed in this cohort, shown by the broad confidence interval.

Our study is the first to report on open surgery as a risk factor for CL. However, this could still be due to patient selection. The literature is conflicting on this point. A single-center retrospective study specifically investigating CL in open (n = 118) versus robot pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) (n = 165) found no effect of the surgical approach on CL (10.9% vs. 13.6%, P = 0.449). In the four randomized trials on laparoscopic versus open PD, only the multicenter randomized LEOPARD-2 trial reported on the incidence of CL. A nonsignificant increase in CL after laparoscopic as compared with open PD (n = 2/50 [4%] vs. n = 7/49 [14%], P = 0.09) was reported.

In general, minimally invasive PD will be reserved for less advanced tumors without vascular contact. For example, in the period 2016 to 2019, the LEALAPS-3 multicenter training program for robot PD was performed in The Netherlands, in which a BMI of ≤ 35 kg/m² and no vascular involvement were eligibility criteria. This is also confirmed by our analysis that shows a significant difference in preoperative factors.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^112aVrXc]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Chyle leak (CL) is a well-known complication after abdominal surgery, caused by the disruption of abdominal lymphatics. In pancreatic surgery, CL is mostly caused by a direct lesion of the main abdominal lymphatic vessels or the cisterna chyli, which are located at the level of the pancreatic head and neck. It has been suggested that the incidence of CL after pancreatic surgery may increase due to the rising number of extended resections.

The reported rate of CL for pancreatic surgery in the literature ranges from 0.6% to 16.3%. Unfortunately, these studies used different definitions for CL. In 2017, the International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) published a consensus definition and classification of CL after pancreatic surgery. CL is defined as the output of milky-colored fluid from a drain, drain site, or wound on or after postoperative day 3, with a triglyceride content exceeding 110 mg/dL (> 1.2 mmol/L). The classification categorizes CL into three grades of severity. Grades B and C have clinical consequences, such as requiring nasoenteral nutrition and/or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), radiological interventions, and maintaining surgical drains or drug treatments (such as somatostatin analogs). Grade C includes other invasive in-hospital treatments, such as admission to the intensive care unit and/or mortality.

The ISGPS definition of CL has been validated in a monocenter retrospective study, which found a 3.5% rate of grade B/C CL but could not identify risk factors. Additionally, a prospective monocenter study including 168 patients…

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: A lymphatic leaks review [^114ZWt51]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system (LS) is susceptible to various diseases, both malignant and benign in origin. Among the primary causes of lymphatic leakages are congenital anomalies and traumatic injuries affecting the LS. Non-traumatic chyle leaks frequently occur due to processes causing lymphatic obstruction, such as malignant occlusion, lymphatic vessel abnormalities, systemic or congenital diseases, or idiopathic obstruction.

The most frequent causes of chyle leakage are iatrogenic injuries, mostly secondary to thoracic or abdominal surgery, with chylothorax rates as high as 3.9% after oesophagectomy. Typically, lymphatic leaks manifest in two scenarios: during surgical resections, particularly in oncological cases necessitating extensive lymphadenectomy, or in surgeries where the operative field intersects with major lymphatic vessels.

Traditionally, management of such complications leaned towards conservative measures. However, persistent lymphatic leaks often led to aggressive open or laparoscopic surgical interventions, despite the associated morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and extended patient recovery periods.

Initial diagnostic procedures involved injecting blue dye between the toes, exposing a lymphatic vessel on the dorsum of the foot for cannulation after dissection, followed by injection of ethiodized oil and serial radiography from the foot to the thorax to track contrast progression. Conventional lymphangiography (LA) emerged as a diagnostic tool in the 1950s, but with the advent of advanced imaging modalities, its usage has evolved.

### Chyloptysis with chylopericardium, a rare case and mini-review [^114djMYP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chyloptysis is primarily diagnosed by lymphangiography, contrast lymphangiography, or MRI. Lymphangiography is recommended to identify the anatomy and site of the lymphatic leak. Lymphoscintigraphy, which is noninvasive, has historically been the imaging modality of choice. Contrast lymphangiography can be used to confirm anatomy, lymphangiectasia, and the site of the lymphatic leak; it is also helpful in planning surgical treatment. Three-dimensional MRI may offer extensive information about the anatomy of the lymphatic vasculature and the effects of lymphatic dysfunction on local structures and tissue composition. HRCT is the most sensitive modality to identify the characteristic pathognomonic features of LAM, which are pulmonary cysts ranging between a few mm and 1 cm in diameter with a thin wall and clear borders from the underlying normal parenchymal image, scattered evenly over all normal lung fields. Fat content should be tested on the bronchial casts or bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, a bronchoscopy should be performed to look for an irregular connection between the pulmonary and lymphatic systems.

Treatment for chyloptysis is focused on treating the primary cause and decreasing chyle formation. In most patients, symptoms can be relieved by eliminating the underlying cause or bypassing the thoracic duct. A low-fat diet may also decrease the production of chyle. Management of the bronchial casts includes bronchoscopic extraction, which may minimize the occurrence of inflammation.

### Lymphangiography in the diagnosis and localization of various chyle leaks [^116c8GY2]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Chyle leaks are rare entities infrequently encountered by most physicians, though large centers providing advanced surgical care are inevitably confronted with them as a complication of surgery, an extension of disease, or as a primary disorder. Proper diagnosis and localization are paramount in the management of any chyle leak regardless of the etiology.

- **Materials and methods**: We present 16 patients with 17 chyle leaks (5 chyluria, 8 chylothorax, and 4 chylous ascites) who underwent bipedal lymphangiography (LAG) and postprocedure computed tomography (CT) imaging.

- **Results**: In each case, the source of the chyle leak was identified and properly localized to guide further treatment. Of the 16 patients, LAG alone provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 4 patients (25%); postprocedure CT imaging provided the diagnosis and localized the chyle leak in 6 patients (37.5%); and both modalities were equal in diagnosing and localizing the chyle leak in the remaining 6 patients (37.5%).

- **Conclusion**: These cases highlight the unparalleled abilities of LAG and the added benefit of post-LAG CT imaging in the diagnosis and fine anatomic localization of chyle leaks. Additionally, these cases demonstrate the retained utility of LAG despite the development of alternative tests involving CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine imaging.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^117AVjBq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare form of pleural effusion that can be associated with both traumatic and non-traumatic causes. Thoracic duct ligation is often the treatment of choice in postsurgical patients; however, the optimal treatment of this disease process after traumatic injury remains unclear. We present a rare case of a thoracic duct injury secondary to a blunt thoracic spine fracture and subluxation, which was successfully treated non-operatively.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old male presented as a tier one trauma code due to an automobile versus bicycle collision. His examination and radiographic work-up revealed fractures and a subluxation at the third and fourth thoracic spine levels resulting in paraplegia. He also sustained bilateral hemothoraces secondary to multiple rib fractures. Drainage of the left hemothorax led to the diagnosis of a traumatic chylothorax. The thoracic spine fractures were addressed with surgical stabilization and the chylothorax was successfully treated with drainage and dietary manipulation.

- **Conclusions**: This unusual and complex blunt thoracic duct injury required a multidisciplinary approach. Although the spine injury required surgical fixation, successful resolution of the chyle leak was achieved without surgical intervention.

### Spontaneous cervical chyle fistula: A case report [^113VoTgj]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

Cervical chylous fistulae are rare complications usually occurring due to iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct. There have been no reported cases of spontaneous chyle leaks in surgically naïve necks.

- **Methods**: Case report.

- **Results**: A 50-year-old female presented with progressive left neck swelling without fever, dyspnea, or dysphagia. Imaging demonstrated extensive infiltrative changes of the left neck with retropharyngeal fluid extending into strap musculature and the mediastinum. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed posterior pharyngeal wall edema. The differential diagnosis included abscess versus necrotizing fasciitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and she was taken to the operating room for neck exploration. Intra-operatively, milky fluid was present around the carotid sheath and in the retropharyngeal space. Fluid analysis demonstrated chylomicrons and triglycerides greater than 2400 mg/dL. Repeat imaging of the neck, chest, and abdomen did not reveal malignancy or obstructive masses. A lymphangiogram showed dilated lymphatic vessels near the cervical thoracic duct. On post-operative day four, the patient was taken back to the operating room for thoracic duct ligation and biopsy of nearby tissue. Pathology demonstrated benign lymph nodes with dilated sinusoids. A low-fat diet was started, and she was discharged home on hospital day nine. She has followed up regularly with no signs of recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: A cervical chylous fistula usually results from iatrogenic injury to the thoracic duct. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a spontaneous cervical chyle leak.

### Risk of chyle leak after robotic versus video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy [^111juxfQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

We investigate the incidence and risk factors for post-operative outcomes, including chyle leak, following minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE).

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing MIE from May 2016 until August 2020 were prospectively followed. Outcomes of robotic and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) esophagectomy were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 347 esophagectomies were performed: 70 cases were done robotically by 2 surgeons, and 277 by VATS by 14 surgeons. Patients had similar demographics, surgical techniques, length of stay (LOS), and re-operation rates. Overall complication rates between robotic and VATS MIE were statistically similar (61% vs. 50%; p = 0.082). The majority of complications for either VATS (41.5%) or robotic-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) (51.4%) were grade II. Nineteen patients developed a chyle leak. Patients with a chyle leak were similar in age, gender, and hospital LOS (all p > 0.05) but were more likely to undergo a three-hole or robotic esophagectomy (both p < 0.05).

	- In 70 robotic esophagectomies, nine chyle leaks occurred. Rates varied by surgeon (7 vs. 2; p = 0.003). Lower leak rates occurred in the surgeon with more robotic esophagectomy experience (n = 47 vs. 23). Patients were similar in age and gender (p > 0.05), but those with a chyle leak were more likely to undergo three-hole esophagectomies, prophylactic thoracic duct ligations, undergo the abdominal portion via laparotomy, and not have further interventions.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^114TZyre]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

This first nationwide study demonstrated a 7.0% incidence of ISGPS grade B/C CL, with CL grade C being extremely rare (0.1%; 1.3% of all CL). CL was associated with prolonged length of hospital stay but not with mortality. Vascular resection and open surgery were independent risk factors for CL.

The 7.0% rate of CL in the present study falls within the range of previous studies, where it ranges from 0.6% to 16.3%. This wide range in previous studies illustrates the relevance of a uniform classification and definition of CL to allow accurate comparison of outcomes across institutions and countries. The results of the present study were comparable to a previous monocenter validation study of the ISGPS CL definition. In that study, grade C CL was extremely rare (0.2% vs. 0.1% in the present study) with grade B CL being much more common (3.3% vs. 6.9% in the present study).

The rate of CL was slightly higher in our study than in the monocenter study, which could be explained by the higher number of vascular resections in this study (12.7% vs. 16.1% in the present study), possibly caused by the different time periods (2014–2016 vs. 2017–2019), or by the early enteral feeding protocol via the enhanced recovery after surgery model which is incorporated in Dutch guidelines and clinical practice. Both studies also confirmed the relation between CL and prolonged length of hospital stay. Moreover, the monocenter study did not identify intraoperative factors associated with CL. This study was, however, not powered to identify risk factors.

### Lymphangiography for thoracic duct interventions [^112zbyRQ]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Lymph leaks resulting in chylous pleural effusions can be life-threatening. Minimally invasive thoracic duct embolization and disruption have been gaining acceptance as first-line treatment for these leaks. This review discusses the techniques for both pedal and intranodal lymphangiography in detail. It also discusses the use of lymphangiography as a means of targeting a retroperitoneal lymphatic to facilitate thoracic duct interventions for chyle leaks. Finally, outcomes and adverse events pertaining to these thoracic duct interventions are discussed.

### Lymphoscintigraphic demonstration of chylous leak after axillary lymph node dissection [^115vJRpq]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A chyle leak is a potentially serious complication resulting from the violation of the thoracic duct, right lymphatic duct, or one of their terminal branches. It may impair nutrition and immunity, compromise and delay wound healing, prolong hospitalization, and delay adjuvant therapy. After surgery for breast carcinoma, this is a rare occurrence. Here, the author describes a novel application of lymphoscintigraphy showing thoracic duct injury following a wide excision and axillary clearance.

### Intranodal lymphangiography with thoracic duct embolization for the treatment of chyle leaks after head and neck cancer surgery [^116xSrKa]. Head & Neck (2021). Low credibility.

Thoracic duct injury is a rare complication of head and neck surgery, and thoracic duct embolization (TDE) has been proposed to manage postoperative chyle leaks.

- **Methods**: Twelve patients who underwent lymphangiography for a chyle leak after head and neck surgery (M:F = 5:7, mean 55 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphangiographic findings, technical success, complications, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: Chyle leak was identified and TDE attempted in 11 of 12 patients. Three patients required repeat TDE. Technical success of TDE was 86% (12/14). Clinical success for patients with technically successful TDE was 90% (9/10). Median time until drain removal was 2.1 days in nine patients with clinical success. Two major complications were encountered: chylothorax after initial TDE, requiring additional TDE, and in one case, surgical TD ligation.

TDE is considered a safe treatment for chyle leaks after head and neck surgery with high technical and clinical success rates.

### Incidence and risk factors for chyle leaks after neuroblastic tumor resection: A systematic review of published studies [^113QgS7s]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Chyle leakage/ascites after surgical resection of neuroblastic tumors may delay the start of chemotherapy and worsen prognosis. Previous studies have reported a highly variable incidence, and risk factors remain largely unknown. This study aims to analyze the true incidence of chyle leaks and ascites and seeks to identify risk factors and optimal treatment strategies.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Literature reviews, case reports, and non-English papers were excluded. Data were extracted independently following paper selection by two authors.

- **Results**: The final analysis yielded 15 studies with N = 1468 patients. Chylous ascites was recorded postoperatively in 171 patients (12%). Most patients experiencing chyle leaks were successfully treated conservatively with drainage, bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, and octreotide, with variable combinations of these treatment options. Seven out of 171 (4%) patients required operative exploration to control troublesome persistent chyle leaks. In the risk factor analysis, higher tumor stage was significantly associated with the risk of chyle leak (P < 0.0001), whereas no correlation was observed with adrenal vs. non-adrenal tumor location, INRG risk groups, and tumor laterality.

- **Conclusion**: Chyle leakage after surgery for neuroblastic tumors is a common morbid complication occurring in some 12% of patients. Higher INSS tumor stage portends greater risks. Conservative therapy strategies appear successful in the majority of cases. To avert this complication, meticulous mesenteric lymphatic ligation is advised.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: A lymphatic leaks review [^115CxNUG]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The lymphatic circulation plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance and supporting immune responses by returning serum proteins and lipids to the systemic circulation. Lymphatic leaks, though rare, pose significant challenges post-radical neck surgery, esophagectomy, and thoracic or retroperitoneal oncological resections, leading to heightened morbidity and mortality. Managing lymphatic leaks necessitates consideration of the etiology, severity, and volume of leakage.

Traditionally, treatment involved conservative measures such as dietary restrictions, drainage, and medical management, with surgical intervention reserved for severe cases, albeit with variable outcomes and extended recovery periods. Lymphography, introduced in the 1950s, initially served as a diagnostic tool for lymphedema, lymphoma, tumor staging, and monitoring chemotherapy response. However, its widespread adoption was impeded by alternative techniques like computed tomography, learning curves, and its associated complications. Contemporary lymphatic interventions have evolved, favoring nodal lymphangiography over pedal lymphangiography for its technical simplicity and reduced complexity.

Effective management of chylous leaks mandates a multimodal approach encompassing clinical evaluation and imaging techniques. In cases where conservative management proves ineffective, embolization through conventional lymphangiography by bipedal dissection or intranodal injection emerges as a viable option. This review underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating lymphatic leaks.

### Iatrogenic chyloma in the neck: Lymphoscintigraphic findings [^114NbQGC]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic chyle leak with chyloma formation in the neck is a rare complication of neck dissection resulting from injury to the thoracic duct. We present the case of a 37-year-old woman who complained of left-sided neck swelling within days after total thyroidectomy and lateral neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy demonstrated the chyle leak in the left cervical region, and subsequent aspiration of the left neck swelling showed radioactivity in the aspirate. After successful operative repair of the thoracic duct, the patient was able to undergo radioactive ablative thyroid treatment.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^116vWXXU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The majority of reported cases of chylothorax are due to malignancy (50%), specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chylothorax resulting from traumatic thoracic injuries, including iatrogenic post-surgical injuries, comprises approximately twenty-five percent of cases. Other iatrogenic complications, primarily related to central access catheters, make up the remaining twenty-five percent. If not properly recognized and treated, this disease process can lead to profound respiratory, nutritional, and immunological dysfunction, resulting in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Available treatment modalities include conservative management with drainage and strict dietary regulation, or more invasive approaches, namely thoracic duct ligation.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography plus computed tomography angiography for location of persistent idiopathic chyle leakage not detectable by ordinary contrast computed tomography [^111eN47C]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Chyluria is the passage of chyle in the urine, caused by the rupture of retroperitoneal lymphatics with leakage into the pyelocaliceal system, giving urine a milky appearance. The etiologies include thoracic duct stenosis, tuberculosis, cancer, trauma, pregnancy, filariasis, or the cause may not be clear. The result is dilatation of distal lymphatics and the eventual rupture of lymphatic vessels into the urinary collecting system. Although rare, severe fluid and protein loss may cause hypovolemia and hypoproteinemia in some patients.

Cystoscopy, lymphangiography (LPG), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lymphoscintigraphy are used to diagnose and locate the origin of chyluria. Combining LPG with post-LPG CT imaging may increase the ability to locate chyle leaks. MRI is contraindicated in patients with implanted metal devices. Some patients fail conservative management because their chyle leaks are not visualized by routine contrast CT and require additional evaluation of the lymphatic system before treatment can be started. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of unilateral LPG with post-LPG CT angiography (CTA) in chyluria patients who failed to respond to conservative management, with chyle leaks undetectable by ordinary contrast CT.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^112zaR6r]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Chyle leak is an uncommon complication following esophagectomy, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality; however, the optimal treatment for chylothorax is still controversial.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, management, and outcomes of chyle leaks within a specialist esophagogastric cancer center.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancers (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) between 1997 and 2017 at the Northern Oesophagogastric Unit were included from a contemporaneously maintained database. The primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes were overall complications, anastomotic leaks, and pulmonary complications.

- **Results**: During the study period, 992 patients underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancers, and 5% (n = 50) of them developed chyle leaks. There was no significant difference in survival in patients who developed a chyle leak compared with those who did not (median: 40 vs. 45 months; p = 0.60). Patients developing chyle leaks had a significantly longer length of stay in critical care (median: 4 vs. 2 days; p = 0.002), but no difference in total length of hospital stay.

- **Conclusion**: Chyle leak remains a complication following esophagectomy, with limited understanding of its pathophysiology in postoperative recovery. However, these data indicate chyle leak does not have a long-term impact on patients and does not affect long-term survival.

### Chyle fistula after neck dissection: An 8-year, single-center, prospective study of incidence, clinical features, and treatment [^114BiwHL]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Chyle fistula is a relatively rare complication of neck dissection, and there is a lack of consensus regarding its incidence, risk factors, and management.

- **Methods**: Between 2007 and 2014, a total of 472 cases of neck dissection involving the level IV compartment were included in the study. The incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of chyle fistula were investigated, as well as the outcomes of conventional management and the use of octreotide injection in high-output chyle fistula.

- **Results**: The overall incidence of chyle fistula was 4.7% (22/472), with an incidence of 3.0% and 6.2% after right and left neck dissection, respectively. The presence of a metastatic lesion around the junction of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein was the only factor significantly associated with the development of chyle fistula, with approximately a fourfold higher risk observed in univariate and multivariate analyses. In 22 cases of chyle fistula, the mean total drainage volume was 3226 mL during a mean 15.4 days of drain placement. Total parenteral nutrition for the management of chyle fistula was required in 16 cases. Nine (40.9%) of 22 cases experienced additional complications related to chyle fistula. Of the six high-output cases, four were managed with conservative methods plus octreotide injection, and three did not require surgery.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of chyle fistula after neck dissection was higher than expected, especially on the right side. Surgeons should pay greater attention to chyle fistula from preoperative evaluation to postoperative management.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1138wvLn]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Overall, 2,186 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) between 2017 and 2019. After excluding 27 patients with missing data on chyle leak (CL), the final cohort consisted of 2,159 patients. In this cohort, 46.1% were female, and the mean age was 67.1 years (SD = 10.4). Of all included patients, 9.8% received neoadjuvant therapy, 20.4% underwent minimally invasive PD, and 16.4% of procedures included vascular resection.

### Thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation for traumatic chylothorax [^1147JLYn]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Traumatic chylothorax requires surgical intervention when conservative medical management fails to reduce chyle leakage. This usually entails thoracotomy or laparotomy. We report a case in which successful ligation of a torn thoracic duct was achieved using a video-assisted thoracoscopic technique.

### Management of high-output chyle leak after harvesting of vascularized supraclavicular lymph nodes [^113yrux9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Vascularized lymph node transfer is a physiologic microsurgical technique used for the treatment of lymphedema. As this procedure becomes more common, it is essential to be aware of all potential complications associated with it and know how to manage them effectively.

Recently, the authors encountered a complication following a supraclavicular vascularized lymph node transfer that had not been previously reported. A patient developed a recalcitrant high-output (> 500 ml/day) chyle leak at the neck donor site post-harvest. In this article, the authors share their experience with managing massive chyle leaks and review strategies for avoiding and treating this potentially dangerous complication.

This review is timely and important, as supraclavicular vascularized lymph node transfer is increasingly offered to patients. Surgeons performing these procedures should be familiar with managing this complication effectively.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^114fsGvX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The incidence and clinical impact of chyle leak (CL) were noteworthy. Grade B/C CL was present in 152 patients (7.0%), of whom 150 patients (6.9%) were classified as grade B and 2 patients (0.1%) as grade C. Notably, the rate of grade C CL among all patients with CL was 2 out of 152 (1.3%).

- **Postoperative and pathological outcomes**: A postoperative complication of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3 occurred in 688 patients (31.9%). Pancreatic-specific grade B/C complications occurred as follows: 375 patients experienced postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (17.4%), 129 had a bile leak (6.0%), 442 suffered from delayed gastric emptying (20.5%), and 172 experienced postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (8.0%). CL co-occurred with other postoperative complications in 48.6% of cases, mainly with delayed gastric emptying (19.7%) and POPF (15.9%).

Patients with CL had a longer median length of stay compared to those without CL, with stays of 16.0 days (IQR: 11–25) versus 12.0 days (IQR: 8–19), respectively.

- **Multivariable logistic regression to assess the association with CL and in-hospital mortality in patients after PD**: This analysis was conducted to further understand the impact of CL on patient outcomes.

### Chyle leak after axillary node clearance in breast cancer surgery-a rare complication and a proposed management strategy from the British and Italian experience [^112Z12uT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Chyle leak after axillary surgery is a rare complication that lacks consensus and management guidelines. This study aimed to present the experiences of two centers in chyle leak management after axillary node clearance for breast cancer. Furthermore, the authors provide a review of its pathophysiology and clinical diagnostic methods as they compare approaches for management of the axilla with those for other locations.

- **Methods**: A multicentre case series descriptive analysis of chyle leak after breast cancer axillary node clearance between January 1, 2013, and May 31, 2020, was performed.

- **Results**: The center in the United Kingdom and the center in Italy performed 655 and 4969 axillary node clearances, respectively. Four patients experienced chyle leaks. All leaks occurred after left-sided surgery (three patients had level 3 clearances with mastectomy and implant-based breast reconstructions, one patient had level 2 clearance with therapeutic mammoplasty). All leaks appeared within three days after surgery. Leak duration ranged from 11 to 29 days. The maximum daily output was 600 mL. All leaks were treated conservatively with nutritional team support and close drainage monitoring. The management strategy included a low-fat diet, high-protein diet, total parenteral nutrition, medium-chain triglyceride supplements, and other elements. No negative effects on oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgery wound-healing and no delays in adjuvant treatment were observed.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of chyle leak after breast cancer axillary node clearance was 0.

### Chyle leakage in port incision after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: Case report [^112MPiaa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old Asian male was found to have chyle leakage from the port incision after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for excision of pulmonary bullae. The diagnosis was confirmed by oral intake of Sudan black and by lymphoscintigraphy. The leakage resolved after 5 days of restricted oral intake and total parenteral nutrition, and no leakage recurred after the return of oral intake. Possible explanations for the port incision chyle leakage include obstruction of the thoracic duct, which induced retrograde drainage of the lymphoid fluid, or an aberrant collateral branch of the thoracic duct in the chest wall.

### Unilateral pedal lymphangiography plus computed tomography angiography for location of persistent idiopathic chyle leakage not detectable by ordinary contrast computed tomography [^116iji9w]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Chyluria can be confirmed by a urine chyle test. About 80% of patients respond to conservative management with a low-fat, high-protein diet or intraperitoneal injection of sclerotherapy, such as silver nitrate, povidone iodine, or dextrose; however, about 22% experience a relapse within two years. Surgical intervention is necessary for patients with severe chyluria who fail to respond to conservative management or experience short-term relapses. Successful surgery requires clear identification and accurate location of the site of chyle leakage, especially concerning the relationship between lymphatic vessels and the renal collection system or vascular system.

- **Imaging studies**: In patients with severe chyluria, imaging studies generally include cystoscopy and lymphatic pedalography (LPG). LPG is more successful than cystoscopy in detecting bilateral lymphatic renal pelvis fistulas. The LPG images in these patients appear wire-like, with semicircular or coralline-shaped shadows primarily distributed in the renal pelvis and parenchyma. The renal hilus appears distorted and dilated, with visible lumbar or iliac lymph vessels, and occasionally, obviously dilated truncus lumbalis lymph vessels can be observed.

- **Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT or MRI**: These may be useful in locating lymphatic ducts and chyle leakage sites, but LPG remains the most widely used method. Evaluation of abdominal and retroperitoneal lymphatic abnormalities, including lymphatic leaks, is conducted using MRI lymphography with heavily T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences. Nonenhanced MRI lymphangiography is considered a safe procedure.

### Intractable chylous leak after radical esophagectomy treated with radiotherapy [^1158vbTn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Postoperative chylous leak after esophagectomy is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that results in hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, and immunologic deficiency. However, the management of postoperative chylous leak remains controversial. Following a diagnosis of esophageal cancer, a 64-year-old man was treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy, laparoscopic gastric tube formation, prophylactic thoracic duct ligation, and reconstruction with esophagogastrostomy at the neck level.

Massive postoperative drainage from the thorax and abdomen did not initially meet the diagnostic criteria for chylothorax, which was ultimately diagnosed 3 weeks after the operation. Despite various treatments including total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, midodrine, reoperation (thoracic duct ligation and mechanical pleurodesis), and thoracic duct embolization, the chylous leak persisted.

Finally, low-dose radiation therapy was administered with a daily dose of 2 Gy and completed at a total dose of 14 Gy. After this, the amount of pleural effusion gradually decreased over 2 weeks, and the last drainage tube was removed. The patient was alive and well at 60 months postoperatively.

Herein, we describe a patient with intractable chylous leak after esophagectomy, which persisted despite conservative treatment, thoracic duct ligation, and embolization, but was finally successfully treated with radiotherapy.

### Nontraumatic chylothorax: Diagnostic algorithm and treatment options [^115qioRm]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic chylothorax is a relatively rare condition in which the intestinal lymph (chyle) leaks into the pleural cavity. It is more difficult to treat than the more common traumatic chylothorax because the site of the chylous leak may occur in less predictable locations. In the past, patients with nontraumatic chylothorax were offered traditional fluoroscopically guided lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization similar to traumatic chylothorax. However, the observation that thoracic duct embolization outcomes for nontraumatic chylothorax differed based on the imaging findings during lymphangiography has led to the development of a treatment algorithm, which incorporates noninvasive diagnostic studies, such as magnetic resonance lymphangiography. This systematic approach allows better delineation of the source of the chylous leak and selection of the appropriate method of embolization. In this article, we review the etiologies of nontraumatic chylothorax, the diagnostic work-up for managing this condition, and the treatment algorithm to care for these patients.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^111wWKpb]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Management of chyle leak**: Among patients who developed a chyle leak, 52% (n = 26) underwent surgical intervention. Identification and ligation of the thoracic duct were successful in 88.4% (n = 23) of patients. Two patients had a leak from both the thoracic duct and the cisterna chyli, requiring laparotomy and thoracotomy. One patient had a left chylothorax, and another had a bilateral chylothorax. The median time to surgery was 6 days (range 2–11), the median time in the CCU was 6 days (range 2–20), and the median length of hospital stay was 24 days (range 9–83). Three patients required a third-look for persistent chyle leak.

- **Non-surgical management**: This approach was used for 48% (n = 24) of patients. Two patients required pleuro-peritoneal shunt insertion, while the remaining 22 patients received aggressive, conservative treatment with maintenance of the pleural drain until daily drainage was < 150 mL/day. The median hospital stay for these patients was 15 days (range 7–55). Parenteral or MCT feeding was adopted depending on the chyle leak's daily output and the patient's general condition. Decisions to use shunts were made on an individual patient basis; one patient had previously undergone unsuccessful attempts to ligate the duct at surgical intervention, while the other patient had a shunt inserted and then required a thoracotomy for bleeding. Early in this series, one patient developed Pneumocystis carinii-related pneumonia and required treatment with cotrimoxazole. It has subsequently become standard practice to commence cotrimoxazole once a chyle leak is recognized.

We developed an algorithm for management…

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1142P9NB]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Data collected included patient characteristics (i.e. age, sex, BMI, preoperative resectability status, American Society of Anesthesiologists score), treatment characteristics (i.e. neoadjuvant therapy, surgical approach, hospital PD volume, vascular resection, additional organ resection, aortocaval lymph node resection), tumor characteristics (i.e. site of origin, postoperative malignant diagnosis, resection margin, lymph node status, number of lymph nodes resected), and postoperative outcomes (i.e. CL, POPF, bile leak, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, postoperative complications, pneumonia, wound infection, length of stay, in-hospital mortality).

Preoperative resectability was defined according to the DPCG criteria. Venous resections were reported according to the ISGPS classification of venous resections. Aortocaval lymph node resection was defined as harvesting of the lymph node station 16b1, in the aortocaval window. Margin status was classified as microscopically radical resection (> 1 mm; R0) and microscopically irradical (≤ 1 mm; R1). Lymph node status was reported according to the TNM classification, eighth edition.

Pancreatic surgery–specific complications were all defined according to the ISGPS and the International Study Group of Liver Surgery definitions. CL was defined, according to the ISGPS definition, as the output of milky-colored fluid from a drain, drain site, or wound, on or after postoperative day 3, with a triglyceride content of ≥ 110 mg/dL or ≥ 1.2 mmol/L. These classifications divide complications into three categories.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^115ftCcX]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

An iatrogenic chyle leak is a well-documented complication of neck surgery, particularly during dissection of the level IV nodal basin, with a risk of thoracic duct injury varying between 2% and 8%. Chyle extravasation carries significant morbidity to the patient, including risk of metabolic disturbances, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, immunosuppression, and local wound complications. In this report, we present an atypical case of acute upper airway obstruction due to a chyle leak, occurring 48 hours following a right hemi-thyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) in a patient treated with neoadjuvant dabrafenib/trametinib. Despite emergent intubation and exploration with ligation of thoracic duct tributaries, the high-output chyle leak persisted, necessitating thoracoscopic duct clipping. Although only one other documented case of chyle leak-related airway obstruction is reported, this is the first report of a high-output chyle leak in a patient with ATC.

### Chylothorax: Aetiology, diagnosis and therapeutic options [^116fC8xW]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare condition that results from thoracic duct damage, leading to chyle leakage from the lymphatic system into the pleural space, usually on the right side. It has multiple aetiologies and is typically discovered when it manifests as a pleural effusion. Diagnosis involves measuring cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the pleural fluid. Complications include malnutrition, immunosuppression, and respiratory distress. Treatment may be either conservative or aggressive depending on the clinical scenario.

This review discusses the aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment of chylothorax. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1, 1980, to February 28, 2008, were reviewed. Keywords searched included chylothorax, aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^114ZeaGP]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Typically, the onset of a chyle leak coincides with the initiation of enteral feeds. In our patient's case, the rate of chyle extravasation and degree of mass effect were rather striking for a patient on a fluid diet. Even more so, the progression of swelling despite the presence of two Jackson‐Pratt drains decompressing the neck was equally unusual. What is more atypical is that the leak was not mitigated by local surgical intervention.

In retrospect, several risk factors rendered this patient at a particularly elevated risk of thoracic duct injury. First of all, he was overweight (pre‐operative BMI 38.8 kg/m²). Obesity is a recognized risk factor for the development of high‐output chyle leaks. Perhaps the strongest predictor of thoracic duct injury in his case, however, was the caudal and lateral extent of disease.

In a review of 436 consecutive MRNDs by Dunlap et al, when controlling for the pathologic indication, chyle leak was found to be significantly more frequent in the endocrine group than in the non‐endocrine group (7.7% vs. 1.1%, respectively, p = 0.003). The increased prevalence of level IV disease and extensive dissection typically required within the territory of the thoracic duct in endocrine pathology were hypothesized as potential explanations for this observation. Intraoperative identification of chyle was another statistically significant predictor of postoperative chyle leak in the same study (p = 0.027), despite the authors' efforts to immediately address the thoracic duct in those cases. Indeed, our patient combined all the aforementioned risk factors.

### Midodrine: a novel therapeutic for refractory chylothorax [^117PbzcG]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Thoracic duct injury is a rare but serious complication following surgery of the neck or chest that leads to uncontrolled chyle leak. Conventional management includes drainage, nutritional modification, or aggressive surgical interventions such as thoracic duct ligation, flap coverage, fibrin glue, or talc pleurodesis; however, few successful medical therapeutics are available. We report a case of a high-output chylothorax refractory to aggressive medical and surgical interventions. Chyle output decreased substantially after initiating midodrine, an α1-adrenergic agonist that causes vasoconstriction of the lymph system, reducing chyle flow. This case report suggests that midodrine may be a novel therapeutic for refractory chyle leaks.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^1174hSjN]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Given the very low rate of ISGPS grade C CL, the main question is whether the ISGPS classification of CL should be changed. The fact that grade C CL is extremely rare in both validation studies suggests that this part of the classification is not of additional value, but also confirms that CL mostly runs a relatively mild clinical course and rarely becomes life-threatening. Thus, it could be debated to redefine grade C. For example, percutaneous drainage and TPN could be classified as grade C, as this can be considered more invasive treatment than maintenance of surgical drains or nasoenteral nutrition with dietary restrictions.

However, when assessing this point in relation to the other ISGPS definitions, such as delayed gastric emptying, TPN should remain as a grade B complication. Furthermore, in most other ISGPS classifications, grade A complications have no to very limited clinical consequences, and grade C complications reflect a life-threatening condition. The latter is clearly not the case in patients with CL and so justifies the Type C definition. One could debate whether to leave out grade A altogether, as was done in the ISGPS definition of pancreatic fistula. Our group supports the notion that the low rate of grade C CL is actually reassuring, and this definition could remain intact to stay in line with other ISGPS definitions.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^1125y7hT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Chyle leak after transthoracic esophagectomy has a reported incidence of 1–9%. This complication has been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality among patients who underwent surgery, ranging between 0 and 50%. The reasons for this are explained by the continuous loss of chylous fluid, which is naturally rich in fats, fat-soluble vitamins, enzymes, and lymphocytes. This leads to a decrease in serum levels of albumin and a significant reduction in peripheral lymphocytes, resulting in malnutrition and immunosuppression. Moreover, this fluid loss may lead to hypovolemia and subsequent respiratory failure.

Postoperative chyle leaks result mainly from damage to, or a failure to ligate, the main thoracic duct or its tributaries during both the abdominal and thoracic phase of esophagectomy. The duct is closely related to the esophagus, but because the anatomy is highly variable, its susceptibility to being damaged is easily explained, especially when extensive nodal dissection is undertaken. In addition, chyle leak could result from damage to the cisterna chyli during nodal dissection around the celiac trunk. In this case, the presentation may be either as chylous ascites or as chylothorax, as chyle spreads into the chest through a widened hiatus promoted by the negative pressure in the thorax.

The most common presentation of chylothorax is excessive drainage via the chest tubes in the early postoperative period, with the classic cream-colored effluent seen only when the patient starts to be fed enterally or orally. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a triglyceride measurement.

### Management of chyle leak post neck dissection: a case report and literature review [^1147NbaQ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chyle leakage following head-and-neck resection is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Management can be challenging and prolonged. Recently, thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct has emerged as a promising technique to definitively address this difficult problem. We present a recent case involving a hemimandibulectomy, radical modified neck dissection, and osseocutaneous fibular-free-flap that was complicated by chyle leakage. The chyle leak was successfully treated with thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct. Based on our clinical experience and a thorough literature review, we propose that complicated or high-output chyle leaks (> 1000 mL day⁻¹) should be treated with early thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^115dAAzP]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Predictors for CL: The univariable analysis identified open surgery, vascular resection, additional resection, hospital volume, tumor diameter, and more than 15 lymph nodes resected as predictors for chyle leak (CL). After multivariable analysis, only vascular resection (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4–3.2, P < 0.001) and open surgery (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.7–7.2, P = 0.001) were independent predictors for CL. When using subgroups for the type of vascular resection, both ISGPS type 1 to 2 vascular resection and type 3 to 4 vascular resection were identified as risk factors for CL, whereas an arterial vascular resection was not.

There were significant differences between patients after open and minimally invasive surgery, namely in terms of preoperative resectability, hospital volume, vascular resections, and additional organ resections.

In the subgroup of patients with malignancy, the additionally assessed risk factors (i.e. neoadjuvant therapy, resection margin, and lymph node stadium) were not associated with CL. Only vascular resection (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2–2.8, P = 0.016) and open surgery (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6–8.5, P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for CL. In a subgroup analysis of patients for whom aortocaval lymph node sampling was registered (n = 456), aortocaval lymph node sampling was not identified as a risk factor for CL in multivariable analysis.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^115MoBTh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chylous pleural effusion is most commonly caused by malignancy, accounting for more than 50% of cases. Lymphoma is the most common malignant cause, representing about 60% of all cases, with the non-Hodgkin's variant being the most prevalent. Traumatic injuries to the upper abdomen and chest, including those sustained during surgery, are the second leading cause of chylothorax, accounting for approximately 25% of cases.

The first traumatic injury to the thoracic duct was described in 1875, and the first thoracic duct ligation was performed in 1948. The traumatic causes of injury to the duct vary widely. The most common blunt mechanism producing injury is related to sudden hyperextension of the spine, with rupture of the duct just above the diaphragm. Sudden stretching over the vertebral bodies for any reason may tear the duct, but this usually occurs in the setting of a thoracic duct previously affected by disease. Episodes of vomiting or a violent bout of coughing resulting in shearing of the lymphatic conduit along the crux of the right diaphragm have been reported as well. Penetrating injuries from a gunshot or stab wound are less common and usually associated with severe damage to nearby structures.

### Postoperative chyle leak after major pancreatic resections in patients who receive enteral feed: Risk factors and management options [^111bSmC9]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Chyle leak complicates 1.3–10.8% of pancreatic resections. Universal use of parenteral nutrition following pancreatic resection may reduce the incidence of chyle leak; however, this denies the majority of patients who do not develop chyle leak the benefits of enteral nutrition (EN). The present study aimed to identify risk factors for chyle leak following pancreatic resection within a single institution where EN was used universally.

- **Methods**: All patients who underwent pancreatic resection between January 2007 and December 2010 were identified retrospectively. Patients were treated according to a common unit protocol of enteral feeding; those developing chyle leaks were switched to a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) regimen. Clinical progress and recovery after surgery were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with chyle leak.

- **Results**: A total of 245 patients underwent major pancreatic resection (231 pancreatoduodenectomy, 14 total pancreatectomy). Chyle leak complicated 40 cases (16.3%). After multivariate analysis, both extensive lymphadenectomy (P = 0.002) and postoperative portal/mesenteric venous thrombosis (PVT) (P = 0.009) were independently linked with a higher incidence of chyle leak. The development of chyle leak was not associated with poorer survival or prolonged duration of hospital stay. It was associated with a significantly increased duration of abdominal drainage and reduced likelihood of early hospital discharge (P = 0.026).

- **Conclusions**: Universal use of enteral feeding is associated with a high incidence of chyle leak, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection and monitoring following pancreatic resection.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^116FdFfr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The principles of conservative management of chyle leak include the reduction of chyle flow, drainage of the pleural cavity for chylothorax, nutritional support, and the prevention of septic complications. Immunosuppression is problematic, particularly in those who have a prolonged chyle leak. Opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis carinii on a background of massive chylous ascites has been previously reported and prompted the introduction of routine prophylactic antimicrobials in cases of chyle leak. Two other series detailing rates of infective complications have reported increased rates, particularly respiratory infections in patients with chyle leaks. In the present series, the rates of wound and respiratory complications were not significantly raised in patients with a chyle leak compared with the other group; however, prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole is employed as standard in patients with a chyle leak and low lymphocyte count.

In recent years, there has been a move towards earlier surgical intervention for postoperative chyle leak. Cerfolio suggested reoperation when drainage volumes exceeded 1000 mL/day for 5 days, while Alexiou et al. suggested reoperation for those with high output chylothorax not settling following a week of conservative management. For very high-volume leaks (> 2000 mL/day), early surgery after only 2 days of conservative treatment has been proposed, while Merrigan et al. advocate reoperation immediately after the diagnosis has been made. An advantage of early reoperation is the opportunity to repair the leak before the patient becomes significantly compromised.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^112eb7kA]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The overall survival of patients is presented in Figure 1. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients without a chyle leak and those with a leak (median: 40 vs. 45 months; p = 0.58). Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis by underlying tumor histology, there were no significant differences in survival in patients with and without a chyle leak for adenocarcinoma (median: 42 vs. 44 months; p = 0.90) and squamous cell carcinoma (median: 17 vs. 47 months; p = 0.31).

- **Figure 1 description**: Overall survival rates for patients undergoing esophagectomy, comparing those developing a chyle leak versus:
	- no chyle leak,
	- no chyle leak in the subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma,
	- no chyle leak in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Table 2 description**: Median overall survival in all patients, and in patients affected by adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, according to whether there was no chyle leak or a chyle leak occurred.

- **Note**: NR - not reached.

On univariable analysis, age, poor and moderate tumor grade, positive margin status, positive lymphatic, vascular, and perineural invasion, extracapsular spread, tumor regression grade 5, and stage III and IV disease were independent prognostic factors for long-term survival. Chyle leak was not a prognostic factor of survival on either univariable or multivariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI 95%] 0.67–1.45, p = 0.949; HR 1.09, CI 95% 0.73–1.63, p = 0.675).

On multivariable analysis, age, male sex, squamous cell carcinoma, year of operation, and other factors were analyzed to determine their impact on survival. The analysis was incomplete.

### A simple method minimizes chylothorax after minimally invasive esophagectomy [^112nLmcx]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Postoperative chylothorax is a rare but potentially fatal complication after esophagectomy. Preventive measures aimed at decreasing the incidence of chyle leakage after minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) could potentially reduce the high postoperative mortality associated with this complication. However, previous techniques are traumatic and time-consuming. We present a simple method in the prophylaxis of chylothorax after MIE.

- **Study design**: A total of 344 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who underwent 3-stage MIE between June 2006 and July 2012 were included. Of these, 178 patients were given preoperative milk orally 6 hours before surgery (Group M+), and 166 underwent MIE without preoperative milk and served as controls (Group M-). Patient demographics were retrospectively collected. The incidences of intraoperative thoracic duct identification and postoperative chylothorax were recorded and statistically compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: In this cohort, the two groups were comparable in clinical features, including age, sex, tumor location, histologic type, and TNM stage. No patient was converted to open thoracotomy. During the thoracoscopic stage, a higher incidence of duct identification (95.5% vs. 12.7%, p < 0.001) and a lower incidence of duct ligation (6.74% vs. 13.25%, p = 0.039) were recorded in Group M+. Postoperatively, a total of 10 cases of chylothorax (2.91%) were observed. The incidence of chylothorax was significantly lower in Group M+ than in Group M- (0.56% vs. 5.42%, p = 0.018).

### Intractable chylous leak after radical esophagectomy treated with radiotherapy [^115SPnei]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative chylous leak after esophagectomy is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that results in hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, and immunologic deficiency. However, the management of postoperative chylous leak remains controversial. Following a diagnosis of esophageal cancer, a 64-year-old man was treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy, laparoscopic gastric tube formation, prophylactic thoracic duct ligation, and reconstruction with esophagogastrostomy at the neck level. Massive postoperative drainage from the thorax and abdomen did not initially meet the diagnostic criteria for chylothorax, which was ultimately diagnosed 3 weeks after the operation.

Despite various treatments, including total parenteral nutrition, octreotide and midodrine, reoperation (thoracic duct ligation and mechanical pleurodesis), and thoracic duct embolization, the chylous leak persisted. Finally, low-dose radiation therapy was administered with a daily dose of 2 Gy, completed at a total dose of 14 Gy. After this, the amount of pleural effusion gradually decreased over 2 weeks, and the last drainage tube was removed. The patient was alive and well at 60 months postoperatively. Herein, we describe a patient with an intractable chylous leak after esophagectomy, which persisted despite conservative treatment, thoracic duct ligation, and embolization, but was finally successfully treated with radiotherapy.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^113s4mSS]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

Airway obstruction secondary to chyle leak is an exceptionally rare phenomenon. Here, we describe this complication in a patient with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) undergoing consolidative surgery after BRAF-targeted therapy.

A 55-year-old man presented with a rapidly enlarging neck mass. Work-up was consistent with metastatic unresectable BRAF V600E-mutant ATC. After a remarkable response to neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, he underwent curative-intent surgery with a right hemithyroidectomy and bilateral neck dissection. Within 48 hours, he developed an expanding left neck mass with laryngeal obstruction due to a chyle leak.

Despite surgical repair and maximal medical therapy, the leak persisted, necessitating thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct. Final pathology showed a completely excised residual tumor. The patient remains disease-free on long-term dabrafenib and trametinib.

BRAF-directed therapy has transformed the care of patients with mutated ATC. As more patients undergo consolidative surgery, increased vigilance is paramount in minimizing complications and their associated morbidity.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^116A3K4v]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Although rare, traumatic chylothorax can be a difficult entity to manage, especially in a patient with additional traumatic injuries. This case reflects a successful approach to the management of a traumatic chyle leak using drainage and strict dietary changes, which precluded the need for surgical intervention.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^114XRY5v]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The pertinent anatomy involved in the development of a chylothorax begins with the cysterna chyli, which is a confluence of lymphatics located in the retroperitoneum, just to the right of the posteromedial aorta at the level of the renal arteries. The thoracic duct ascends from this level and enters the chest through the aortic hiatus into the right hemithorax. The duct crosses over to the left chest at the fourth and fifth thoracic levels and enters the neck anterior to the left subclavian artery to join the venous system at the junction of the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Knowledge of this anatomy should alert the physician to the possibility of a thoracic duct injury with thoracic spine fractures or any associated upper abdomen or chest injury involving this trajectory.

As in this case, the diagnosis of a chyle leak was supported by a pleural fluid triglyceride level greater than 110 mg/dL. A pleural fluid triglyceride concentration less than 50 mg/dL excludes a chylothorax. An intermediate level between 50 and 110 mg/dL should be followed by lipoprotein analysis to inspect the pleural fluid for chylomicrons or cholesterol crystals. The presence of chylomicrons and the absence of cholesterol crystals confirm a chyle leak. In addition, a ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride of less than 1 is also diagnostic.

### Chylopericardium following esophagectomy: a case report and systematic review [^116xg99J]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Chylopericardium is a rare clinical condition characterized by a pericardial effusion composed of chyle from the lacteals via the thoracic duct. The etiology can be idiopathic or secondary to surgery, radiation exposure, trauma, malignancy, and infection.

Esophagectomy is the mainstay approach for managing esophageal cancer. It is associated with the potential development of cardiac complications, namely atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. Chylopericardium is extremely rare post-esophagectomy. The acute leakage of chyle post-esophagectomy can lead to rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid and increased intrapericardial pressures, resulting in cardiac tamponade. Nevertheless, early identification and prompt management of this condition pose certain challenges.

The incidence of chylopericardium post-esophagectomy is extremely low. No specific reports in the literature have identified its exact prevalence. Available literature is limited to case reports, further highlighting the rarity of this complication.

We presented a case of chylopericardium, which led to cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest, in the setting of esophagectomy. We also performed a systematic literature review on this rare condition.

### Incidence and management of chyle leakage after esophagectomy [^114F4Coz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Postoperative chyle leakage is a rare but well-recognized complication after esophageal surgery. The aim of this study was to identify its incidence and potentially predisposing factors and to assess the consequences and management.

- **Methods**: A consecutive series of 536 patients who underwent esophagectomy for malignant disease of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction was reviewed.

- **Results**: There were 20 patients (3.7%) with chyle leakage. After transthoracic esophagectomy, the risk for the development of chyle leakage was higher than after transhiatal resection (p = 0.006). Chyle leakage was associated with more positive nodes (p = 0.041). Patients with chyle leakage had significantly more pulmonary complications (p < 0.001) and longer intensive care unit (p = 0.015) and hospital stays (p = 0.001). No patient with chyle leakage died. Conservative management, consisting of no enteral feeding and total parenteral nutrition, was instituted in all patients, but was abandoned in 4 patients (20%) because of persistence of high chyle output through the chest tube. In contrast to patients who were successfully treated with conservative measures, patients who eventually needed a reoperation had a drain output of more than 2 L on the day conservative therapy was started and 1 and 2 days later.

- **Conclusions**: Chyle leakage is seen more often in patients who undergo transthoracic esophagectomy and in patients who have more positive nodes. Patients with chyle leakage have more pulmonary complications. Conservative therapy is often successful, but operative therapy should be considered if conservative management fails.

### Lymphatic embolization for the management of post-operative chyle leaks following solid tumor resection in pediatric patients [^1113FjUJ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Chyle leaks are a common post-operative complication following solid tumor resection in pediatric patients. Treatments for persistent chyle leaks are limited, leading many patients to experience prolonged hospitalization, nutritional deficits, and delays in cancer therapies. Lymphatic embolization is an emerging treatment option for chyle leaks; however, limited reports exist of its use in pediatric populations.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients (< 18) who underwent lymphangiogram with the intent for lymphatic embolization for the management of chyle leaks following solid tumor resection between 2017 and 2022.

- **Results**: Seven patients underwent a total of 11 attempted lymphatic embolization procedures after standard of care treatments failed to resolve the leak. Lymphangiograms identified a chyle leak in 6 of 7 patients and embolization had a technical success rate of 73%. The complication rate was 9%, and complications were limited to one episode of inadvertent gastric wall perforation that did not result in a gastric leak. Lymphatic embolization was ultimately associated with chyle leak resolution in 100% of patients within a median of 24 days; however, repeat embolization was required in 5 of 7 patients (83%).

- **Conclusion**: Lymphatic embolization appears to be a safe and effective treatment for persistent chyle leaks in pediatric patients, leading to a direct reduction in chyle output and having high rates of technical and clinical success. Complete resolution of the chyle leak may require multiple embolization procedures.

### "Tension chyle leak": A life-threatening sequela of thoracic duct injury following resection of BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma [^113Jp9W3]. Head & Neck (2025). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old gentleman presented with a rapidly enlarging right neck mass, dysphagia, and dysphonia. On flexible laryngoscopy, significant external compression of the airway was appreciated, and the right vocal cord was fixed. CT imaging revealed a large mass of the right thyroid gland encasing a portion of the common carotid artery and trachea, extending down to the anterior mediastinum with multiple adenopathy (Figure 1).

Following needle biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with cT4N1bM1 BRAF V600E-mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer. After 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib (DT) treatment, near complete radiologic and metabolic resolution was obtained in the neck, along with a complete response at distant sites. At this time, following multidisciplinary team discussion, appropriate counseling, and informed consent, the patient elected for consolidative surgery.

He underwent definitive locoregional control with a right hemithyroidectomy, right central, and bilateral modified radical neck dissections (MRND II-V). Of note, the dissection planes were scarred, akin to patients undergoing surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The right laryngeal nerve was grossly involved by the tumor and was sacrificed. The internal jugular vein was thrombosed secondary to direct tumor invasion and was resected down to the jugular-subclavian junction. The sternocleidomastoid muscles were adherent to bulky nodal disease bilaterally and were partially resected. A small chyle leak was identified intra-operatively, following which the thoracic duct was clipped and suture ligated with no evident complications.

### Interventional solutions for post-surgical problems: A lymphatic leaks review [^114ReEMq]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Low credibility.

The chyle cistern (CC) is commonly located between L1 and L2, parallel to and behind the inferior cava vein, joining the thoracic duct (TD) in the upper third of the abdomen, deep to the arcuate ligament. It is present in 65% to 85% of patients and its shape is variable: oval (50%), linear (40%), or round (10%) (Fig. 1 a, b). It can measure up to 5 cm in length with an average diameter of 6–7 mm. The intestinal, hepatic, and lumbar trunks drain the lymph/chyle into the CC.

Cephalad and in the chest, the TD is located parallel and to the right of the esophagus, crossing to the left at the approximate level of the middle third of the thoracic vertebral bodies, where it lies anterior to the intercostal branches of the thoracic aorta. Then, it rises to the dome pleura and drains into the left subclavian vein, next to the jugular subclavian confluence (Fig. 1 d). The TD measures approximately 45 cm in length and 2–5 mm in diameter.

The anatomy of the TD and CC is variable, with normal anatomy in 40–60% of the patients. This includes a variable crossing level, number of thoracic collaterals — which increase surgical complexity — and variations in the anatomy of the venous-lymphatic anastomosis with the left subclavian vein (either a single trunk with a big caliber or several small vessels) (Fig. 2 a, b). These anatomic variants should be carefully considered when planning a retrograde embolization.

### A case of a traumatic chyle leak following an acute thoracic spine injury: Successful resolution with strict dietary manipulation [^117JbahG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a rare form of pleural effusion that can be associated with both traumatic and non-traumatic causes. Thoracic duct ligation is often the treatment of choice in postsurgical patients; however, the optimal treatment of this disease process after traumatic injury remains unclear. We present a rare case of a thoracic duct injury secondary to a blunt thoracic spine fracture and subluxation, which was successfully treated non-operatively.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old male presented as a tier one trauma code due to an automobile versus bicycle collision. His examination and radiographic work-up revealed fractures and a subluxation at the third and fourth thoracic spine levels resulting in paraplegia. He also sustained bilateral hemothoraces secondary to multiple rib fractures. Drainage of the left hemothorax led to the diagnosis of a traumatic chylothorax. The thoracic spine fractures were addressed with surgical stabilization, and the chylothorax was successfully treated with drainage and dietary manipulation.

- **Conclusions**: This unusual and complex blunt thoracic duct injury required a multidisciplinary approach. Although the spine injury required surgical fixation, successful resolution of the chyle leak was achieved without surgical intervention.

### Multimedia article. Prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation for postsurgical chylothorax [^112CdA9a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Chylothorax after complex abdominal and thoracic procedures remains a challenging complication with a mortality rate reaching 50% if untreated. Iatrogenic trauma accounts for almost 20% of all chyle leaks, with esophagectomy being the most common iatrogenic cause. Consequences of ongoing chyle leak include dehydration, malnutrition, and immunocompromise.

- **Methods**: When nonoperative management techniques fail, prompt ligation of the thoracic duct at the diaphragmatic hiatus should be attempted. The authors present prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation performed for two patients after laparoscopic transthoracic esophagectomy and revision paraesophageal hernia repair.

- **Results**: The prone position for thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation offers several benefits to the surgeon. Gravity retracts the lung anteriorly, exposing the diaphragmatic hiatus. Single-lumen endotracheal intubation combined with low-pressure carbon dioxide insufflation efficiently collapses the lung to create ample working space. For the two reported patients, only three trocars were necessary to complete suture ligation of the thoracic duct via the right chest. Both patients had complete resolution of their chylothorax and recovered uneventfully. Based on this experience, the authors currently advocate early thoracoscopic treatment for cost and morbidity savings.

- **Conclusions**: The authors believe prone thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation offers significant advantages to the patient in preventing the dangerous consequences of chyle leak in a timely, minimally invasive fashion.

### Chyle leak after pancreatoduodenectomy: Clinical impact and risk factors in a nationwide analysis [^111NF4Kk]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as this is a retrospective study, there is a risk of selection bias. For instance, data on aortocaval lymph node sampling was only registered in a limited number of patients. Second, data on the management of CL (e.g. nasoenteral nutrition, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, or percutaneous drainage) and on nutrition (e.g. early enteral feeding), as well as variables predicting a course that requires an aggressive approach (e.g. lymphopenia) and some potential predictors in previous studies (e.g. portal/mesenteric thrombosis and operative time), are not registered in the DPCA and therefore not available for this analysis. Third, the intended extent of lymph node dissection is not available in the audit; therefore, no distinction can be made between regular and extended resection as a risk factor for CL. Strengths of this study include its large size, nationwide aspect, and the dedicated registration of CL according to the ISGPS definition within the registry.

In conclusion, this nationwide post hoc assessment of the prospectively maintained nationwide audit shows that the rate of CL according to the ISGPS B/C definition is 7.0%, with grade C being extremely rare (0.1%). The use of this definition is recommended for further studies to adequately compare results. Risk factors for CL should be considered in the postoperative follow-up period. Moreover, a future step would be to study strategies to prevent CL and, mostly, to achieve consensus about the treatment.

### Aso author reflections: Chyle leak: No long-term impact on survival [^111WNNyt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The present study indicates that surgical outcomes for patients developing a chyle leak were similar to those with an uneventful surgery, except for the length of critical care stay, which was longer for those developing a chyle leak. More importantly, a chyle leak was not associated with any detrimental long-term effect. In particular, there was no significant difference in overall survival regardless of tumor histology between patients who developed a leak and those who did not. Conservative treatment, with the implementation of MCT feed, may address many leaks that are encountered. However, high-volume leaks are likely to require surgical intervention, which should not be feared, because it is safe and effective.

### Chyle leak following radical en bloc esophagectomy with two-field nodal dissection: Predisposing factors, management, and outcomes [^1127esk7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

A further option to treat chylothorax is the use of pleuro-peritoneal shunts, which have been demonstrated to provide internal drainage of chylothorax. Chyle can be reabsorbed by the peritoneum, preventing the nutritional, fluid, and immunological losses associated with external drainage. In this series, this approach was employed in a small number of patients. Shunts can be a successful option, either as a first-line treatment or in cases resistant to surgical management. However, outcomes with shunts were inferior to those for surgery, and the authors advocate surgical intervention as the first-line treatment of choice for high-volume leaks.

In recent years, percutaneous thoracic duct embolization has become the standard of care for high-output chylothoraces. In cases of chylous output < 1 L/day, conservative management with dietary restriction is a reasonable initial approach, which could be followed by embolization. However, surgery remains an indication in case of failure or success. Unfortunately, this technique is not available at our institution.

There are a number of limitations to this study. While the data for patients within this study, and whether or not there was a chyle leak, was collected during their inpatient stay, not all patients presumed to have a chyle leak had biochemical testing. This could potentially lead to an overestimation of the incidence.

Furthermore, precise data were not available on the length of time that conservative management was employed before progressing to surgical intervention.

### Factors predisposing to chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without lateral neck dissection [^114kWmJq]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to assess the clinicopathologic features of patients with chyle leakage following thyroid cancer surgery without lateral neck dissection and to evaluate the factors associated with chyle leakage.

- **Methods**: Of 3,137 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between January 2006 and December 2007, 2,314 patients (73.8%) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into those with chyle leakage (group I, n = 14) and those without (group II, n = 2,300).

- **Results**: There were no significant differences between the two groups in clinicopathologic features, including age, body mass index, extent of thyroidectomy, pathologic type, tumor size, multiplicity, capsular invasion, and coexisting thyroiditis. In univariate and multivariate analyses, male sex, age > 45 years, and number of harvested central nodes were significantly associated with chyle leakage.

- **Conclusions**: If extensive central compartment node dissection is needed, meticulous dissection is required, especially in male patients aged > 45 years, even without lateral neck dissection.
