## Question

A 54-year-old man with a history of alcohol-related liver cirrhosis is seen in the hepatology clinic for routine follow-up. He has no history of gastrointestinal bleeding. An upper endoscopy performed last week revealed newly diagnosed type 1 gastroesophageal varices. He is currently asymptomatic, with stable vital signs and no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. His laboratory results show a platelet count of 110,000/μL and an INR of 1.3. The patient asks about measures to prevent bleeding from his varices.

According to current EASL guidelines, what is the recommended approach for primary prevention of bleeding in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 gastroesophageal varices?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach for primary prevention of bleeding in a 54-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and newly diagnosed type 1 gastroesophageal varices, according to current EASL guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the variceal classification and why GOV1 behaves like esophageal varices. Then, I should verify the risk stratification criteria that trigger primary prophylaxis. Next, I will review the recommended first-line options and how to choose between them. After that, I need to check dosing, titration, and monitoring. Finally, I should confirm what not to do, including combination therapy and TIPS, and outline follow-up and special considerations like alcohol use and decompensation risk.

> Let me first confirm the variceal type and its implications. Type 1 gastroesophageal varices extend from the esophagus into the lesser curve and are managed like esophageal varices for primary prophylaxis, so the same EASL principles for esophageal varices apply here rather than gastric varice–specific strategies [^c782c011] [^54408711].

> Next, I should review risk stratification to determine whether primary prophylaxis is indicated. EASL recommends initiating primary prophylaxis for high-risk varices, which includes medium or large varices irrespective of Child-Pugh class, small varices with red wale marks, or small varices in Child-Pugh C patients, and also in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, ascites, or acute intercurrent illness. Wait, let me verify the size thresholds — most contemporary guidance treats varices larger than about 5 mm as medium to large, so if these GOV1 varices are medium or large, they meet criteria for prophylaxis [^728a05ad] [^37bf4c2d] [^6a3f6100].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the first-line options and the preference. EASL recommends either nonselective beta-blockers or endoscopic band ligation for primary prophylaxis in medium to large varices, with a preference for nonselective beta-blockers because they lower portal pressure and may confer additional benefits beyond bleeding prevention. Carvedilol is reasonable and increasingly favored in many guidelines, though traditional NSBBs like propranolol or nadolol are also acceptable [^f4d438f6] [^e586dd5b] [^1ebfcb5c].

> I need to ensure I address the practical choice between NSBB and EVL. NSBBs are once-daily, do not require procedural sedation, and do not carry banding-ulcer bleeding risk, but they can cause hypotension, bradycardia, fatigue, and may be less suitable with severe/refractory ascites. EVL achieves variceal eradication but requires serial endoscopies and carries banding-ulcer bleeding risk. Shared decision-making is appropriate, and in compensated patients without contraindications, NSBB — especially carvedilol — is often preferred [^f42fa589] [^6a3f6100].

> Let me think about dosing and titration if we choose carvedilol. I should double-check the typical regimen: start at 6.25 mg once daily, increase to 12.5 mg once daily after about a week if tolerated, and titrate to a resting heart rate around 50–60 bpm while maintaining systolic blood pressure above about 90 mmHg. If heart rate is already low, traditional NSBBs like nadolol or propranolol can be used with heart-rate–based titration instead [^cac332b9] [^8473aa5d].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Once NSBB therapy is initiated for primary prophylaxis, routine serial endoscopy is not required. Instead, monitor for hypotension, bradycardia, fatigue, and reassess the need for continuation if decompensation occurs. If EVL is chosen, schedule banding every 2–4 weeks until eradication, then surveillance endoscopy at 6 months and annually thereafter, with closer intervals if liver disease remains active or decompensation persists [^805428a8] [^6a175efe] [^6a3f6100].

> But wait, what if someone suggests combination therapy or TIPS for primary prevention? I should confirm that both are not recommended. EASL and AASLD advise against combining NSBB with EVL for primary prophylaxis because it increases adverse events without clear benefit, and TIPS is not indicated for primary prevention of variceal bleeding in this setting [^f207d94d] [^83b9ef3c].

> I will now examine special considerations. Given alcohol-related cirrhosis, I need to ensure ongoing alcohol cessation support, as continued drinking accelerates progression and decompensation. If the patient develops severe or refractory ascites, I should be cautious with NSBB dosing and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if hypotension or renal dysfunction emerges, balancing bleeding risk against hemodynamic compromise [^8d3a187b] [^83245834].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure I'm aligned with EASL. For newly diagnosed GOV1 varices that are medium or large, or otherwise high risk, initiate primary prophylaxis with either NSBB (carvedilol preferred by many) or EVL, with a preference for NSBB when tolerated. Do not use combination therapy or TIPS for primary prevention, and tailor the choice to comorbidities, patient preference, and local expertise [^f42fa589] [^e586dd5b] [^83b9ef3c].

---

For a 54-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and newly diagnosed GOV1 varices, **EASL recommends nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) as first-line primary prophylaxis** [^f42fa589] because they reduce portal pressure and bleeding risk [^53909544]. If NSBB are contraindicated or not tolerated, **endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is an alternative** [^e586dd5b] [^c06d27b3]. Combination therapy is not recommended for primary prophylaxis [^f207d94d], and TIPS is not indicated for primary prevention [^83b9ef3c]. Reassess treatment response and tolerability at regular intervals, and consider EVL if NSBB are discontinued or not tolerated [^9ddfd5ad].

## EASL recommendations for primary prophylaxis of GOV1 varices

EASL guidelines recommend **NSBB as first-line therapy** for primary prophylaxis in patients with medium or large varices, including GOV1 varices, because they reduce portal pressure and bleeding risk [^f42fa589] [^53909544]. NSBB options include propranolol, nadolol, or carvedilol, with carvedilol increasingly favored for its additional alpha-1 blockade and potential hemodynamic benefits [^1ebfcb5c] [^6a3f6100].

---

## Alternative therapy: endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)

If NSBB are contraindicated or not tolerated, **EVL is an effective alternative** [^e586dd5b] [^c06d27b3]. EVL involves serial endoscopic sessions to eradicate varices, typically repeated every 2–4 weeks until obliteration, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 6–12 months [^6a175efe].

---

## Combination therapy and TIPS

Combination therapy (NSBB plus EVL) is **not recommended for primary prophylaxis** because it increases adverse events without additional benefit [^f207d94d]. TIPS is not indicated for primary prevention of variceal bleeding [^83b9ef3c].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment response, tolerability, and disease progression. For patients on NSBB, monitor heart rate and blood pressure, and adjust the dose to achieve a target heart rate of 55–60 bpm if tolerated. For patients undergoing EVL, schedule repeat endoscopy every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication, then surveillance every 6–12 months [^6a175efe].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Recommendation** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB) | First-line therapy | - Reduces portal pressure <br/> - Preferred option [^f42fa589] [^53909544] |
| Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) | Alternative therapy | Use if NSBB contraindicated or not tolerated [^e586dd5b] [^c06d27b3] |
| Combination therapy (NSBB + EVL) | Not recommended | Increases adverse events without added benefit [^f207d94d] |
| Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) | Not indicated | Not for primary prophylaxis [^83b9ef3c] |

---

EASL recommends **NSBB as first-line primary prophylaxis** for GOV1 varices, with EVL as an alternative if NSBB are contraindicated or not tolerated. Combination therapy and TIPS are not recommended for primary prophylaxis. Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure treatment efficacy and safety.

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^0f971cd4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Both EVL and BBs are effective in the primary prevention of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, and guidelines recommend the use of either of these therapies to prevent hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis with medium/large-sized varices. In this study, 39% of the physicians surveyed chose both BBs and EVL as their preferred choice for prevention of first variceal hemorrhage for a 60-year-old man with hepatitis C cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Thus it appears that combination therapy may be commonly used in clinical practice despite practice guidelines recommending the use of either, but not both options, for primary prophylaxis.

Preference for using both options may be based on data demonstrating that combined therapy is superior to either monotherapy for prevention of recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices. While combination therapy is recommended for the prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (where the risk of rebleeding is in the order of 60% in one year), a more conservative approach is recommended for primary prophylaxis (where the risk of hemorrhage is ~15% in one year). Failure to adhere to guideline recommendations, however, is well recognized across specialties, and may be due to multiple factors including the level of the guidelines trustworthiness, the perceived relevance of the guideline recommendations to the individual patient, and the strength of the evidence underlying each recommendation.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^9c9ac334]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in almost half of patients with cirrhosis at the time of initial diagnosis. Variceal bleeding occurs in 25% to 35% of patients with cirrhosis. Effective and timely care can prevent variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis). For example, clinical studies demonstrate that both beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation are effective in preventing a first episode of variceal bleeding. The major challenge is to screen patients in a timely manner and institute a form of therapy that has the highest chance of success in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness.

Primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal hemorrhage in cACLD: Patients who have decompensated cirrhosis by definition have CSPH, and patients with high-risk varices (moderate/large varices or any size varices with red wale marks or in a patient with CTP C) should undergo primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding; if the high-risk varices are small, the only method that is technically feasible is the administration of nonselective beta-blocker (NSBB), whereas if the high-risk varices are large, both NSBB as well as EVL are possible approaches; a recent systematic review with network meta-analysis showed a lower risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and a trend for mortality reduction, and administration of carvedilol in patients with high-risk varices and ascites has been associated to improved survival in a prospective study (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19–0.96) and a retrospective study (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.81).

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^5f03cf1e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we found that most of the physicians in this study (the majority of whom performed endoscopies and had practices with a small number (< 25%) of liver patients) preferred to a strategy including EVL to prevent first variceal bleed in patients with cirrhosis. This may be due to the strong appeal of being able to visualize eradication of varices. Further research is needed to better understand and confirm this practice pattern and to develop interventions to improve adherence to guidelines.

### The use of screening and preventive therapies for gastroesophageal varices in patients referred for evaluation of orthotopic liver transplantation [^647d91f1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening for varices has been recommended in patients with cirrhosis to prevent variceal hemorrhage (primary prophylaxis). In addition, therapy is recommended after the initial episode of variceal bleeding to prevent recurrence (secondary prophylaxis). However, the degree of adherence to these recommendations remains unclear. The purpose of our study was to determine whether these recommendations are being followed in patients presenting for evaluation of orthotopic liver transplantation.

Methods

One hundred twenty-five patients referred for liver transplantation were evaluated. Data regarding demographics, clinical information, relevant time intervals (diagnosis of cirrhosis to screening, screening to initial variceal bleeding, variceal bleeding to referral, diagnosis of cirrhosis to referral), screening strategies used, and implementation of primary or secondary prophylaxis was obtained. The differences among quantitative variables were analyzed with Student's t test. Qualitative variables were evaluated with the Mantel-Haenzel χ² test or Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was designated at p < 0.05.

Results

Our study found that 46% of patients presenting for evaluation of liver transplantation had screening endoscopy or radiological studies to detect the presence of varices. On the contrary, secondary prophylaxis was performed in all patients with a prior history of variceal hemorrhage. Screening for varices displayed no regional differences.

Conclusions

In our cohort, screening for varices is not being consistently performed, thus delaying the timely implementation of primary prophylaxis. Therefore, the adherence to currently available practice guidelines and the education of physicians to implement screening in this patient population is an important goal.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications… [^6edc6463]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for hepatic encephalopathy include provision of supportive care, identification and removal of precipitating factors, reduction in the nitrogenous load from the gut, and optimization of long-term therapy. Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus. 14 Variceal hemorrhage is defined as bleeding from an esophageal or gastric varix at the time of endoscopy, or the presence of large esophageal varices with blood in the stomach and no other recognizable source of bleeding.

9 The rate of variceal bleeding is approximately 10 to 30 percent per year.
14. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage recommend that patients with cirrhosis who present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo an urgent upper endoscopic evaluation. 9 If no varices are observed, these patients should have repeat endoscopy at three-year intervals. If small varices are diagnosed, patients should have repeat surveillance at one-year intervals. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is aimed at reducing the portal pressure gradient, azygous blood f low, and variceal pressure. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding. 9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9. TIPS has been shown to improve outcomes and is more cost-effective than endoscopic band ligation in reducing variceal bleeding, but it is associated with a higher risk of encephalopathy. 9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting. 3 Compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin, TIPS improves survival without liver transplantation in patients with refractory or recidivant ascites.
17.

After the cessation of active variceal hemorrhage, the subsequent six weeks carry a high risk of recurrent hemorrhage. The greatest risk of rebleeding is within the first 48 to 72 hours, with more than 50 percent of episodes occurring within the first 10 days. 18 Risk factors for early rebleeding include age older than 60 years, renal failure, large varices, and severe initial bleeding. 18 A retrospective study showed that in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding decreased from 43 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 2000, in concurrence with an early and combined use of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies and short-term antibiotic prophylaxis.
19. Hepatorenal Syndrome Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as functional renal failure in cirrhotic patients in the absence of intrinsic renal disease.

Chronic hepatitis C after sustained virologic response (SVR) — esophageal varices risk and proposed variceal bleeding management: A cohort of 444 patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis was divided into 218 with stage 1 and 226 with stage 2, with a median follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 1–12.6 years); in stage 1, SVR was associated with fewer new varices (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11–0.48; P < .001), whereas in stage 2, SVR was not associated with fewer further varices (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03). Based on the available literature, a proposed practical approach is: no varices — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years and no further screening if negative; small varices, no treatment — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years with further actions as stated; prior primary prophylaxis with β-blockers and/or band ligation — repeat after 6–12 months and repeat after 1–2 years once low risk; decompensated or prior bleeding — close surveillance and/or treatment as already instituted. Although updated Baveno VI guidance supports risk stratification using a TE cutoff of < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150,000/μL to identify patients at low risk who may not require screening endoscopy, in post-SVR populations such data are not yet available and application of these cutoffs should be approached with caution and on an individual-patient basis.

### Carvedilol for prevention of variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b92cb0b1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, carvedilol is a safe and efficacious treatment option for the primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. In addition, it may also delay variceal progression. However, our confidence in these conclusions is very low, given the imprecision, heterogeneity and potential risk of bias of the available evidence. This underlines the need for adequately powered, high-quality clinical trials.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Carvedilol is a guideline-recommended treatment option for the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding
Carvedilol's efficacy in the context of secondary prevention of variceal bleeding is under consideration
Randomized controlled trials present data regarding its efficacy and safety

What the new findings are:

Carvedilol is equally efficacious to endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), for both primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence indicates that carvedilol reduces all-cause mortality compared to EVL in patients with a previous history of variceal bleeding
Very low-quality evidence suggests that carvedilol is as efficacious as propranolol for the prevention of variceal rebleeding after variceal eradication

### Endoscopic screening for varices in cirrhosis: findings, implications, and outcomes [^f9efa461]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

At least two thirds of cirrhotic patients develop esophageal varices during their lifetime. Severe upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding as a complication of portal hypertension develops in about 30%-40% of cirrhotics. Despite significant improvements in the early diagnosis and treatment of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, the mortality rate of first variceal hemorrhage remains high (20%-35%). Primary prophylaxis, the focus of this article, is treatment of patients who never had previous variceal bleeding to prevent the first variceal hemorrhage. The potential of preventing first variceal hemorrhage offers the promise of reducing mortality, morbidity, and associated health care costs. This article (1) reviews endoscopic grading of size and stigmata for esophageal and gastric varices, (2) describes data on prevalence and incidence of esophageal and gastric varices from prospective studies, (3) discusses independent risk factors from multivariate analyses of prospective studies for development of first esophageal or gastric variceal hemorrhage and possible stratification of patients based on these risk factors, (4) comments on the potential cost effectiveness of screening all newly diagnosed cirrhotic patients and treating high-risk patients with medical or endoscopic therapies, and (5) recommends further studies of endoscopic screening, stratification, and outcomes in prospective studies of endoscopic therapy. The author's recommendations are to perform endoscopic screening for the following subgroups of cirrhotics: all newly diagnosed cirrhotic patients and all other cirrhotics who are medically stable, willing to be treated prophylactically, and would benefit from medical or endoscopic therapies. Exclude patients who are unlikely to benefit from prophylactic therapies designed to prevent the first variceal hemorrhage, those with short life expectancy, and those with previous UGI hemorrhage (they should have already undergone endoscopy). For low or very low risk cirrhotic patients-those found to have no varices or small varices without stigmata-repeat endoscopy is recommended because screening for progression may be warranted in 2 or more years.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^ecd88229]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

Primary prophylaxis

Since 30–50% of patients with portal hypertension will bleed from varices and about 20% will die from the effects of the first bleed, it seems rational to develop prophylactic regimens to prevent the development of, and bleeding from, these varices. However, most of the published trials do not have sufficient power to identify favourable treatment effects. Based on the expected bleeding and death rates in the control group, the minimum number of patients needed to detect a 50% reduction in bleeding would be 270, and 850 patients in each arm to detect the same reduction in mortality. A proposed algorithm for surveillance and prophylaxis of varices is shown in figure 2. At this time there is insufficient evidence to support treating patients without varices or 'pre-primary prophylaxis'. A large randomised placebo-controlled trial of timolol in patients without varices and portal hypertension defined as HVPG > 6 mm Hg did not show any effect on the development of varices or variceal bleeding. The role of drug treatment in preventing bleeding in patients with small varices is unclear. Three randomised placebo-controlled trials have studied this. Cales et al showed that propranolol in patients with small, or no, varices resulted in greater development of varices. However, patients without varices were included and there was significant loss of patients to follow-up. The second trial showed that nadolol reduced variceal bleeding without survival benefit and increased adverse events. Sarin et al did not show any effect with propranolol, despite a significant effect on portal pressure.

Gastric varices — prevention of first hemorrhage: Only one randomized trial has been published on the primary prevention of gastric VH; this study included 89 patients with large (≥ 10 mm) GOV2 and IGV1, the number of patients with IGV1 was small (15%), and cyanoacrylate injection was associated with lower bleeding rates (10%) than NSBBs (38%) and observation (53%), while survival was higher in the cyanoacrylate group (93%) compared to observation (74%), but no different from those on NSBBs (83%). No studies have assessed primary prevention of bleeding from GOV1 varices; TIPS is not recommended in this setting and the efficacy of BRTO has not been studied and therefore cannot be recommended for primary prophylaxis. Guidance statements specify: For prevention of first VH from GOV2 or IGV1, NSBBs can be used, although the data are not as strong as for EV; Prevention of first bleeding from GOV1 varices may follow the recommendations for EV; Neither TIPS nor BRTO are recommended to prevent first hemorrhage in patients with fundal varices that have not bled.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^6a3f6100]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

There are two options for primary prevention of variceal bleeding: non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and variceal band ligation (VBL). At present, we recommend NSBB or VBL in medium to large varices (> 5 mm in diameter), considering comorbidities, tolerances and patient choice. Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not need further surveillance. Those who have VBL should have banding approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated; in those who continue to have active liver disease (eg, still drinking alcohol), we would recommend rescope at 1 year (or if they develop decompensation) and then 1–2 yearly until abstinence is achieved and there is evidence that their liver disease is stable or improving.

A recent meta-analysis, including results from the PREDESCI trial, suggests that NSBB such as carvedilol may reduce decompensation and mortality in patients with compensated cirrhosis, particularly in the presence of varices. Based on this evidence, carvedilol, where tolerated, could be preferred to VBL in patients with compensated cirrhosis and medium to large varices. In addition, carvedilol could be considered in patients with small varices (defined as varices < 5 mm in diameter or varices which completely disappear on moderate insufflation of the oesophagus) and compensated cirrhosis in the presence of active liver disease. However, concerns of poor tolerance and concordance with NSBB (particularly in ARLD with ongoing alcohol use) could limit NSBB use in small varices and make VBL a preferable option in some patients with medium/large varices. We are currently awaiting the results of CALIBREand BOPPP, two multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at definitively addressing these issues.

Another area of active debate is the role of NSBB in preventing decompensation in clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), defined by the Baveno group as hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg or LSM > 25 kPa. The recently published updated Baveno VII document includes a recommendation to use NSBB in all patients with CSPHregardless of the presence of varices. However, we believe further studies are required, and we do not currently advocate prescribing NSBB based on non-invasive markers (such as TE) alone, without endoscopic evidence of varices.

### The magnitude and correlates of esophageal varices among newly diagnosed cirrhotic patients undergoing screening fibre optic endoscope before incident bleeding in north-Western tanzania; a cross-sectional study [^07e229b5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Even with these differences, the clinical relevance of these findings remains practically similar. It is known that bleeding occurs in up to 35% of patients with cirrhosis without prophylaxis with high mortality ranging between 20 and 40% in most studies. Our study involved patients who had never reported any overt bleeding. In a similar context, it may be inferred that about 35% of these participants may suffer fatal bleeding within 2 years with mortality that may be over 20% without initiation of appropriate primary preventive treatment.

Furthermore, cirrhotic patients without varices at diagnosis will subsequently develop varices and those with small varices will develop large varices at a rate of about 8% a year as reported by Garcia et al. In our study, about 60% had no varices on endoscopic screening and about 34 (15.2%) had small varices. This also suggests that without prophylaxis each year about 8% of our patients without esophageal varices will potentially develop esophageal varices in addition to 8% risk of developing large varices and bleeding among those with small varices. Guidelines recommend the initiation of primary prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of these unfavorable outcomes. Follow-Up endoscopy is indicated every 1–2 years among patients with small varices and those without varices.

Prevention of recurrent hemorrhage after initial bleeding — timing and risk: After a first AVH, patients are at high risk of rebleeding (up to 60% at 1 y without prophylaxis), and secondary prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding should be instituted immediately after control of the index bleed, within 7 days from admission, because the highest risk period for rebleeding is the first 6 weeks after presentation; in patients who underwent preemptive TIPS, no further measures are required.

### Primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding: β-blockers, endoscopic ligation, or both? [^b922fac9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the complications of cirrhosis that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. It is recommended that all patients with cirrhosis be screened for gastroesophageal varices and those with large varices should be offered primary prophylaxis. Nonselective beta-blockers (nadolol or propranolol) are the treatment of choice for primary prophylaxis but there are a number of limitations to their use. A number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of variceal band ligation (VBL) in providing primary prophylaxis, either in comparison to no treatment or to beta-blockers. VBL is very effective in preventing the initial bleed when compared to no treatment, but it is not superior to beta-blockers. In this issue of the journal the effect of beta-blockers on bleeding in patients undergoing VBL is examined and no benefit compared to VBL alone is shown. Thus, patients with large varices should be treated with beta-blockers and VBL should be offered to those cirrhotics who are unable to take beta-blockers. Further study is required to determine if VBL in combination with beta-blockers is more effective than the beta-blockers alone.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients: a cohort study [^63d6003d]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend beta-blockers for primary prevention of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients, and band ligation for patients with contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers. However, it has been suggested that these patients may respond poorly to band ligation.

Aim

We evaluated the usefulness of a strategy in which band ligation was used to treat patients with contraindications or intolerance and patients not responding to beta-blockers identified by hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement. Haemodynamic responders and patients refusing hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement were given long-term beta-blockers.

Methods

One hundred and thirty-five consecutive patients with high-risk oesophageal varices and no prior bleeding were enrolled. Twenty-five patients with contraindications (group A), 26 with intolerance to beta-blockers (group B) and 25 showing a poor haemodynamic response (Group C) underwent band ligation. Twenty-two haemodynamic responders (Group D) and 37 refusing hepatic vein pressure gradient measurement (Group E) were treated with beta-blockers.

Results

Median follow-up was 32 months. 12/135 patients (8.9%) bled: 3/25 (12%) in group A, 1/26 (3.8%) in group B, 0/25 (0%) in group C, 0/22 (0%) in group D and 8/37 (22.2%) in group E. Mortality was 8/135 (5.9%).

Conclusions

Patients with contraindications, intolerance or not responding to beta-blockers treated with band ligation achieve protection from variceal bleeding comparable to that of good responders to beta-blockers.

### Gastric varices: an updated review of management [^5b8746ca]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

Screening, surveillance and prophylaxis of variceal bleeding

All patients with DC who are not on a non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) should undergo endoscopy to screen for varices. The risk of progression to high-risk varices is higher in decompensated disease, so we recommend annual surveillance in all patients not already receiving primary prophylaxis. Patients with Child-Pugh C disease and small varices should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB if tolerated. All patients with medium-to-large varices/red signs should have primary prophylaxis with NSBB or variceal band ligation (VBL) (figure 2). Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not require further surveillance endoscopy. Those who have VBL for primary prevention should be scoped approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated and then have ongoing surveillance annually until they recompensate and the underlying aetiological driver for their liver disease is removed (eg, abstinence from alcohol).

Figure 2
Surveillance and treatment of non-bleeding gastrooesophageal varices indecompensated cirrhosis. + Titrate from 6.25 mg od to target 12.5 mg od in single or divided doses if tolerated (maintain HR, 50–60, systolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg). *Small varices defined as < 5 mm diameter or varices which completely disappear with moderate insufflation of the oesophagus, medium-large varices > 5 mm diameter. NSSB, non-selective beta blocker; VBL, variceal band ligation.

Secondary prevention of variceal haemorrhage is important, as the risk of rebleeding can be as high as 60% with 20% mortality for each rebleeding episode. A combination of NSBB and VBL is recommended. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPSS) has a role in secondary prevention in high-risk cases, where patients rebleed despite NSBB and VBL, or where there are additional indications such as refractory/recurrent ascites. Careful patient selection is necessary (see BSG guidelines on TIPSS in portal hypertension), including consideration of liver transplantation (LT) where appropriate.

Recommendations: management of active haemorrhage from gastric varices (Figure 3)
What is the optimal management of bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices? Gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV)-1: treat as for oesophageal varices (level 2b, grade B). GOV-2 and isolated gastric varices (IGV): We recommend initial endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate injection (level 1a, grade A). Thrombin may also be considered (level 4, grade C). TIPSS can be considered, depending on local resources and clinical judgement (level 3a, grade B).
If control of bleeding fails: Balloon tamponade is suggested for GOV and IGV-1 until definitive treatment is undertaken (level 2b, grade B). Salvage TIPSS is suggested as the first-line definite treatment, where feasible (level 3a, grade B). Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) or surgical shunting can be considered if TIPSS is not possible (eg, portal vein thrombosis present) and depending on local resources (level 3a, grade B).
What are the therapeutic options for prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices? We recommend that patients with GOV-1 are entered into a VBL surveillance programme (level 2b, grade B). We recommend endoscopic surveillance with cyanoacrylate injection as needed for GOV-2 and IGV (level 2b, grade B). Note the optimum endoscopic follow-up strategy remains unclear. Thrombin can also be considered (level 4, grade C). NSBB can be considered in certain circumstances after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement (level 1b, grade B). We suggest TIPSS if patients rebleed despite cyanoacrylate injection. TIPSS can also be considered in other selected patients (eg, those with large or multiple gastric varices) (level 1b, grade B). Shunt surgery may be used in selected patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and depending on local resources (level 3c, grade B). Splenectomy or splenic artery embolisation should be considered in all patients where there is splenic vein thrombosis or left-sided portal hypertension (level 4, grade C).
Is there a role for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding? NSBB (level 2a, grade B) can be considered in selected high-risk patients with large GOV-2 after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement. Cyanoacrylate injection is not recommended outside clinical trials (level 2a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of thrombin in gastric varices, comparing this with tissue adhesives in both acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of TIPSS in acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of haemostatic powders in controlling refractory active gastric variceal bleeding. Role of NSBB in the prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices. Role of B-RTO as monotherapy or in combination with endoscopic injection of tissue adhesives in prevention of bleeding from gastric varices. Role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of tissue adhesives or thrombin. Primary prevention of gastric variceal bleeding with tissues adhesives and NSBB.

### Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^a36f75a6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. Forty-six trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The follow-up ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), beta-blockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the follow-up period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very low-certainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on low-certainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderate-certainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. Beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. Beta-blockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. While physical examination findings may be suggestive, it is recommended to stratify risk for all using the FIB-4 followed by elastography for at-risk patients. After identifying patients with cirrhosis, optimal care may involve referral to a hepatologist, liver cancer screening, and consideration of endoscopy for varices screening and/or initiation of nonselective β-blockers. BMI indicates body mass index. 40% Lifetime risk among patients with cirrhosis 5. 1% at 1 y 20% at 3 y Varices form at a rate of 9%/y in patients with cirrhosis Variceal bleeding occurs at a rate of

1. 2%-4% within 3 y among patients with cirrhosis.

Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively. Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis are caused by alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with many patients having overlapping causes. 4 However, hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals and most newly diagnosed cirrhosis is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder.
5. Outcomes for patients with cirrhosis can be improved with evidence-based therapies directed toward both the etiology of cirrhosis6-12 and its complications.

13–21 Recent innovations include noninvasive risk stratification of cirrhosis22, 23 as well as interventions that improve survival by preventing or reducing the complications of cirrhosis. 24 Such complications include variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Survival for patients with cirrhosis is improved with control of their underlying chronic liver disease. Beyond that, screening for liver cancer with biannual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein is associated with higher rates of curative treatment when cancer is detected. When patients develop portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers are associated with lower rates of decompensation or death. The causes of cirrhosis vary by context and many overlap.

In a study of 68 673 patients from a national sample of patients in the Veterans Administration, the causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C, alcohol related, hepatitis C and alcohol related, NAFLD related and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance.

### Comparative efficacy of endoscopic variceal ligation versus non-selective β-blockers in primary prevention of gastroesophageal varix type 2: an IPTW-adjusted study [^d785c175]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Practice guidelines recommend non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) for primary prevention in cirrhosis patients with esophageal varices. However, there is no clear recommendation for primary prevention strategies for gastric varices, particularly GOV-2. Our objective is to investigate the incidence of initial bleeding and liver-related complications when NSBB and EVL are used for primary prevention in GOV-2.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from patients with GOV-2 gastric varices. Patients were divided into the NSBB group or the EVL group. Differences in the incidence of initial bleeding within 1 year, as well as the occurrence of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, were compared between the two groups before and after adjustment for Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent risk factors for the first bleeding event.

Results

There were 60 patients in the NSBB group and 66 patients in the EVL group. Before IPTW adjustment, there were differences between the two groups in sex, portal hypertensive gastropathy, esophageal variceal diameter, red signs, FIB-4, and MELD scores. After IPTW adjustment, these differences were balanced, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) within acceptable ranges. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no difference in bleeding rates between the two groups before or after IPTW adjustment. After IPTW adjustment, Cox regression analysis identified esophageal variceal diameter (HR:5.59 (2.03–15.39), p < 0.001) and MELD score (HR:1.17 (1.01–1.23), p = 0.042) were independent risk factors for bleeding. NSBB treatment did not reduce the incidence of liver-related complications within one year compared to EVL.

Conclusion

For primary prevention of bleeding in cirrhotic patients with GOV-2, EVL does not significantly reduce initial bleeding episodes or liver-related complications compared to NSBB.

### Comparison of therapies for primary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^53909544]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

We performed a systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy of different approaches in primary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and overall survival in patients with cirrhosis with large varices. Thirty-two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with 3,362 adults with cirrhosis with large esophageal varices and no prior history of bleeding, with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up, were included. Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB), isosorbide-mononitrate (ISMN), carvedilol, and variceal band ligation (VBL), alone or in combination, were compared with each other or placebo. Primary outcomes were reduction of all-cause mortality and prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding. Random-effects NMA was performed and summary estimates were expressed as odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (OR; CI). Quality of evidence was critically appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Moderate quality evidence supports NSBB monotherapy (0.70; 0.49–1.00) or in combination with VBL (0.49; 0.23–1.02) or ISMN (0.44; 0.21–0.93) for decreasing mortality in patients with cirrhosis with large esophageal varices and no prior history of bleeding. Moderate-quality evidence supports carvedilol (0.21; 0.08–0.56) and VBL monotherapy (0.33; 0.19–0.55) or in combination with NSBB (0.34; 0.14–0.86), and low-quality evidence supports NSBB monotherapy (0.64; 0.38–1.07) for primary prevention of variceal bleeding. VBL carries a higher risk of serious adverse events compared with NSBB. Conclusion: NSBB monotherapy may decrease all-cause mortality and the risk of first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis with large esophageal varices. Additionally, NSBB carries a lower risk of serious complications compared with VBL. Therefore, NSBB may be the preferred initial approach for primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding.

### Challenges in the management of esophagogastric varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis – A narrative review [^79041189]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advancements in pharmacological, endoscopic, and radiographic treatments have emerged in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices or variceal hemorrhage. These advances have been in several areas, including the role of screening and primary prophylaxis (preventing an initial variceal bleed), evaluation and management of acute esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, and in preventing variceal rebleeding. Therefore, we believe there is a need for an updated, evidence-based "narrative review" on this important clinical topic that will be relevant for internists, hospitalists, intensive care unit physicians, and those in training. We believe the guidance presented in this narrative review will enhance daily medical practice of health care professionals and has the potential to improve quality of care for these complex patients.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^86554a3f]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal hypertension — recommendations state that prevention and treatment of acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) and hepatic decompensation in patients with HCC should follow the same principles as those for patients without HCC. In the absence of contraindications, NSBB therapy is recommended for the primary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage (VH) and prevention of decompensation in patients with HCC with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) (including varices). In the presence of occlusive bland or malignant portal vein thrombosis (PVT), upper endoscopy is recommended to identify varices, and if varices are detected, NSBB or endoscopic band ligation are recommended; preference is given to NSBB (including carvedilol) because of benefits beyond prevention of variceal hemorrhage.

### Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of carvedilol versus variceal band ligation in primary prevention of variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis (CALIBRE trial) [^34b7126a]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Trial rationale

The main focus of the research is the comparison of beta-blockers and variceal band ligation in the prevention of the first variceal bleed. There have been two important guidelines published in the UK in 2015–2016 from NICE and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG).NICE favours banding for primary prevention, whereas the BSG suggests banding if the patient is intolerant of beta-blockers. The recommendations of the BSG guidelines are similar to those of international guidelines. Therefore, there is at present disparity in the current guidelines with regard to first-line therapy for primary prevention.

Many specialists have significant concerns about the adverse effects of variceal band ligation, in particular the risk of banding induced bleeding. There are also concerns about the use of beta-blockers in patients with advanced cirrhosis with some studies showing higher mortalitywhile others report improved survival. In particular with carvedilol, improved survival has been suggested. None of these studies are randomised trials and are therefore limited by their designs and the potential for confounding and other biases.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^07f406a1]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70-90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.
