## Question

54 yo F with known systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis (baseline Cr 1.6), and hypertension presents for mild pneumonia. She is on chronic prednisone 20 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine, and lisinopril. She reports stable weight and appetite. Labs: Na 135, K 4.7, Cr 1.7, glucose 108. CXR shows left lower lobe infiltrate. You plan to admit and start IV ceftriaxone and add trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg BID for broader coverage. Safe to proceed with this regimen?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg twice daily to ceftriaxone is safe for a 54-year-old woman with SLE, lupus nephritis, and hypertension who is on prednisone 20 mg/day and lisinopril, given her current creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication for TMP-SMX in this pneumonia scenario. Then, I should verify renal dosing requirements and the risk of hyperkalemia with TMP-SMX, especially with an ACE inhibitor. Next, I will assess SLE-specific risks, including sulfa allergy and drug-induced lupus flares. After that, I should review drug–drug interactions and whether any justify choosing an alternative. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation and confirm monitoring needs and alternatives if TMP-SMX is not suitable.

> Let me first confirm the indication. TMP-SMX is not standard empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia; ceftriaxone alone covers typical pathogens, and adding TMP-SMX without a specific atypical or resistant indication risks overtreatment and harm, so I need to ensure there is a clear rationale such as suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas, or Nocardia before proceeding [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the renal dosing because creatinine 1.7 mg/dL likely reflects eGFR around 30–40 mL/min/1.73 m² in many adults. Standard adult treatment dosing of TMP-SMX at 160/800 mg twice daily is high for this kidney function; FDA labeling advises dose reduction by about 50% when creatinine clearance is 15–30 mL/min, and many HIV and transplant guidance documents similarly recommend halving the dose in moderate CKD, with close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR] [^112oB8Jc] [^115BtcTw].

> Hold on, I should verify the hyperkalemia risk with TMP-SMX, especially with lisinopril. TMP acts like amiloride and can cause dose-dependent hyperkalemia, and the risk is amplified with ACE inhibitors, baseline CKD, and older age; observational data show a roughly threefold higher risk of hyperkalemia with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin, with the absolute risk rising as eGFR falls, so I need to ensure baseline potassium is checked and rechecked within a few days if I proceed [^116C7QHU] [^115pbXZz] [^113RRnHU].

> I need to check SLE-specific issues next. Sulfa allergy is more common in SLE, with reports around 30% and a meaningful fraction experiencing worsening disease activity; moreover, TMP-SMX can trigger severe cutaneous adverse reactions and, rarely, drug-induced lupus phenomena, so I should confirm no prior sulfa allergy and monitor closely for rash, fever, or mucocutaneous involvement if used [^112RmuaH] [^1125p7VX] [^113RRnHU].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions. TMP-SMX can increase serum creatinine without reducing true GFR by inhibiting tubular secretion, which can confound assessment of kidney function; it also has additive hyperkalemia risk with ACE inhibitors and can cause hematologic toxicity, so I should double-check baseline CBC and electrolytes and plan serial monitoring if I use it [^114Z9B3a] [^113RRnHU].

> But wait, what if the pneumonia is actually PJP or another indication where TMP-SMX is first-line? If there is a credible PJP risk (e.g., immunosuppression with high-dose steroids, dyspnea, hypoxemia, diffuse interstitial pattern), then TMP-SMX is appropriate, but I should still dose-adjust for renal function and monitor potassium every 2–3 days initially; if there is no PJP risk, I should avoid routine TMP-SMX for CAP and favor standard therapy with close follow-up [^111VvEHB] [^115uyNcC] [^116C7QHU].

> I should confirm practical monitoring if TMP-SMX is used despite risks: check baseline creatinine/eGFR, potassium, sodium, and CBC; recheck renal function and potassium within 48–72 hours; ensure good hydration to mitigate crystalluria; and watch for rash, fever, or mucosal involvement. If potassium rises above 5.5 mmol/L or creatinine rises more than 30% from baseline, I need to reassess dosing or discontinue promptly [^113RRnHU] [^116C7QHU].

> Let me reconsider alternatives if the renal or hyperkalemia risk is unacceptable or if sulfa allergy is present. For broader bacterial coverage in CAP, I could add doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if clinically indicated, while avoiding TMP-SMX; for PJP prophylaxis when TMP-SMX is contraindicated, atovaquone or dapsone (after G6PD testing) are reasonable substitutes, recognizing they do not provide the same antibacterial breadth [^113EkQLQ] [^112r5FRS].

> Putting this together, I should not proceed with TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice daily in this patient without a compelling indication such as suspected PJP or Stenotrophomonas, given her CKD and ACE inhibitor exposure. If there is a valid indication, I would reduce the dose by 50% (e.g., 80/400 mg twice daily or 160/800 mg once daily) with strict potassium and renal monitoring, and if no indication exists, I would avoid TMP-SMX and continue with guideline-concordant CAP therapy plus supportive care and close follow-up [^115uyNcC] [^116C7QHU] [^117H344e].

It is **not safe** to add TMP-SMX 160/800 mg BID in this patient because of her CKD (Cr 1.7 mg/dL, ~eGFR 30–40 mL/min) and concomitant ACE inhibitor, which together markedly increase the risk of hyperkalemia and AKI [^116C7QHU] [^115pbXZz]. TMP-SMX should be **avoided or dose-reduced by 50%** with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium if absolutely necessary [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR]. For mild pneumonia, ceftriaxone alone is appropriate; if broader coverage is needed, consider doxycycline or a beta-lactam with a macrolide, and reserve TMP-SMX only for confirmed PJP or Stenotrophomonas with strict renal dosing and monitoring.

---

## Pharmacokinetics and renal considerations

TMP-SMX is renally cleared, and **impaired renal function increases drug exposure and toxicity risk** [^1152boC6]. In CKD, trimethoprim can cause potassium retention and a dose-dependent rise in serum creatinine from inhibited tubular secretion, even without true GFR decline [^114Z9B3a]. The FDA advises dose reduction by 50% when CrCl is 15–30 mL/min and close monitoring of renal function and potassium [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR].

---

## Risk of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia is a major concern with TMP-SMX, especially with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and risk rises with CKD and older age [^116C7QHU]. In a large cohort, TMP-SMX increased hyperkalemia risk 3.36-fold versus amoxicillin, with the highest risk in eGFR < 30 mL/min [^116C7QHU]. Given this patient's CKD and lisinopril, adding TMP-SMX BID is **likely to cause hyperkalemia** [^115pbXZz].

---

## Risk of acute kidney injury (AKI)

TMP-SMX can cause AKI via crystalluria, interstitial nephritis, and hemodynamic effects, with higher risk in CKD and when combined with nephrotoxic or renally active drugs [^113RRnHU]. Observational data show a 3.15-fold higher AKI risk with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin, particularly with ACE inhibitors or baseline CKD [^116C7QHU]. Thus, adding TMP-SMX here **increases AKI risk** [^115pbXZz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise **avoiding TMP-SMX in CKD** unless clearly indicated, and if used, to reduce the dose by 50% and monitor creatinine and potassium closely [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR]. For mild pneumonia, ceftriaxone alone is appropriate; broader coverage can be achieved with doxycycline or a beta-lactam plus macrolide, reserving TMP-SMX for confirmed PJP or Stenotrophomonas with strict renal dosing and monitoring [^117H344e].

---

## Alternative antibiotic options

Given the risks, **consider these alternatives**:

- **Doxycycline**: covers atypicals and some MRSA; no significant nephrotoxicity or hyperkalemia.
- **Macrolides (azithromycin)**: for atypical coverage; use cautiously with QT risk.
- **Beta-lactam plus macrolide**: for severe CAP or comorbidities.

---

## Monitoring and precautions if TMP-SMX is absolutely necessary

If TMP-SMX is unavoidable (e.g. confirmed PJP), **reduce the dose by 50%** and monitor serum creatinine and potassium every 2–3 days initially, then weekly; ensure adequate hydration to reduce crystalluria risk [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR] [^113RRnHU].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Adding TMP-SMX 160/800 mg BID is **unsafe** in this patient due to CKD and ACE inhibitor use, with high risks of hyperkalemia and AKI [^116C7QHU] [^115pbXZz]. Use ceftriaxone alone or with doxycycline or a macrolide as indicated, and reserve TMP-SMX for confirmed indications with dose reduction and close monitoring if absolutely necessary [^115uyNcC] [^111X1VYR].

Supportive care and fertility considerations in lupus nephritis (LN) note that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) use may be limited because kidney function and hyperkalemia may also limit use, and alternatives, such as atovaquone, dapsone (often used for skin manifestations in SLE), or pentamidine may be considered in patients unable to take TMP-SMX; for patients receiving cyclophosphamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and sperm or oocyte cryopreservation should be considered, and shared decision making, with discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment, should guide therapy; additionally, non-LN glomerular disease occurs only in about 1% to 5% of SLE patients with kidney manifestations, making prospective trials difficult to pursue in lupus podocytopathies.

Exposure to prophylactic‐

In this study, physicians at each institution determined the selection process of patients for prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In addition, because there were no established guidelines for discontinuing TMP‐SMX, the decision about when or whether to discontinue was also made at the physician's discretion. The TMP/SMX dosage was either one single‐strength tablet (TMP 80 mg and SMX 400 mg) daily or one double‐strength tablet (TMP 160 mg and SMX 800 mg) every other day, adjusted according to the patient's renal function. No patients received alternative prophylactic agents, such as dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine.

In this study, the index date (day 0) was defined as 14 days after the initiation of RTX or CYC as induction therapy. This 14‐day lead‐in period was established to ensure a stable study population and sufficient time for evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX. Patients who developed serious infection or censored during the lead‐in period were excluded. Exposure to TMP‐SMX was determined using two approaches (Supplementary Figure 2). First, an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) design was used in which each patient was classified into the prophylaxis group if he/she received the prophylactic TMP‐SMX at the index date. In the ITT analysis, classified patients remained in their original group regardless of later treatment changes. Second, a time‐varying analysis (ie, as‐treated) was performed in which each person‐day observation was classified according to whether the patient received prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In this approach, patients were able to dynamically transit between exposed and unexposed categories without restriction, defining consecutive periods of exposure or nonexposure as episodes. In both analyses, observation for all patients started on the index date and continued until either death, loss to follow‐up (defined as no visit for more than 6 months since the last visit), or 52 weeks from the index date, whichever occurred first.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus… [^115XkE9U]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and immune-mediated injury to multiple organ systems, including the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, and kidney systems. Approximately 3. 4 million people worldwide have received a diagnosis of SLE. These classification criteria include both clinical factors, such as fever, cytopenia, rash, arthritis, and proteinuria, which may be indicative of lupus nephritis; and immunologic measures, such as SLE-specific autoantibodies and low complement levels. Approximately 40% of people with SLE develop lupus nephritis, and an estimated 10% of people with lupus nephritis develop end-stage kidney disease after 10 years.

The primary goal of treatment is to achieve disease remission or quiescence, defined by minimal symptoms, low levels of autoimmune inflammatory markers, and minimal systemic glucocorticoid requirement while the patient is treated with maintenance doses of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications. Treatment goals include reducing disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and organ damage due to the disease or treatment toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine is standard of care for SLE and has been associated with a significant reduction in mortality. Treatments in addition to hydroxychloroquine are individualized, with immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclophosphamide, typically used for treating moderate to severe disease. Three SLE medications were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration: belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

Conclusions and Relevance Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with immune-mediated damage to multiple organs and increased mortality. Hydroxychloroquine is first-line therapy and reduces disease activity, morbidity, and mortality. When needed, additional immunosuppressive and biologic therapies include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, voclosporin, and anifrolumab.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^112RmuaH]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) infection risk and prophylaxis — Infection is a leading cause of death in patients with LN, and infection-related deaths are more common during the initial phase of management following exposure to intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Antibiotic-related adverse drug reactions are not infrequent in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with an early survey reporting 31% sulfonamide allergy and one-fifth of these patients reporting worsening of SLE with intolerance. In SLE receiving prophylaxis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) adverse drug reaction occurred in only 9.4% in a Thai retrospective series that included 132 patients with connective tissue diseases, whereas a Japanese retrospective study reported a drug allergy rate of 41.9% with conventional dosing but only 10.7% with gradual introduction over a 9-day period. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a severe complication in immunosuppressed patients that can result in fatality, and prophylaxis should be actively considered taking into account a patient's allergic diathesis. The rate of Herpes zoster is 2–10 times higher in SLE than in healthy controls, the role of antiviral prophylaxis is uncertain, available vaccines include Zostavax and Shingrix, and in general live vaccines should be avoided in immunosuppressed subjects.

### Acute vesiculobullous eruption in lupus patient on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^114MuJdj]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Administer rituximab
B. Increase prednisone dose
C. Initiate dapsone
D. Resume TMP-SMX
E. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)

Answers:
A. Administer rituximab – Incorrect. Rituximab can be effective in SLE and bullous SLE, but should follow the first-line treatment (dapsone) due to cost and immunosuppression.
B. Increase prednisone dose – Incorrect. High-dose prednisone is also effective for bullous SLE, but is not the first-line treatment, and long-term administration is associated with infections and osteoporosis.
C. Initiate dapsone – Correct. Dapsone effectively treats bullous SLE by targeting neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst. Additionally, dapsone serves as a second-line alternative for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Prior to starting dapsone, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase should be evaluated, and complete blood count and liver function tests should be monitored after treatment initiation.
D. Resume TMP-SMX – Incorrect. Unlike dapsone, TMP-SMX is associated with phototoxicity and does not serve as an effective treatment for bullous SLE.
E. Start IVIg – Incorrect. IVIg is an option for severe or refractory bullous SLE. The associated high cost and limited access make IVIg a third or fourth-line treatment option.

Dose reductions to reach equivalent exposure

In Table 4, the doses required to reach equivalent exposure compared with a patient with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 (the median eGFR in the study population) are shown and the lowest dose that leads to > 25% of the simulated patients reaching concentrations above the upper limit of the target range. In Figures S6 and S7 the exposure reached with different dosing regimens is visualized. The dose reductions were similar for all simulated eGFRs for both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for patients with a low eGFR. To reach equivalent exposure a dose reduction of 16.7% is needed in patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and of 33.3% for an eGFR of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. For CRRT the dose adjustments were not similar for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. A 100% increased dose is needed for sulfamethoxazole, while for trimethoprim no dose adjustments are required. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases with increasing dose for patients with reduced renal function.

Isospora belli infection — acute management and initial therapy lists supportive care and preferred antimicrobial regimens. Fluid and electrolyte support in patients with dehydration (AIII) and nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients (AIII) are noted. Preferred therapy for acute infection is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) QID for 10 days (AII), or TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) BID for 7–10 days (BI). One approach is to start with TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) BID regimen first, and increase daily dose and/or duration (up to 3–4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). IV therapy is listed for patients with potential or documented malabsorption. For patients with sulfa intolerance, alternative therapy for acute infection includes pyrimethamine 50–75 mg PO daily + leucovorin 10–25 mg PO daily (BIII), or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID for 7 days (CI).

### Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and serious infections in granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with rituximab [^1136fsvJ]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure

We defined TMP-SMX prophylaxis as any ≥ 28-day prescription, to exclude intermittent antibiotic prescriptions for infection. 'Baseline' prophylaxis was a TMP-SMX prescription dispensed either in the 30 days prior to index rituximab (with enough supply to overlap the index date) or in the 30 days following the index rituximab. In the primary analysis, individuals could have received TMP-SMX before the index date, but we excluded those individuals in sensitivity analyses, and in analyses of adverse events. We considered TMP-SMX as a time-varying exposure, permitting a ≤ 30-day refill gap between prescriptions for continuous use. A period of TMP-SMX exposure ended 30 days after the last TMP-SMX dose (estimated based on days' supply) if no new prescription was dispensed, to allow for intermittent non-adherence leading to leftover supply, and/or potential remaining drug effects. A new exposure period started if a new ≥ 28-day TMP-SMX prescription was dispensed later during cohort follow-up, and the intervening person-time between prescriptions was considered unexposed.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^112Wx9eX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We used a central computer generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

Treatment of PJP

The median initial corrected treatment doses were 11.6 mg TMP/kg/day (range 7.9–14.8 mg TMP/kg/day) and 16.7 mg TMP/kg/day (range 15.1–20 mg TMP/kg/day) in the reduced- and standard-dose groups, respectively (Figure 2). Nineteen of 33 patients (58%) in the standard-dose group were subject to dose reductions after the first 2 full days of treatment that resulted in a mean corrected daily dose of TMP-SMX of ≤ 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. In only 1 of 80 patients in the reduced-dose group, the dose was increased so that the mean corrected daily dose TMP-SMX was > 15 mg/kg on days 3–7. This patient was not considered to be a case of clinical failure according to the documentation in the medical record by the treating physician, and the reason for the dose increase was unknown.

Figure 2.
Distribution of initial corrected treatment doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the reduced- and standard-dose groups. The initial treatment dose corresponds to the mean daily dose/kilogram of trimethoprim (TMP) (corrected for renal function) on the first and second day of a full daily treatment. The horizontal lines represent the median values, boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile of each group's distribution of values, and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum values.

Details regarding PJP treatment and duration of TMP-SMX are presented in Table 2. Eighty patients received < 21 days of TMP-SMX treatment (median, 14 days [range, 2–20 days]). The reason for TMP-SMX discontinuation was clinical cure in 58 of 80 patients (median TMP-SMX duration, 14.5 days [range, 7–20 days]), adverse reactions and switch to a second-line drug in 6 of 34 patients (median TMP-SMX duration, 8 days [range, 6–12 days]), and death in 16 of 80 patients.

Guidelines

A. Approximately 5% of patients develop Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) after renal transplantation if they do not receive prophylaxis. PCP is a severe disease, with a very high fatality rate. Therefore, all renal transplant recipients should receive PCP prophylaxis. The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), at a dose of 80/400 mg/day or 160/800 mg every other day, for at least 4 months. Patients who are treated for rejection should receive TMP-SMX prophylaxis for 3–4 months. B. In the case of TMP-SMX intolerance, aerosolized pentamidine (300 mg once or twice per month) is an alternative for prophylaxis. C. The first-line treatment of PCP is high-dose TMP-SMX. Patients with a PaO2 of < 70 mmHg initially should be treated parenterally, and the administration of additional steroids should be considered.

Cystoisosporiasis — TMP-SMX dosing regimens and adjustments: Three studies in people with HIV in Haiti have demonstrated the effectiveness of various TMP-SMX treatment regimens. Based on the initial studies, the traditional treatment regimen has been a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII). In another study, TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily for seven days was also effective, and although published experience with using twice-daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) is limited, one approach would be to start with this regimen but increase the daily dose and/or the duration of therapy (up to 3 to 4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption or for those who cannot tolerate oral medications.

Analysis

We described cohort characteristics at the index date, overall and according to baseline TMP-SMX use, using means (with.) for continuous data and counts and percentages for categorical data. Differences between baseline TMP-SMX users and non-users were assessed using the 95% CI for the difference in mean or proportion.

Crude incidence rates for serious infections, outpatient infection visits and PJP infections were calculated overall and according to person-time with and without TMP-SMX exposure, by dividing the number of events occurring during exposed and unexposed periods by the sum of person-time exposed and unexposed to TMP-SMX during follow-up, respectively.

Kaplan–Meier curves plotted serious infection-free survival among individuals exposed and unexposed to baseline TMP-SMX. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of time-varying TMP-SMX use with serious infection, considering the following potential confounders and effect modifiers for inclusion in multivariable models: age, sex, insurance (Commercial vs Medicare/Medicaid), disease duration (dichotomized as < or > 6 months), baseline prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, hospital admission or serious infection (defined previously) in the 6 months before rituximab, induction rituximab (vs maintenance), use of other immunosuppressants in the 6 months before rituximab, and having one of the following conditions: interstitial lung disease, obstructive lung disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or dialysis. The final multivariable model included age, sex, prednisone use, as well as any variables significantly associated with serious infection in univariable analyses (i.e. a hazard ratio [HR] with 95% CI excluding the null). We performed the same procedure for the secondary outcomes of outpatient infection and PJP.

To assess the association of TMP-SMX with adverse events potentially attributable to TMP-SMX, we included individuals with no prescriptions for TMP-SMX prior to the index date. Crude incidence rates were computed during person-time exposed and unexposed to TMP-SMX. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of time-varying TMP-SMX with adverse events, considering the following potential confounders or effect modifiers: age, sex, insurance status (Commercial vs Medicare/Medicaid), induction rituximab (vs maintenance), disease duration > 6 months (vs ≤ 6 months), hospitalization in the 6 months prior to rituximab, baseline prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, and having ≥ 1 co-morbidity. The multivariable model included age, sex, prednisone use and covariates significantly associated with adverse events in univariable analyses.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113xQthG]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV pediatric PCP prophylaxis — TMP-SMX dosing and resistance considerations: For trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX, and in patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dose may be necessary. TMP-SMX, preferably given daily, also is effective in preventing toxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections. Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutations in Pneumocystis from humans have been observed with TMP-SMX and dapsone prophylaxis, suggestive of possible drug resistance, but studies for clinical correlates have not provided conclusive results, and prolonged TMP-SMX prophylaxis for PCP is associated with the emergence of TMP-SMX resistant bacterial species due to selective pressure, a point to be considered in managing bacterial infections in patients receiving prophylaxis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111VvEHB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment — first-line TMP-SMX and adjuncts: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI), and outpatient oral TMP-SMX is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease (AI); lower doses may also be effective though randomized controlled data are unavailable, and the dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens, and leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on outcome is uncertain. Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). In moderate-to-severe disease — defined by room air PaO2 < 70 mmHg or A-a (alveolar-arterial) gradient ≥ 35 mmHg — patients should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).

### Incidence of hyponatremia with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exposure [^114VVtx3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used at high doses for treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections. Trimethoprim is structurally related to the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride and has been associated with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia through blocking of epithelial sodium channels in the distal nephron. The incidence of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients treated with high-dose TMP-SMX is unknown.

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of all hospitalized patients who received high-dose TMP-SMX (n = 235) from January 2012 to July 2014. Patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, baseline hyponatremia, and those on other medications associated with hyponatremia were excluded. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 136 mEq/L.

Results

Analysis was restricted to 76 unique patients who received more than 8 mg/kg/d of TMP for ≥ 3 days. Mean starting serum sodium at time of TMP-SMX initiation was 138.4 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Fifty-five patients (72.3%) developed hyponatremia while on therapy, of which 43.6% (n = 24) were cases of serum sodium < 130 mEq/L. Mean sodium at the time of nadir was 131.6 ± 5.1 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was noted, on average, 5.5 days after initiation of therapy, with more severe hyponatremia development among African American patients. Urine sodium concentrations were available for 40.0% (22/55) of incident hyponatremia cases, with mean urinary sodium of 104.8 ± 55.9 mEq/L. Hyponatremia often resolved within 3 weeks of drug discontinuation.

Conclusions

There is a high incidence (72.3%) of hyponatremia associated with the use of high-dose TMP-SMX among hospitalized patients. This is an overlooked and potentially reversible cause of hyponatremia.

Randomisation and masking

We randomly allocated patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive TMP-SMX with either placebo doxycycline (hereafter referred to as placebo) or doxycycline, which were identical in appearance. Randomisation and masking was done at the coordinating centre at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Bangkok, Thailand). The allocation sequence was computer generated with a block size of ten and was stratified by study site. To achieve treatment concealment, TMP-SMX and either placebo or doxycycline were dispensed into sequential, identical, tamper-proof bottles for each participant for 20 weeks. The study drug bottles were labelled with sequential code numbers and distributed to the study sites. TMP-SMX, placebo, and doxycycline were manufactured and provided by the Siam Pharmaceutical Company (Bangkok, Thailand). All patients and study investigators were unaware of the drug allocation throughout the study. The randomisation codes remained sealed until after data collection, data cleaning, and completion of a masked analysis.

Procedures

All patients received TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for a minimum of 20 weeks. TMP-SMX (80 mg TMP and 400 mg SMX) tablets were prescribed using a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 40 kg or estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–29 mL/min, 160 mg TMP and 800 mg SMX twice daily; bodyweight of 40 kg to 60 kg, 240 mg TMP and 1200 mg SMX twice daily; and bodyweight greater than 60 kg, 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX twice daily. Doxycycline or placebo was prescribed as a 100 mg tablet to be taken twice daily. Patients were advised to repeat the dose if vomiting occurred within 30 min of their taking the tablet. The minimum duration of 20 weeks was based on a combination of current practice and available evidence. The recommended duration for oral antimicrobials is 12–20 weeks in Thailand, and 3–6 months in Australia, a discrepancy that shows the uncertainty about the optimum duration. Findings from a retrospective study in Thailand showed that treatment for longer than 12 weeks was associated with lower risk of relapse. We therefore chose to use 20 weeks as a minimum duration rather than 12 weeks or an empirically chosen point between the two.

### An evaluation of hyperkalemia and serum creatinine elevation associated with different dosage levels of outpatient trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with and without concomitant medications [^115pbXZz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse events associated with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for outpatient infections, particularly those likely caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, have not been adequately characterized.

Objective

Describe hyperkalemia and acute renal injury associated with high-dose TMP-SMX.

Methods

An electronic medical record database retrospective study was conducted of outpatients receiving high-dose or low-dose TMP-SMX, comparing the incidences of hyperkalemia and acute renal injury.

Results

Of 6162 patients, more developed hyperkalemia (3.06% vs 1.05%, P < .0001) or acute renal injury (1.99% vs 0.700%, P = 0.0001) in the high-dose TMP-SMX group. Variables independently associated with hyperkalemia included age > 58 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.86–7.0; P < .0001), concomitant receipt of an NSAID (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.02–2.79; P = 0.044) or an ACE inhibitor (OR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.06–5.14; P < .0001), high-dose TMP-SMX prescribed (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.85–4.60; P < .0001), and baseline elevated serum creatinine (OR = 45.1; 95% CI = 21.7–93.2; P < .0001). Variables independently associated with acute renal injury included concomitant receipt of an ACE inhibitor (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.01–5.24; P = 0.048) or a potassium supplement (OR = 4.10; 95% CI = 1.45–10.1; P = 0.010), high-dose TMP-SMX prescribed (OR = 3.70; 95% CI = 1.70–8.12; P = 0.0012), and baseline elevated serum creatinine (OR = 2110; 95% CI = 724–7980; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Serum creatinine and potassium concentrations should be monitored in outpatients receiving high-dose TMP-SMX.

### Protective effect of different doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for early severe infections among patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis [^114eDodo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To analyse the protective effect of different doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) prophylaxis for early severe infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis (AAV), considering time-varying changes.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we assessed the protective effect of TMP/SMX within the first 6 months of diagnosis among Japanese patients with AAV. We included 250 consecutive patients with AAV who were admitted to our hospital. The protective effect of TMP/SMX against early severe infections was verified using Cox regression analysis along with potential confounding factors. Cox regression with inverse probability treatment weights for early severe infections was also performed as a sensitivity analysis.

Results

Cox regression analysis showed that the reduced TMP/SMX exposure group had a significant protective effect against early severe infections (standard-dose group versus no TMP/SMX group: hazard ratio [HR] 0.393, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.139–1.11, p = 0.077; reduced-dose group versus no TMP/SMX group: HR 0.418, 95%CI: 0.216–0.807, p = 0.009), even when considering time-dependent changes. In the sensitivity analysis, the reduced-dose group still had a significantly lower risk of early severe infections than the no TMP/SMX group (HR = 0.393, 95%CI: 0.177–0.873, p = 0.022). During follow-up, 18.0% of the patients discontinued TMP/SMX due to side effects.

Conclusions

TMP/SMX is highly effective in preventing severe infections among patients with AAV despite the high incidence of side effects. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose of TMP/SMX for preventing severe infections, especially considering renal impairment.

### Successful use of fludrocortisone for the management of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced hyperkalemia: a case series [^112Jbu1n]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a widely used antibiotic for various infections but is often associated with hyperkalemia. In this case series, we evaluate the use of fludrocortisone (FCS), a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, in managing TMP-SMX-induced hyperkalemia. Six patients treated with TMP-SMX for infectious indications developed hyperkalemia within 2–6 days of therapy initiation. The administration of FCS at doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily effectively stabilized potassium levels in all patients within 1–2 days, allowing most to continue the TMP-SMX treatment. These findings highlight the efficacy of FCS in mitigating TMP-SMX-induced potassium retention, thereby providing a safe and practical approach to maintaining essential antibiotic therapy.

Results

Between Oct 24, 2005, and Feb 1, 2010, we randomly assigned 626 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis to receive either oral TMP-SMX plus placebo (n = 311), or oral TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (n = 315; figure 1). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups (table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 40 patients (6%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment before enrolment, and 357 patients (57%) were deemed to need longer than 14 days of parenteral treatment before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight between 40 kg and 60 kg and received 320 mg of TMP with 1600 mg of SMX twice daily (table 1).

Trial profile

TMP-SMX = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

Follow-up was completed in Feb 21, 2011, 1 year after we enrolled the last patient. 618 patients (99%) had at least one follow-up assessment. Median follow-up duration was 17 months (IQR 13–28) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 19 months (16–31) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (p = 0.06). Total duration of follow-up was 536 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 583 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group.

We recorded no between-group difference in our primary analysis for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (p = 0.64; table 2). Non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo was shown because the upper bound of the 95% CI was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin (one-sided p = 0.01; figure 2). The probability of having culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis within 1 year of enrolment was 3% and within 3 years of enrolment was 10% (figure 3). Of 37 culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis cases, seven (19%) occurred during 20 weeks of oral treatment, 17 (46%) occurred during the first year of follow-up, four (11%) occurred between year 1 and year 2 of follow-up, and nine (24%) occurred after 2 years.

### Acute vesiculobullous eruption in lupus patient on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115zCktG]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical case

A 48-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and class IV lupus nephritis treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg/day and prednisone 20 mg/day starting 1 month earlier presented with a new, acute-onset vesiculobullous eruption. This vesiculobullous eruption started two weeks after initiating trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. She described the eruption as burning and painful.

Examination revealed erythema with overlying tense, straw-colored bullae on the dorsal distal upper extremities, periocular skin, vermillion lips, and lateral tongue (Fig 1). Periorbital edema and conjunctival injection were noted. Both Nikolsky and Absoe-Hansen signs were negative.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous pemphigoid (BP)
B. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus
C. Erythema multiforme
D. Pemphigus vulgaris
E. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome

Answers:
A. BP – Incorrect. While BP can present with tense straw-colored bullae and negative Nikolsky sign, BP typically occurs in elderly patients with a medication history notable for dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (sitagliptin), PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), loop diuretics (furosemide), and penicillin-type antibiotics.
B. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus – Correct. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most likely diagnosis in a patient with a history of SLE and the above clinical presentation. Bullous SLE is a rare cutaneous manifestation of SLE that presents with tense, straw-colored bullae. Intraoral blisters erosions and blistering along the vermillion lip are often observed.
C. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. While the distribution of lesions on acral and oral mucosal sites is characteristic of erythema multiforme, the morphology of the lesions shown in Fig 1 is not consistent with the targetoid appearance of erythema multiforme.
D. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. Pemphigus vulgaris presents with flaccid bullae and a positive Nikolsky sign due to acantholysis.
E. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome – Incorrect. Although Stevens-Johnson syndrome is commonly associated with preceding TMP-SMX use, clinical findings typically include severe mucous membrane involvement, dusky patches and flaccid bullae, large erosions, and positive Nikolsky sign.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected children — TMP-SMX (cotrimoxazole) is the drug of choice (AI); the prophylactic dosage is 150 mg/m2 body surface area per day TMP and 750 mg/m2 body surface area per day SMX (approximately 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight per day TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight per day SMX; dosing based on TMP component), administered orally either every day with 5.0–10 mg/kg body weight/dose TMP and 25–50 mg/kg body weight/dose SMX, on 3 consecutive days per week with 2.5–5.0 mg/kg body weight/dose TMP and 12.5–25 mg/kg body weight/dose SMX twice per day, or every other day; the total daily dose should not exceed 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX, and in patients with impaired renal function a reduced dose may be necessary; TMP-SMX, preferably given daily, also is effective in preventing toxoplasmosis and some bacterial infections, and TMP alone has little, if any, anti-Pneumocystis activity.

### Clinical analysis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in children with malignant disease [^1126y1uU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Current treatment guidelines from both ECIL and the American Society of Transplantation recommend TMP/SMX as first-line therapy (trimethoprim 15–20 mg/kg and sulfamethoxazole 75–100 mg/kg) for ≥ 14 days, with a preference for 21 days in most cases. Important precautions include avoiding concurrent methotrexate administration and screening for G6PD deficiency. The target peak concentration of TMP-SMX is suggested to be 100–200 mg/L, but we are currently unable to monitor this concentration to confirm therapeutic efficacy. While echinocandins target only the cyst form of P. jirovecii, combination therapy with TMP/SMX and caspofungin has shown promise. In our cohort, to ensure therapeutic efficacy, 90% received this combination therapy, consistent with recent evidence suggesting superior outcomes compared to TMP/SMX monotherapy. However, studies on caspofungin in combination with TMP-SMX as first-line therapy are currently limited to retrospective analyses and case reports, and further prospective and large-scale studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^117K1edK]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case-control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The primary outcome was a one-year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person-years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person-years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP-SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP-SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP-SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP-SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) — in children, adverse reactions include rash, hematologic abnormalities, GI complaints, hepatitis, and renal disorders; data from a PACTG study of HIV-infected children at high risk of PCP receiving TMP-SMX for a median of 3 years showed 28% had a rash, 9.3% had neutropenia, 8.8% had thrombocytopenia, and 2.2% had anemia, and none were fatal or irreversible reactions. With any significant adverse effect, TMP-SMX should be withheld until the reaction has subsided, and based on adult randomized clinical trials, unless the reaction has been life-threatening, TMP-SMX prophylaxis can be resumed in children, preferably by beginning with low desensitizing daily doses and gradually increasing to therapeutic dosing (CIII); in adults, 75% of patients affected tolerated re-challenge with TMP-SMX. The overall frequency of adverse reactions appears to be lower in HIV-infected children than in adults; approximately 15% of children have substantial adverse reactions to TMP-SMX; if an urticarial rash or SJS occurs, TMP-SMX should be discontinued and not re-administered (AIII).

### Adverse reactions to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole in AIDS [^116XoizC]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a woman with AIDS who developed tremor, acute pancreatitis, and elevated serum creatinine levels while receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX).

Case Summary

A 37-year-old Puerto Rican woman with AIDS, HIV nephropathy, and a recent history of disseminated histoplasmosis presented with fever, nonproductive cough, pancytopenia, and elevated transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels. Serum creatinine was near her baseline level of 2.9 mg/dL. Treatment was started with amphotericin B lipid complex for histoplasmosis and intravenous TMP/SMX for presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Two days later, the patient developed a high-frequency tremor and severe abdominal pain, and serum creatinine increased to 5.6 mg/dL. TMP/SMX was discontinued, after which the patient's symptoms resolved within 72 hours and serum creatinine returned to baseline levels.

Discussion

A high incidence of adverse reactions to TMP/SMX has been reported among HIV-infected persons. Toxic sulfamethoxazole metabolites may elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Trimethoprim can inhibit renal creatinine secretion, leading to high serum creatinine levels. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, causing decreased dopamine production, which may lead to parkinsonian symptoms. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the adverse effect and TMP/SMX.

Conclusions

The high frequency and wide range of potential adverse effects associated with the use of TMP/SMX in HIV-infected persons require that clinicians consider drug toxicity as a cause of new symptoms in patients receiving this medication.

### Trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and serious infections in granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with rituximab [^117LhiAy]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, female sex was negatively associated with serious infection (aHR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.5, 1.1), similar to a prospective Japanese AAV study (aHR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.9), yet we observed a positive association with outpatient infection (aHR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Both biological sex and gender might influence hospitalization for infection. In a review of 84 studies, lower respiratory tract infections were more frequent and severe in males, while upper respiratory infections more frequently affected females. Female sex was also associated with more rapid B cell repopulation following rituximab in AAV, which may confer protection against severe infection. Gender (as a sociocultural factor) may influence health behaviours, utilization or treatment decisions. Importantly, even as we previously found that females were less likely to be dispensed TMP-SMX prophylaxis than males (adjusted odds ratio 0.57; 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), TMP-SMX appeared similarly protective in both sexes. Future studies should evaluate how sex and gender-associated variables influence AAV treatment and outcomes.

Although currently recommended in several guidelines, the evidence supporting prophylaxis during rituximab maintenance (when absolute infection risks are lower), is less certain. In the subgroup of our cohort with no baseline prednisone exposure, the effect estimates for serious infection were inconclusive, but were similar to the primary analysis. In patients with a low serious infection risk, the absolute benefit afforded by TMP-SMX may be small. Furthermore, although TMP-SMX prophylaxis significantly reduced pneumonia risk in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), guidelines recommend against TMP-SMX prophylaxis solely for this purpose in HIV, with one potential concern being antimicrobial resistance. Finally, in line with prior studies, we observed a potential association between TMP-SMX exposure and adverse events. Recent hospitalization (i.e. within 6 months of index rituximab), prior serious infection and having ≥ 1 co-morbidity were associated with serious infection, yet prior hospitalization and co-morbidity were also associated with potential adverse events. Clinicians should consider an individual's infection risk when deciding whether to continue prophylaxis. Defining infection risk groups and evaluating patient preferences could assist with prophylaxis decisions during rituximab maintenance.

### Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole [^1136cCih]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Infusion-related reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim infusion can cause local irritation and inflammation in cases of extravasation.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- **Metabolic acidosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains propylene glycol as a solvent, which at high doses can cause metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.
- **Sulfite sensitivity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions in susceptible patients.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: a matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

Methods

We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada involving adults ≥ 66 years of age newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58 999) matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

Results

A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58 999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58 999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin {RR 3.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31]}. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44 and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15 (95% CI 2.82–3.51)] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.34–1.53)].

Conclusions

The 14-day risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia was higher in patients newly treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and the risk was highest in patients with a low eGFR.

Glucocorticoid-sparing therapies in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome — calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) dosing and monitoring include cyclosporine 4 to 5 mg/kg/d (starting dose) in two divided doses with a target 12 hour trough level of 60–150 ng/ml (50–125 nmol/l), and tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/d (starting dose) given in two divided doses with a target 12 hour trough level of 5–10 ng/ml (6–12 nmol/l); CNI should be continued for at least 12 months as most children will relapse upon discontinuation and CNI levels should be monitored during therapy to limit toxicity. In younger children (< 6 years of age), the daily dose of cyclosporine can be divided into 3 doses (every 8 hours), and at present the most reasonable dosing of a CNI may be to titrate the individual patient to achieve the desired effect on proteinuria, balancing dose escalation against serum creatinine and reducing the dose if serum creatinine increases but does not plateau or increases over 30% of baseline, with discontinuation if the serum creatinine level does not fall after dose reduction.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^113ZPKwe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim pharmacokinetics show large IIV in hospitalized patients, and are affected by eGFR and CRRT. The current recommended dose for PCP treatment leads to adequate exposure in general, but there is a risk of both under and over‐exposure. Dose reductions for patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 are suggested to reach similar exposure compared with patients without renal insufficiency. The risk of concentrations above the target range increases in patients with lower eGFR and high cotrimoxazole doses. Notably, in patients treated with CRRT, sulfamethoxazole clearance is increased. Therefore, doubling the sulfamethoxazole dose is needed to reach similar exposure to patients without renal failure. Monitoring with TDM is necessary in patients treated with CRRT as high doses might lead to N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation.

### Time-dependent effect of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on the incidence of serious infections in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a target trial emulation study [^112x52q5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrated that the prophylactic use of TMP‐SMX significantly lowered the risk of serious infection in patients with AAV with the greatest impact observed during the initial 180 days of the observation period. The benefits were more evident in patients with additional risk factors for serious infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale cohort study to focus on factors affecting the prophylactic effect of TMP‐SMX.

Patients with AAV are more susceptible to serious infections than the general population because of disease‐specific organ damage, potential long‐term effects of widespread inflammation, and medications used to treat AAV. The increased susceptibility to infection is most significant in the early phase because of intensive immunosuppressive treatment; thus, infection is one of the common causes of early mortality in patients with AAV. This study confirmed these reports, as indicated by the 1‐year incidence of serious infection after induction therapy using RTX or CYC of 30.5 per 100 person‐years, with a significant fatality rate, which suggests that decreasing the risk of serious infections is crucial for improving treatment outcomes in patients with AAV.

Despite its significant impact on the prognosis of patients with AAV, there have been few studies on optimal management to minimize the risk of infection. Notably, some recent studies have suggested that prophylactic TMP‐SMX could prevent serious infections in patients with AAV as well as PJP, which is consistent with the results of this study, in which the prophylaxis group was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in serious infections compared with the control group. The mechanisms underlying the reduced incidence of serious infections in patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX remain unclear. However, TMP‐SMX has broad‐spectrum antimicrobial effects against bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which may allow the removal of pathogens in patients with AAV. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that prophylactic TMP‐SMX was associated with a lower incidence of bacterial infections in patients with HIV infection. Although the antimicrobial effect of TMP‐SMX has not been thoroughly investigated in patients without HIV, our results strongly suggest that prophylactic TMP‐SMX provides additional benefits in patients with AAV beyond reducing the risk of PJP. Furthermore, we demonstrated a favorable safety profile of prophylactic TMP‐SMX, with the NNH for serious ADR being significantly higher than the NNT to prevent one case of serious infection. This risk‐benefit assessment indicates that prophylactic TMP‐SMX should be administered to patients with AAV receiving induction immunosuppressive treatment.

The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the initial treatment dose of TMP-SMX: (1) reduced-dose group receiving 7.5–15 mg/kg/day of TMP component; and (2) standard-dose group receiving > 15–20 mg/kg/day of TMP component. The initial treatment dose was defined as the mean daily dose/kg of TMP, corrected for renal function, on the first and second day of PJP treatment (the dose referred to from hereafter). The first treatment day corresponds to the first calendar day of full treatment, generally meaning the day after the start of treatment. This approach was chosen to better reflect the true TMP-SMX exposition as the initial TMP-SMX dose often was adjusted (either increased or decreased) during the first days of treatment. The corrected dose was calculated as the actual given dose multiplied by a correction factor according to creatinine clearance (CrCl): ≥ 50 mL/minute, factor 1; 30 to < 50 mL/minute: factor 1.5; 15 to < 30 mL/minute: factor 2.0; < 15 mL/minute or hemodialysis: factor 3.0.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^115yeoVz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The clearance of sulfamethoxazole in patients on CRRT exceeds the median clearance of the patients in this study. For trimethoprim, the clearance in patients on CRRT was comparable to patients with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m 2. N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole is not rapidly eliminated by CRRT. The rapid clearance of sulfamethoxazole and the difference between sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole clearance has been previously reported in small case series. One possible explanation is that tubular reabsorption, which is significant for sulfamethoxazole, does not occur in patients treated with CRRT. When filtrated via CRRT, sulfamethoxazole will be cleared directly from the body via the ultrafiltrate. This lack of tubular reabsorption of sulfamethoxazole could explain the increased clearance observed in patients treated with CRRT. In contrast, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole, being reabsorbed to a lesser extent, is less affected by CRRT. This change in pharmacokinetics presents a risk of rapid clearance of active sulfamethoxazole in CRRT patients, while N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulates, potentially leading to underexposure or toxicity. The clinical impact is unclear as the exposure to trimethoprim is sufficient in these patients. To prevent toxicity, therapy for PCP could be started with TID 1,920 mg and doses can be subsequently individualized using early TDM. For other infections requiring lower daily doses and thereby a lower risk of N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole accumulation, doubling the cotrimoxazole dose should be considered to reach similar exposure of sulfamethoxazole compared with patients with a normal renal function.

The results show that in a median patient with an eGFR of 70 mL/minute/1.73 m 2, a dosing regimen of b.i.d. 2,400 mg resulted in exposure in 89.0% of the patients within, 3.0% below and 8.0% above the target range for trimethoprim and 68.7% within, 10.9% below and 20.4% above for sulfamethoxazole and N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole. TID 1,920 mg resulted in 90.9% within, 1.8% below, and 7.3% above for trimethoprim and 63.0% within, 6.2% below, and 30.8% above the target range for sulfamethoxazole.

In patients with a reduced eGFR, the likelihood of reaching concentrations above the target range increases. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate simulated dose reductions for the target concentrations for the treatment of PCP. For patients with an eGFR of 10 mL/minute/1.73 m 2, all dosing regimens except b.i.d. 960 mg resulted in > 25% of the patients with sulfamethoxazole or N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations above the upper limit of the target range, while b.i.d. 960 mg leads to 54.2% of patients with sulfamethoxazole underexposure.

Shortly thereafter she was evaluated by infectious disease for a worsening productive cough over several months and was found to have Nocardia pneumonia with pulmonary nodules seen on CT scan. She was subsequently started on a six-month course of twice daily TMP-SMX 2DS and cefpodoxime 200 mg. Prior to starting the antibiotic regimen, a non-contrast CT scan showed a new 6 mm non-obstructing stone in the left lower renal pole. A repeat CT scan three months later (2 months after starting TMP-SMX) revealed interval growth of the renal stone to 9 mm; intervention with URS was scheduled. But in the interim, the patient became symptomatic and presented for emergency treatment. Physical exam was significant for mild pelvic tenderness. Labs were significant for creatinine of 1.58 mg/dL and hematuria but no infection. Her pain was managed, and she was discharged. Repeat CT, now 4 months after starting TMP-SMX, revealed a developing staghorn calculus in the left renal pelvis measuring up to 4 cm (Fig. 1) and an obstructing conglomerate of calculi in the left lower ureter measuring up to 7 mm with mild upstream hydroureteronephrosis. Within 2 days, the patient underwent left URS and LL of the renal pelvis and ureteral stones. During the procedure, stone fragments were retrieved via basket and sent for analysis; results demonstrated 80% N 4 -acetyl-sulfamethoxazole with remaining constituents calcium oxalate (12% monohydrate and 5% dihydrate) and 3% calcium phosphate carbonate apatite (composition was assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy at Dianon Systems in Oklahoma City, OK). The origin of the fragments that were analyzed, whether from the larger renal pelvis stone or from the ureteral conglomerate of stones, was not documented and is thus unknown. Afterward, the patient passed multiple amber-colored stone fragments (Fig. 2).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^115rRyxc]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy "has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus". Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with "a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58)", and "Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low". Safety screening notes that "Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine". For ocular monitoring, guidelines "do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment", and "yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; dose of hydroxychloroquine > 5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise". Retinopathy risk is quantified as "affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be > 20% when treatment duration is over 20 years". Dosing guidance states, "The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels", and "a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare". Renal adjustment is specified: "In patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥ 25%". Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine "can be an expensive drug in some countries", and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, "but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted".

### The role of trimethoprim / sulfametoxazole in reducing relapses and risk of infections in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a meta-analysis [^112hMpDR]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies including a control group regarding the role of trimethoprim/sulfametoxazole (TMP/SMX) in reducing the relapse rate in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and the risk of infections in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception until 15 January 2020 to identify controlled studies assessing the role of TMP/SMX in reducing the rate of relapse in patients with GPA (primary outcome) and the number and/or severity of infections in patients with AAV (secondary outcome). Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies and extracted data. Cumulative risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI were calculated using a random effect meta-analysis.

Results

Eight studies were selected out of 2907 records. Seven studies (520 patients) (of which two were RCTs) assessed the role of TMP/SMX in the relapse rate in patients with GPA. TMP/SMX was not associated with a reduced risk of relapse (RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.51, 2.55; I2 = 78.5%; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis according to the dose of TMP/SMX (960mg twice daily vs three times/week) confirmed the results. One retrospective cohort study (192 patients) was identified demonstrating a significant reduction of severe infections in patients with AAV receiving prophylaxis with TMP/SMX in association with rituximab.

Conclusion

TMP/SMX was not associated with a reduced risk of relapse in patients with GPA. TMP/SMX might be useful in the reduction of infectious complications.
