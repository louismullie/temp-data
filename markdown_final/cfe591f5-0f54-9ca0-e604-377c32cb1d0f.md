## Question

codeine syrup dose and course for dry cough

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about codeine syrup dose and course for dry cough. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether codeine-containing cough medicines are even indicated. Then, I should verify the age-based contraindications and boxed warnings. Next, I will review the evidence for efficacy in acute and chronic cough. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 variability. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and outline alternatives and monitoring if, despite everything, codeine is considered in select adults.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because I need to ensure I'm not recommending something that is contraindicated. Multiple FDA communications and labels restrict codeine-containing cough and cold medicines to adults 18 years and older, with explicit contraindications in children under 12 years and strong warnings against use in adolescents 12–18 years, particularly after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, due to risks of respiratory depression and death [^115h69cf] [^111aM7NB] [^115YAz7m] [^115PfuUF].

> Wait, let me verify the age cutoffs and the rationale. The FDA's 2017 and 2018 safety communications contraindicated codeine for cough in children under 12 and extended restrictions to all adolescents under 18 for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines, citing serious respiratory depression and fatalities, including cases linked to CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolism and post-tonsillectomy contexts [^112jgV2i] [^112QFweG]. I should also confirm that professional societies align with this stance; CHEST and AAFP recommend avoiding codeine for pediatric cough and note insufficient evidence for routine adult use in acute viral cough, reinforcing a conservative approach [^1135GYQg] [^111cYDA2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adult use; I need to check the efficacy data. High-quality evidence for codeine as an antitussive in acute viral cough is limited and mixed, with randomized trials showing no consistent benefit over placebo in adults with acute cough, and systematic reviews concluding insufficient evidence to support routine use of codeine or other OTC antitussives for acute cough [^115j1sKh] [^111cYDA2]. In chronic cough, including COPD, codeine has not shown superiority to placebo in objective cough reduction, which further weakens the case for routine use [^111wVKRe].

> I should double-check the pharmacology and safety profile. Codeine is a prodrug converted to morphine by CYP2D6, with substantial interindividual variability; ultra-rapid metabolizers can have markedly higher morphine exposure, explaining unpredictable respiratory depression even at standard doses, and this variability underpins the pediatric restrictions and cautions in adults with respiratory disease or concomitant CNS depressants [^1142ZzGH] [^112QFweG]. Common adverse effects include constipation, nausea, sedation, and respiratory depression, and the risk is amplified in older adults, those with lung disease, or when combined with benzodiazepines or alcohol [^115vRe4b] [^111ofXhR] [^116dtkxj].

> Let me consider the specific adult scenarios where codeine might still be considered. Guidelines for cancer-related cough suggest low-dose opioids, including codeine 30–60 mg/day, as a trial when cough is refractory and benefits outweigh risks, but this is a distinct, severe symptom context and not generalizable to acute viral cough in otherwise healthy adults [^116riXH8] [^1115u26w]. For acute viral cough, the balance of benefit and risk does not favor codeine, and non-opioid options or supportive care are preferred [^111cYDA2] [^1178JuvT].

> I will now examine practical dosing and duration if, despite the above, a clinician elects to use codeine in a carefully selected adult after assessing etiology and risk. Typical adult antitussive dosing referenced in palliative and specialty contexts is 30–60 mg per dose, not exceeding about 120–240 mg/day, with treatment limited to the shortest effective course, often 3–5 days, and reassessment if cough persists beyond 5 days for alternative diagnoses; this aligns with opioid stewardship principles and the lack of durable benefit in acute cough [^116riXH8] [^111ofXhR]. I should confirm that this is framed as a last-resort, off-label approach in adults, not standard care [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the cough is chronic or refractory? I need to ensure we are not masking a treatable cause. Persistent cough warrants evaluation for asthma, UACS, GERD, ACE inhibitor use, or other etiologies, and evidence-based options include dextromethorphan, low-dose morphine in adults with chronic refractory cough, gabapentin for unexplained chronic cough, or inhaled corticosteroids when indicated; codeine should not be first-line in these scenarios either [^114P88QZ] [^11567hYH] [^112aZVVt].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives for acute viral cough. Dextromethorphan has modest, dose-dependent antitussive activity and is a reasonable non-opioid option in adults, while honey has supportive evidence for pediatric acute cough and can be considered in children over 1 year; simple demulcent syrups may also provide short-lived symptomatic relief via local effects, and these strategies avoid the respiratory risks inherent to opioids [^114VPfkg] [^1178JuvT] [^111mS94h]. I need to ensure I emphasize that no antitussive reliably shortens illness duration, so expectations should be managed [^115j1sKh].

> I should confirm monitoring and counseling points if codeine is nevertheless prescribed. Counsel on constipation, drowsiness, and respiratory symptoms; avoid use with other CNS depressants, benzodiazepines, or alcohol; reassess in 5 days if cough is unresponsive; and consider CYP2D6 phenotype risk, especially if there is a history of unusual opioid sensitivity or adverse effects, even though routine testing is not standard in practice [^111ofXhR] [^112QFweG]. In older adults or those with lung disease, start low, go slow, and monitor closely for respiratory depression [^111ofXhR].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and safety-first. Codeine syrup is not indicated for acute viral cough in adults due to limited efficacy, significant adverse effects, and regulatory restrictions in children and adolescents; if considered at all in adults with refractory cough after etiologic assessment, use the lowest effective dose, typically 30–60 mg per dose not exceeding about 120–240 mg/day, for the shortest duration with close follow-up, and prioritize non-opioid alternatives and diagnosis-directed therapy instead [^111cYDA2] [^116riXH8] [^111ofXhR].

---

Codeine syrup is **not recommended for dry cough** because of limited efficacy and significant risks, especially in children and adolescents [^1135GYQg] [^113KthhB]. If used in adults, the typical dose is **10–20 mg every 4–6 hours**, not exceeding 120 mg in 24 hours, for a short course of 3–5 days with reassessment if cough persists [^116riXH8] [^111ofXhR]. Codeine is **contraindicated in children under 12 years** and in adolescents 12–18 years after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy due to risk of respiratory depression [^1135GYQg] [^111aM7NB]. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid with other CNS depressants, and monitor for sedation, respiratory depression, and constipation [^117KxBVT] [^116dtkxj] [^115vRe4b].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to cough suppression

Codeine is a **prodrug** converted to morphine by CYP2D6; morphine suppresses cough by acting on the medullary cough center [^112zCb5r]. However, CYP2D6 activity varies widely, causing unpredictable morphine exposure and adverse effects, including respiratory depression [^1142ZzGH].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in dry cough

Evidence for codeine in acute viral cough is **limited and inconsistent** [^115j1sKh]. A Cochrane review found no evidence that codeine is more effective than placebo for acute cough, and a study in COPD showed no superiority of codeine over placebo in reducing cough frequency [^111wVKRe]. Thus, routine use for dry cough is not supported.

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

If codeine syrup is used in adults, the following dosing is **generally referenced**:

| **Clinical context** | **Recommended dose** | **Frequency** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adult dry cough | 10–20 mg | Every 4–6 hours | 120 mg |
| Short-term course | 3–5 days | N/A | N/A |

---

These adult dosing ranges are consistent with palliative-care guidance for cough suppression, though **individualize to the lowest effective dose** and reassess if cough persists beyond 5 days [^116riXH8] [^111ofXhR].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

Codeine has **significant safety concerns**, including:

- **Respiratory depression**: Risk is higher in children, ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers, and when combined with CNS depressants [^1135GYQg] [^112QFweG].
- **Sedation and dizziness**: Common and dose-related [^112Ep5eV].
- **Constipation**: Very common with repeated dosing [^115vRe4b].
- **Dependence and misuse**: Risk increases with prolonged use or high doses [^1152kxMY].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Codeine is **contraindicated or requires caution** in the following situations:

- **Children under 12 years**: Contraindicated due to respiratory depression risk [^1135GYQg] [^115pBENA].
- **Adolescents 12–18 years**: Contraindicated after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy [^1135GYQg] [^115pBENA].
- **Ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers**: Higher risk of morphine toxicity [^112QFweG].
- **Respiratory conditions**: Use with caution in asthma, COPD, or other respiratory diseases [^111ofXhR].
- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Use only if benefits outweigh risks; monitor infants for sedation and respiratory depression [^113FLCv2].

---

## Alternative treatments for dry cough

Given codeine's limited efficacy and safety concerns, **consider alternatives**:

- **Dextromethorphan**: A non-opioid antitussive with modest evidence in adults [^114VPfkg].
- **Honey**: Effective for nocturnal cough in children over 1 year [^1178JuvT].
- **Demulcent syrups**: Simple linctus or glycerin-based syrups can soothe the throat [^111mS94h].
- **Address underlying causes**: Treat reflux, allergies, or other contributors to chronic cough [^112AHCKh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines advise against routine codeine use for cough: CHEST recommends avoiding codeine-containing medications in children and notes **insufficient evidence** for routine adult use in acute cough [^1135GYQg] [^111cYDA2]. The FDA restricts codeine-containing cough medicines to adults 18 years and older due to safety concerns [^115h69cf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for dry cough due to limited efficacy and significant risks.
- **Adult dosing**: If used, 10–20 mg every 4–6 hours, not exceeding 120 mg/day, for 3–5 days.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for sedation, respiratory depression, and constipation.
- **Contraindications**: Children under 12 years, adolescents after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers.
- **Alternatives**: Prefer dextromethorphan, honey, demulcent syrups, and treat underlying causes.

---

Codeine syrup has a **limited role** in dry cough management; reserve it for select adults after weighing risks and benefits, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with close monitoring.

Codeine use in children — Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety communication and advisory panel actions are outlined as follows: On July 1, 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication investigating risks of codeine-containing medicines for coughs and colds in children younger than 18 years because of serious adverse effects, including slowed or difficult breathing. An FDA advisory panel met in December 2015 and, by an overwhelming majority vote, recommended that the use of codeine in the treatment of cough in all children up to 18 years of age should be contraindicated, with final agency action on this recommendation pending at this time; alternative therapies for cough have recently been reviewed.

Background

Cough in children is a commonly experienced symptom that is associated with increased health service utilisation and burden to parents. The presence of chronic (equal to or more than four weeks) cough in children may indicate a serious underlying condition such as inhaled foreign body or bronchiectasis. Codeine (and derivative)-based medications are sometimes used to treat cough due to their antitussive properties. However, there are inherent risks associated with the use of these medications such as respiratory drive suppression, anaesthetic-induced anaphylaxis, and addiction. Metabolic response and dosage variability place children at increased risk of experiencing such side effects. A systematic review evaluating the quality of the available literature would be useful to inform management practices.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of codeine (and derivatives) in the treatment of chronic cough in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to 8 June 2016), EMBASE (1974 to 8 June 2016), the online trials registries of the World Health Organization and ClinicalTrials.gov, and the bibliographic references of publications. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered studies eligible for analysis when: the participant population included children aged less than 18 years with chronic cough (duration equal to or more than four weeks at the time of intervention); and the study design evaluated codeine or codeine-based derivatives against placebo through a randomised controlled trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine eligibility against a standardised criteria, and we had a pre-planned method for analysis.

Main Results

We identified a total of 556 records, of which 486 records were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. We retrieved the remaining 70 references in full to determine eligibility. No studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review, and thus we found no evidence to support or oppose the use of codeine or derivatives as antitussive agents for chronic cough in children. While chronic cough is not the same as acute cough, systematic reviews on the use of codeine efficacy for acute cough in children conclude an overall lack of evidence to support or oppose the use of over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing codeine (or derivatives) for treatment of acute cough in children. The lack of sufficient evidence to support the use of these medications has been consistently reaffirmed by medical experts in international chronic cough guidelines and by governing medical and pharmaceutical authorities in the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Due to the lack of sufficient evidence to support efficacy, and the known risks associated with use - in particular the increased risks for children - these medications are now not recommended for children less than 12 years of age and children between 12 to 18 years with respiratory conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has highlighted the absence of any randomised controlled trials evaluating codeine-based medications in the treatment of childhood chronic cough. Given the potential adverse events of respiratory suppression and opioid toxicity, national therapeutic regulatory authorities recommend the contraindication of access to codeine in children less than 12 years of age. We suggest that clinical practice adhere to clinical practice guidelines and thus refrain from using codeine or its derivatives to treat cough in children. Aetiological-based management practices continue to be advocated for children with chronic cough.

Use of codeine as an antitussive agent in children — Codeine is also prescribed as an antitussive agent and is still available in over-the-counter cough and cold formulations without a prescription from outpatient pharmacies in 28 US states and the District of Columbia; however, neither the value of suppressing cough nor the effectiveness of codeine in children with acute illnesses has been shown. In April 2015, the European Medicines Agency announced that codeine should not be used to treat cough and cold in children younger than 12 years and further cautioned that codeine is not recommended in children and adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age with compromised respiratory function.

The efficacy of antitussive drugs

Codeine

Codeine is often considered the archetypal antitussive, yet there is little evidence that it has any intrinsic activity of its own. In man, codeine acts as a prodrug, being converted to morphine in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6. Morphine has been used for centuries in the treatment of cough and indeed has been demonstrated to have efficacy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Experience in chronic cough suggests that morphine is only efficacious in about a third to half of patients, others having no effective relief of the symptom. Whether this is also true in the acute bronchitis and cough in common cold is unknown.

Despite its widespread use, there is very little clinical evidence supporting significant antitussive activity for orally administered codeine. In some studies, it has been reported to have no effect on cough challenge or on the sensation of urge to cough, whereas others have reported a small but significant effect. In two well-designed studies investigating cough due to URTIs, codeine 30 mg, followed by 4 days of dosing four times a day, had no effect greater than placebo syrup, either on an objective initial cough recording or on a subsequent self-reported cough. In the second study, oral codeine (50 mg) was compared with placebo syrup in 82 participants in a parallel group design using all three measures of cough assessment; again, no effect greater than that of placebo was observed.

The cytochrome system which converts the prodrug codeine to morphine is highly polymorphic. Some patients are fast metabolisers converting the majority of codeine to morphine at first pass through the liver. In others, the slow metabolisers, very little codeine is converted. Thus, when prescribing codeine to an individual patient who has not previously used the drug, it is impossible to predict the degree of opiate effects or indeed side effects. Both overdosing or underdosing occurs in an unpredictable fashion. The European Medicines Agency has restricted the use of codeine in children for precisely this reason while the FDA are currently reviewing the use of codeine cough-and-cold medicines in children. Children who are fast metabolisers were observed to have dangerous levels of sedation and suppression of respiration. We believe that this is not just a problem in the young and that the dangers of codeine far outweigh the limited evidence of efficacy in clinical studies.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^111mS94h]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Perhaps the most important consideration when using combination products is the possibility of a drug interaction, and therefore well-conducted safety and efficacy studies are required. Only studies of adequate power should be considered. As an example, Mizoguchi et al studied 432 participants in a placebo-controlled study of a syrup containing 15 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide, 7.5 mg doxylamine succinate, 600 mg paracetamol and 8 mg ephedrine sulfate. The primary end point (composite of nasal congestion/runny nose/cough/pain relief scores 3 hours postdosing) showed a highly significant beneficial effect in the group given active treatment (p = 0.0002). Each individual symptom score also showed statistically significant improvement 3 hours postdosing (p ≤ 0.017). The next morning active treatment continued to show clinically and statistically significant benefits (p ≤ 0.003). Evidence of benefit with the test syrup was also seen in the higher score for overall night-time relief (p < 0.0001) and greater satisfaction on sleep (p = 0.002). Adverse events were reported at half the frequency in the active treatment group compared with the placebo and there were no reported events > 1% in the population. We suggest that only by the use of large well-controlled and well-designed studies such as this can combination products be recommended with any surety.

Recommended treatment strategy

URTIs are benign and self-limiting, and therefore patients with milder symptoms can be safely reassured.
The demulcent effect of a simple linctus/syrup such as a home remedy of honey and lemon may bring a significant reduction in the cough, albeit of a relatively short duration. This strategy should be the first choice, particularly in children.
In isolated dry or minimally productive cough, dextromethorphan 30–60 mg per day has the best evidence base.
When other symptoms are also present, a combination product containing adequate amounts of dextromethorphan should be considered.
A cough persisting longer than 2 weeks requires additional diagnostic evaluation.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116iS6ce]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Sediflù syrup exerts positive effects by reducing the main disturbances associated with day-time and night-time cough scores, shortening the duration of coughs in children. Cough severity and frequency are significantly reduced from day 1 of treatment with Sediflù, which showed a very good safety profile. Based on these findings, Sediflù syrup can be considered a valid treatment for cough management, especially in younger children with upper respiratory tract infections, thanks to the creation of a protective mechanical barrier on oropharyngeal mucosa and its complementary physicochemical effects.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^115Wgf3o]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cough is the most common symptom for which medical advice is sought. It is responsible for over 50% of new patient attendance in primary care and is the major source of consultation in pharmacy practice. Indeed, since symptomatic therapy is the mainstay of management of this generally benign and self-limiting illness, the pharmacist is the key player in the treatment of this condition.

Unfortunately, much of the over-the-counter (OTC) therapy currently recommended throughout Europe is based on custom and practice and is not supported by clinical studies of sufficient quality to meet the standards of modern evidence-based medicine. Here we review the diagnosis and therapeutic options available for the treatment of what is perhaps the most common ailment to afflict mankind.

### How does rhinovirus cause the common cold cough? [^113KthhB]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

A postviral cough is generally unresponsive to conventional pharmacological intervention, but has shown limited responsiveness to the anticholinergic drug, tiotropium, which leaves a major hole in our therapeutic armamentarium. Currently, treatment merely consists of dampening the inflammatory response with the use of antiinflammatories (such as naproxen), and cough suppressants (codeine-containing products and dextromethorphan), in the hope of reducing the frequency, severity and transmission of cough. Opiates, although commonly prescribed, are not generally recommended for viral cough due to their poor efficacy and significant adverse effect profile.

The multiple mechanisms described above provide a confusing and inter-related 'soup' of potential therapeutic targets, dissecting which, are the key players involved in this common affliction that will be challenging. We suggest that modulation of the afferent neuronal hypersensitivity will provide the most fruitful target in what is essentially a benign and self-limiting disease. Other strategies, such as systemic immune modulation, run the risk of generating unforeseen off-target effects. The rewards for understanding the mechanism of viral-induced cough will have enormous impact on human morbidity.

### Codeine: time to say "No" [^116VVbD6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Codeine — pediatric adverse events and FDA reviews indicate risk for life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression based on case reports since 2004 and an FDA review of reports from 1969 through May 2012 identifying 13 cases attributed to therapeutic codeine (pediatric deaths n = 10; respiratory depression n = 3), with 7 published and ages 21 months to 9 years. The majority occurred during the postoperative period after adenotonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy with the recommended codeine dose and dosing interval. Additional reports in 2013 described three pediatric deaths (10-year-old after orthopedic surgery, 4-year-old after tonsillectomy, and a child given codeine as a cough suppressant at a higher dose than prescribed). A later FDA review of 1965 to 2015 data in children who used codeine or any codeine-containing products found 64 cases of severe respiratory depression and 24 codeine-related deaths, including 21 in children younger than 12 years.

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1155RhJn]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — opioid antitussives for cough in adult lung cancer states that for patients with lung cancer experiencing cough for whom treatment with an opioid derivative is indicated, we suggest pholcodine or hydrocodone (where available) or dihydrocodeine or morphine, while codeine is less preferred because of its greater side effect profile. Morphine should be used if the cough is not suppressed by other opioid derivatives or other means, including other centrally acting antitussives such as dextromethorphan, and if patients are already receiving morphine, sometimes increasing the dose by 20% may be helpful, although this is based on experience rather than evidence. For nonspecific cough in the palliative stage, we suggest a bedtime dose of codeine/pholcodine or morphine to help suppress cough and induce an undisturbed sleep, although again there is no evidence for this.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^114DaZ6t]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The study was conducted between November 2020 and March 2021, when the use of masks was compulsory in Spain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to this fact, cough episodes have been milder and less frequent than in previous years. This is the main limitation of this study, since the cough-associated disturbances of the children enrolled were lower than expected. In addition, children in the Sediflù group had baseline scores for all the variables studies slightly higher than those present in the placebo group. Finally, although the inclusion criteria only allowed for the enrollment of children with a cough duration between 3 and 7 days, specific information on the duration of the cough in each comparison group was not collected. Children with COVID-19 were not included in the study; however, no other tests were performed. Despite these limitations, Sediflù syrup proved to be effective in reducing all the variables associated with both diurnal and nocturnal coughing in children and confirmed its safety profile as well as its tolerability. Further studies should be conducted with a larger sample size and a wider age range of the participants.

### Triprolidine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (pseudodine C) [^1152kxMY]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Like other medications containing a narcotic, Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup is controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration. It is classified under Schedule V.

Codeine can produce drug dependence of the morphine type, and therefore it has a potential for being abused. Psychic dependence, physical dependence and tolerance may develop on repeated administration.

The dependence liability of codeine has been found to be too small to permit a full definition of its characteristics. Studies indicate that addiction to codeine is extremely uncommon and requires very high parenteral doses.

When dependence on codeine occurs at therapeutic doses, it appears to require from one to two months to develop, and withdrawal symptoms are mild. Most patients on long-term oral codeine therapy show no signs of physical dependence upon abrupt withdrawal.

### Interventions for cough in cancer [^111vGyJW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in Issue 9, 2010 on "Interventions for cough in cancer". Cough is a common symptom in patients with malignancies, especially in patients with lung cancer. Cough is not well controlled in clinical practice and clinicians have few management options to treat it.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of interventions, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, (other than chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy) in the management of cough in malignant disease (especially in lung cancer).

Search Methods

For this update, we searched for relevant studies in CENTRAL and DARE (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; AMED and CINAHL to 9 June 2014. In addition, we searched for ongoing trials via the metaRegister of controlled trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials (quasi-experimental trials and trials where there is a comparison group but no mention of randomisation) in participants with primary or metastatic lung cancer or other cancers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all studies for inclusion, and extracted data from all included studies independently before reaching consensus. A third review author arbitrated on any disagreement. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the heterogeneity of the studies.

Main Results

For the original version of the review, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and examined either brachytherapy, laser or photodynamic therapy (eight studies) or a variety of pharmacological therapies (nine studies). Overall, there was an absence of credible evidence and the majority of studies were of low methodological quality and at high risk of bias. Brachytherapy in a variety of doses seemed to improve cough in selected participants, suggesting that possibly the lowest effective dose should be used to minimise side effects. Photodynamic therapy was examined in one study and, while improvements in cough were observed, its role in relationship to other therapies for cough was unclear. Some indication of positive effect was observed with morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, levodropropizine, sodium cromoglycate and butamirate citrate linctus (cough syrup), although all studies had significant risk of bias. For this update, we did not identify any additional trials for inclusion. Two ongoing trials were identified but no study results were available.

Authors' Conclusions

No new trials were included since the publication of the original version of this review, while 11 new studies that were identified were eventually excluded from this review. Therefore, our conclusions remain unchanged. No practice recommendations could be drawn from this review. There is an urgent need to increase the number and quality of studies evaluating the effects of interventions for the management of cough in cancer.

### Triprolidine and pseudoephedrine hydrochlorides and codeine phosphate syrup (triacin-C) [^112zCb5r]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Codeine: Codeine probably exerts its antitussive activity by depressing the medullary (brain) cough center, thereby raising its threshold for incoming cough impulses.

Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with a therapeutic dose reaching peak antitussive effectiveness in about 2 hours and persisting for 4 to 6 hours. Codeine is rapidly distributed from blood to body tissues and taken up preferentially by parenchymatous organs such as liver, spleen and kidney. It passes the blood brain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk.

The drug is not bound by plasma proteins nor is it accumulated in body tissues. Codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine and norcodeine, each representing about 10 percent of the administered codeine dose. About 90 percent of the dose is excreted within 24 hours, primarily through the kidneys. Urinary excretion products are free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (under 4%) and hydrocodone (< 1%). The remainder of the dose appears in the feces.

Triprolidine: Antihistamines such as triprolidine hydrochloride act as antagonists of the H1 histamine receptor. Consequently, they prevent histamine from eliciting typical immediate hypersensitivity responses in the nose, eyes, lungs and skin.

### Cough, codeine and confusion [^114n9Ddv]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Codeine is widely prescribed in clinical practice with over the counter (OTC) preparations of codeine freely available for consumption typically as a component of remedies for the common cold/cough. We describe the first reported case of acute confusional state in a previously healthy 14-year-old girl ultimately attributed to inappropriate codeine use. The usage of codeine in the paediatric setting has been highlighted in recent years with many reported deaths — mostly due to respiratory depression. The risks associated with codeine usage may be particularly unnecessary with OTC cough suppressants as evidence of efficacy is absent. Finally, codeine dependence is a common problem among adults and has been reported locally and internationally among adolescents. The combination of lack of efficacy, risk of acute intoxication and dependence, suggests that the use of OTC codeine preparations may be unwarranted.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^1166HPTV]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Misuse of cough medications — dextromethorphan and promethazine with codeine: The report notes that both prescription and OTC products contain active ingredients that may be abused, that high doses of dextromethorphan can produce euphoria and dissociative effects, and that ingestion of large doses of dextromethorphan cough syrup is referred to as "robo-tripping". It also describes "Purple drank", in which promethazine with codeine syrup is combined with soda, fruit candy, or even alcohol, producing relaxation, euphoria, and intoxication, and warns that these medication misadventures can lead to serious complications and even death.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^111Fwi2u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of Sediflù, a medical device containing active herbal ingredients, on nocturnal and diurnal persistent coughs in children, with a duration of 3 to 7 days. Children with a dry and/or productive cough were enrolled in this prospective, interventional, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study. Clinical efficacy was assessed through the evaluation of the soothing action of Sediflù against dry and/or productive coughing, both at night and during the day, and other effects of coughing associated with quality of sleep: frequency, child's quality of sleep, parental quality of sleep and severity. Treatment with Sediflù improved both night-time and day-time cough scores from day 2. The diurnal score also improved significantly in the Sediflù group at days 3 and 7. Sediflù syrup can be considered a valid treatment for cough management in younger children with upper respiratory tract infections, shortening the cough duration.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^116C3ZhR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Acute cough is perhaps the most common symptom to afflict mankind. While it is usually a benign and self-limiting illness, the amount of morbidity endured as a consequence of acute viral respiratory tract infection has enormous consequences on humanity. By the use of evidence-based treatment, significant improvement in patient outcomes can be achieved. While there are many gaps in the knowledge of our therapy in acute cough, our improved understanding of the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity brings rational treatment choices a step closer. A greater understanding of how drugs may normalise this aberrant reflex, thus bringing relief and shortening the duration of illness, may be of enormous benefit to the whole of society.

### What has dry cough in common with pruritus? Treatment of dry cough with paroxetine [^116vSn5C]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Distressing persistent dry cough is commonly the consequence of sensitization of the cough reflex. A slight and transient peripheral nociceptive impulse, such as bronchitis, may be perpetuated for weeks because of sensitization of the cough reflex. Cough usually can be inhibited by opioids, but some types of cough can be out of opioid control or even be induced by opioids. We describe here a series of 5 patients with dry cough that did not respond to codeine. Because two of these patients also suffered with pruritus, paroxetine was tried. In all patients, cough ceased within hours to days. The only observed adverse effect was sleepiness in the first days of therapy. Paroxetine should be investigated as antitussive in cases of opioid-resistant cough. The putative mechanism of action of paroxetine on pruritus and rough is discussed.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (promethazine with codeine) [^111ofXhR]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.6 Risks with Use in Other At-Risk Populations

Unresponsive Cough

The dosage of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease

The use of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including codeine, one of the active ingredients in Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.

Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution and when Promethazine with Codeine Oral Solution is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Triprolidine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (pseudodine C) [^111eq43C]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car, operating dangerous machinery or hazardous appliances.
Patients with a history of glaucoma, peptic ulcer, urinary retention or pregnancy should be cautioned before starting Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup.
Patients should be told not to take alcohol, sleeping pills, sedatives or tranquilizers while taking Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup.
Antihistamines may cause dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, weakness, nausea, headache or nervousness in some patients.
Patients should be told to store this medicine in a tightly closed container in a dry, cool place away from heat or direct sunlight and out of the reach of children.
Nursing Mothers - refer to following section titled "Nursing Mothers".

Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup should not be used by persons intolerant to sympathomimetics used for the relief of nasal or sinus congestion. Such drugs include ephedrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine and phenylpropanolamine. Symptoms of intolerance include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, difficulty in breathing, tenseness, muscle tremors or palpitations.

Codeine may be habit-forming when used over long periods or in high doses. Patients should take the drug only for as long, in the amounts, and as frequently as prescribed.

Caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people. These people are ultra-rapid metabolizers and are more likely to have higher-than-normal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which can result in overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing. In most cases, it is unknown if someone is an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer.

Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers. These higher levels of morphine in breast milk may lead to life-threatening or fatal side effects in nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call 911 (or local emergency services).

### Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings [^115j1sKh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is a common symptom. Many health practitioners recommend non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) medicines as a first-line treatment for cough, but there is little evidence as to whether these drugs are effective.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral over-the-counter cough preparations for acute cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 3, 2004); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2004); and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (December 2003, http://www.update-software.com/National/nrr-frame.html). We also searched personal collections of references and reference lists of articles. We wrote to study investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information on further published or unpublished studies. There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral OTC cough preparations with placebo in children and adults suffering from acute cough in ambulatory settings. We considered all cough outcomes (such as frequency and severity, continuous and categorical data, using different ways of measurement). The second outcomes of interest were adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators screened potentially relevant citations independently. Any differences at any stage of the review were resolved by discussion. We also extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. We contacted investigators for additional information and performed quantitative analysis when appropriate data were available.

Main Results

Twenty four trials (17 in adults, seven in children) involving 3,392 people (2,876 adults and 516 children) were included. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN ADULTS: 1. Antitussives: Six trials compared antitussives with placebo. Codeine was no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms. Two studies favoured dextromethorphan over placebo, whereas a third did not show an effect. Moguisteine was no more effective than placebo apart from a reduction of cough in a subgroup of participants with more severe night cough. 2. Expectorants: Two trials compared guaifenesin with placebo. In the larger study, 75 per cent of participants taking guaifenesin stated that the medicine was helpful compared to 31 per cent in the control group. In the second study, both groups showed improvement with respect to cough frequency and severity, with no statistically significant differences between groups. 3. Mucolytics: One trial compared a mucolytic with placebo. Active treatment reduced cough frequency and symptom scores on day four and eight. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo. Antihistamine-decongestants were significantly more effective than placebo in one of the studies, whereas the other did not show any difference between the study groups. 5. Other drug combinations: Three studies compared combinations of drugs other than antihistamine-decongestant with placebo. Two studies were effective in reducing cough symptoms, and one study showed relief at night but not during the day. 6. Antihistamines: Three trials compared antihistamines with placebo. Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. RESULTS OF STUDIES IN CHILDREN: 1. Antitussives: Antitussives were no more effective than placebo (one study) 2. Expectorants: No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. 3. Mucolytics: The results of one trial favoured active treatment over placebo from day four until day 10. 4. Antihistamine-decongestant combinations: Two studies showed no difference between antihistamine-decongestant combinations and placebo. 5. Other drug combinations: One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups. Compared to placebo, both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46 per cent and 56 per cent of children compared to 21 per cent of children in the placebo group. One study compared an antitussive/bronchodilator combination in children, which showed no difference between the treatment groups. 6. Antihistamines: In one trial that tested antihistamines active treatment was no more effective than placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes between studies. The numbers of studies in each group were small, and studies often showed conflicting results. Effect sizes in many studies were unclear and it is questionable as to whether all of the positive results are clinically relevant. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, as identification of effective self-care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Identification of ineffective preparations could avoid costs for consumers and health care providers.

### Treatment of the common cold [^112RPNsf]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The common cold is a viral illness that affects persons of all ages, prompting frequent use of over-the-counter and prescription medications and alternative remedies. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms (e.g., cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea). Dextromethorphan may be beneficial in adults with cough, but its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in children and adolescents. Codeine has not been shown to effectively treat cough caused by the common cold. Although hydrocodone is widely used and has been shown to effectively treat cough caused by other conditions, the drug has not been studied in patients with colds. Topical (intranasal) and oral nasal decongestants have been shown to relieve nasal symptoms and can be used in adolescents and adults for up to three days. Antihistamines and combination antihistamine/decongestant therapies can modestly improve symptoms in adults; however, the benefits must be weighed against potential side effects. Newer nonsedating antihistamines are ineffective against cough. Topical ipratropium, a prescription anticholinergic, relieves nasal symptoms in older children and adults. Antibiotics have not been shown to improve symptoms or shorten illness duration. Complementary and alternative therapies (i.e. Echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however, humidified air and fluid intake may be useful without adverse side effects. Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^113dBeVa]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

It has proven to be more difficult to obtain subjective evidence for the effect of dextromethorphan in acute cough resulting from common cold infection. As with so much of the literature assessing subjective antitussive effects with a wide range of products, many of the studies are far from rigorous in their execution, using small numbers of participants, often with diverse disease and measuring symptoms without a validated methodology. Perhaps the biggest problem in any subjective measures in cough with common cold is the rapid rate of spontaneous remission in this acute illness, the large placebo effect and the demulcent effect of the syrups. In current preparations containing dextromethorphan, all of these ancillary options are used to enhance activity. Combining the three strands of evidence, it has been estimated that there is an excess antitussive activity due to dextromethorphan at the dose of 30 mg of ∼17%.

Pentoxyverine

Pentoxyverine citrate is in use as a non-opioid central acting antitussive with very little evidence of clinical efficacy, seen in poorly designed > 50 years old clinical studies. Animal studies, however, show efficacy on evoked cough by electrical stimulation or citric acid challenge. In our experience, animal studies are extremely poor at predicting clinical effectiveness of antitussives.

Butamirate

Butamirate preparations are widely used in Europe as OTC antitussives. Butamirate is thought to have a central mechanism which is neither chemically nor pharmacologically related to that of the opioid alkaloids. Butamirate also possesses non-specific anticholinergic and thus bronchodilator effects. Butamirate is claimed to be effective by the manufacturer in a number of double-blind, randomised, parallel group trials with codeine and other comparators, none of which were placebo controlled. The single placebo-controlled study remains unpublished and is held on file. The effects of butamirate on cough reflex sensitivity, as demonstrated by capsaicin inhalational cough challenge in normal participants, were recently studied in a placebo-controlled six-way randomised cross-over study with dextromethorphan as the positive control. All four doses of butamirate failed to demonstrate greater cough reflex suppression than placebo, whereas dextromethorphan was significantly effective.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^111Fm5tW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the USA and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome. However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion. In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established. However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough — despite an important sedative effect (dizziness) — especially in the USA. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

### Functional connectome-based biomarkers predict chronic codeine-containing cough syrup dependent [^113iFpDe]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Codeine-containing cough syrup (CCS) is considered among the most popular drugs of abuse in adolescents worldwide. Accurate prediction and identification of CCS dependent (CCSD) users are crucial. This study aimed to identify a brain-connectome-based predictor of CCSD using a machine learning model based on a ten-fold cross-validation logistic regression (LR) classifier.

Methods

40 CCSD users and 40 healthy control (HC) subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to construct weight functional networks. Partial correlation analysis was used to analyze relations between abnormal network metrics and clinical characteristics (BIS total scores, CCS abuse duration, and mean CCS dose) in CCSD. A ten-fold cross-validation LR classifier was used to classify CCSD users and HC subjects.

Results

The CCSD group showed significantly abnormal nodes and connections in the right posterior cingulate, right middle insula, bilateral prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. Furthermore, higher characteristic path length and lower clustering coefficient (Cp), global efficiency, and local efficiency (Eloc) were observed in the global topologies in CCSD. The abnormal global properties (Cp and Eloc) and node properties of the prefrontal cortex were significantly correlated with clinical characteristics (BIS-11 scores, CCS abuse duration) in CCSD. The LR classifier models demonstrated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and AUC of 82.5%, 82.5%, 82.5%, 76.8%, and 82.5%.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that abnormal functional connectome may be closely linked to clinical characteristics in CCSD. Functional connectome-based biomarkers can be a powerful tool for personalized diagnosis of CCSD in the future.

### Effect of codeine on objective measurement of cough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111wVKRe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Codeine is the standard antitussive treatment to which novel agents are compared. Little is known about the objective effect of any treatments on cough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objective

To quantify the effect of codeine on objective cough frequency (quantified as time spent coughing: cough seconds, cs/h), citric acid cough threshold, and subjective measures in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in COPD.

Methods

We studied 21 patients with physician-diagnosed, stable disease who complained of cough (76.9% male; mean age, 67.7 years; mean predicted FEV(1), 53.4%; median smoking history, 43.5 pack-years). Each subject performed a cough challenge (single breath, citric acid), 10-hour daytime ambulatory and overnight cough recordings, subjective cough scores, and visual analog scales at baseline and on 2 study days, 1 week apart. Codeine phosphate 60 mg or matched placebo were given, in random order, at the start of each cough recording (0 and 12 hours).

Results

Median time spent coughing at baseline was 8.27 cs/h (interquartile range [IQR], 5.94–11.67); after placebo treatment, 7.22 cs/h (IQR 4.42–10.40); and after codeine treatment, 6.41 cs/h (IQR 3.86–9.10). Codeine treatment had a significant effect on time spent coughing compared with baseline (P = 0.02) but not compared with placebo (P = 0.52). There were no significant differences in cough challenge thresholds (log concentration of tussive agent causing 2 coughs or log concentration of tussive agent causing 5 coughs) or subjective cough measures for codeine compared with placebo.

Conclusion

In this study, codeine was no more effective than placebo in patients with COPD complaining of cough.

Clinical Implications

Codeine is the antitussive agent to which we compare new treatments; however, in a group of stable patients with COPD, it had no effect on cough frequency over placebo.

### Important drugs for cough in advanced cancer [^111W47V7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Cough is a defense mechanism that prevents the entry of noxious materials into the respiratory system and clears foreign materials and excess secretions from the lungs and respiratory tract. In advanced cancer, it is a common symptom that interferes with the patient's daily activity and quality of life. Empiric treatment with antitussive agents is often needed. Two classes of antitussive drugs are available: (1) centrally acting: (a) opioids and (b) non-opioids; (2) peripherally acting: (a) directly and (b) indirectly. Antitussive availability varies widely around the world. Many antitussives, such as benzonatate, codeine, hydrocodone, and dextromethorphan, were extensively studied in the acute and chronic cough settings and showed relatively high efficacy and safety profiles. Benzonatate, clobutinol, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and levodropropizine were the only antitussives specifically studied in cancer and advanced cancer cough. They all have shown to be effective and safe in recommended daily dose for cough. In advanced cancer the patient's current medications, previous antitussive use, the availability of routes of administration, any history of drug abuse, the presence of other symptoms and other factors, all have a role in the selection of antitussives for prescription. A good knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, dosage, efficacy, and side effects of the available antitussives provides for better management.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^114VPfkg]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Dextromethorphan

In the domain of cough counting, which is widely regarded as being the gold standard for assessing cough by regulatory authorities such as the FDA, only dextromethorphan has been demonstrated to significantly suppress acute cough using objective measures. In the three studies reported by Parvez et al,451 patients were observed using acoustic cough monitors. Compared with placebo, there was a highly significant reduction in cough counts with the dose of 30 mg dextromethorphan. To demonstrate true drug effect, dextromethorphan was administered within a capsule form, thus removing the demulcent effect of syrup. This also probably explains the relatively slow onset of action seen in this study. Subsequent studies with dextromethorphan have been performed with the syrup formulation, thus combining the rapid onset of action of demulcent activity with assessed efficacy of the drug. These positive results have been confirmed in a subsequent meta-analysis.

In the second aspect of the assessment of efficacy of antitussive medications, dextromethorphan again passes. There have been multiple studies of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan performed under a variety of cough challenge conditions. Citric acid challenge is the most common modality, but recently dextromethorphan was found to be superior in the capsaicin challenge model. Dextromethorphan is revealed to be a drug with a relatively slow onset of action peaking in efficacy after ∼2 hours. Owing to its relatively slow penetration through the blood–brain barrier and consequent retention within the central nervous system, dextromethorphan may have a prolonged antitussive activity, being significantly better than placebo after as long as 24 hours. Some challenge studies also show that a higher than recommended daily dose of 30 mg may be even more efficacious against cough.

### Triprolidine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (pseudodine C) [^113FLCv2]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Nursing Mothers

The components of Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from maternal ingestion of Pseudodine™ C Cough Syrup, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Codeine is secreted into human milk. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Despite the common use of codeine products to manage postpartum pain, reports of adverse events in infants are rare. However, some women are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. These women achieve higher-than-expected serum levels of codeine's active metabolite, morphine, leading to higher-than-expected levels of morphine in breast milk and potentially dangerously high serum morphine levels in their breastfed infants. Therefore, maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants.

The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians and Arabs. Data is not available for other ethnic groups.

The risk of infant exposure to codeine and morphine through breast milk should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and baby. Caution should be excercised when codeine is administered to a nursing woman. If a codeine containing product is selected, the lowest dose should be prescribed for the shortest period of time to achieve the desired clinical effect. Mothers using codeine should be informed about when to seek immediate medical care and how to identify the signs and symptoms of neonatal toxicity, such as drowsiness or sedation, difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, and decreased tone, in their baby. Nursing mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may also experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion or shallow breathing. Prescribers should closely monitor mother-infant pairs and notify treating pediatricians about the use of codeine during breastfeeding. (See PRECAUTIONS–General-Ultra-rapid Metabolizers of Codeine)

### N-of-1 double-blind, randomized controlled trial of tramadol to treat chronic cough [^113tr9yV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic cough caused by interstitial pneumopathy can present a therapeutic dilemma, and the use of tramadol in the treatment of this symptom might be an alternative to improve the quality of life in patients. The present study describes a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial lung disease lasting 11 years who developed dry cough secondary to interstitial pneumopathy but was nonresponsive to several treatments (codeine 20 mg q6h; clobutinol 240 mg/d; and dextromethorphan 10 mg q4h).

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate, for an individual patient, the effectiveness of tramadol 50 mg compared with placebo, and whether tramadol provided any antitussive benefit.

Methods

This was an N-of-1 double-blind, randomized controlled trial of tramadol against placebo. Treatment was administered in 3 pairs, each consisting of 2 periods in which either tramadol 50 mg BID or placebo was administered for 6 days, followed by a 2-day washout period, and then the administration of the alternate for 6 days. A 2-day washout period was also carried out after pairs 1 and 2. Per pair, the sequence of treatments was randomized. Outcome measures were: the intensity of daytime and nighttime cough, assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = no cough, 5 = distressing cough); and the patient's perception regarding her health state (better, same, or worse).

Results

A 55-year-old black woman (height, 153 cm; weight, 71 kg) was in the study. In all treatment pairs, cough intensity, as reported by the patient using the VAS, was significantly lower with tramadol compared with placebo (P < 0.001), both in the daytime (2 vs 5, respectively) and at nighttime (1 vs 4). Regarding the patient's health state, in all periods in which tramadol was administered, the patient reported feeling better than when placebo was administered. At the begin- ning of pair 2, the use of rescue tramadol 50 mg (un-blinded) was permitted due to cough intensity. In the remaining treatment periods in which placebo was administered, rescue tramadol was administered, whereas rescue tramadol was not needed during the periods in which tramadol was administered.

Conclusions

Tramadol appeared to be effective in controlling cough in this patient. Because no similar report was found in the literature, further studies assessing the efficacy of tramadol as an antitussive agent are warranted.

### Prescriptions for codeine or hydrocodone cough and cold medications to US children and adolescents following US food and drug administration safety communications [^112jgV2i]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cough and cold medications containing codeine or hydrocodone are associated with misuse and addiction in adolescents and with potentially fatal respiratory depression in young children. On April 20, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication announcing a contraindication against all codeine use in children aged 0 to 11 years. On January 11, 2018, the FDA issued a safety communication announcing that codeine and hydrocodone cough and cold medications were no longer approved for use in children and adolescents aged 0 to 17 years. Using national data, we assessed whether these communications were associated with changes in prescriptions for codeine and hydrocodone cough and cold medications to children and adolescents.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (prometh with codeine) [^111Toh2U]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

BOXED WARNINGS

The combination of promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age. Concomitant administration of promethazine products with other respiratory depressants has an association with respiratory depression, and sometimes death, in pediatric patients. Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities, have been reported with use of promethazine hydrochloride in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. A wide range of weight-based doses of promethazine hydrochloride have resulted in respiratory depression in these patients.

Codeine: Dosage of codeine SHOULD NOT BE INCREASED if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease.

Codeine may cause or aggravate constipation.

Respiratory depression leading to arrest, coma, and death has occurred with the use of codeine antitussives in young children, particularly in the under-one-year infants whose ability to deactivate the drug is not fully developed.

Administration of codeine may be accompanied by histamine release and should be used with caution in atopic children.

Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure: The respiratory-depressant effects of narcotic analgesics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure. Narcotics may produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.

Asthma And Other Respiratory Conditions: Narcotic analgesics or cough suppressants, including codeine, should not be used in asthmatic patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Nor should they be used in acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.

Hypotensive Effect: Codeine may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.

Pediatric codeine use — prescribing patterns and emergency department trends — shows substantial exposure and specialty variation: Codeine was prescribed to > 800 000 patients younger than 11 years, and during 2007–2011 otolaryngologists were the most frequent prescribers of codeine/ acetaminophen liquid formulations (19.6%), followed by dentists (13.3%), pediatricians (12.7%), and general practice/family physicians (10.1%). In pediatric emergency departments during 2001–2010, the frequency of codeine administration both for pain associated with injury and for cough remained unchanged, and another longitudinal study over the same period showed overall codeine use remained constant in adolescents but has decreased in younger age groups.

5.6 Risks
with Use in Other At-Risk Populations

Unresponsive Cough

The dosage of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease

The use of Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including codeine, one of the active ingredients in Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient's respiratory function.

Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Promethazine HCl, Phenylephrine HCl and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:

Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution and when Promethazine VC with Codeine Oral Solution is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Clinical updates in women's health care summary: acute cough: primary and preventive care review [^116VAif4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute cough is a common presenting symptom in the ambulatory care setting in the United States. It imposes a significant symptom burden on patients and financial burden on the health care system. In most cases, acute cough is caused by a benign viral infection that will resolve without intervention. When needed, there are few evidence-based interventions to hasten the resolution of cough symptoms. Patients may request antibiotics or prescription cough syrups; however, these medications have little evidence of benefit and can be potentially harmful to the patient. It can be challenging for the clinician to provide reassurance while minimizing unnecessary prescriptions. The health care provider also must be alert to signs and symptoms that could signal a high-risk diagnosis that requires urgent evaluation. This monograph provides a review of the differential diagnosis for acute cough, an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of cough, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Also, it highlights warning signs and symptoms that should trigger an emergent referral and special clinical considerations in more vulnerable patient populations, including pregnant patients and geriatric patients.

### Efficacy and safety of the syrup "KalobaTUSS® " as a treatment for cough in children: a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^11645GKH]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of AOU Policlinico "G. Martino" with protocol number 95/18 on 17 December 2018. The trial was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice principles were adopted. The size of the sample to enrol in the study was calculated based on an average baseline cough score of 3 points in both groups, and an average change in the cough score of 2 points occurring in the group treated with the study product and 1 point for the placebo group (identifier: NCT04073251).

The primary outcome of interest was the change in the night-time cough score before treatment (N0) and nocturnal scores obtained after the first (N1), fourth (N4) and eighth nights of treatment, and the change in the diurnal time cough score before treatment (D0) and scores obtained after the first (D1), fourth (D4) and eighth days of treatment. The secondary outcome was the safety of the syrup when administered to children with acute cough for 8 days, which was evaluated by recording potential adverse reactions to treatment.

Cough was clinically diagnosed and evaluated by paediatricians during the first visit and successively monitored by parents, who completed a daily diary after receiving instructions from the paediatricians. The clinical efficacy of KalobaTUSS ® was assessed using a validated 6 points Likert scale that was completed by parents and chosen because it is able to establish the severity of cough and to measure the effects of the treatments. The 6 points Likert scale was used to measure the effects of the interventions on all outcomes. The scale ranged from 0 (absence of cough) to 5 (disturbing cough) points corresponding to six increasing degrees of severity for cough at night-time and six other increasing degrees of severity for cough during the day. The syrup was always administered by parents.

### Beyond the 'purple drank': study of promethazine abuse according to the European medicines agency adverse drug reaction reports [^1129zBc8]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Effects

Promethazine reported effects mostly include a range of CNS side effects, such as: confusion; disorientation; drowsiness; cardiovascular symptoms; and respiratory depression. A clear abuse potential has been observed and reported for first-generation antihistamines such as promethazine and cyclizine, due to: calming and sedating effects and enhancement of other co-ingested substances, and especially those interacting with gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), opiate and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to hallucinogenic experiences. Indeed, an anti-cholinergic toxidrome with hyperthermia, flushing, tachycardia, dry mucosa, mydriasis, urinary retention and gastrointestinal dysmotility has been described. In these cases, the mental state alteration is characterised by agitated delirium, with abnormal thoughts, irritability, distressing visual hallucinations, disorganised behaviour and insomnia. With the promethazine-codeine cough syrup, 'euphoric feelings', 'relaxation', 'slight giddiness and disorienting', and 'nice hallucinations' have been described as well (Erowid.org). Reported side-effects include drowsiness, fatigue, loss of coordination, constipation and urinary retention.

Anti-doping status — cough medications and WADA conditions in athletes: In asthma, inhaled β2-agonists list salbutamol and formoterol as "Permitteda", while terbutaline is "Prohibited"; inhaled anticholinergic agents, inhaled corticosteroids, and leukotriene antagonists are "Permitted", and oral corticosteroids are "Prohibitedb". For respiratory tract infections (RTIs), antibiotics, nasal ipratropium, nasal corticosteroids, codeine (short-term use), and dextromethorphan are "Permitted", and first-generation antihistamines with or without oral decongestant are "Permittedc". For upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), nasal corticosteroids; first-generation antihistamines with or without oral decongestant; second-generation antihistamines (nonsedative); nasal ipratropium; and topical decongestants (eg, xylometazoline, phenylephrine) are listed as "Permittedc". For exercise-induced vocal cord dysfunction (EIVCD), proton pump inhibitors are "Permitted". WADA-related notes specify "Prohibited drugs can be used by athletes only if a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) is granted", that for inhaled β2-agonists the "maximum daily doses of salbutamol and formoterol permitted are 1,600 and 54 μg/d, respectively" and that "A urinary concentration of salbutamol > 1,000 ng/mL or of formoterol > 40 ng/mL is considered by the WADA to be an adverse analytic finding unless the athlete proves the drug was used therapeutically"; for pseudoephedrine, "a maximum daily dose of 240 mg/d is permitted", the "urinary concentration of pseudoephedrine should not be > 150 μg/mL", and "Athletes must stop taking pseudoephedrine at least 24 hours before competition".

### A register-based study: cough-a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^114tPjJi]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

One of the strengths of this study is that both the Prescription and Patient registries are validated on a national level, giving them a high level of credibility and there is a strong economic incentive to use the system, since the ICD-10 coding, given at the final visit, leads to reimbursement and payment of the hospital department or specialist practice. In the country involved in this study, we have one number each, same number use in Medicare, social welfare, education, medication and use of hospital facilities. All Medicare is free of charge for all inhabitants, independent of income or not. This support, that the data could be generalized, although it is a one nation study.

The weakness in this registry-based study is, that it is not possible to identify and exclude smokers or obese patients, which are known reasons for cough and tobacco cessation has been shown to reduce cough substantially. It is a limitation in this study that surrogate measures are used to define chronic cough, both from the Prescription database and the Patient registry, even though measures were taken to eliminate reasons for acute cough through exclusion of antibiotics, cough due to ACE-inhibitors and diagnosed cancers as well as not having the exact time frame of the cough prior to final diagnosis in the Patient registry, even though in the Danish clinical setting the final diagnosis can be defined as a contact lasting for ≥ 8 weeks. One could argue that patients treated with ACE develop chronic cough, whereas only 7% had the diagnosis of cough less than 12 weeks before and were deleted from the cohort. From a clinical point of view, patients with cough, and treatment with ACE, are discontinued with the treatment to test the relationship between the two. As it is a register-based study, we cannot examine this, which might be a limitation of the study. Furthermore, another issue could be Codeine selected as a cough suppressant drug, which also have pain killer effect. We believe that this is only of minor importance, as the doses used in the analysis are equivalent to the prescribed doses for cough treatment. The number of patients, with the strengthen criteria, attachment to the department of 8 weeks and more, followed by a diagnosis of cough were reduced in number of included patients, but the distribution was similar. We therefore consider the main group as the final diagnosis and analysis.

Methodology

Study Treatment

The product administered to the treatment group is a vegetable extracts-based medical device manufactured by Sakura Italia Srl and marketed in different EU territories with their corresponding brand names (Seditus tos, Sediflù tosse, Actirub toux, and Complexe expert Sirop toux séche et grasse). It is a syrup containing eucalyptus honey, dry extract of horehound flowers (Marrubium vulgare L.), dry extract of sundew flowers (Drosera rotundifolia L.), dry extract of ivy leaves (Hedera helix L. 10% hederacoside C), and dry extract of plantain leaves (Plantago lanceolata L. 5% total phenols and 1% verbascoside). The placebo product was an inactive syrup, without the active components listed above, with the same appearance, density, brix and flavor as Seditus.

Either the treatment or the placebo was administered in 2 doses per day (morning and evening), 10 mL each, for 7 days, as recommended in the instructions for use of the marketed product.

Design

The study was conducted as a prospective, interventional, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical response and tolerance of the medical device in patients aged 5 to 11, with a dry and/or productive cough.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (acetaminophen and codeine) [^1176uEr2]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. The usual adult dosage is:

The usual dose of codeine phosphate in children is 0.5 mg/kg.

Doses may be repeated up to every 4 hours.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

It should be kept in mind, however, that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg fail to give commensurate relief of pain but merely prolong analgesia and are associated with an appreciably increased incidence of undesirable side effects. Equivalently high doses in children would have similar effects.

### FDA restricts use of prescription codeine pain and cough… [^112QFweG]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Health care professionals should be aware that tramadol and single-ingredient codeine medicines are FDA-approved only for use in adults. Consider recommending over-the-counter or other FDA-approved prescription medicines for cough and pain management in children younger than 12 years and in adolescents younger than 18 years, especially those with certain genetic factors, obesity, or obstructive sleep apnea and other breathing problems. Cough is often secondary to infection, not serious, and usually will get better on its own so treatment may not be necessary.
- An opioid pain reliever used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is usually combined with other medicines, such as acetaminophen, in prescription pain medicines.
- Single-ingredient codeine is approved for pain management in adults only.
- Also used to reduce coughing. It is frequently combined with promethazine in prescription cough-and-cold medicines and with other cold remedies in over-the-counter preparations.
- Common side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling tired, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, itching, or rash.
- In 2014, nearly 1. 9 million patients 18 years of age and younger received a dispensed prescription for codeine-containing products from U. S. outpatient retail pharmacies. Of the total pediatric patients, nearly 1. 4 million patients received codeine-containing analgesic products, and 483, 000 patients received codeine-containing cough-and-cold products.
- If patients of any age are known to be CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers, which means their bodies convert codeine or tramadol into their active forms faster and more completely than usual, they should not use codeine or tramadol.
- If a child has taken codeine or tramadol and you notice any signs of slow or shallow breathing, difficult or noisy breathing, confusion, or unusual sleepiness in a child of any age, seek medical attention immediately by taking the child to an emergency room or calling 911. Respiratory depression occurred after the children received a range of one to 18 doses, with a median of five doses. The most frequently reported codeine-containing medicines in the cases were acetaminophen with codeine used for pain, and promethazine with codeine used for cough and cold.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^116RhPcw]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The demulcent capacity is a physical action that confers a protective effect on the mucous membranes. This action can lead to decreased coughing, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies elsewhere. Furthermore, the formation of this layer on the epithelial surface or the oral cavity allows rehydration, increasing saliva production, desensitization, and a decrease in local inflammation and the cough reflex. Demulcent, emollient, and lubricant effects are reinforced by a mucoadhesive effect.

The ideal physical and chemical characteristics for a cough syrup can be obtained by a complex mixture of natural substances exerting lubricant, demulcent, and protective barrier effects. The optimal combination of ingredients to produce a humectant action is natural sweetness, such as honey, which stimulates salivation, and herbal extracts associated with complementary actions. Up to 85% of the benefit of cough syrups may be due to the physical and chemical effects of the syrup, which contribute to its demulcent action.

The syrup tested in this study is a class IIa medical device containing different active herbal ingredients: eucalyptus honey and dry extracts of horehound flowers (Marrubium vulgare L.), sundew flowers (Drosera rotundifolia L.), ivy leaves (Hedera helix L.), and plantain leaves (Plantago lanceolata L.).

The ingredients of this syrup involve a combination of actions with a potential benefit for cold symptoms. Sediflù uses 2 main mechanisms to produce the desired effects: (a) mucolytic and expectorant actions (moisturizing and fluidifying action of mucus that favors its physiological elimination) and (b) demulcent effect (soothing and protective effects against external irritants by forming a protective barrier and increasing saliva production to reduce the cough reflex). Due to this double action, it is recommended both for productive coughs (due to its mucolytic and expectorant effect, as well as its demulcent action) and for dry coughs (due to its demulcent effect).

The aim of this randomized trial was to assess the effectiveness of this medical device, as compared with a placebo, on nocturnal and diurnal persistent coughs in children, with a duration of 3 to 7 days.

### Beyond the 'purple drank': study of promethazine abuse according to the European medicines agency adverse drug reaction reports [^115mwB3Y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacological properties of promethazine

Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative and a histamine (H1) receptor antagonist that is commonly used for symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting, for allergic conditions, motion sickness and common cold, and for short-term use treatment of insomnia in adults or as a paediatric sedative. It also acts as a direct antagonist at muscarinic (M1) and dopamine (D2) receptors. Promethazine hydrochloride is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with an average of 88% of the dose absorbed after oral administration, and clinical effects appearing within 20 min after intake whilst lasting 4–6 h. The plasma half-life is approximately 7–14 h. It is classified as a first-generation antihistamine molecule which, compared with second-generation antihistamines, easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and is associated with adverse effects such as moderate/intense sedation. Thus, promethazine might be used in rapid (acute) tranquilization due to its blocking action at H1 and M receptors. Toxicity might result in severe impairment of cognitive and psychomotor functions due to central nervous system (CNS) depression/reduced levels of consciousness, and may cause fatalities.

Availability of promethazine

Promethazine is a medicinal product available on its own or in combination with other ingredients, including dextromethorphan, paracetamol and/or expectorants. With regards to promethazine availability, there are wide variations across countries. In fact, in some European countries such as France, Italy and the UK, but also outside Europe, some medicinal products containing promethazine can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC). Promethazine was restricted from an OTC status to prescription only in Denmark as of December 2014. This restriction was partly based on increasing enquiries regarding promethazine exposures to the Danish Poison and Information Centre (DPIC), highlighting its abuse potential and subsequent observations of side-effects after ingestion of standard doses. In Australia, promethazine is available as an OTC medication either alone as a tablet or as a liquid preparation or in combination with paracetamol and codeine phosphate as a syrup. In the USA, some cough preparations containing no more than 200 mg of codeine per 100 mL are considered Schedule V controlled substances, purportedly possessing the lowest potential for both misuse and development of a Substance Use Disorder (SUD).

### Clinical characteristics and drug utilisation patterns in patients with chronic cough: a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese claims database [^112AHCKh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies of chronic cough have yielded a range of prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 12%, with the rate in the general adult population likely to be in the range of 4–5%. Prevalence is higher in older individuals and in women. In Japan, the point prevalence of cough (regardless of duration) in the general population has been estimated to be 10.2%, with no difference in prevalence between men and women or between age groups. However, for chronic cough lasting ≥ 8 weeks, the prevalence was around 2%, being somewhat higher in men (2.5%) than in women (1.4%), and tending to rise with age.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic cough have been developed by professional bodies in several countries including Japan. The guidelines of the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) provide a comprehensive algorithm for the initial assessment, diagnosis, classification and treatment of chronic cough in adults. The Japanese guidelines emphasise the importance of performing an adequate diagnostic work-up in all patients with a cough lasting more than three weeks, and then treating any underlying diseases appropriately. These guidelines recommend treatment of productive cough consistent with sinobronchial syndrome with erythromycin or a related antibiotic. Dry cough with suspected allergic or atopic origin should be treated with antihistamines or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), treatment of cough-variant asthma with long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and ICS and cough associated with GERD with anti-reflux treatments. Mucolytics (expectorants) are recommended for the management of productive cough. Centrally acting (narcotic and non-narcotic) antitussives are not recommended in the Japanese guidelines due to adverse effects such as constipation and drowsiness, and due to nonspecific cough suppression which may mask the evaluation of the treatment response for any underlying diseases In addition, these medications suppress "necessary coughing" that acts as a physiological defence mechanism to eliminate foreign substances or pathogens invading the airways. Finally, in many cases these medications are ineffective. Despite a range of recommended treatments for chronic cough management, treatment satisfaction in Japan is low, at around 16.0%. Approximately 40% of surveyed individuals with chronic cough were receiving medical care for their cough, and only half of these were under care for longer than 1 month.

Consumer purchasing is frequent and costly: "In 2015, the average American household made 26 trips to retail outlets and spent approximately $338 annually on OTC products". Availability is widespread: "OTC medications are sold in 540,000 pharmacies and in > 750,000 retail locations in the United States". Market size is large: "Total sales of OTC cough, cold, and allergy products was $9.56 billion in the United States in 2015 according to Drug Store News".

### Fact or fiction: the truth behind the doctors company claims regarding licit and illicit opioids [^114yoATJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Facts or fake medical news?

The writer and educator, William Zinsser wrote, "The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn't induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead". Marcus perhaps took this to heart, captivating readers by having them consider a number of rather hyperbolic "facts". Given the lack of citations and explanation surrounding these so-called truths, we highlight key issues to enlighten those that choose the path of informed decision.

Consider these facts:
The US consumes 99% of the world's hydrocodone. The US uses hydrocodone (which milligram for milligram is presumed to be roughly equivalent to oral morphine) in combined formulations with acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and in cold products with atropine and related alkaloids. Outside North America, dihydrocodeine, a codeine derivative and weaker analgesic compared to hydrocodone, and simply morphine itself are the drugs more commonly used for relief of mild to moderate pain. Hydrocodone is marketed in Canada only in cough syrups or elixirs but is not otherwise used for pain treatment. Hydrocodone has also been used in Australia but has largely been replaced by morphine. Ignoring this exclusiveness of hydrocodone skews explanations of why the US consumes the worldwide majority of hydrocodone and the reasons why hydrocodone was once prescribed more than any other medication in the US. The practical reality is that hydrocodone became preferred by physicians and other prescribers nationwide because it was the only opioid analgesic of significant potency that for many years was not a schedule II controlled substance per United States Federal Regulations. During that time span, hydrocodone combination products were classified as schedule III controlled substances, as it was originally believed that the combinations with acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and/or atropine alkaloids were less abusable compared to other products and, with the exception of the latter, potentially more effective in treating pain. This meant that prescribers could write prescriptions for hydrocodone with up to five refills and avoid multiple patient visits for prescription renewals, which are required of oxycodone and nearly all other chronic opioid analgesics.
The number of annual opioid prescriptions written in the US is roughly equal to the number of adults in the country. This statement is an example of a spurious correlation that is shamefully aligned with the agenda-driven rheto ric spewed by politicians and nonscientists. To highlight the inanity, consider the congruent correlations between the cost of bananas vs opioid deaths, points scored by losing Super Bowl team vs opioid deaths, or the cost of 16-ounces of potato chips vs opioid deaths, all of which are more closely parallel than opioid prescriptions written vs number of adults in the US. According to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Changes in Opioid Prescribing in the US, the amount of opioids prescribed peaked in 2010 and has subsequently decreased each year through 2016. More specifically between 2006 and 2016, the annual prescribing rate decreased from 0.724 opioid prescriptions per person to 0.665 prescriptions per person for all opioids, which calculates to an 8.1% reduction in opioid prescriptions written overall. When considering the data from 2006 through 2016 for high-dose opioid prescribing, which was defined as a total daily dosage of ≥ 90 MME, there was a substantial 46.8% overall reduction during that 10-year span. These data were obtained from QuintilesIMS Transactional Data Warehouse, representing 59,000 pharmacies (88% of the prescriptions) across the US. This type of data collection poses several limitations. First, the QuintilesIMS estimates have not been validated. Second, the analysis does not include clinical outcomes. Lastly, the data obtained did not include the indications for which opioids were prescribed. Thus, one cannot assess the appropriateness of these medications and the setting in which they were prescribed – acute, chronic, palliative care, or end-of-life care. What exactly does "roughly equal" mean and is this in fact true? Taking a look at the data reported by the CDC's 2017 Annual Surveillance Report (Table 1), from 2012 to 2016, there was a steady decline in the amount of opioid prescriptions written. Furthermore, from 2014 to 2016, the number of adults exceeded the annual number of opioid prescriptions written.
Nine million Americans take prescribed opioids on a long-term basis. From where Dr. Marcus obtained this figure is unclear. The latest data that we could find suggest that there were actually 13 million Americans prescribed opioids as long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) in 2013–2014. However, given the steady annual decreases in the number of opioids prescribed since 2014, we suspect that this number has likely decreased. Irrespective of the actual number and Marcus's source, we are confident that he presented the number as a means of alarming his readers. If 9 million is an accurate figure, is it not tragic that fewer than 10% of the 100 million suffering from chronic pain are able to access opioid analgesia on an ongoing basis, and overall deaths attributable to such a large number of prescribed opioids are therefore quite low?
Nearly 60% of Americans have leftover opioids in their homes, and 20% have shared their opioids with others, often to help with pain management. Hendricks et al conducted a national survey among US adults with recent opioid medication use to examine the pervasiveness of sharing opioid medications, medication storage and disposal practices, and the sources of information received. Of the 4,836 that were sampled, 1,055 were eligible based on the past year opioid use, and of that group, 1,032 completed the survey. It is important to note that the survey was conducted from February 24 to March 16, 2015. Given the short time frame and lack of US census data on how many adults used prescription opioids within the past year, the results of this study cannot be extrapolated, and that this study sample represents all US adults cannot be verified. Frequently, agenda-driven medical writers jump to extremely inaccurate conclusions and focus on the negative aspects that a study may have revealed. If we look at these data from an alternative perspective, of the 20.7% (weighted percentage) who reported sharing opioid medications with another person, the primary reason for 73% of them was to help someone else manage his or her pain. Perhaps we are missing the bigger picture, with uncontrolled pain remaining a major issue. This survey sheds some positive light on the situation, including that only 1% of respondents no longer using opioid medications reported they would sell them. Dr. Marcus did not share this important information.
In 2015, 19,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose, and the death rate from all opioids (including heroin) now exceeds the death rate from motor vehicle accidents. When contemplating these statistics, the important question to consider is whether the opioids are licit or illicit. In a 2017 article, the authors used the Department of Justice data from a state that breaks down deaths as caused by a licit vs illicit opioids, concluding that as many as 85% of overdose deaths that the CDC has attributed to "prescription opioids" were actually due to illicit fentanyl and its analogs and/or heroin. Although the media and policy makers continue to pay insufficient attention to this distinction, doing so is disingenuous – as is citing such blatantly dishonest figures. Similarly, The Hill recently released an article regarding DEA to Target Pharmacies, Prescribers in Crackdown in which the authors stated, "at least 66,000 deaths from overdoses reported, including 42,249 deaths from opioids". This statistic fails to inform the reader of what percentage of opioid deaths were due to illegally obtained prescription vs nonprescription opioids. Finally, Somerville et al examined fentanyl deaths in Massachusetts over a 6-month period from 2014 to 2015, finding that 82% of the fentanyl deaths were likely due to illicitly manufactured fentanyl, with only 4% attributed to legal, pharmaceutical fentanyl. Polypharmacy also plays a significant role in opioid overdoses. The authors of a 2016 study found that of over 2 million patients who were prescribed opioid analgesics, 80% also were prescribed a benzodiazepine. There were 629 deaths involving opioid analgesics in the study, and alcohol was involved in 12.2% of the fatal overdoses involving opioid analgesics. Most recently, Hannah et al found an average of six potentially deadly substances in toxicologies of supposed "prescription opioid overdose decidents". Dr. Marcus's cited statistics regarding opioid overdoses and mortalities are oversimplified and clearly do not reflect the complex and more accurate picture.

### Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate (Tylenol with codeine) [^117KxBVT]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24–72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).

Initial Dosage

Initiating Treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.

The usual adult dosage is:

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.

TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.

Conversion from Other Opioids to TYLENOL®with Codeine Tablets

There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

### Efficacy and tolerability of SEDIFL ù in treating dry or productive cough in the pediatric population (SEPEDIA): a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial [^117NUERu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The active components of Sediflù syrup, in addition to honey, include mainly mucilaginous polysaccharides from plantain, lactones and phenolic compounds from horehound, saponins from ivy and naphthoquinones from sundew.

The ingredients of Sediflù syrup create a protective film on the mucosa, calming coughing and protecting the upper respiratory tract. In an inflammatory process of the throat and pharynx, the function of the epithelial surface is altered causing subsequent physical irritation of the membranes. Adhesion to the mucosa limits contact with external irritating agents, promotes hydration and reduces damage caused by the mucosal contact of microorganisms and other irritant agents.-

Honey is used to treat upper respiratory tract symptoms and it is generally believed to be safe outside of the pediatric population. Honey is a lay remedy for upper respiratory tract infections and has an emerging evidence base for its use. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 considered the use of honey of interest in the treatment of coughs, due to its demulcent properties. The WHO reports that demulcents may soothe the throat and can be recommended to provide some relief from coughing in children. As evidenced by some previous studies, honey products may have a beneficial effect for symptomatic relief of coughing, even nocturnal coughing, associated with upper respiratory tract infections.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (prometh with codeine) [^112AxyEx]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Pediatric Use

The combination of promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, because the combination may cause fatal respiratory depression in this age population (see WARNINGS Box Warning and Use in Pediatric Patients).

The combination of promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate should be used with caution in pediatric patient 6 years and older (see WARNINGS – Use in Pediatric Patients).

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate syrup did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of Promethazine Hydrochloride and Codeine Phosphate Syrup and observed closely.
