## Question

What is the dosage of Ozempic for type 2 diabetes mellitus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Ozempic (semaglutide) dosing for type 2 diabetes, including initiation, titration, maintenance, special populations, missed-dose handling, and key safety and efficacy context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing schema and confirm the exact titration steps. Then, I should verify the rationale for dose escalation and the maximum approved dose. Next, I will review special populations, especially chronic kidney disease, and check whether dose adjustments are needed. After that, I need to examine missed-dose instructions and practical administration details. Finally, I will integrate efficacy and safety data to contextualize dose selection and provide a concise, clinically usable summary with caveats and monitoring points.

> Let me first confirm the labeled initiation and titration schedule. The FDA prescribing information directs starting Ozempic at 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks to mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects, then increasing to 0.5 mg once weekly, and subsequently titrating to 1 mg and then to 2 mg once weekly if additional glycemic control is needed after at least 4 weeks at each prior dose, with a maximum recommended dose of 2 mg once weekly [^111iaJ3u].

> Wait, let me verify the maintenance range and the escalation logic. The maintenance dose is 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg once weekly, chosen based on glycemic response and tolerability, and each up-titration should occur only after at least 4 weeks at the current dose to allow assessment of efficacy and tolerability; this stepwise approach is supported by pharmacokinetic data showing dose-proportional exposure and steady-state achievement after 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly dosing [^111iaJ3u] [^116jGrvh].

> Hold on, I should verify the special population guidance, particularly for chronic kidney disease. The label notes that in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, the maintenance dose is typically 1 mg once weekly after at least 4 weeks at 0.5 mg, which implies a more conservative maintenance target in CKD rather than routine escalation to 2 mg; importantly, no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment per se, and population PK analyses indicate no clinically relevant effects of renal function on exposure, supporting the absence of a mandated renal dose adjustment [^111iaJ3u] [^114Pr3oE].

> I need to check missed-dose instructions carefully. If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible within 5 days; if more than 5 days have elapsed, skip the missed dose and resume the regular weekly schedule, ensuring at least 2 days (> 48 hours) between doses if the weekly administration day is changed; this aligns with the long half-life and steady-state kinetics of semaglutide [^111iaJ3u] [^116jGrvh].

> Next, I should review administration details to avoid practical errors. Ozempic is administered subcutaneously once weekly in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, with rotation of injection sites; it can be given at any time of day, with or without meals, and if used with insulin, separate injections should be used and not mixed in the same syringe, though the same body region is acceptable if sites are not adjacent [^111iaJ3u].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic rationale for dose escalation. Semaglutide's gastrointestinal adverse effects, notably nausea and vomiting, are dose-related and commonly occur during escalation; the gradual 4-week titration mitigates these effects, and clinical experience supports slower, flexible titration in some patients to improve adherence without sacrificing efficacy, consistent with exposure-response analyses showing greater GI events at higher exposure but with tolerance developing over time [^111EadSj] [^114zRHEv] [^115p9Ldh].

> I should double-check the efficacy context to guide dose selection. In randomized trials, semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg reduce HbA1c by approximately 1.0–1.8% and produce weight loss of about 3–6 kg, with additional HbA1c and weight reductions observed when increasing from 1 mg to 2 mg; the SUSTAIN-FORTE data suggest mean HbA1c reduction around 2.1% at 2 mg, supporting escalation in patients who need more glycemic lowering after 1 mg [^113btTHa] [^114Bf7oP].

> But wait, what if the patient also has obesity and the clinician is considering higher-dose semaglutide for weight loss. I should clarify that the 2.4 mg weekly dose is the obesity dose (Wegovy) and is not the FDA-approved maximum for Ozempic in type 2 diabetes; Ozempic's maximum approved dose for glycemic control is 2 mg weekly, and while higher semaglutide doses can yield more weight loss, this pertains to the obesity indication and distinct labeling, so I need to ensure we do not conflate the two [^111iaJ3u] [^1176BSAE].

> Let me synthesize a practical dosing pathway. Start 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, then increase to 0.5 mg once weekly; maintain at 0.5 mg if glycemic targets are met and tolerability is acceptable, or escalate to 1 mg after at least 4 weeks if additional control is needed; further escalate to 2 mg after at least 4 weeks at 1 mg if targets remain unmet and the patient tolerates therapy, recognizing that many patients with CKD may stop at 1 mg as a maintenance dose per label guidance [^111iaJ3u].

> I should confirm key safety and monitoring points. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common but usually transient and manageable with dose escalation; hypoglycemia risk increases when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, warranting dose adjustments and glucose monitoring; rare but serious risks include pancreatitis and gallbladder disease, and rapid glycemic improvement has been associated with worsening diabetic retinopathy in patients with pre-existing retinopathy, so ophthalmic follow-up is prudent in high-risk patients [^111EadSj] [^113nUjKU] [^112V4EUn] [^115W4B2V] [^114uW3UH].

> Final check and concise summary: Ozempic is initiated at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, then increased to 0.5 mg; maintenance options are 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg once weekly based on glycemic response, with a maximum of 2 mg for type 2 diabetes; in CKD, maintenance at 1 mg is typical; missed doses should be taken within 5 days or skipped if beyond that window; administration is subcutaneous with site rotation and can be at any time of day; dose escalation mitigates GI effects and should be individualized to tolerability and response [^111iaJ3u].

---

Ozempic (semaglutide) for type 2 diabetes is dosed **once weekly** [^111iaJ3u], starting at 0.25 mg for 4 weeks to reduce GI side effects, then increasing to 0.5 mg. If additional glycemic control is needed, titrate to 1 mg after at least 4 weeks, and to 2 mg after another 4 weeks if needed; the **maximum dose is 2 mg weekly** [^111iaJ3u]. Administer subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm [^111iaJ3u], rotating sites and using a new needle each time. If a dose is missed, take it within 5 days; if more than 5 days have passed, skip and resume the next scheduled dose. No dose adjustment is required for renal or hepatic impairment [^114Pr3oE] [^112veycA].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

The **recommended dosing regimen** for Ozempic in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is as follows:

| **Dose** | **Duration** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 0.25 mg once weekly | 4 weeks | Initial dose to reduce gastrointestinal side effects |
| 0.5 mg once weekly | ≥ 4 weeks | Maintenance dose for glycemic control |
| 1 mg once weekly | ≥ 4 weeks (if additional control needed) | Increased maintenance dose |
| 2 mg once weekly | Maximum dose | For patients requiring further glycemic control |

---

The **maximum recommended dose** is 2 mg once weekly [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Administration instructions

- **Injection sites**: Abdomen, thigh, or upper arm [^111iaJ3u].
- **Site rotation**: Use a different injection site each week.
- **Needle**: Use a new needle for each injection.
- **Missed dose**: If within 5 days, take as soon as possible; if more than 5 days, skip and resume the next scheduled dose [^111iaJ3u].

---

## Special populations

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^114Pr3oE].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^112veycA].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment required, but monitor closely [^114Pr3oE].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimen

Clinical trials demonstrate that Ozempic **significantly reduces HbA1c and body weight** in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117M5mKF]. The SUSTAIN clinical trial program showed that once-weekly semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg effectively improved glycemic control and reduced body weight compared to placebo and active comparators [^116kiH43]. The SUSTAIN FORTE trial further demonstrated that increasing the dose to 2.0 mg once weekly provided additional HbA1c reduction and weight loss benefits for patients requiring further glycemic control [^notfound].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Ozempic is generally well tolerated, but **gastrointestinal adverse reactions** — such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea — are common, especially during dose escalation [^111EadSj]. These effects are usually mild to moderate and transient, resolving with continued treatment or dose adjustment. Gradual dose escalation is recommended to minimize gastrointestinal side effects [^113nUjKU].

---

## Summary of dosing recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks.
- **Maintenance dose**: 0.5 mg once weekly.
- **Increased dose**: 1 mg once weekly if additional control needed.
- **Maximum dose**: 2 mg once weekly.
- **Administration**: Subcutaneous injection in abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.
- **Missed dose**: Take within 5 days if remembered; if more than 5 days, skip and resume next scheduled dose.

---

Ozempic is administered as a **once-weekly subcutaneous injection**, starting at 0.25 mg for 4 weeks, then increasing to 0.5 mg, with further titration to 1 mg or 2 mg based on glycemic response and tolerability [^111iaJ3u].

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Inspect OZEMPIC visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless. Do not use OZEMPIC if particulate matter and coloration is seen.
Administer OZEMPIC once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of the day, with or without meals.
Inject OZEMPIC subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Instruct patients to use a different injection site each week when injecting in the same body region.
When using OZEMPIC with insulin, instruct patients to administer as separate injections and to never mix the products. It is acceptable to inject OZEMPIC and insulin in the same body region, but the injections should not be adjacent to each other.
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the time between two doses is at least 2 days (> 48 hours).
If a dose is missed, administer OZEMPIC as soon as possible within 5 days after the missed dose. If more than 5 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Recommended Initiation Dosage

Initiate OZEMPIC with a dosage of 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks. Follow the dosage escalation below to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After 4 weeks on the 0.25 mg dosage, increase the dosage to 0.5 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance and Maximum Dosages for Glycemic Control

The recommended maintenance dosage is 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg, injected subcutaneously once weekly, based on glycemic control.

If additional glycemic control is needed after at least 4 weeks on the:

0.5 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 1 mg once weekly.
1 mg dosage, the dosage may be increased to 2 mg once weekly.

The maximum recommended dosage is 2 mg once weekly.

Recommended Maintenance Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Increase the dosage to the maintenance dosage, 1 mg once weekly, after at least 4 weeks on the 0.5 mg dosage.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89%. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure is achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

In patients with type 2 diabetes, semaglutide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg. Steady-state exposure is achieved following 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the mean population-PK estimated steady-state concentrations following once weekly subcutaneous administration of 0.5 mg and 1 mg semaglutide were approximately 65 ng/mL and 123 ng/mL, respectively. In the trial comparing semaglutide 1 mg and 2 mg, the mean steady state concentrations were 111.1 ng/mL and 222.1 ng/mL, respectively.

Distribution

The mean apparent volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 12.5L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (> 99%).

Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 weeks after the last dose.

14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

OZEMPIC has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, metformin and sulfonylureas, metformin and/or thiazolidinedione, and basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of OZEMPIC was compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release (ER), and insulin glargine.

Most trials evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 0.5 mg, and 1 mg, with the exception of the trial comparing OZEMPIC and exenatide ER where only the 1 mg dose was studied. One trial evaluated the use of OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, OZEMPIC produced clinically relevant reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared with placebo.

The efficacy of OZEMPIC was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI at baseline, body weight (kg) at baseline, diabetes duration and level of renal function impairment.

Monotherapy Use of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In a 30-week double-blind trial (NCT02054897), 388 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with diet and exercise were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg or OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly or placebo. Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 54% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 4.2 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 64% were White, 8% were Black or African American, and 21% were Asian; 30% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Table 7. Results at Week 40 in a Trial of OZEMPIC 2 mg Compared to OZEMPIC 1 mg in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Combination With Metformin or Metformin with Sulfonylurea

a The intent-to-treat population includes all randomized subjects. At week 40 the primary HbA1c endpoint was missing for 3% and 5% of patients randomized to OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg, respectively. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation based on retrieved dropouts. For calculation of proportions, imputed values are dichotomized and the denominator is the number of all randomized subjects.
b Intent-to-treat analysis using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline value and stratification factor.
cp < 0.01 (2-sided) for superiority, adjusted for multiplicity.

The mean baseline body weight was 98.6 kg and 100.1 kg in the OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg arms, respectively. The mean changes from baseline to week 40 were -5.6 kg and -6.4 kg in the OZEMPIC 1 mg and OZEMPIC 2 mg arms, respectively. The difference between treatment arms in body weight change from baseline at week 40 was not statistically significant.

Combination with basal insulin

In a 30-week, double-blind trial (NCT02305381), 397 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with basal insulin, with or without metformin, were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg once weekly, OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly, or placebo. Patients with HbA1c ≤ 8.0% at screening reduced their insulin dose by 20% at start of the trial to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients had a mean age of 59 years and 56% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 13 years, and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m2. Overall, 78% were White, 5% were Black or African American, and 17% were Asian; 12% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Combination with metformin or metformin with sulfonylurea

In a 30-week, open-label trial (NCT02128932), 1089 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized to OZEMPIC 0.5 mg once weekly, OZEMPIC 1 mg once weekly, or insulin glargine once daily on a background of metformin (48%) or metformin and sulfonylurea (51%). Patients had a mean age of 57 years and 53% were men. The mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 8.6 years, and the mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. Overall, 77% were White, 9% were Black or African American, and 11% were Asian; 20% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Patients assigned to insulin glargine had a baseline mean HbA1c of 8.1% and were started on a dose of 10 U once daily. Insulin glargine dose adjustments occurred throughout the trial period based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose before breakfast, targeting 71 to < 100 mg/dL. In addition, investigators could titrate insulin glargine at their discretion between study visits. Only 26% of patients had been titrated to goal by the primary endpoint at week 30, at which time the mean daily insulin dose was 29 U per day.

Common Adverse Reactions

Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of OZEMPIC in the pool of placebo-controlled trials. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on OZEMPIC than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with OZEMPIC.

Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials Reported in ≥ 5% of OZEMPIC-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

In the pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials and in the 2-year cardiovascular outcomes trial, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1.

In a clinical trial with 959 patients treated with OZEMPIC 1 mg or OZEMPIC 2 mg once weekly as add-on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea treatment for 40 weeks, no new safety signals were identified.

In the FLOW trial [see Clinical Studies 14.3] in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, safety data collection was limited to serious adverse events and selected predefined categories of adverse events regardless of seriousness. There were no new serious or severe adverse reactions identified in this trial.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving OZEMPIC than placebo (placebo 15.3%, OZEMPIC 0.5 mg 32.7%, OZEMPIC 1 mg 36.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation. More patients receiving OZEMPIC 0.5 mg (3.1%) and OZEMPIC 1 mg (3.8%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%).

### Randomized open-label trial of semaglutide and dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes of different pathophysiology [^112FZXCd]. Nature Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Trial procedures

The metformin dose at inclusion (as prescribed by the primary care physician) was maintained throughout the study. After a screening visit, participants wore a Libre Pro sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care) for continuous glucose monitoring for 2 weeks. This was followed by a first study visit for baseline measurements, including an OGTT with venous blood sampling at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingesting 75 g of glucose. At the end of this visit, the participants were randomized to receive either semaglutide (Ozempic, Novo Nordisk) or dapagliflozin (Forxiga, AstraZeneca) in addition to metformin (Extended Data Fig. 1). Three months after randomization, the participants attended a visit for measurement of HbA1c and safety variables and application of another glucose sensor to wear for 2 weeks. Six months after randomization, they attended a final study visit for measurement of primary and secondary variables, including an OGTT. Participants who discontinued before the scheduled 6-month visit were invited to attend an immediate final visit before suspending their study medication.

Semaglutide was injected at a dose of 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly during the first 4 weeks, followed by 0.5 mg weekly for the subsequent 4 weeks and, finally, 1.0 mg weekly throughout the trial (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). A dose reduction to 0.5 mg was allowed if the participant experienced unacceptable side effects at 1.0 mg. Those randomized to dapagliflozin treatment received 10 mg orally once daily (the maximal dose approved for diabetes treatment). Participants on semaglutide were instructed to adjust the administration schedule such that the last dose was taken 3 days before their final visit to standardize administration in relation to the final OGTT. In parallel, participants on dapagliflozin were instructed to take their tablet in the evening at least 3 days before their final visit, including the evening before the visit. These considerations were based on the pharmacokinetics and routes of administration of the study drugs to provide an average steady-state condition for both drugs before the OGTT.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus once-daily sitagliptin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes in SUSTAIN China: a 30-week, double-blind, phase 3a, randomized trial [^116kiH43]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The most recent guidelines and position statements issued in collaboration by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, 8 as well as guidelines from the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS), 7 emphasize an individually tailored choice of glucose‐lowering treatment for managing T2D. Besides optimizing glycaemic control, several other factors influence treatment choice, including the effect on weight, risk of hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular status. Currently, the CDS recommends the addition of glucose‐lowering agents, including glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors, after first‐line metformin treatment and lifestyle modification in patients with T2D.

Semaglutide is a once‐weekly long‐acting GLP‐1 RA approved for the treatment of T2D under the trade name Ozempic ®. The GLP‐1 moiety of semaglutide is modified by the addition of a fatty diacid chain and two amino acid substitutions. These modifications prolong its half‐life through enhanced binding to albumin and inhibition of degradation by DPP‐4, facilitating once‐weekly dosing. 18 The efficacy and safety of semaglutide have been established in more than 10 000 patients in the SUSTAIN clinical trial programme. Semaglutide has consistently shown superior reductions in HbA 1c and body weight versus placebo and a range of active comparators such as sitagliptin, exenatide extended release, insulin glargine, dulaglutide, canagliflozin and liraglutide. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Furthermore, semaglutide was also associated with a significant 26% reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo in a preapproval cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT). 30

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers fasting and postprandial blood glucose and reduces body weight. All pharmacodynamic evaluations were performed after 12 weeks of treatment (including dose escalation) at steady state with semaglutide 1 mg.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose, and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24-hour glucose concentration (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Mean 24-hour Plasma Glucose Profiles (standardized meals) in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo

Insulin Secretion

Both first-and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with OZEMPIC compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with semaglutide resulted in the following relative reductions in glucagon compared to placebo, fasting glucagon (8%), postprandial glucagon response (14 to 15%), and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration (12%).

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. With semaglutide, the insulin secretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes was similar to that of healthy subjects (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Mean Insulin Secretion Rate Versus Glucose Concentration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes during Graded Glucose Infusion before (Baseline) and after 12 Weeks of Treatment with Semaglutide or Placebo and in Untreated Healthy Subjects

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady-state.

Fig. 5
Structure of semaglutide (subcutaneous formulation)

The SURPASS-2 trial compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, with those of semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg in patients with type 2 Diabetes over a period of 40 weeks. The overall mean duration of Diabetes was 8.6 years, the average body weight was 93.7 kg, and the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 8.28%. The final and mean points of reduction in body weight show that tirzepatide at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 7.6 kg, − 9.3 kg, and − 11.2 kg, respectively, compared to −5.7 kg for semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. Both drugs also decreased glycated haemoglobin levels. The reductions observed in glycated haemoglobin levels with tirzepatide at a dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg were − 2.01% points, − 2.24% points, and − 2.30% points, respectively, compared to − 1.86% points with semaglutide at a dose of 1 mg. These final results confirm the primary pharmacological effects of semaglutide.

However, Ozempic does not exhibit greater impact on gastric emptying. Semaglutide may also cause some side effects, the frequency of which is shown in Fig. 6.

Ozempic is available in injectable form. In the treatment of type 2 Diabetes, Ozempic is administered subcutaneously once a week at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, with an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week for the first 4 weeks. However, in the treatment of obesity, this drug is used in larger doses – 2.4 mg/week.

### Semaglutide s.C. once-weekly in type 2 diabetes: a population pharmacokinetic analysis [^113pYFNZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is of increasing global concern. Since 1980, the population of adults with diabetes has quadrupled worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence of diabetes has increased, and no single country has managed to see a reduction in this prevalence. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common type of diabetes, making up approximately 90% of the total number of patients with diabetes in high-income countries, with an estimated 415 million adults with diabetes worldwide in 2015.

T2DM is linked to a range of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), microvascular complications, and cancer. Patients with T2DM have twice the risk of CVD mortality compared with age-matched subjects without T2DM, approximately 10% increased risk of cancer, and poorer survival rates of cancer. As the number of comorbidities a patient suffers from and the number of medications a patient is prescribed increase, his or her perceived quality of life decreases. There are many available treatments, but there is still a need for more effective treatments for T2DM.

Semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic ®) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2DM. Native human GLP-1 functions in a glucose-dependent manner, increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion in the presence of elevated blood glucose. GLP-1 also decreases appetite and energy intake. However, endogenous GLP-1 has a short half-life (t ½ = 2–3 min) and is therefore not well suited for the treatment of T2DM. Semaglutide retains 94% amino acid homology with native GLP-1, allowing it to retain GLP-1 signaling functionality but with a half-life of about 1 week. This allows for subcutaneous injection once weekly.

The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) phase III trials have shown that semaglutide has a strong glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c)-lowering effect in patients with T2DM when injected subcutaneously once weekly. As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), treatment with semaglutide causes a reduction in body weight. Globally conducted clinical trials have shown that semaglutide can provide superior glycemic control and body weight loss compared with placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide extended-release or insulin glargine and compared with additional oral anti-diabetic drugs investigated in a dedicated Japanese trial. In addition, semaglutide has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure, and no cardiovascular risk was demonstrated.

Semaglutide (Ozempic® and Wegovy®) dose escalation — it is recommended to slowly increase the dose of semaglutide until you reach your goal dose. For Ozempic®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 6 weeks, then give 1 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next. For Wegovy®, give 0.25 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 0.5 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, give 1.7 mg semaglutide once each week for 4 weeks, then give 2.4 mg semaglutide once each week; this is the final dose and continue until you see the doctor next.

### Semaglutide-properties, action and chromatographic analysis [^113BqouD]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Properties and applications of semaglutide

The primary indication of semaglutide is type 2 diabetes. Currently, it is used as medication for adults who are obese or overweight, provided they have at least one weight-related comorbidity (for instance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol).

Semaglutide, as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, increases the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Addictionally, it supress glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells. It also contributes to a reduction in hunger and food cravings, and stimulates the satiety center in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing a feeling of fullness. It causes weight loss by reduced energy intake with minimal effects on energy expenditure.

Semaglutide is available in two forms: oral and injectable (under the skin fold). The structure of semaglutide in the subcutaneous formulation is presented in Fig. 5. Oral tablets of Ozempic are often administered once a day at doses of 7 mg and 14 mg, with an initial dose of 3 mg once a day for the first 30 days. Oral absorption of semaglutide is considerably faster than subcutaneous administration. However, other oral drugs should be administrated 30 min after swallowing the semaglutide tablet as they can disturb the absorption process. The elimination of this medication is very similar for both the oral and injectable form.

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; p = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^11111JSr]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Oral semaglutide is a welcome addition to diabetes therapy. As evidence and experience accumulate, its use will become more effective and efficient. More evidence is needed, however, regarding the impact of oral semaglutide on absorption of alcohol and other drugs and in those with diabetic gastroparesis. This commentary, based on the expert opinion of the authors and suggestions mentioned in other peer-reviewed published papers, shares clinical tips on how to use the drug, in a safe and smart manner, in a wider spectrum of people living with type 2 diabetes. This will ensure rational use of this molecule in a safer and more effective method. Diabetes care is a dynamic field, and oral semaglutide counseling will continue to be updated as research and real-world experience evolve.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus daily canagliflozin as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 8): a double-blind, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial [^1128HX8r]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines for management of type 2 diabetes recommend a patient-centred approach to guide the choice of pharmacological agents. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are increasingly used as second-line agents, direct comparisons between these treatments are insufficient. In the SUSTAIN 8 trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) with canagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This was a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3b, randomised controlled trial done at 111 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA 1c 7·0–10·5% [53–91 mmol/mol]) on stable daily metformin therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of an interactive web response system to subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg once weekly or oral canagliflozin 300 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA 1c, and the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change from baseline in bodyweight, both at week 52. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients, using on-treatment data collected before initiation of rescue medication. The safety analysis was done on a population that included all patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product. The trial was powered for HbA 1c and bodyweight superiority under reasonable assumptions. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03136484.

Findings

Between March 15, 2017, and Nov 16, 2018, 788 patients were randomly assigned to semaglutide 1·0 mg (394 patients) or canagliflozin 300 mg (394 patients). 739 patients completed the trial (367 in the semaglutide group and 372 in the canagliflozin group). From overall baseline mean, patients receiving semaglutide had significantly greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight than those receiving canagliflozin (HbA 1c estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0·49 percentage points, 95% CI -0·65 to -0·33; -5·34 mmol/mol, 95% CI -7·10 to -3·57; p < 0·0001; and bodyweight ETD -1·06 kg, 95% CI -1·76 to -0·36; p = 0·0029). Gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea, were the most frequently reported adverse events with semaglutide, occurring in 184 (47%) of 392 patients; whereas infections and infestations (defined using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 21.0), most commonly urinary tract infections, occurred more frequently with canagliflozin, in 136 (35%) of 394 patients. Premature treatment discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 38 (10%) of 392 patients with semaglutide and in 20 (5%) of 394 patients with canagliflozin. One fatal adverse event confirmed unlikely to be caused by treatment occurred in the semaglutide group.

Interpretation

Once-weekly semaglutide 1·0 mg was superior to daily canagliflozin 300 mg in reducing HbA 1c and bodyweight in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin therapy. These outcomes might guide treatment intensification choices.

### Real-world treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiating treatment with oral semaglutide [^11476R2m]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus affects one in ten Americans, with 90‒95% of patients with diabetes diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM rarely occurs on its own and is typically associated with a host of comorbid conditions. Comorbidities among patients with T2DM are associated with a lower quality of life, increased healthcare utilization and worse treatment outcomes. Among patients with comorbid T2DM and overweight/obesity, even a small weight loss can result in improved glycemia and a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, while a larger weight loss may result in sustained remission of T2DM for at least 2 years and long-term reductions in cardiovascular and mortality risk.

Physicians treating patients with T2DM face competing clinical concerns and complex treatment situations that require prescription of additional medications and dosing adjustments for patients to obtain optimal levels of HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. While metformin has historically been the treatment of choice in first-line therapy, guidelines now recommend a patient-centered approach with any mono- or combination therapy that allows patients to maintain treatment goals. Nearly all FDA-approved obesity medications have been shown to improve glycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and delay progression to type 2 diabetes in at-risk individuals. In people with T2DM and overweight or obesity, the preferred pharmacotherapy should be a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 RA with greater weight loss efficacy, especially considering their added weight-independent benefits (e.g. glycemic and cardiometabolic).

With the increasing availability of more effective treatments, individuals with diabetes and overweight or obesity should be informed of the potential benefits of both modest and more substantial weight loss and guided in the range of available treatment options. In patients with T2DM, comorbid conditions such as obesity may decrease the benefit of treatment and negatively influence patients' emotional wellbeing and ability to self-manage their T2DM. Semaglutide, a GLP1-RA, was initially granted market authorization for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In 2021 and 2022, regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe licensed semaglutide for the treatment of individuals who are obese or overweight and who have at least one weight-related comorbidity. Manufacturer-sponsored randomized controlled trials have shown a loss of almost 12% of body weight over a 68-week period. Once the medication was stopped patients regained most of their pretreatment weight.

### Oral semaglutide: the first-available noninjectable glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist [^112KyZ6K]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There are roughly 30 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), with nearly 95% of these cases being type 2 (T2)-DM. The American Diabetes Association continues to recommend metformin as the first-line initial treatment of T2DM, in combination with lifestyle modifications; yet, many require multiple therapies to achieve adequate glycemic control. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, adding a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist is a preferred treatment option; however, many patients are apprehensive about injecting medications. Semaglutide is the first oral option in this life-saving medication class. The purpose of this article was to review the pharmacology, clinical trials, safety profile, along with recommended dosing and costs, of oral semaglutide used for managing patients with T2DM.

Methods

A search through the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane libraries was conducted for literature published from January 2017 through December 2020, using the key word semaglutide. Articles were selected if they were related to the approval of oral semaglutide or provided novel clinical information regarding this drug entity in its oral dosage formulation.

Findings

Three Phase II studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and Phase III trials from the PIONEER series were ultimately selected, as these trials were thought to provide pivotal information to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval of oral semaglutide.

Implications

On review of the literature, it appeared that semaglutide is a viable option in treating T2DM. The use of this medication has been associated with glycosylated hemoglobin lowering similar to that with the injectable medication in its same class. Semaglutide was also showed some potential in preventing cardiovascular events as well as increasing weight loss.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^112QMeus]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Exposure-response analysis for evaluation of semaglutide dose levels in type 2 diabetes [^114zRHEv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate dose levels for semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, by examining the effects of demographic factors on efficacy and safety in an exposure-response analysis.

Methods

We analysed data from 1552 adults from four randomized phase III trials of 30 to 56 weeks' duration, investigating once-weekly semaglutide doses 0.5 and 1.0 mg. Exposure-response relationships were investigated using graphical and model-based techniques to assess the two dose levels and subgroups with the highest and lowest exposure and response.

Results

The population had the following demographic characteristics: baseline mean age between 53.2 and 58.4 years, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between 64 and 67 mmol/mol (8.0% and 8.3%), body weight between 71.3 and 96.2 kg, and diabetes duration between 4.2 and 8.9 years. Exposure-response analysis showed a clear HbA1c and weight reduction across exposures after 30 weeks, irrespective of baseline values. The exposure-response for HbA1c was influenced by baseline HbA1c, and body weight exposure-response was influenced by sex, with limited impact of other factors. Analyses for relevant subgroups of baseline body weight, baseline HbA1c and sex indicated clinically relevant additional benefits with regard to HbA1c and weight with 1.0 vs 0.5 mg semaglutide. The proportion of participants reporting gastrointestinal (GI) side effects increased with increasing exposure, but was counteracted by tolerance development.

Conclusions

The analysis showed that all subgroups obtained a clinically relevant benefit with semaglutide 0.5 mg and an additional benefit with semaglutide 1.0 mg. The increase in GI side effects with higher exposure was mitigated by gradually increasing the dose.

### Effect of additional oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin on glycated hemoglobin in adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin alone or with sulfonylurea: the PIONEER 3 randomized clinical trial [^114Ycy6s]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared oral semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes of glucose-lowering therapy.

Objective

To compare efficacy and assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at 206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018. Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466), 7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c and body weight.

Results

Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age, 58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n = 879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide, 3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and 13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%] and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P < .001 for both) and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5 kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P < .001 for both) from baseline to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical setting.

6.2 Key clinical considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice

Currently, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the United States as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbid condition.,

Figure 1 illustrates key considerations for the use of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should be initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every 4 weeks according to the dose‐escalation schedule in Figure 1, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached. This escalation schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs, but if a patient does not tolerate a dose during the escalation period, the subsequent escalation step can be delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re‐escalated to 2.4 mg. If needed, this re‐escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 more weeks) and the escalation can be stopped at a lower maintenance dose where AEs are tolerable. In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Methods

Data Sources and Searches

PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov database, Cochrane Library, and CNKI databases were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing oral semaglutide with placebo or other active medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes. The main search terms were "Semaglutide", "NN9535", "T2DM", and "type 2 diabetes mellitus". This study has been registered at INPLASY (INPLASY202380046).

Study Selection

The document management software Endnote was used to import bibliographic information from each database search result. Two independent reviewers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts after deduplication. Full-text articles were reviewed when title and abstract were insufficient to verify eligibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Fig. 1. The screening aimed to find studies assessing the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in both Asian and non-Asian patients.

Literature search flow chart and screening criteria

Quality Assessment and Data Extraction

Cochrane Handbook v5.2 was recognized as the authority on quality assessment. The studies' biases were assessed using this method. Two researchers conducted the evaluation. After completing data extraction, the two Excel tables used in the study were compared to ensure consistency and accuracy. If there were any differences, they were resolved through negotiation. Characteristics collected included author name, publication year, NCT number, patient's size and ethnicity, intervention, follow-up time point, etc. As for the results, due to the limited data published so far, the Asian and non-Asian study results were recorded separately. HbA1c changes and body weight changes were observed, as well as the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Priority extraction of data from published articles when no data is given in a published article and the data in ClinicalTrials.gov is used. As for the dosage of oral semaglutide, we extracted three doses (3, 7, and 14 mg), among which 7 mg and 14 mg are the doses that have been approved by the regulatory authorities.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

### A 26-week randomized controlled trial of semaglutide once daily versus liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on diet and exercise with or without metformin [^114FGRFv]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily semaglutide in comparison with once-daily liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This 26-week, multicenter, double-blind trial involved patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with HbA 1c 7.0–10.0% (53–86 mmol/mol) and treated with diet and exercise with or without metformin. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily semaglutide, liraglutide, or placebo in one of four volume-matched doses (semaglutide 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg and liraglutide 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg, with both compared within each volume-matched dose group). Primary end point was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 26.

Results

In total, 705 randomized patients were exposed to trial products. At week 26, a dose-dependent change in HbA 1c was observed with semaglutide from -1.1% (0.05 mg) to -1.9% (0.3 mg) and with liraglutide from -0.5% (0.3 mg) to -1.3% (1.8 mg) (all P < 0.001 in favor of volume-matched semaglutide dose). Change with pooled placebo was -0.02% (P < 0.0001 vs. semaglutide). Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the most common adverse events (AEs) with semaglutide and liraglutide, occurring in 32.8–54.0% and 21.9–41.5% of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Once-daily semaglutide at doses up to 0.3 mg/day resulted in greater reductions in HbA 1c compared with liraglutide or placebo but with a higher frequency of GI AEs.

### Efficacy and safety of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg: a single-center, retrospective observational study [^11512Qa5]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide, the first glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist available in tablet form for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were established in the phase 3a PIONEER program. However, evidence regarding the titration of oral semaglutide in real-world clinical settings remains insufficient. This study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic advantages of escalating the dose of oral semaglutide from 7 to 14 mg through clinical data analysis.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single center in Japan, focusing on adults with type 2 diabetes who were initiated on 14 mg oral semaglutide. The primary endpoint was the alteration in HbA1c levels 24 weeks after the initial prescription of 14 mg oral semaglutide. Secondary endpoints included changes in metabolic parameters and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

Data from 66 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. The mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 24 weeks following dose escalation was - 0.5 ± 0.8% [from 7.4 ± 1.0% at baseline to 7.0 ± 0.9% at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)]. Moreover, a significant reduction in body weight of - 2.0 ± 4.4 kg was observed at 24 weeks [from 90.0 ± 20.5 kg at baseline to 88.2 ± 21.4 kg at 24 weeks (p < 0.01)], with 41% of patients achieving at least a 3% reduction compared to baseline. Gastrointestinal disorders emerged as the most prevalent adverse event (10.6%), particularly nausea (7.6%), although predominantly of mild or moderate severity, with no instances of serious adverse events necessitating drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

Escalating the dose of oral semaglutide to 14 mg could be an effective approach for enhancing glycemic control and managing body weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

6 Limitations

The results from this study must be analysed within the context of its limitations. First, there is a relative paucity in head‐to‐head trials comparing tirzepatide against semaglutide. Further studies, especially with longer‐duration trials and varying dosages, can better elucidate the long‐term weight loss reduction and maintenance and characterise the safety profile over time. Second, two non‐RCTs were included in this study, which may introduce bias that can affect the meta‐analysis results. Third, there was heterogeneity across the patient characteristics and the dose regimens in these studies. Fourth, the semaglutide dosage used across several studies, as noted earlier, is lower than the approved dose for T2DM and obesity, as mentioned earlier, which may not fully reflect the results seen at clinically relevant doses.

3.3 Semaglutide exposure and body weight reduction

The exposure‐response relationship between semaglutide exposure and change from baseline to week 30 in body weight is shown in Figure 2. Body weight loss increased linearly with increasing semaglutide exposure, with a relative weight loss from baseline of ~6.5% for the highest exposure quantile and a predicted weight loss of ~8% for participants with exposure at the upper end of the exposure range (Figure 2 A). The characteristics of the exposure‐response relationships were similar in each trial (data not shown). When stratifying by sex, body weight loss was greater in women than in men, with a steeper slope vs exposure for women compared to men (Figure 2 B).

Data are mean values of body weight change from baseline with 95% confidence interval (CI) vs exposure expressed as 6 quantiles of C avg A, or stratified by sex B, with four quantiles, plus a value of 0 exposure assigned to participants treated with placebo. The lines through the data represent covariate‐adjusted model‐derived estimates for each population. Horizontal lines with diamonds along the x ‐axis represent median and 95% exposure ranges for each dose level. C avg, average semaglutide concentrations at steady state

Standard goodness‐of‐fit plots were also used to evaluate the exposure‐response model for body weight and were found to be acceptable (Figure S4).

3.4 Exploration of HbA1c and body weight responses across populations

For the exposure‐response relationship for HbA1c and body weight, the most influential covariate factors were baseline HbA1c and baseline body weight and, moreover, body weight loss was influenced by sex. Therefore, we conducted additional subgroup analyses for these variables, investigating the exposure and the exposure‐response relationship for 0.5 and 1.0 mg semaglutide. Consistently greater model‐derived HbA1c and body weight responses were observed in participants dosed with 1.0 mg compared with 0.5 mg semaglutide, irrespective of baseline HbA1c, baseline body weight or sex (Table 1). We observed greater effects of semaglutide on HbA1c in the 10% of participants with the lowest body weight than in those with the 10% highest weight. Nevertheless, in the heaviest participants a substantial effect on HbA1c and body weight was observed with semaglutide 0.5 mg, despite the lower exposure.

Adverse effects are noted as it "may delay gastric emptying with adverse effects of nausea and vomiting", and "gradual dose titration may help mitigate these adverse effects". Class-level risks are flagged as "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and gallbladder disease", and semaglutide "is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2".

### Semaglutide once weekly as add-on to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 9): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^117M5mKF]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Semaglutide is a once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for type 2 diabetes. Few clinical trials have reported on the concomitant use of GLP-1 receptor agonists with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of semaglutide when added to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

The SUSTAIN 9 double-blind, parallel-group trial was done at 61 centres in six countries (Austria, Canada, Japan, Norway, Russia, and the United States). Adults with type 2 diabetes and HbA 1c 7·0–10·0% (53–86 mmol/mol), despite at least 90 days of treatment with an SGLT-2 inhibitor, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg or volume-matched placebo once weekly for 30 weeks, after a dose-escalation schedule of 4 weeks of 0·25 mg semaglutide or placebo and 4 weeks of 0·5 mg semaglutide or placebo. Existing antidiabetic medications, including SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment, were continued for the duration of the trial. Rescue medication, defined as intensification of background antidiabetic treatment or the initiation of new glucose-lowering medications, could be given to patients meeting specific criteria at the discretion of the investigator. The primary outcome was change in HbA 1c from baseline at week 30, assessed in the full analysis set (all patients randomly allocated to treatment) using on-treatment data collected before rescue medication was started. The confirmatory secondary outcome was change in bodyweight from baseline to week 30. Safety was also assessed in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of treatment). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03086330).

Findings

Between March 15, and Dec 4, 2017, 302 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 1·0 mg or placebo (full analysis set), of whom 301 received at least one dose of treatment (safety analysis set). One patient was assigned to semaglutide but was not treated (reason unknown). 294 (97·4%) patients completed the trial and 267 (88·4%) completed treatment. Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between groups. In addition to randomised medication and SGLT-2 inhibitor, 216 (71·5%) patients were taking metformin and 39 (12·9%) were taking sulphonylurea. Patients given semaglutide had greater reductions in HbA 1c (estimated treatment difference -1·42% [95% CI -1·61 to -1·24]; -15·55 mmol/mol [-17·54 to -13·56]) and bodyweight (-3·81 kg [-4·70 to -2·93]) versus those randomised to placebo (both p < 0·0001). 356 adverse events were reported by 104 (69·3%) patients in the semaglutide group, and 247 adverse events were reported by 91 (60·3%) patients in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were most common and were reported in 56 (37·3%) patients in the semaglutide group and 20 (13·2%) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in seven (4·7%) patients in the semaglutide group and six (4·0%) in the placebo group. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemic events were reported in four patients on semaglutide (2·7%). 16 patients stopped treatment early because of an adverse event, 13 of whom were in the semaglutide group. There were no deaths during the trial.

Interpretation

Adding semaglutide to SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces bodyweight in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, and is generally well tolerated.

### Gradual titration of semaglutide results in better treatment adherence and fewer adverse events: a randomized controlled open-label pilot study examining a 16-week flexible titration regimen versus label-recommended 8-week semaglutide titration regimen [^115p9Ldh]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a slower, flexible titration regimen of semaglutide would improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) compared with the label-recommended regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 104 patients with T2D were randomized to label-recommended titration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg at 4-week intervals) or flexible titration (starting at 0.0675 mg [measured as five clicks made by the dose selector dial], with gradual increases by 0.0675 mg/week and delays for GI-AEs) for 26 weeks.

Results

While final doses were similar between groups, only 2% of patients in the flexible arm withdrew due to GI-AEs vs. 19% in the label arm (P = 0.005). The flexible arm reported less nausea (45.1% vs. 64.2%; P = 0.051) and asthenia (9.8% vs. 24.5%; P = 0.047), with fewer days experiencing nausea (2.88 vs. 6.3 days; P = 0.017). HbA1c and BMI changes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Slower, flexible titration improved adherence and reduced adverse events without compromising efficacy.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

### Managing weight and glycaemic targets in people with type 2 diabetes-how far have we come? [^113GgZn2]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies demonstrated the efficacy of GLP‐1 RAs in reducing HbA1c by up to 1.9 percentage points compared with baseline and promote weight loss of up to 6.9 kg. There were also significant reductions in cardiovascular events and some renal outcomes in the absence of hypoglycaemia due to their glucose‐dependent mechanism of action. While all approved GLP‐1 RAs have high glucose‐lowering and weight loss efficacy, there is variation within the drug class. Structural differences among GLP‐1 RAs influence duration of action, and their formulation and dosing may affect efficacy in reducing blood glucose and body weight, as well as side effect profile and cardiovascular effects. However, an increased dosage of multiple approved GLP‐1 RAs has been studied in recent trials. The AWARD‐11 trialcompared dulaglutide at doses of 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus the approved dose of 1.5 mg in people with T2D inadequately controlled with metformin. Indeed, escalation to a higher dose of dulaglutide provided clinically relevant, dose‐related reductions in HbA1c (1.72 percentage points vs. 1.61 percentage points vs. 1.55 percentage points with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0 and 1.5 mg, respectively) and body weight (4.9 kg vs. 4.0 kg vs. 3.4 kg with dulaglutide 4.5, 3.0 and 1.5 mg, respectively) at 52 weeks with a similar safety profile. Another example is the weekly injectable semaglutide, currently approved at doses of up to 1.0 mg for people with T2D and up to 2.4 mg for obesity management. In the STEP trials, semaglutide plus a lifestyle intervention was tested at the higher dose of 2.4 mg/week, specifically for promoting weight loss, regardless of the presence of T2D (Table 2). Adverse effects were in line with those expected for a GLP‐1 receptor agonist, with mild‐to‐moderate GI events being the most common.,

TABLE 2
STEP‐program phase 3 trials with efficacy results

Both GLP‐1 RAs with good efficacy for weight loss and SGLT2i are recommended as a second‐line monotherapy when there is a compelling need to minimize weight gain, or to promote weight loss. Moreover, the use of GLP‐1 RAs is recommended for people with T2D who have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or indicators of high risk, established renal disease, or if there is a compelling need to minimize hypoglycaemia.

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

This double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3, superiority study enrolled adults with a body-mass index of at least 27 kg/m 2 and glycated haemoglobin 7–10% (53–86 mmol/mol) who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 180 days before screening. Patients were recruited from 149 outpatient clinics in 12 countries across Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) via an interactive web-response system and stratified by background glucose-lowering medication and glycated haemoglobin, to subcutaneous injection of semaglutide 2·4 mg, or semaglutide 1·0 mg, or visually matching placebo, once a week for 68 weeks, plus a lifestyle intervention. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and achievement of weight reduction of at least 5% at 68 weeks for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo, assessed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03552757 and is closed to new participants.

Findings

From June 4 to Nov 14, 2018, 1595 patients were screened, of whom 1210 were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 404), semaglutide 1·0 mg (n = 403), or placebo (n = 403) and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated change in mean bodyweight from baseline to week 68 was -9·6% (SE 0·4) with semaglutide 2·4 mg vs -3·4% (0·4) with placebo. Estimated treatment difference for semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo was -6·2 percentage points (95% CI -7·3 to -5·2; p < 0·0001). At week 68, more patients on semaglutide 2·4 mg than on placebo achieved weight reductions of at least 5% (267 [68·8%] of 388 vs 107 [28·5%] of 376; odds ratio 4·88, 95% CI 3·58 to 6·64; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were more frequent with semaglutide 2·4 mg (in 353 [87·6%] of 403 patients) and 1·0 mg (329 [81·8%] of 402) than with placebo (309 [76·9%] of 402). Gastrointestinal adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate, were reported in 256 (63·5%) of 403 patients with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 231 (57·5%) of 402 with semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 138 (34·3%) of 402 with placebo.

Interpretation

In adults with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 2·4 mg once a week achieved a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in bodyweight compared with placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 analog ecnoglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^113U9zPc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important global health problem, with approximately 483 million adults currently living with the disease. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing, with an estimated 783 million cases expected worldwide in 2045. In China, over 140 million people were living with diabetes in 2021. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, with approximately 6.7 million deaths attributable to the condition annually.

Over the past two decades, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs have been developed as a key therapeutic for T2DM and obesity. GLP-1 analogs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of T2DM include exenatide (Byetta®), liraglutide (Victoza®), lixisenatide (Adlyxin®), dulaglutide (Trulicity®) and semaglutide (Ozempic® and Rybelsus®). Semaglutide (Wegovy®) and liraglutide (Saxenda®) are also approved for the management of obesity. Most GLP-1 analogs are administered by injection, whereas Rybelsus® is a once-daily oral tablet.

GLP-1 analogs mimic the activity of the natural peptide incretin hormone, which is produced by intestinal L-cells in response to a meal. Incretins act to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and lower blood glucose levels, as well as to slow gastric emptying and promote a sense of fullness that reduces appetite. While the native GLP-1 peptide is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4), with a half-life of approximately 2 min, recombinant analogs have modifications to improve plasma stability, resulting in a half-life as long as 1 week.

Next generation GLP-1 therapeutics aim to improve efficacy and tolerability, as well as maximize convenience for patients by focusing on the frequency of dosing and route of administration. In addition, peptide sequence optimization seeks to overcome the high cost and complexity of manufacturing for some recombinant peptides that contain unnatural amino acid substitutions, such as semaglutide.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Improved treatment satisfaction in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with once-weekly semaglutide in the SUSTAIN trials [^117QaZPA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the availability of effective glucose‐lowering agents, many patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) do not achieve glycaemic targets. 1, 2, 3 Adherence to and persistence with treatment regimens are important factors for treatment effectiveness. 4 Higher treatment satisfaction has been associated with better treatment adherence and improved persistence. 5

Ongoing day‐to‐day management of T2D lies with the patient and their caregivers, and treatment guidelines are moving towards an individualized approach to improve treatment satisfaction and adherence. 6, 7, 8 Surveys have shown that key determinants of treatment preference among patients with T2D include route of administration (e.g. oral vs. injectable), convenience and low frequency of administration, efficacy (e.g. achievement of glycaemic control) and safety [e.g. adverse events (AEs) including weight gain, gastrointestinal (GI) effects and hypoglycaemia]. 9, 10, 11, 12 In addition to biomarkers and clinical data, patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) can provide insights into risks and benefits of T2D treatments. 9 Consequently, PROs are frequently assessed in T2D trials, including measures such as treatment satisfaction, quality of life, well‐being, health status and impact of weight changes. 9

### Long-term cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide versus polyethylene glycol loxenatide for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in China [^11656mNg]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a novel long-acting, human-based GLP-1RA that has been developed for the treatment of T2D. Semaglutide has 94% structural homology to native human GLP-1. Three minor but important modifications significantly extend the half-life of semaglutide to 165 h and make it suitable to be administered on a once-weekly schedule: amino acid substitutions at position 8 (alanine to alpha-aminoisobutyric acid a synthetic amino acid) and at position 34 (lysine to arginine), and acylation of the peptide backbone with a spacer and C-18 fatty di-acid chain to lysine at position 26. Throughout the global Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) trials, compared to all the other comparators once-weekly semaglutide displayed greater short-term efficacy, with more significant reductions in HbA 1c and multiple cardiometabolic benefits (including improving the control of blood pressure, blood lipids and body weight, among others). Also, the SUSTAIN China trial showed that the proportion of patients achieving the HbA 1c target (HbA 1c < 7%) with once-weekly semaglutide was as high as 86.1% in the Chinese diabetes population.

In addition to clinical considerations, economic value assessment of a novel intervention is also important for healthcare decisions given the enormous disease burden of diabetes. In China, three once-weekly GLP-1 RAs have been included in the National Reimbursement Drug List, including once-weekly semaglutide (Ozempic ®; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), dulaglutide (Trulicity ®; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEG-loxenatide; Fu Laimei ®; Hansoh Pharma, Lianyungang, China). The long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide compared with dulaglutide in the Chinese setting was evaluated in our previous study. However, to date there has been no cost-effectiveness comparison between once-weekly semaglutide and PEG-loxenatide. Semaglutide is available in two treatment doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, administered once-weekly; PEG-loxenatide is also available in two treatment doses of 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg, administered once-weekly. Because PEG-loxenatide 0.1 mg is rarely used in clinical practice in China, we did not include this dose in our study.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous (SQ) weekly — weight-loss efficacy from randomized trials: Across "8 RCTs (2658 participants treated with semaglutide group vs 1694 participants in the placebo group)" with "a follow-up period ranging from 52 to 72 weeks", semaglutide produced greater total body weight loss (%TBWL), with "MD %TBWL was 10.76% (95% CI, 8.73%–12.80%)". Absolute weight change was larger with semaglutide as "weight loss ranging from 9.7 to 16.8 kg in the semaglutide group vs 1.5 to 6.2 kg in the placebo group (MD, 10.81 kg; 95% CI, 8.19–13.43 kg)". Categorical thresholds favored semaglutide: "82.3% vs 30.6% for ≥ 5% TBWL (RR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.21–3.40), 64.9% vs 12.3% for ≥ 10% TBWL (RR, 5.25; 95% CI, 3.61–7.64), and 46.1% vs 5.4% for ≥ 15% TBWL (RR, 7.82; 95% CI, 5.19–11.76)".

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 analog ecnoglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^114httVj]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In addition to glycemic effects, we observed dose-dependent body weight reductions over 20 weeks of treatment with ecnoglutide. Between 11 and 33% of participants who received ecnoglutide reached the ADA recommended weight loss target of ≥ 5%, versus 3% with placebo. Body weight changes from baseline of −1.57, −1.65, and −2.26 kg for ecnoglutide (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 mg at 20 weeks) were greater than reported for dulaglutide (−1.0 to −1.5 kg for 0.75 and 1.5 mg doses at 26 weeks. Longer studies in populations with T2DM and obesity are needed to compare ecnoglutide-induced weight loss to other GLP-1 analogs, which included −2.05 to −2.45 kg for liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg) at 52 weeks, −3.73 to −4.53 kg for semaglutide (0.5 to 1.0 mg) at 30 weeks, and −5.7 kg for semaglutide (1.0 mg) at 40 weeks. Ecnoglutide weight reductions were progressive during the study and did not reach a plateau in any of the three dose groups at the end of 20 weeks of treatment. Continued weight loss is therefore expected with longer treatment periods. In addition, potential cardiovascular benefits may result from the favorable changes in LDL and systolic blood pressure observed with ecnoglutide in this study.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity [^1123BArJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide vs empagliflozin added to metformin in type 2 diabetes: patient-level meta-analysis [^113hk1fL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

No head-to-head trials have directly compared once-weekly (OW) semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, with empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, in type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Objective

We indirectly compared the efficacy of OW semaglutide 1 mg vs once-daily (OD) empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy, using individual patient data (IPD) and meta-regression methodology.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions

IPD for patients with T2D receiving metformin monotherapy and randomized to OW semaglutide 1 mg (SUSTAIN 2, 3, 8 trials), or to OD empagliflozin 25 mg (PIONEER 2 trial) were included. Meta-regression analyses were adjusted for potential prognostic factors and effect modifiers.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcomes were change from baseline to end-of-treatment (~1 year) in HbA1c (%-point) and body weight (kg). Responder outcomes and other clinically relevant efficacy measures were analyzed.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between OW semaglutide (n = 995) and empagliflozin (n = 410). Our analyses showed that OW semaglutide significantly reduced mean HbA1c and body weight vs empagliflozin (estimated treatment difference: -0.61%-point [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.72; -0.49] and -1.65 kg [95% CI: -2.22; -1.08], respectively; both P < 0.0001). Complementary analyses supported the robustness of these results. A significantly greater proportion of patients on OW semaglutide vs empagliflozin also achieved HbA1c targets and weight-loss responses.

Conclusions

This indirect comparison suggests that OW semaglutide 1 mg provides superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight vs OD empagliflozin 25 mg in patients with T2D when added to metformin monotherapy.

### A phase 2, randomized, dose-finding study of the novel once-weekly human GLP-1 analog, semaglutide, compared with placebo and open-label liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes [^114AuWPf]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the dose-response relationship of semaglutide versus placebo and open-label liraglutide in terms of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind phase 2 trial. Patients (n = 415) were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of semaglutide once weekly without dose escalation (0.1–0.8 mg) or with dose escalation (E) (0.4 mg steps to 0.8 or 1.6 mg E over 1–2 weeks), open-label liraglutide once daily (1.2 or 1.8 mg), or placebo. The primary end point was change in HbA1c level from baseline. Secondary end points included change in body weight, safety, and tolerability.

Results

Semaglutide dose-dependently reduced the level of HbA1c from baseline (8.1 ± 0.8%) to week 12 by up to -1.7%, and body weight by up to -4.8 kg (1.6 mg E, P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Up to 81% of patients achieved an HbA1c level of < 7%. HbA1c level and weight reductions with semaglutide 1.6 mg E were greater than those with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg (based on unadjusted CIs), but adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals occurred more frequently. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and withdrawal due to gastrointestinal AEs increased with the semaglutide dose; most events were mild to moderate, transient, and ameliorated by dose escalation. There were no major episodes of hypoglycemia and few cases of injection site reactions.

Conclusions

After 12 weeks, semaglutide dose-dependently reduced HbA1c level and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. No unexpected safety or tolerability concerns were identified; gastrointestinal AEs typical of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists were mitigated by dose escalation. On this basis, weekly semaglutide doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg with a 4-week dose escalation were selected for phase 3.

### Real-world hbAchanges and prescription characteristics among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients initiating treatment with once weekly semaglutide for diabetes [^113btTHa]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of antihyperglycemic drugs that were first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in 2005. GLP-1 RAs have been shown to decrease HbA 1c levels by at least 1% and to have positive impacts on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels. GLP1- RAs are recommended for patients who need to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and to help promote heathy weight management. Once-weekly semaglutide for diabetes (OW sema T2D) is a GLP-1 RA administered weekly as a subcutaneous injection first approved by the FDA in 2017. In the Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical trials, OW sema T2D was effective at lowering HbA 1c levels in patients with T2DM. Across the SUSTAIN trials, a 1.0 mg dose of OW sema T2D was shown to reduce HbA 1c by 1.5–1.8% after 30–56 weeks. Additionally, patients using OW sema T2D reduced their body weight significantly more than patients who used the DPP-4, SGLT-2, daily subcutaneous GLP-1 RA, once weekly subcutaneous GLP-1 RA and insulin medications tested in the trials. Recently, results from the SUSTAIN-FORTE trial showed that patients on a 2.0 mg dose of OW sema T2D had their HbA 1c levels reduced by an average of 2.1%. 27 Dosing instructions for OW sema T2D recommend an initial dose of 0.25 mg weekly and that this dose be increased to 0.50 mg weekly after 4 weeks. After 4 weeks at the 0.50 mg dose, a 1.0 mg weekly dose may be used if the patient needs further glycemic control. At the time this study was conducted, the 1.0 mg weekly dose was the maximum dose; a 2.0 mg weekly dose was approved in 2022 and this dose can be prescribed if additional glycemic control is needed.

### Cagrilintide-semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes [^1179kSRV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cagrilintide and semaglutide have each been shown to induce weight loss as monotherapies. Data are needed on the coadministration of cagrilintide and semaglutide (called CagriSema) for weight management in adults with type 2 diabetes, including those in a subgroup who are undergoing continuous glucose monitoring.

Methods

In this phase 3a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 12 countries, we assigned adults with a body-mass index of 27 or more, a glycated hemoglobin level of 7 to 10%, and type 2 diabetes in a 3:1 ratio to receive once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (2.4 mg each) or placebo, along with lifestyle intervention, for 68 weeks. The two primary end points were the percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients with a weight reduction of at least 5%. Additional end points were changes in glycemic measures and safety assessments. Effect estimates were calculated with the use of the treatment-policy estimand (consistent with the intention-to-treat principle).

Results

A total of 1206 patients underwent randomization to either the cagrilintide-semaglutide group (904 patients) or the placebo group (302 patients). The estimated mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -13.7% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and -3.4% in the placebo group (estimated difference, -10.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -11.2 to -9.5; P < 0.001). More patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group than in the placebo group had a weight reduction of 5% or more (P < 0.001); the same was true of reductions of at least 10%, 15%, and 20% (P < 0.001 for the last comparison). The percentage of patients who had a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or less was 73.5% in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 15.9% in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 72.5% of the patients in the cagrilintide-semaglutide group and 34.4% in the placebo group, most of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Once-weekly cagrilintide-semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg each) resulted in a significantly lower body weight than placebo in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; REDEFINE 2 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05394519.).

2.3 Study design

This was a phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging, parallel‐group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lotiglipron in adult participants with T2D and, separately, with obesity without T2D.

The study had 13 arms, with administration of oral lotiglipron (five arms) or matching placebo (one arm) in each cohort, and one additional arm in the T2D cohort receiving open‐label oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) as an internal reference standard (Figure 1). Participants in the T2D cohort were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive lotiglipron QD at one of five maintenance doses (20, 40, 80, 160 or 260 mg) or matching placebo, or semaglutide QD at one maintenance dose (14 mg). Participants in the obesity cohort were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive lotiglipron QD at one of four maintenance doses, with two dose titration regimens for the 200‐mg dose (80 mg, 140 mg, 200 mg five‐step titration, 200 mg four‐step titration and 260 mg) or matching placebo (Figure 1). The target doses and titration scheme selected for this study were based on observed safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic data in completed phase 1 clinical studies. The starting lotiglipron dose of 20 mg was found to be well tolerated in a phase I study. The target doses evaluated in this study (from 20 to 260 mg QD) were selected to allow adequate bracketing of efficacious doses (from low doses predicted to have sub‐maximal efficacy up to doses expected to have near‐maximal efficacy, while still having an acceptable safety/tolerability profile). The titration scheme aimed to gradually progress from the starting dose to the target dose in each arm while ensuring participants stay at each dose step for 4 weeks before titrating to the next dose level based on data from marketed GLP‐1R agonists, including oral semaglutide, where 4‐week intervals at each dose step are generally appropriate to facilitate mitigation of MoA‐driven GI adverse events. In addition, the employed titration scheme aimed for ≤ 2‐fold increase in PK exposure with consecutive titration steps.

### One-year weight reduction with semaglutide or liraglutide in clinical practice [^115jd9fK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

Data for this retrospective cohort study were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic electronic health record (EHR) in Ohio and Florida, including linked Surescripts pharmacy dispensation records, from January 1, 2015, to July 28, 2023. The Surescripts prescription data service captures prescriptions paid for via insurance benefits, cash, coupons, or other methods, from nearly all major pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers in the US.

The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board as minimal risk research using data collected for routine clinical practice, for which the requirement for informed consent was waived. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines were followed.

Study Participants

We identified adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who filled an initial prescription for injectable semaglutide or liraglutide from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022, and had a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared) of at least 30.0, recorded on the date of treatment initiation (index date) or during the latest available primary care visit before the index date. To ensure that these were initial fills, we excluded patients prescribed these medications between January 1 and June 30, 2015. Individuals were required to have a follow-up weight measurement at least 12 months after the treatment initiation to be included in the study. Patients who were pregnant, had cancer diagnoses during the study period, or underwent bariatric surgery within 2 years of the initial medication fill were excluded (Figure 1). This study captured fills for injectable forms of semaglutide and liraglutide under the brand names approved by the FDA for obesity (semaglutide, 1.7 or 2.4 mg [Wegovy], and liraglutide, 3.0 mg [Saxenda]), as well as those approved for T2D (semaglutide, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg [Ozempic], and liraglutide, 1.2 or 1.8 mg [Victoza]), including all starting doses.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

RYBELSUS has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, insulins, and thiazolidinediones in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The efficacy of RYBELSUS was compared with placebo, empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide. RYBELSUS has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, RYBELSUS produced clinically significant reduction from baseline in HbA1ccompared with placebo.

The effectiveness of RYBELSUS (formulation R2–1.5 mg, 4 mg and 9 mg strengths) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] and RYBELSUS (formulation R1–3 mg, 7, mg and 14 mg strengths) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] has been established as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on adequate and well-controlled studies of RYBELSUS (formulation R1) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Below is a display of the efficacy results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of RYBELSUS (formulation R1) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The efficacy of RYBELSUS was not impacted by baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, BMI, body weight, duration of diabetes and degree of renal impairment.

Table 2 — Semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) at 2.4 mg subcutaneously per week is approved for treatment of obesity, with average weight reduction about 15%, and at oral doses of 7–14 mg per day is indicated to lower blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is contraindicated in patients with personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 or known hypersensitivity to semaglutide. It is associated with hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with concomitant hypoglycemic medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas and may slow gastric emptying, which may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medication.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic evaluations described below were in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received once weekly subcutaneous injections of placebo or semaglutide injection over 12 weeks (semaglutide injection-treated patients were started on lower dosages and then titrated up to 1 mg once weekly). RYBELSUS is not approved for subcutaneous use.

Fasting and Postprandial Glucose

Semaglutide reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with semaglutide injection 1 mg resulted in reductions in glucose in terms of absolute change from baseline and relative reduction compared to placebo of 29 mg/dL (22%) for fasting glucose, 74 mg/dL (36%) for 2-hour postprandial glucose and 30 mg/dL (22%) for mean 24 hour glucose concentration.

Insulin Secretion

Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion are increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with semaglutide compared with placebo.

Glucagon Secretion

Semaglutide lowers the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations.

Glucose dependent insulin and glucagon secretion

Semaglutide lowers high blood glucose concentrations by stimulating insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.

During induced hypoglycemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of increased glucagon compared to placebo and did not impair the decrease of C-peptide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Gastric emptying

Semaglutide causes a delay of early postprandial gastric emptying, thereby reducing the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation postprandially.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of subcutaneously administered semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. At an average exposure level 4-fold higher than that of the maximum recommended dose of RYBELSUS, semaglutide does not prolong QTc intervals to any clinically relevant extent.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Semaglutide s.C. once-weekly in type 2 diabetes: a population pharmacokinetic analysis [^114Pr3oE]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Semaglutide, a new treatment option approved for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to be injected subcutaneously once weekly. This analysis used a population pharmacokinetic model of semaglutide to identify clinically relevant covariates for exposure.

Methods

A total of 1612 patients with up to seven pharmacokinetic observations each were included in the analysis. All subjects had type 2 diabetes mellitus and were enrolled in one of five trials in the phase III development program for subcutaneous semaglutide once weekly (the SUSTAIN program). The treatment duration of the trials varied from 30 to 104 weeks.

Results

No clinically relevant effects on the exposure were seen for sex, age, race, ethnicity, renal function, or injection site used, and semaglutide exposure was stable over time. Of the covariates chosen, only body weight had a relevant effect on the exposure of semaglutide. Few subjects developed semaglutide antibodies, and the antibodies had no effect on exposure. Dose proportionality was shown for the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg maintenance doses of semaglutide.

Conclusion

The population pharmacokinetic study showed that semaglutide exposure is not affected by covariates other than body weight at either a maintenance dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mg semaglutide. Therefore, we conclude that no semaglutide dose adjustments are needed in different populations. This finding is to be further explored in an exposure-response analysis.

Trial Registration

The trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifiers: NCT02054897, NCT01930188, NCT01885208, NCT01720446 and NCT02207374).

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 analog ecnoglutide in adults with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^114mtRDn]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Compared with other GLP-1 based therapies, ecnoglutide showed comparable or greater HbA1c reductions at all three doses tested. Change from baseline in HbA1c was −1.81, −1.90, and −2.39% for ecnoglutide (0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 mg at 20 weeks). This compared to −0.84 to −1.14% reported for liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg at 52 weeks), −1.45 to −1.55% for semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg at 30 weeks), −1.86% for semaglutide (1.0 mg at 40 weeks), and −1.25 to −1.46% for dulaglutide (0.75 and 1.5 mg at 26 weeks). In these studies, the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c concentration < 7.0% was 43–51% for liraglutide, 72–74% for semaglutide, and 63–72% for dulaglutide, compared to 68–84% seen here for ecnoglutide. Ecnoglutide (1.2 mg) also showed comparable HbA1c reductions to the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, tirzepatide. Tirzepatide at 5, 10, and 15 mg weekly resulted in −2.01, −2.24, and −2.30% HbA1c reductions, respectively, from baseline to 40 weeks.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) initiation — monitoring and coadministration guidance is emphasized as follows: Patients initiating a GLP-1RA should be informed that transient nausea is a relatively common side effect, and nausea and vomiting can be minimized by starting with the lowest dose, up-titrating gradually according to the label recommendations, ceasing up titration when the nausea becomes uncomfortable, and eating smaller portions; a low-fat diet can also help. This nausea does not imply gastrointestinal pathology and is usually self-limited in patients treated with longer-acting GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RAs should be used with caution in patients who have had problems with clinically significant gastroparesis, and if treatment is suspended, reinitiation should again be at the lowest dose, with gradual up-titration to avoid recurrent nausea and vomiting. GLP-1RA should not be coadministered with DPP4 inhibitors given that both work through GLP-1 signaling and have not been studied for use together. An increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications has been noted with semaglutide, predominantly in patients with a prior history of proliferative retinopathy; therefore, these patients should have regular eye examinations, as recommended by the current guidelines.
