## Question

This question refers to the following information.
"Lincoln was strongly anti-slavery, but he was not an abolitionist or a Radical Republican and never claimed to be one. He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner".
— Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010
Which of these statements best describes the Emancipation Proclamation?

Answer Choices:
A. It guaranteed the freedom of all slaves living within the boundaries of the United States at the conclusion of the Civil War.
B. It freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion against the United States at the time it was issued.
C. It declared that the freedom of the slaves was conditional upon the agreement of individual southern states to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. government.
D. It prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both the Union and Confederate Armies.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement best describes the Emancipation Proclamation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact wording and scope of the Emancipation Proclamation. Then, I should verify which states and regions it actually applied to and whether it was immediate or conditional. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that factual baseline. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the best option, making sure I anchor the reasoning in the provided sources.

> Let me first confirm the core facts. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, declared that all persons held as slaves within states or designated parts of states in rebellion against the United States were, and henceforward shall be, free, and it specifically excluded loyal border states and already Union-occupied areas, which means it did not apply to the entire country at that moment [^112RSdTq] [^114D3Rcr].

> Wait, let me verify the scope and timing so I don't overstate it. The Proclamation's freedom was immediate for those in the designated rebellious areas, but it was a wartime executive act under the President's war powers and did not by itself abolish slavery nationwide; that required the 13th Amendment, which Lincoln later championed, so any option implying universal, nationwide freedom at the war's end would be incorrect for 1863 [^114D3Rcr] [^115WTn74].

> Now, Option A claims it guaranteed freedom for all slaves in the United States at the war's conclusion. Hold on, I should double-check that. The Proclamation did not cover loyal slave states like Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, nor did it guarantee freedom everywhere; it was a military measure targeting Confederate-held territory, with nationwide abolition coming later via the 13th Amendment, so A is too broad and therefore incorrect [^114D3Rcr] [^115WTn74].

> Option B says it freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion at the time it was issued. Let me consider whether that matches the text. Yes, the Proclamation explicitly named the rebellious states and applied to those areas, while exempting loyal border states and Union-occupied regions, so B aligns with the actual scope and timing of the order [^112RSdTq] [^114D3Rcr].

> Option C proposes that freedom was conditional on southern states signing peace treaties. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify whether there was such a condition. The Proclamation declared freedom immediately for those in rebellion; it did not make emancipation contingent on peace treaties, so C introduces a condition that wasn't in the document and is not accurate [^112RSdTq] [^114D3Rcr].

> Option D states it prohibited the use of slaves in combat in both armies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether the Proclamation addressed military service at all. The Proclamation did not prohibit combat use of enslaved people; rather, it opened the door for formerly enslaved persons to be received into the Union armed forces, which is the opposite of a prohibition, so D is incorrect [^1152cay7].

> Putting this together, the best answer is B, because it precisely reflects that the Emancipation Proclamation freed enslaved people only in those states and parts of states still in rebellion, effective immediately upon issuance, while excluding loyal border states and not guaranteeing universal abolition until the 13th Amendment [^112RSdTq] [^114D3Rcr] [^115WTn74].

---

The Emancipation Proclamation **freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion** against the United States at the time it was issued [^112RSdTq], and it did not apply to loyal border states or areas already under Union control [^114D3Rcr]. It was a wartime measure justified by Lincoln's authority as commander-in-chief [^114D3Rcr], not a universal declaration of freedom, and it did not end slavery nationwide — that required the 13th Amendment [^115WTn74].

---

## Scope and limitations of the Emancipation Proclamation

The Emancipation Proclamation **applied only to states and regions in rebellion** against the Union, specifically targeting Confederate-held territories [^112RSdTq]. It explicitly excluded loyal border states such as Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, where slavery remained legal despite their allegiance to the Union [^114D3Rcr]. Additionally, areas already under Union control were exempt from the proclamation's provisions [^114D3Rcr].

---

## Legal and political context

Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under his authority as commander-in-chief [^114D3Rcr], framing it as a **necessary war measure** to weaken the Confederacy by depriving it of its labor force [^1152cay7]. This approach reflected Lincoln's careful navigation of constitutional constraints, as he recognized that the federal government lacked the authority to abolish slavery outright in peacetime [^114D3Rcr]. The proclamation was therefore a strategic military action rather than a comprehensive legal mandate to end slavery nationwide [^1152cay7].

---

## Impact on slavery

While the Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately free all enslaved individuals, it fundamentally transformed the character of the Civil War by **redefining it as a struggle against slavery** [^1152cay7]. It paved the way for the eventual abolition of slavery through the 13th Amendment, which was ratified in 1865 [^115WTn74]. The proclamation also authorized the enlistment of African American men into the Union Army, further undermining the Confederacy's ability to sustain its war effort [^1152cay7].

---

## Misconceptions and clarifications

A common misconception is that the Emancipation Proclamation **immediately freed all slaves in the United States** [^notfound]. In reality, it only applied to specific regions in rebellion and did not address slavery in loyal states or areas under Union control [^114D3Rcr]. Its significance lies in its symbolic and strategic impact, rather than in immediate, universal emancipation [^114D3Rcr].

---

## Conclusion

The Emancipation Proclamation **freed only the slaves in states and portions of states in rebellion** against the United States at the time it was issued [^112RSdTq]. It was a wartime measure that applied only to Confederate-held territories, excluding loyal border states and areas under Union control [^114D3Rcr]. Its lasting impact was in reshaping the Civil War and setting the stage for the complete abolition of slavery through the 13th Amendment [^115WTn74].

### Genetic consequences of the transatlantic slave trade in the americas [^113oykSN]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Potential Inconsistencies with Historical Documents

While genetic connections between African populations and individuals from the Americas are strongly correlated with historical documents (Figure 2 A), a granular breakdown of disembarkation in discrete regions of the Americas identifies discordance. For example, ms IBD with the Bights of Benin and Biafra, as well as Nigerian ancestry, is overrepresented in the United States and Latin America considering the recorded number of enslaved people that embarked from ports along the coast of present-day Nigeria into these regions of the Americas (Figures 2 B and 3). However, this discordance is explained by records from the intra-American slave trade, an intercolonial trade that occurred primarily between 1619 and 1807 whose impact has recently been understood through collections of port records, newspapers, and merchant accounts from disparate parts of the Americas. Documented intra-American voyages indicate that the vast majority of enslaved people were transported from the British Caribbean to other parts of the Americas, presumably to maintain the slave economy as transatlantic slave trading was increasingly prohibited (Figure S13). These voyages would spread African ancestry common in the British Caribbean to other regions of the Americas that were not in direct trade with specific regions of Africa. In Latin America, transatlantic slave trading voyages virtually ceased between 1660 and 1780, yet a large proportion of all documented captives continued to be transported throughout the early 1800s to Latin America primarily from the British Caribbean. In the United States, nearly 10% of the total enslaved population arrived via intra-America trading with the British Caribbean and consequently ms IBD between the United States and the British Caribbean (primarily the Bahamas, British Windward, and Leeward Islands) is high (Figure S14). Therefore, embarkation out of Africa and ms IBD between Africa and all of the Americas is correlated (Figure 2 A), whereas disembarkation in specific regions of the Americas and ms IBD with Africa are not consistently correlated (Figure 2 B) because of the asymmetric transportation of enslaved people within the Americas.

### The hookworm blues: we still got' em [^11166mvg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Many Americans are unaware that tropical diseases in the classical sense were historically endemic throughout North America after the introduction of various diseases by European settlers and their African slaves. Malaria was prevalent from the Gulf of Mexico to northern Canada by the seventeenth century. Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, wrote classic descriptions of both dengue and yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia. These diseases traveled with settlers as they made their westward migration but never became as well established in other parts of the country. While there were short periods of re-establishment of malaria in the North after Federal soldiers returned home from the South after the Civil War, and a yellow fever outbreak moved from New Orleans as far north as Ohio in 1878, these had largely become southern diseases by the mid-nineteenth century. Malaria became established as a normal part of rural life in much of the deep South, where agricultural practices maintained persistent exposure to the vector. Outbreaks of dengue were fairly common in port cities throughout the South and began spreading across Texas in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Outbreaks of yellow fever, which occurred with frightening regularity, were especially problematic for port cities in the South, as the risk of yellow fever and subsequent quarantine of goods created a negative economic incentive for merchants to use those ports. Although transmission of some diseases was in decline, thanks to the "Great Sanitary Awakening" of the nineteenth century, the discovery of the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of yellow fever and malaria led to more purposeful and successful efforts that dramatically decreased transmission of these diseases. The last outbreak of yellow fever in a U.S. city was in New Orleans in 1905, the last recorded outbreaks of dengue were in Louisiana in 1945, and the United States was subsequently declared free from the endemic transmission of malaria in 1951.

### A historical examination of military records of US army suicide, 1819 to 2017 [^114fNRW8]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

This report has limitations. While every effort was made to only include active-duty members as categorized by the US Army, that designation presumably included militia service members in the 19th century, and from the 1960s to the 1980s, US Army reporting undoubtedly included individuals who served as reservists as well. Nevertheless, the study focused on tracking suicide rates for active-duty service members in the US Army, however the military chose to define them. These intermittent fluctuations in population should not undermine the study's integrity. Furthermore, suicide presents a 2-sided and pernicious challenge as a concept of study: completed suicides do not typically document their cause, and tracking the reduction of suicide rates is documenting nonevents. Working with historical data is inherently problematic, and caution is to be urged because, then as now, there is a level of uncertainty in the determination of suicide. However, as Assistant Surgeon General of the US Army J. J. Woodward wrote in 1870 in the Medical and Surgical History of the War of Rebellion, 1861–1865, while the medical data "are most imperfect, they embrace so large a proportion of the troops concerned that they cannot fail to serve fairly as a reliable basis for deductions with regard to the health of the whole army". Woodward later added that any inconsistencies in data should "not be looked upon as oversights or errors on the part of those to whom preparation of the tables was entrusted. They are the necessary consequence of the fidelity with which the facts, as reported, were consolidated". We place faith in the fidelity of historical reporting, as admittedly imperfect as it was. Discussions of what constitutes a fact aside, this study focused on changes and paradigm shifts during long periods more than on attempting to claim with absolute certainty each annual return — something cautioned against even in modern military and medical reporting.

Nevertheless, seeing the value in producing these reports more frequently, the next Statistical Report on the Sickness and Mortality in the Army of the United States covered 16 years (1839–1855), and shortly thereafter, a third Statistical Report on the Sickness and Mortality in the Army of the United States examined 5 years (1855–1860). By 1843, the US Army began tracking suicide among service members with enough confidence to include annual totals in their published statistical reports. In 1856, the introduction to the second Statistical Report on the Sickness and Mortality in the Army of the United States noted that "although it was possible to exhibit with accuracy the entire amount of sickness and mortality… the utility of such statistics would not be commiserate with the very great amount of labor necessary to their competition". In this way, the US Army Surgeon General Office acknowledged its belief in the veracity of their medical reporting, but given the time and resources needed, they questioned the utility and practicality — something US Army Surgeon General Offices in the 20th century would do for similar reasons. The office also acknowledged that the US Army medical reporting system was incapable of detailed medical tracking during the active combat of the Mexican-American War (1846–1848). This underscores the impressive improvements and expansion of capacity required to produce the medically and militarily groundbreaking Medical and Surgical History of the War of Rebellion, 1861–1865, a detailed record of illnesses, combat injuries, and behavioral health problems compiled by the Union Army during the significantly larger and longer US Civil War (1861–1865).

Regional Discordance

Our results indicate that African ancestry and ms IBD do not vary much within broad regions of the Americas despite enslaved people disembarking at different rates in different ports. This observation is expected, given that slavers transported enslaved people regionally, and extensive local migration followed the transatlantic slave trade. For instance, the domestic slave trade in the United States between 1790 and 1860 would see the transportation of one million enslaved people across the southeastern United States. Similarly, "The Trail of Tears" would force Native Americans and the enslaved people they owned west toward Oklahoma. Also, the "Great Migrations" that occurred between 1916 and 1970 to escape segregation and poor economic conditions would bring former slaves and their descendants to all parts of the Northeast and Midwest United States(Figure S16). Similar movements occurred elsewhere such as migrations from northeastern Brazil (Bahia and Pernambuco) to southern and central Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais-Goiás). These large migrations could easily obscure pre-existing local population structure in African-descendant communities as a result of admixture. Because the majority of individuals in this study have connections to multiple populations in Atlantic Africa, it is unlikely that members of distinct African communities remained isolated from one another after they reached the Americas. However, based on limited marriage records of enslaved people, it is likely that communities from distinct Atlantic African regions initially remained isolated, but interbred later, which would lead to genetic evidence of post-transport mixing of African populations over generations.

Despite extensive genetic evidence of internal or local migrations, we found no evidence for long-distance migrations between broad regions in the Americas after disembarkation except between the United States and the British Caribbean (Figures S5, S6, and S15). Representative individuals in the United States and British Caribbean share little IBD with those in Latin America, and very little IBD sharing is found between regions within Latin America. This is striking when comparing the British Caribbean to the Latin Caribbean: although some countries are geographically proximate (e.g. Haiti and the Dominican Republic), ancestry estimates and IBD connections within the Americas and to Atlantic Africa differ substantially.

### Expanding opportunities for American descendants of slavery to build a more inclusive and diverse global health workforce [^116nbook]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Historically, the terms African American and Black have been used interchangeably to describe any person with African ancestry living in the United States. However, Black Americans are not a monolith, and legitimate differences exist between those with generational roots in the United States and either African or Caribbean immigrants. American descendants of slavery (ADOS) are underrepresented in many fields, but I have noticed during my decades long career in global health that they are acutely absent in this field. Here, I offer seven recommendations to improve recruitment, retention, and advancement of ADOS in the global health field. Immediate implementation of these recommendations will not only bring diverse perspectives and immense capacity to the field but also allow ADOS an opportunity to engage in compelling and meaningful work and to collaborate with those from their ancestral homelands.

Methods

Study Overview

Historical cross-sectional data were extracted from US government publications and journal articles published from 1840 to 2018. Specifically, 19th-century data came from US Army Surgeon General annual and periodic statistical reports, and the Medical and Surgical History of the War of Rebellion, 1861–1865. Data from the 20th and 21st centuries incorporated sources from US military health and personnel readiness reports and academic journals. Overall, raw annual rates for the 19th century until World War I came from US Army Surgeon General publications, while the rates for World War I until 2017 draw on additional military medical sources. These latter sources were compiled by 1 of us (M.D.), a Department of Defense historian who worked alongside Department of Defense epidemiologists in compiling data beginning in 2001. The author (M.D.) had direct access to the Department of Defense Suicide Event Report data as well as to the epidemiologists who created it. In historically contextualizing the US Army's data, the author (M.D.) tracked the increase in sophistication over time. Because the data in this study were publicly available, deidentified historical data, this research was exempt from institutional review board review per Common Rule, and approval of ethical considerations for the protection of human subjects was not required nor were informed consent forms collected. This study complies with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data Sources

While efforts to create a singular repository for tracking military suicide are relatively new, individual branches of the US military have tracked suicide among active-duty personnel with varying degrees of interest and analysis since the early 19th century. Although undertaken in an effort to identify causal links between health and climate to formulate "a system of medical geography", the Statistical Report on the Sickness and Mortality in the Army of the United States used US Army "vital statistics of the troops extending over a period of twenty years"(ie, 1819–1839). In doing so, the statistical report explicitly recorded the first US Army suicides in the decade from 1829 to 1839. Unfortunately, the Surgeon General Office pooled the suicide data into multiyear date ranges associated with specific forts and barracks across the United States because the military was more concerned with associated data and geography than with investigating armywide trends.

### The ancestry and geographical origins of ST helena's liberated Africans [^111tvpX7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between the 16 th and 19 th centuries, over 12.5 million Africans were abducted from their homelands in Africa to be sold into slavery in the Americas. Historical records have revealed a great deal about the changing volume and structure of the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans, but where in Africa they originated has been much more difficult to ascertain. Recently, ancient and modern DNA studies have started to provide new information on the ancestral origins and experiences of enslaved Africans and their descendants in the Americas and elsewhere. Meanwhile, archaeologists have stressed the importance and value of involving descendant communities in study design and research, as modeled on the New York African Burial Ground Project and others.,

The island of St Helena in the South Atlantic played a crucial role in the history of the transatlantic slave trade and its abolition. Between 1840 and 1867, St Helena received approximately 27,000 "liberated Africans" who had been rescued from slave ships by the Royal Navy (Figure 1; Table S1). Most of these individuals did not stay long on the island, as they were moved on to South Africa or the British colonies in the Caribbean and South America as indentured laborers. However, a small number of liberated Africans were allowed to settle on the island and, of those who did, many lived well into the 20 th century. While there is no recognized descendant community on the island today, it is clear that hundreds if not thousands of descendants of St Helena's liberated Africans must exist on as well as off the island.

### The genetic ancestry of African Americans, latinos, and European Americans across the United States [^112vh59z]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past 500 years, North America has been the site of ongoing mixing of Native Americans, European settlers, and Africans (brought largely by the trans-Atlantic slave trade), shaping the early history of what became the United States. We studied the genetic ancestry of 5,269 self-described African Americans, 8,663 Latinos, and 148,789 European Americans who are 23andMe customers and show that the legacy of these historical interactions is visible in the genetic ancestry of present-day Americans. We document pervasive mixed ancestry and asymmetrical male and female ancestry contributions in all groups studied. We show that regional ancestry differences reflect historical events, such as early Spanish colonization, waves of immigration from many regions of Europe, and forced relocation of Native Americans within the US. This study sheds light on the fine-scale differences in ancestry within and across the United States and informs our understanding of the relationship between racial and ethnic identities and genetic ancestry.

### Medical specimens and the erasure of racial violence: the case of harriet cole [^112UN5fu]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Grave robbing

Defilement of the graves of African-Americans was only one way that deep-seated structural racism shaped the lives and afterlives of African-Americans in late nineteenth-century Philadelphia. The long shadow of slavery in American society continued to define black people as inferior, pathological, criminal and ultimately ungovernable. Just as white social scientists — political scientists, criminologists and anthropologists — identified the failings of individual black people for high rates of crime, physicians and public health experts blamed the same individuals for failing to take the necessary steps to prevent disease and injury, all the while ignoring the structural factors — environment, housing, low wages, poor diets — that resulted in much higher rates of diseases such as tuberculosis. As a working-class black woman in Philadelphia, Harriet Cole experienced the brutality and violence of everyday life in an urban landscape that afforded her little visibility in the traditional archive.

When Harriet Cole died in March of 1888, 5 years had passed since a notorious grave robbing scandal rocked Philadelphia. Louis Megargee, editor of the short-lived muck-raking Philadelphia Press, and several of his reporters staked out the Lebanon Cemetery, a burial ground for African-Americans, to catch grave robbers in the act. During the spring of 1882, they regularly watched the cemetery get plundered of the bodies of the newly dead, but only set up a plan to catch the culprits in late November of that year. On the night of Monday, 4 December, they apprehended three men — one African-American and one white man who did the digging, and one white wagon driver — carrying the exhumed bodies of four black men and two black women in a wagon bound for Jefferson Medical College.

### Medical specimens and the erasure of racial violence: the case of harriet cole [^117CafFz]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

The white press devoted considerably more attention to the final requests of African-Americans legally sentenced to death for their crimes against the state. Whereas some newspaper accounts recorded the soon-to-be executeds' fear that their bodies would be turned over for dissection, others reported that some of these individuals — both men and women — were able to direct the transfer of their bodies to doctors and surgeons either for 'science' or for financial considerations.

White newspapers allocated generous press to the executions of black women. Like the more numerous stories covering the execution of black men, these stories reflected the white press's desire to emphasise that the state could subject the recently enslaved to harsh punishments. In 1881, when Lucinda Fowlkes was hanged in Virginia for the murder of her husband, her execution received substantial coverage in local papers. But the hanging of the 'colored murderess' also became front-page news in Philadelphia, Wilmington, Washington, DC, and in cities across the Midwest. Although the New York Times did not feature a lengthy story about Fowlkes' crime and execution on the front page (it appeared on page 2), the paper included information about her final disposition. After her body was taken down from the gallows, it was placed in a 'rude coffin, and buried near the jail'. Because 'the woman had consented that the doctors might have it', the paper predicted it would be 'taken up' after dark, or, as another reporter noted, 'resurrected' (: 2 2).

### Protecting the health of United States military forces in Afghanistan: applying lessons learned since the gulf war [^112QWizk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Four weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, US combat troops began bombing missions over Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. Additional Reserve and National Guard personnel were called to active duty to support the war effort and to ensure security throughout the United States. All of these troops will require health care and assistance during and after this war on terrorism. They will benefit from recent federal legislation that has increased access to health care and from the changes implemented by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs since the Gulf War. An innovative Defense Department "Force Health Protection" strategy places greater emphasis on helping service members and families stay healthy and fit and on preventing injury and illness. The two agencies also have developed new post-deployment clinical practice guidelines, established deployment research centers, and made further improvements in preventive medicine, health surveillance, and risk communication and are thus better prepared for this newest generation of war veterans.

### Presidency of abraham… [^115WTn74]. Wikipedia (2007). Low credibility.

Lincoln was called on to handle both the political and military aspects of the Civil War, facing challenges in both spheres. As commander-in-chief, he ordered the suspension of the constitutionally protected right to habeas corpus in the state of Maryland in order to suppress Confederate sympathizers. He also became the first president to institute a military draft. As the Union faced several early defeats in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War, Lincoln cycled through numerous military commanders during the war, finally settling on General Ulysses S. Grant, who had led the Union to several victories in the Western Theater. Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation recognized the legal freedom of the 3. 5 million slaves then held in Confederate territory and established emancipation as a Union war goal. In 1865, Lincoln was instrumental in the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which made slavery unconstitutional.

Lincoln also presided over the passage of important domestic legislation, including the first of the Homestead Acts, the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862, and the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. Lincoln spent much of 1859 and 1860 building support for his candidacy, and his Cooper Union speech was well received by eastern elites. Lincoln positioned himself in the "moderate center" of his party; he opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories but accepted the consensus that the federal government could not abolish slavery in the slave states. Delegates then nominated Senator Hannibal Hamlin from Maine for vice president. The party platform opposed the extension of slavery into the territories but pledged not to interfere with it in the states. It also endorsed a protective tariff, internal improvements such as a transcontinental railroad, and policies designed to encourage the settlement of public land in the West.

President Buchanan declared that secession was illegal but denied that the government had any power to resist it. Lincoln had no official power to act while the secession crisis escalated. Nevertheless, Lincoln was barraged with advice. Many wanted him to provide reassurances to the South that its interests were not being threatened. Realizing that soothing words on the rights of slaveholders would alienate the Republican base, while taking a strong stand on the indestructibility of the Union would further inflame Southerners, Lincoln chose a policy of silence. In December 1860, both the House and Senate formed special committees to address the unfolding crisis. Lincoln communicated with various Congressmen that there was room for negotiation on issues such as fugitive slaves, slavery in the District of Columbia, and the domestic slave trade.

However he made it clear that he was unalterably opposed to anything which would allow the expansion of slavery into any new states or territories. On December 6, Lincoln wrote to Congressman Orlando Kellogg, a Republican on the special House committee, saying that Kellogg should "entertain no proposition for a compromise in regard to the extension of slavery. The instant you do, they have us under again; all our labor is lost, and sooner or later must be done over. Douglas is sure to be again trying to bring in his. Have none of it. The tug has to come & better now than later". Congress would be forbidden from abolishing slavery in any state or interfering with the domestic slave trade. Despite pressure from Seward, Lincoln refused to support the compromise. Still opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories, Lincoln privately asked Republican Senators to oppose the compromise, and it failed to pass Congress.

Lincoln went on to win the general election by winning the vast majority of the electoral votes cast by Northern states. In response to Lincoln's opposition to the expansion of slavery into the western territories, seven Southern states seceded, and the American Civil War commenced in the second month of Lincoln's presidency. Four additional states then seceded. Lincoln won election to the House of Representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.

Emergence as Republican leader The debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding South and the North, and the Compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. In the early 1850s, Lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for Henry Clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue. For months after its passage, Lincoln did not publicly comment on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, but he came to strongly oppose it. On October 16, 1854, in his "Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself.

I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world. " Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life. Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln would write in 1855, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. " Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists.

Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Eric Foner contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress.

The Oregon State Hospital, first established in 1862 as the Oregon Insane Asylum, was a state funded mental health institution that provided care and housing for a large and diverse patient population. In December 1941, the United States formally entered World War II. As wartime production and demands increased over the course of 1941 and into 1942, resources became more limited and budgets tightened. On the evening of November 18, 1942 hundreds of patient suddenly fell ill and dozens died. Initially it was unclear if this was an accident, a mass murder, or an act of sabotage related to the war effort. The investigation revealed that the casualties fell victim to a mass poisoning. Over the next months to years, there would be new State and Federal laws intended to prevent something like this from ever happening again.

### Babesia microti, upstate New York [^1135gESP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Babesiosis is a malarialike infection often caused in humans by the bite of an infected tick. Currently, most cases of human babesiosis in the United States occur in the northeastern and northern Midwest portions of the country and may be attributed to infection with Babesia microti. B. microti is maintained naturally through the same reservoir (the White-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus) and vector (the Black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis) as Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease in the United States.

Human cases of babesiosis caused by B. microti were first identified in the United States in coastal areas of the Northeast, including several islands off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts; in Rhode Island; and on Long Island, New York. Studies in Connecticut, Maine, and New Jersey have detected B. microti in other northeastern areas. In New Jersey, human cases have been reported from various inland locations across the state. In addition, B. microti has been identified in local populations of I. scapularis from the western portion of the state. B. microti has recently been found in local populations of White-footed mice collected in Connecticut. Detection of B. microti in Maine has been reported from the Southern Red-backed Vole (Clethrionomys gapperi), the Masked Shrew (Sorex cinereus), and the Northern Short-tail Shrew (Blarina brevicauda), as well as from questing I. scapularis.

### From battleside to stateside: the reconstructive journey of our wounded warriors [^1167cRjF]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Recent military operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom) have led to further refinements of the military medical system's ability to provide advanced surgical care. The deployment of a global trauma care system has directly contributed to improved combat casualty survival rates. As a consequence of improved survivorship, a high-volume patient population of individuals having challenging multiple extremity injuries/amputations has presented to military treatment facilities. These patients present with unique mixed pattern blast injuries. Blast injuries incorporate multiple mechanisms of injury including penetrating fragmentary injury, blunt force trauma, flash burn, and overpressure wave damage. These complex injuries have furthered refinements in traditional reconstruction and facilitated early application of regenerative medicine therapies.

### Abraham Lincoln-Wikipedia… [^112RSdTq]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

As a moderate Republican, Lincoln had to navigate conflicting political opinions from contentious factions during the war effort. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of Southern ports. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus in April 1861, an action that Chief Justice Roger Taney found unconstitutional in Ex parte Merryman, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states "in rebellion" to be free. On November 19, 1863, he delivered the Gettysburg Address, which became one of the most famous speeches in American history. He promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, which, in 1865, abolished chattel slavery. Re-elected in 1864, he sought to heal the war-torn nation through Reconstruction.

The only Whig in the Illinois delegation, he was assigned to the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department. Lincoln teamed with Joshua R. Giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, but dropped the bill when it failed to attract support from most other Whigs. Republican politics Emergence as Republican leader The Compromise of 1850 failed to alleviate tensions over slavery between the slave-holding South and the free North. As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery, but Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.

Lincoln's Peoria Speech of October 1854, in which he declared his opposition to slavery, was one of an estimated 175 speeches he delivered in the next six years on the topic of excluding slavery from the territories. Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life. I now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. " The new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to anti-slavery, drawing from the anti-slavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and anti-slavery Democratic Party members, Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists. 1856 campaign Violent political confrontations in Kansas continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North.

As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the Bloomington Convention, where the Illinois Republican Party was established. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power. He argued that the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence, which stated that "all men are created equal. with certain unalienable rights", among them "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness". The Senate campaign featured seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew thousands. Lincoln warned that the Slave Power was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting Jefferson's premise that all men are created equal.

### Applying an intersectional lens to alcohol inequities: a conceptual framework [^116hgH1d]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Historical context

Social categories, their significance and their interaction with factors beyond the individual level, evolve over time. For example, the definition of gender, the number of recognized gender categories, societal gender norms and laws/policies related to gender have all evolved significantly in recent years across many countries. To draw explicit attention to the influence of such historical factors on alcohol inequities, we incorporated a 'historical' level into the IAIF.

For instance, in the behaviour domain we highlight the impact of historical trauma, defined as 'cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over the lifespan and across generations, emanating from massive group trauma experiences'. In the US context, this is well documented within Native American communities in response to the brutal practices of colonization. Historical trauma can adversely affect the physical and mental health of descendants from historically oppressed groups and may lead to self‐destructive behaviours, including harmful alcohol use. While much of the US literature on historical trauma has focused on Native American populations, its effects can also be seen among other oppressed groups. For example, sexual minoritized groups may experience similar trauma responses owing to historical discrimination, including the criminalization and pathologization of homosexuality.

The influence of historical practices is also apparent in the healthcare domain. During colonial times, the justification for slavery and inhumane medical experimentation on Black individuals stemmed from the stereotype that they possess higher pain thresholds. This belief persists today, and may contribute to Black people receiving inadequate treatment for pain and mental health issues, both of which may motivate alcohol consumption. Furthermore, medical textbooks have historically over‐represented light skin tones, potentially leading to the misdiagnosis of conditions related to skin colour, such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin) in the context of liver cirrhosis.

### Implementation… [^114D3Rcr]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

The Emancipation Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery in all of the U. S. Lincoln also mandated that Reconstruction plans for Southern states require them to enact laws abolishing slavery; Lincoln encouraged border states to adopt abolition and pushed for passage of the 13th Amendment. Lincoln accepted the conventional interpretation of the Constitution before 1865 as not allowing the federal government in peacetime to end slavery in the states where it existed, as opposed to in U. S. territories and the District of Columbia. During the Civil War, however, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation under his authority as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy" under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution.

In the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln said "attention is hereby called" to two 1862 statutes, namely "An Act to Make an Additional Article of War" and the Confiscation Act of 1862, but he didn't mention any statute in the Final Emancipation Proclamation and, in any event, the source of his authority to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and the Final Emancipation Proclamation was his "joint capacity as President and Commander-in-Chief". Governmental action toward emancipation In December 1861, Lincoln sent his first annual message to Congress. In it he praised the free labor system for respecting human rights over property rights; he endorsed legislation to address the status of contraband slaves and slaves in loyal states, possibly through buying their freedom with federal money; and he endorsed federal funding of voluntary colonization.

On June 9, 1862, Congress passed a bill that prohibited slavery in all current and future United States territories, and, on June 19, President Lincoln signed it into law. This act effectively repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott case that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U. S. territories. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free. It was one of Lincoln's most skillful public relations efforts, even if it has cast longstanding doubt on his sincerity as a liberator. " Historian Richard Striner argues that "for years" Lincoln's letter has been misread as "Lincoln only wanted to save the Union. " However, within the context of Lincoln's entire career and pronouncements on slavery this interpretation is wrong, according to Striner.

Rather, Lincoln was softening the strong Northern white supremacist opposition to his imminent emancipation by tying it to the cause of the Union. This opposition would fight for the Union but not to end slavery, so Lincoln gave them the means and motivation to do both, at the same time. In effect, then, Lincoln may have already chosen the third option he mentioned to Greeley: "freeing some and leaving others alone"; that is, freeing slaves in the states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, but leaving enslaved those in the border states and Union-occupied areas. Nevertheless, in the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation itself, Lincoln said that he would recommend to Congress that it compensate states that "adopt, immediate, or gradual abolishment of slavery".

### Joseph lister and his 1876 tour of America [^115eCCjj]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the events and people that shaped Joseph Lister's 1876 tour of America and how the journey became a landmark episode in the history of surgery.

Background

In a little known chapter in American medical history, Joseph Lister toured the United States in 1876 in an attempt to convince physicians that they should accept his ideas about surgical antisepsis. His 2 month-long visit, which included a transcontinental railroad trip across the North American continent, sparked controversy as doctors struggled to understand the relationship between bacteria and disease.

Methods

An analysis of the published medical and lay literature and unpublished documents pertaining to Lister and antisepsis for the 15-year period, from 1865 to 1880.

Results

Joseph Lister's 1876 tour of America proved a turning point in the slow process of accepting the principles of antisepsis by the nation's doctors. This visit laid the foundation for the blossoming of medical care in America and the remarkable advances that followed.

Conclusions

Among the most debated topics in the American medical world of 1876 was whether to accept Joseph Lister's principles of surgical antisepsis. He was invited to address the issue and gave a series of lectures in Philadelphia, Boston, and New York. The presentations marked the beginning of a significant change in American physicians' awareness of the correlation between wounds, germs, and pus. Lister's visit is a crucial milestone in the history of medicine.

### Is it about the 'where' or the ' how'? Comment on… [^113kZtV1]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Why practise somewhere else?

The authors raise relevant and justifiable concerns regarding some common assumptions among global health practitioners. First, we agree that the oft-assumed 'expertise gradient' is problematic and maintains an ill-conceived notion of the foreign expert. This presumes that global health is practised by foreign experts in distant lands, flowing directionally from high-income experts to low-income recipients. While we reject this notion, we acknowledge the importance of exchanging knowledge and sharing experiences. In fact, health problems are often shared, transcend geographical boundaries, and can be better addressed by working together across various cultural, social or political perspectives. Moreover, highlighting the assumption that those from outside have more valuable knowledge suggests that the authors have not adequately acknowledged the increasing trend to work in partnership with governments and local organisations, placing local and foreign expertise on at least the same level. Thus, how global health is practised is, in our view, just as important as where it is practised.

Second, working somewhere else may result in someone having less cultural proficiency or professional regulation — rendering them less accountable to their intended beneficiaries — than when working at home. While this is certainly a problem when it occurs abroad, it is important to note that accountability issues can also arise at home. Marginalised, vulnerable or at-risk populations, including those within high-income countries, are intervened on without the same ability to demand accountability of the person or organisation delivering the intervention. Furthermore, emerging trends in global health rely increasingly on a country-level or regional-level expertise, rather than bringing advisors from further afield who may lack contextual understanding. We therefore contend that, once again, the how is just as important as the where in this context.

Third, the global health industry often preserves its idealistic desire to 'help' at the expense of efficiency. It is certainly important to consider how resources are being consumed, particularly in resource-constrained areas. Yet we should also consider how resource constraint is a direct result of historical events such as slavery, colonisation and the development of the neoliberal economic order, the resultant moral obligation of which should account for at least some of the justification of global health interventions. Thus, global health practitioners should be sensitive to such histories and work towards redressing these structural ills, for example, through systems advocacy and strengthening.

### Vital signs: trends in human rabies deaths and exposures-United States, 1938–2018 [^116j9wwQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of oral rabies vaccine, composed of vaccine wrapped in a flavored bait, has been successful in controlling westward spread of raccoon rabies. * However, outside oral rabies vaccination zones, raccoon rabies virus variant accounts for nearly 75% of the terrestrial animal rabies cases reported in the United States. In areas where both raccoon and bat rabies occur, human rabies exposures are 600% higher than in areas where only bat rabies occurs.

Although domestic animal exposures account for a large portion of human PEP usage, bat rabies virus variants are responsible for most human rabies deaths in the United States. This apparent paradox might be due to several factors, including lack of awareness of the risk of acquiring rabies from bats, or difficulty identifying bat bites and scratches. This analysis highlights current rabies risks in the United States, and assesses the cost and public health impact of rabies control efforts.

Providing care for children in immigrant families — global and US migration context notes that in 2016, half of the 22.5 million refugees worldwide were 18 years or younger, and less than 1% are resettled annually, with humanitarian crises exemplified by the displacement of nearly 12 million Syrians by the end of 2015. The number of refugees entering the United States is set annually by Congress and the president and has historically fluctuated, and all 50 states, with the exception of Wyoming, have refugee resettlement programs. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was developed to allow young adults who arrived as children without legal status to apply for deportation relief and work permits, whereas the related Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) was halted in federal courts and subsequently rescinded by presidential executive order before implementation. In 2017, new executive orders focused on heightened immigration enforcement, increased border security, and limits to the US refugee program, and changes to temporary protected status (TPS) created uncertainty for the nearly 320 000 TPS beneficiaries and their families.

### Environmental exposures relative to locally acquired hansen disease, United States [^111XFuHM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Hansen disease (HD), commonly known as leprosy, is caused by Mycobacterium leprae. HD is diagnosed in approximately 150–200 persons in the United States annually, with a recent high of 225 cases in 2023, and the disease is diagnosed in 200,000 persons globally. HD leads to nerve damage if left untreated, highlighting the need for early diagnosis.

Recent literature shows increasing incidence of HD in Florida, and case reports name Florida as a site of travel or residence in persons receiving an HD diagnosis elsewhere in the United States. In addition, a study in Georgia showed a recent increase in cases relating to US-born patients. The 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), the only known animal reservoir of M. leprae in North America, is the suspected source of locally acquired cases (through molecular epidemiology) in the southeast and Gulf states of the United States. M. leprae can persist in free-living amoebae in soil, serving as another potential reservoir for human infection, which might explain the connection between human infections and the armadillo reservoir.

Recognizing a need to increase epidemiologic understanding of HD in the United States, we describe environmental exposures among patients from the southern portion of the country with suspected locally acquired HD infections. We also highlight clinical and demographic differences between cases involving US-born and immigrant persons.

### Epidemiology of human plague in the United States, 1900–2012 [^115qHzkm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Plague is a globally distributed, zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. In the late 1890s, rat-infested steamships introduced the disease into the continental United States. The first documented autochthonous human infection occurred in the Chinatown section of San Francisco, California, in March of 1900. Cases were soon reported in other port cities, including New Orleans, Galveston, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Along the Pacific Coast, infection spread from urban rats to native rodent species, and by the 1950s, Y. pestis had spread eastward to reach western portions of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. This distribution has remained static for > 60 years, presumably the result of climatic and ecologic factors that limit further spread (,–). Although poorly defined, these factors may be related to the ecology of vector species rather than that of rodent hosts.

The history of human plague in the United States provides a unique opportunity for long-term study of a zoonotic disease introduced onto a continent. Although the medical and scientific literature has detailed case histories and epidemiologic findings of plague cases in the United States, most reports have been limited in geographic scope or time frame We use data from all reported human plague cases in the United States during 1900–2012 to summarize and describe changes in the epidemiology of plague since its introduction.

### The unethical Texas heartbeat law [^113gVJU5]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

2 THE HISTORY OF THE ACT

To date, 13 US states have enacted 'heartbeat laws'. Until now, all these laws have been struck down by state supreme courts and the US Supreme Court. According to Evans and Narasimhan, US fetal heartbeat bills have increasingly become the anti‐abortion legislative measure of choice, since they were first introduced in 2011. The legislative models adopted by other states were framed in a way which would allow individuals to sue state officials for enforcing an unconstitutional law because these laws directly challenged the federal protection under Roe v Wade, which recognizes the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion up to fetal viability as part of the constitutional right to privacy. The Texas law, however, adopts a different framing. The 'clever' drafting of the Act and privatization of enforcement means that judicial review can be evadedand state officials are shielded from being sued for violating the constitution, which arguably makes the law more durable and difficult to challenge.

The Law was passed in May 2021, and was signed by Texas Governor, Greg Abbott (Republican), who said:

"Our creator endowed us with the right to life and yet millions of children lose their right to life every year because of abortion. In Texas, we work to save those lives".

The day before the ban came into effect many women raced against the clock to secure an abortion. One abortion clinic reportedly performed 67 abortions in 17 h to beat the new ban. In a midnight ruling on 1 September, 2021, just prior to when the Act was due to come into force, the US Supreme Court refused to block the legislation, despite appeals from reproductive rights organizations, civil rights organizations, and abortion clinics. The Supreme Court's 5‐4 decision reflected its newly conservative leaning shaped by former president Donald Trump. The Supreme Court claimed that it was not ruling on the constitutionality of the Texas law, but was allowing it to go ahead because of complex legal and procedural questions.

The Act came into effect on 1 September, 2021. Following its introduction, there have been several legal challenges; however, no challenge has been successful to date. In December 2021, the US Supreme Court left the door open for future challenges in lower courts on narrow grounds, which was subsequently shut down by the Texas Supreme Court in March 2022.

Presents the 2015 Annual Report of the American Psychological Association. In his introduction, President Barry Anton describes how 2015 was among APA's most challenging. Although 2015 ushered in an era of greater transparency within the association and enhanced communications to members and the public, it also required painful self-reflection stemming from the revelations of an independent review by an outside law firm. The review examined the question of whether APA played any role related to the Bush administration's use of abusive interrogation techniques during the war on terror. Anton's introduction also discusses (1) the APA convention, (2) representing APA at a White House meeting with health care providers and insurance companies, (3) APA's effort to increase the number of APA-accredited internships, (4) international activities, and (5) the global summit on psychology and integrated care.

### Notes from the field: hospitalizations for respiratory disease among unaccompanied children from central America-multiple States, June-July 2014 [^113mf4QC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

During October 2013-June 2014, approximately 54,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, were identified attempting entry into the United States from Mexico, exceeding numbers reported in previous years. Once identified in the United States, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, processes the unaccompanied children and transfers them to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), an office of the Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ORR cares for the children in shelters until they can be released to a sponsor, typically a parent or relative, who can care for the child while their immigration case is processed. In June 2014, in response to the increased number of unaccompanied children, U.S. Customs and Border Protection expanded operations to accommodate children at a processing center in Nogales, Arizona. ORR, together with the U.S. Department of Defense, opened additional large temporary shelters for the children at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; U.S. Army Garrison Ft. Sill, Oklahoma; and Naval Base Ventura County, California.

### Abraham Lincoln and slavery… [^1152cay7]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Abraham Lincoln's position on slavery in the United States is one of the most discussed aspects of his life. Lincoln frequently expressed his moral opposition to slavery in public and private. "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong, " he stated. "I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel". Although Lincoln stated in the Emancipation Proclamation that he "sincerely believed to be an act of justice, " he issued it as a "military necessity, " because he believed that the U. S. Constitution would not permit it on any other basis. The Emancipation Proclamation was a war tactic, because by freeing enslaved people it deprived the South of labor, and it allowed African American people to "be received into the armed service of the United States". Lincoln worried about the consequences of his action, fearing an endemic racial divide in the nation.

Nonetheless, during his second presidential campaign, he ran on a platform to forever abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. According to Michael Lind, Lincoln was for most of his life a moderate Northern mainstream white supremacist and proponent of black colonization abroad in Panama, Haiti, and Liberia. An ardent follower of Henry Clay, he envisioned an all-white United States without slavery. Leading Lincoln scholars, however, do not see Lincoln as a white supremacist and view his support for voluntary colonization as intended in part to make emancipation more palatable to racist white people.

Until late in his life, Lincoln wanted human rights — the rights listed in the Declaration of Independence and the natural right to eat the bread they earn with their own hands — for black people, but civil rights, such as the vote, "only on their own soil", that is in their own lands abroad, to which they would move pursuant to voluntary colonization. Constitution and that no state had a right to interfere". Lincoln himself had been one of only six in the Illinois House of Representatives to vote against a resolution saying "That we highly disapprove of the formation of abolition societies. That the right of property in slaves, is sacred. That the General Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, against the consent of the citizens of said District. " "Six weeks later, he and Representative Dan Stone filed a protest to the passage of the resolution — a rarely used device to register strong disagreement".

1840s–1850s Legal and political Lincoln, the leader most associated with the end of slavery in the United States, came to national prominence in the 1850s, following the advent of the Republican Party, whose official position was that freedom was "national, " the natural condition of all areas under the direct sovereignty of the Constitution, whereas slavery was "exceptional" and local. While a congressman from Illinois in 1846 to 1848, Lincoln supported the Wilmot Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U. S. territory won from Mexico. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman Joshua R. Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter.

CONCLUSION

All in all, we believe that the FDA is indeed more open and flexible with regard to evidence of effectiveness for drugs against rare diseases. Unfortunately, the Rare Disease Guidance does not give that impression. We urge the FDA to explicitly state that the conventional body of evidence of effectiveness may not be applicable to rare diseases; and discuss few innovative approaches that may be more readily acceptable for rare diseases. These changes will render Guidance synchronous with the FDA actions.

### The effects of armed conflict on children [^112WPJ89]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on the effects of armed conflict on children — background and scope emphasize that children are increasingly exposed and targeted, and that armed conflict directly and indirectly affects children's physical, mental, and behavioral health, can affect every organ system, and its impact can persist throughout the life course, with children disproportionately impacted by morbidity and mortality associated with armed conflict. A children's rights–based approach provides a framework for collaboration by the American Academy of Pediatrics, child health professionals, and national and international partners to respond in the domains of clinical care, systems development, and policy formulation, and the American Academy of Pediatrics and child health professionals have critical and synergistic roles to play in the global response. For the purpose of this policy statement, armed conflict is defined as any organized dispute that involves the use of weapons, violence, or force, whether within national borders or beyond and whether involving state actors or nongovernmental entities, with examples including international wars, civil wars, ethnic conflicts, and violence associated with narcotics trafficking and gang violence involving narcotics. Civilian casualties have increased such that 90% of deaths from armed conflicts in the first decade of the 21st century were civilians, a significant number of whom were children. The guidance in this statement does not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care, and this policy statement was reaffirmed December 2023.

Working with professional medical interpreters — definition, access, and best practices — notes that "Medical interpretation is the accurate, complete, and objective transmission of oral messages between healthcare professionals and patients who do not share a language. This can be done in person, by phone, or via video", and that "Working effectively with professionally trained medical interpreters is a skill set required for timely and effective communication that can minimize poor health outcomes". Directives include "Provide patients with professional interpretation services even if they have a friend or family member with them who can help communicate. Never use a child as an interpreter", "Make patients aware of their right to professional medical interpreters free of charge with the assurance of confidentiality in the healthcare encounter", and "Always confirm the language and dialect when arranging for an interpreter". Additional practices are "Prepare for extra time. Interpreted encounters tend to take more time than when the healthcare professional and patient speak the same language. Remember that each statement is uttered twice through interpretation, and clarification may be needed", "Allow interpreters to introduce themselves and explain their role in a brief statement to both patient and provider", and "Consider creating specific resources, like glossaries, to improve cross-cultural communication of standardized health terms through a rigorous translation and cultural validation process".

### Prevalence and phenotype of transthyretin val122Ile variant in the hispanic community health study / study of latinos [^113qZK9Z]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Hispanic/Latino (H/L) individuals face an increased risk of heart failure (HF) compared to non-Hispanic Whites, precipitated by a higher prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and a higher burden of abnormalities in cardiac structure and function, such as subclinical or unrecognized HF with preserved ejection fraction. The burden of HF among H/L individuals in the United States is projected to increase over time; traditional and modifiable risk factors do not fully explain the pathogenesis and mechanism(s) of HF in this population.

Over the past decade, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy has become steadily recognized as a cause of HF in the United States, especially among individuals older than ≥ 60 years of age and those with HF with preserved ejection fraction. The most common genetic variant in the United States for the hereditary subtype of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (h ATTR-CM) is the Val122Ile (p. Val142Ile) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation. As described by population-based studies, in the United States, the Val122Ile variant is almost exclusively found among the African American population, with an estimated prevalence of 3.40%. The Val122Ile variant is relatively common among individuals of African descent (2.00% allele frequency in 1,000 genome African population)since it originates in West African countries, which historically served as a main source of the Atlantic slave trade to the American continent countries during colonization. H/L are an admixed population with African, European, and Amerindian ancestries as a result of colonization and slave trade from West Africa. Therefore, some H/L might be at an unrecognized increased risk for Val122Ile-associated cardiac amyloidosis. Yet, despite the admixed genetic ancestry shared by many H/L individuals, and the elevated proportion of African ancestry found in H/L of Caribbean descent, to date, no population-based cohort has reported on the prevalence of the Val122Ile mutation among H/L from the community, nor by disaggregated H/L backgrounds.

### History of mosquitoborne diseases in the United States and implications for new pathogens [^1173KqJu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The recent explosive outbreaks of disease throughout the Americas caused by the introduction of Zika and chikungunya viruses has raised several questions, including whether these or similar disease-causing pathogens could spread into countries located at temperate latitudes, particularly into the continental United States. The conventional perception is that diseases caused by mosquito-transmitted pathogens are mostly associated with tropical areas. Indeed, such areas include the ranges of temperature and other climatic conditions that are ideal for the vectors of these pathogens. Moreover, because such diseases are clearly more prevalent in these areas, we might easily assume that the association between the tropics and mosquito-transmitted pathogens indicates that temperate regions are at less risk for these diseases because of their cooler climates. However, this expectation of safety should not be taken for granted. In fact, cases of disease caused by mosquito-transmitted pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV) occur readily in North America, and several encephalitides occasionally occur in the United States. In addition, history reveals that yellow fever and malaria were once very common in the United States and resulted in millions of cases. More than 100,000 deaths occurred in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries from yellow fever alone (Figure), in areas considered as temperate or cold according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification scheme.

Figure
Outbreaks of yellow fever reported during 1693–1905 among cities comprising part of present-day United States. Because deaths from yellow fever were often not recorded, or only referred to as "a significant portion of the population" and thus not accounted for here, the numbers presented in this figure represent a minimum for the cities cited (,–).

### West nile virus in the United States: guidelines for surveillance, prevention, and control. 4th revision [^111VsAwr]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Environmental surveillance — mosquito-based West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance consists of the systematic collection of mosquito samples and screening them for arboviruses and is an integral component of an integrated vector management program and the primary tool for quantifying WNV virus transmission and human risk. WNV may be passed from infected female mosquitoes to their eggs, resulting in infected offspring (vertical transmission), which is likely responsible for virus maintenance over the winter in northern parts of the country, although its contribution during the peak transmission season is not well understood. Regional vectors vary: in the northern states Culex pipiens are the primary vectors with Cx. salinarius important in portions of the Northeast; Culex quinquefasciatus is the main vector in the southern states, and Culex tarsalis is important in western states where it overlaps the distribution of Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus; therefore, programs in the United States primarily target these Culex species and may include other locally implicated species. Principal functions are to collect data on mosquito population abundance and virus infection rates, provide indicators of the threat of human infection and disease and identify geographic areas of high-risk, support decisions on the need and timing of intervention activities, and monitor the effectiveness of vector control efforts. Additional attributes include that collecting adult mosquitoes provides information about vector species community composition, relative abundance, and infection rates to enable rapid computation of infection indices and timely risk assessment, and that maintaining consistent programs over the long-term provides a historical baseline to evaluate risk and guide control operations. Limitations include potential nondetection when infection rates are very low or when only small sample sizes are tested.

### Historicising global nutrition: critical reflections on contested pasts and reimagined futures [^115V2EW2]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Historicising as a vantage point

Why, then, is what happened between 1974 and 1979 so important to the present moment? In our reading, this was a prior moment of crisis when an old world (of empire) was dying and the possibility of the birth of a new postcolonial world order appeared on the horizon. Instead, a confluence of factors that includes the role played by Western technocratic elites in international health and nutrition foreclosed a true break from the 'interregnum' and helped usher in new reconfigurations of old power dynamics. Historicising global nutrition in this instance means to interpret this current field of action as the product of contested historical development, and in doing so, challenge linear or singular narratives of how the field has been shaped over time. This historicised view shows that competing factions, geopolitical agendas and the politics of ownership often prevented the stated goals of ending malnutrition. Yet, a reconfiguration and reimagining of what should constitute international cooperation is still needed. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark reminder that the vulnerabilities of the few can quickly become vulnerabilities for the whole. At the same time, the vantage point of history cautions against a 'leaving no one behind' approach that assumes the project of international development, nutrition or health such as they are currently configured are projects that all should want to join.

### Radical republicans… [^1119L7RB]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The Radicals were opposed during the war by the Moderate Republicans, and by the Democratic Party. Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation. After unsuccessful measures in 1866 resulted in violence against former slaves in the former rebel states, Radicals pushed the Fourteenth Amendment for statutory protections through Congress. They opposed allowing ex-Confederate politicians and military veterans to retake political power in the Southern U. S., and emphasized equality, civil rights and voting rights for the "freedmen", i.e., former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment. The Radicals tried passing their own Reconstruction plan through Congress in 1864. Lincoln vetoed it, as he was putting his own policy in effect through his power as military commander-in-chief.

Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865. Radicals demanded for the uncompensated abolition of slavery, while Lincoln wished instead to partially emulate the British Empire's abolition of slavery by financially compensating former slave owners who had remained loyal to the Union. The Radicals, led by Thaddeus Stevens, bitterly fought Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson. After Johnson vetoed various congressional acts favoring citizenship for freedmen, a much harsher Reconstruction for the defeated South, and other bills he considered unconstitutional, the Radicals attempted to remove him from office through impeachment, which failed by one vote in 1868. During the Reconstruction period, Radical Republicans supported prolabor legislation, in contrast to conservative Democrats and Liberal Republicans. Radical coalition The Radicals were heavily influenced by religious ideals, and many were Protestant reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God's punishment for slavery.

The term "radical" was in common use in the anti-slavery movement before the Civil War, referring not necessarily to abolitionists, but particularly to Northern politicians strongly opposed to the Slave Power. Some wartime Radicals had been Democrats before the war, often taking pro-slavery positions. They included John A. Logan of Illinois, Edwin Stanton of Ohio, Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, and Vice President Johnson; Johnson would break with the Radicals after he became president. The Radicals came to majority power in Congress in the elections of 1866 after several episodes of violence led many to conclude that President Johnson's weaker reconstruction policies were insufficient. These episodes included the New Orleans riot and the Memphis riots of 1866. In a pamphlet directed to black voters in 1867, the Union Republican Congressional Committee stated: The "Moderate" and "Conservative" Republican factions usually opposed the Radicals, but they were not well organized.

Lincoln tried to build a multi-faction coalition, including Radicals, "Conservatives, " "Moderates" and War Democrats as while he was often opposed by the Radicals, he never ostracized them. On issues not concerned with the destruction of the Confederacy, the eradication of slavery and the rights of Freedmen, Radicals took positions all over the political map. For example, Radicals who had once been Whigs generally supported high tariffs and ex-Democrats generally opposed them. Some men were for hard money and no inflation while others were for soft money and inflation. Wartime After the 1860 elections, moderate Republicans dominated the Congress. Radical Republicans were often critical of Lincoln, who they believed was too slow in freeing slaves and supporting their legal equality. Lincoln put all factions in his cabinet, including Radicals like Salmon P. Chase, whom he later appointed Chief Justice, James Speed and Edwin M.

### Health hazards of exposures during deployment to war [^116inPwQ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This article serves as an introduction to the history of military environmental exposures, both man-made and naturally occurring. It also discusses exposure hazards of concern to US military members who have served in armed conflict in the past 40+ years.

Methods

A review of the literature of the historic exposure concerns as well as those of the recent and current conflicts.

Results

In recognition that there have been no significant compilations of articles regarding exposure hazards and concerns faced by US Service members returning from the recent and current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, this dedicated issue of the Journal contains 14 such papers. This articles provides a brief overview of these reports.

Conclusions

Environmental exposure hazards during deployment to conflict are not new. Concerns about these exposures are not new. Many conflicts have similar, if not identical exposures of concern, but also often have some that are unique to the particular conflict. In 2001 the Department of Veterans Affairs established a new program to address some of these concerns of Veterans.

### The concept of quarantine in history: from plague to SARS [^116nJU7h]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The concept of 'quarantine' is embedded in health practices, attracting heightened interest during episodes of epidemics. The term is strictly related to plague and dates back to 1377, when the Rector of the seaport of Ragusa (then belonging to the Venetian Republic) officially issued a 30-day isolation period for ships, that became 40 days for land travellers. During the next 100 years similar laws were introduced in Italian and in French ports, and they gradually acquired other connotations with respect to their original implementation. Measures analogous to those employed against the plague have been adopted to fight against the disease termed the Great White Plague, i.e. tuberculosis, and in recent times various countries have set up official entities for the identification and control of infections. Even more recently (2003) the proposal of the constitution of a new European monitoring, regulatory and research institution has been made, since the already available system of surveillance has found an enormous challenge in the global emergency of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the absence of a targeted vaccine, general preventive interventions have to be relied upon, including high healthcare surveillance and public information. Quarantine has, therefore, had a rebound of celebrity and updated evidence strongly suggests that its basic concept is still fully valid.

### 'Between-time stories': waiting, war and the temporalities of care [^112F62ku]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Thoughts buzz like planes and bombs but, for Woolf, the suspended time of waiting for a bomb to drop also produces a demand for thinking that, in Bion's terms, might effect a containment of unbearable anxiety and function, perhaps, as 'the only efficient air-raid shelter'. For she asserts that soldiers and civilians alike are subjected to a 'subconscious Hitlerism', and, Woolf argues, what women might do in this moment of suspension, of apprehension, is to create an alternative to catastrophe through their capacity for thinking.

In the June of 1940, Melanie Klein was also exploring her patients' experience of the external war and their ability to face it by linking it with their internal phantasies. She wrote in an unpublished lecture: 'If the feeling that external war is really going on inside — that an internal Hitler is fought inside by a Hitler-like subject — predominates, then despair results. It is impossible to fight this war, because in the internal situation catastrophe is bound to be the end of it'. 87 Klein also wrote extensive clinical notes on her British patients' reactions to the Anschluss of Austria and Germany in March 1938 and the anxious wait, known as the Munich Crisis, before a settlement was reached in September 1938 that permitted the German annexation of Western Czechoslovakia. While Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain famously spoke of 'peace in our time', Klein was concerned with a more complex time of psychic life marked out by aggression and attack, shame and guilt, and by experiences in the past repeated in the present. These reflections on the 'war inside' were not divorced from external, political reality, however. Indeed, Klein wrote that part of their purpose was precisely to explore '[t]he phenomenon of whole nations submitting to dictators and being kept under by them We get to understand this better if we study the reactions of people who are not directly implied, but stirred in their feelings by happenings like the overrunning of Austria'. 88 For both Woolf and Klein, the contours of 'subconscious Hitlerism' or an 'internal Hitler' seemed more palpable in experiences of waiting than in those of military action.

### Tuberculosis among temporary visa holders working in the tourism industry-United States, 2012–2014 [^1155x9uU]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial disease of global concern. During 2013, an estimated nine million incident TB cases occurred worldwide (1). The majority (82%) were diagnosed in 22 countries, including South Africa and the Philippines, where annual incidence was 860 TB cases per 100,000 persons and 292 TB cases per 100,000 persons, respectively (1). The 2013 TB incidence in the United States was three cases per 100,000 persons (2). Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, TB screening is required for persons seeking permanent residence in the United States (i.e., immigrants and refugees), but it is not routinely required for nonimmigrants who are issued temporary visas for school or work (3). A portion of the U.S. tourism industry relies on temporary visa holders to accommodate seasonal and fluctuating demand for service personnel (4). This report describes three foreign-born persons holding temporary visas who had infectious TB while working at tourist destinations in the United States during 2012–2014. Multiple factors, including dormitory-style housing, transient work patterns, and diagnostic delays might have contributed to increased opportunity for TB transmission. Clinicians in seasonally driven tourist destinations should be aware of the potential for imported TB disease in foreign-born seasonal workers and promptly report suspected cases to health officials.

Refugee healthcare can be a model for best practices in migration medicine which are safe, orderly, planned, with upstream interventions and coordinated care, evidence based, and getting better in that regard, and with prepared providers and healthcare systems.

I'd like to wrap up by imagining our future in migration medicine. I'd like to imagine a world where we work for peaceful resolution of international conflicts so that those of us in the field don't have jobs. I'd like to imagine a world where we honor key principles of international refugee law, where governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations are prepared for high volume, long-term tragedies such as the Syrian conflict, where upstream public health interventions are supported with adequate funding. I imagine a world where we have universal health care access. (I was very pleased to read recently that World Health Organization Director General Dr. Tedros' number one goal is universal health care access.) A world which views refugee situations as the indescribable human tragedies which they are and which responds with generosity and compassion. As Pope Francis said, "refugees are not the danger, they are in danger".

I'd like to imagine a world where leading governments respond by increasing refugee acceptance numbers. When Canadians saw the picture of Alan Kurdi lifeless on the beach, they responded by accepting 25,000 Syrians in 4 months. I imagine a world where transitions of care are seamless as refugees move from country of first asylum to resettlement communities. I imagine a world where providers are trained in the body of knowledge which encompasses refugee and immigrant healthcare. American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene can and does play a significant role in regards to this goal.

I am very pleased that there is a lot of knowledge that did not exist 35 years ago when I began in the field, and also that people like Dr. Alexia Knapp will say, "Where were you born and where have you traveled?" and they will know what to do with the answer. And where anything less than that is unacceptable from a health equity perspective.

Mass casualty explosive event triage planning — Develop a color-coded patient (LSI = Life Saving Intervention) prioritization protocol: red (immediate), yellow (delayed), green (minimal), grey (expectant), and black (deceased). Consider lifesaving interventions for each patient when equipment is readily available, intervention is within provider's scope of practice, procedure can be quickly performed, and continuing post-procedure care does not require provider's presence at bedside. Reserve the use of imaging and lab testing for clinical conditions based on flexible triage protocols, and reduce provider documentation and other administrative responsibilities.

### Emerging infectious diseases: a 10-year perspective from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [^116GARfR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Challenges for the Future

Scientists — government and academic, together with their industrial partners and international collaborators — have made great strides over the past 10 years in understanding many of the pathogenic mechanisms of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Many of these discoveries have been translated into novel diagnostics, antiviral and antimicrobial compounds, and vaccines, often with extraordinary speed.

However many challenges remain. Paramount among these is developing a safe and effective HIV vaccine. The evolution of pathogens with resistance to antibacterial and antiviral agents continues to challenge us to better understand the mechanisms of drug resistance and to devise new ways to circumvent the problem. These efforts will pave the way for developing countermeasures against deliberately engineered microbes.

If history is our guide, we can assume that the battle between the intellect and will of the human species and the extraordinary adaptability of microbes will be never-ending. To successfully fight our microbial foes, we must continue to vigorously pursue research on the basic mechanisms that underlie microbial pathogenesis and develop novel strategies to outwit theses ingenious opponents. The past 10 years have been challenging but no more so than will be the future.

### Addendum guidelines for the prevention of peanut allergy in the United States: report of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored expert panel [^113Si8da]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Appendix D — instructions for home feeding of peanut protein for infants at low risk of an allergic reaction state that these instructions are meant for feeding infants who have severe eczema or egg allergy and were allergy tested (blood test, skin test, or both) with results that your doctor considers safe for you to introduce peanut protein at home (low risk of allergy). General instructions include: Feed your infant only when he or she is healthy; do not do the feeding if he or she has a cold, vomiting, diarrhea, or other illness; Give the first peanut feeding at home and not at a day care facility or restaurant; Make sure at least 1 adult will be able to focus all of his or her attention on the infant, without distractions from other children or household activities; Make sure that you will be able to spend at least 2 hours with your infant after the feeding to watch for any signs of an allergic reaction. Feeding steps are: Prepare a full portion of one of the peanut-containing foods from the recipe options below; Offer your infant a small part of the peanut serving on the tip of a spoon; Wait 10 minutes; If there is no allergic reaction after this small taste, then slowly give the remainder of the peanut-containing food at the infant's usual eating speed.

### The current approach of the courts [^117ShkcG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

The approach of the courts when considering proprietary ('ownership') interests in human bodily material has been pragmatic and piecemeal. The general principle was initially that such material is not legally 'property' that can be 'owned', but courts have recognised many exceptions. In determining disputes between individuals in particular cases, they have stated principles that are often inconsistent with those stated in other cases with different facts. Later judges have been constrained by these decisions, especially when made at appellate level. They can distinguish the facts of one case from another to achieve a different outcome, but they cannot state new principles to be applied more widely to promote consistency. This requires the will of Parliament and legislation to introduce new principles. Experience to date suggests that such legislation will need to be wide-ranging and complex, with different principles for different circumstances. There will not be one area of law that answers all the issues that arise.

### (A) historical science [^112iXDg3]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

In contrast to many other human endeavors, science pays little attention to its history. Fundamental scientific discoveries are often considered to be timeless and independent of how they were made. Science and the history of science are regarded as independent academic disciplines. Although most scientists are aware of great discoveries in their fields and their association with the names of individual scientists, few know the detailed stories behind the discoveries. Indeed, the history of scientific discovery is sometimes recorded only in informal accounts that may be inaccurate or biased for self-serving reasons. Scientific papers are generally written in a formulaic style that bears no relationship to the actual process of discovery. Here we examine why scientists should care more about the history of science. A better understanding of history can illuminate social influences on the scientific process, allow scientists to learn from previous errors, and provide a greater appreciation for the importance of serendipity in scientific discovery. Moreover, history can help to assign credit where it is due and call attention to evolving ethical standards in science. History can make science better.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^111t4osm]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?", "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?", "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?", and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes", with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior".

### Ibn sina and the clinical trial [^116Nf3Fq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 1000 years ago, a physician by the name of Ibn Sina, known in the West as "Avicenna", wrote 7 conditions for "The recognition of the strengths of the characteristics of medicines through experimentation". Ibn Sina proposed applying logic to the testing of drugs, and in doing so, he wrote the earliest known treatise related to clinical trials. This article presents an overview and the historical context of Ibn Sina's life and work. In addition, the authors provide a translation of his treatise on drug testing and discuss its similarity to modern concepts of pharmacology and clinical trials.

### Examining permanent contraception for children, adolescents, and young adults with intellectual developmental disorder: ethical, legal, and medical considerations: clinical report [^116J4gYZ]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Federal regulations — Federal policy regarding sterilization is limited to 42 CFR 50.203 — Sterilization of a mentally competent individual aged 21 or older and applies to federally assisted family planning projects, not procedures that are not federally funded. This policy prohibits sterilization of all people deemed incompetent regardless of age, all minors under the age of 18 years, and typically developed adults between the ages of 18 and 21 years, and it imposes an informed consent window for federally funded procedures of at least 30 but no more than 180 days. Historical context includes Buck v Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927), which has never been overturned, and Skinner v State of Oklahoma 316 U.S. 535 (1942), which held that compulsory sterilization laws treating similar crimes differently violate the Equal Protection Clause and recognized a fundamental right to procreate, with a decrease in involuntary sterilization procedures over subsequent decades.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^112Pfu3a]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The raw scores from a 0–100 cumulative questionnaire (on the ordinate) are given as a function of the "true" linear measure (on the abscissa) of the variable tackled. Suppose scores are the number of correct responses (or, interchangeably here, the percent of correct answers). The true measure is given in linear logit units from RA. The increase in scores is roughly proportional to the rise in measure only in the "central" portion of the S-shaped (here, logistic) function (heavily hatched area). At the extremes (here, the "ceiling" of the scale, not the "floor", is highlighted), the same increase of 10 score points corresponds to a much higher increase in true measure (lightly hatched area). The scale's capacity to discriminate across subjects is lower the more the scores approach the ceiling of the questionnaire (reprinted with permission from Linacre, Fig. 1 in Wright and Linacre).

### Contextualizing ancient texts with generative neural networks [^114mx6io]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

The Roman world was a written world. Inscriptions were ubiquitous in public and private spaces, their communicative power shaped not only by the written text but also by their physical form and placement. It is estimated that about 1,500 new Latin inscriptions are discovered every year, ranging from the decrees of emperors to the epitaphs of enslaved individuals, and preserving precious information on the cultural and linguistic life of an empire that spanned 5 million square kilometres and more than 2,000 years. The study of these inscriptions, known as the discipline of epigraphy, faces numerous challenges: letters, words or entire sections of an inscription may be lost over time, with the full extent of the missing text often being unknown. High levels of human mobility, absence of explicit dates and the frequent use of abbreviations, a hallmark of the Latin epigraphic habit, further complicate our interpretation of these inscribed artefacts.

The resulting tasks of textual restoration, geographical and chronological attribution (Fig. 1) depend on specialist historians situating inscriptions within their wider linguistic and historical setting. A key method for this process of contextualization involves identifying parallels — inscriptions that share similar words, phrases, formulae or broader social, linguistic and cultural analogies. Given the far-reaching communication networks of ancient societies, such connections often span vast geographical and temporal distances. By linking an inscription to this network of parallel texts and embedding it within its broader epigraphic culture, historians can refine its interpretation, reducing reliance on speculative, subjective hypotheses and isolated readings. However, this contextualization is time-consuming, labour-intensive and highly specialized, requiring scholars to compare inscriptions against potentially hundreds of parallels. This demands extraordinary erudition, long-term knowledge acquisition, access to extensive library and museum collections, and repeated consultation of reference works — often using laborious manual searches or string-matching techniques. Consequently, scholars tend to develop regional and chronological specializations, which can limit the identification of epigraphic and historical connections at scale. We address the critical challenge of contextualization in ancient history and support historians in grounding their work using generative artificial intelligence (AI).

### Over 132 years ago, the inaugural immunotherapy treated its first head and neck cancer patient [^1178NqdP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy in oncology has a more extensive history than is commonly perceived. Rooted in the observations and experiences of multiple physicians in the late 19th century, immunological interventions are currently integral to the oncological therapeutic repertoire. This article seeks to delineate the evolution of cancer immunotherapy, tracing its inception in 1891 with the pioneering work of an American surgeon, William B. Coley, who achieved the first documented cure of a cancer case involving a malignant head and neck tumor. The narrative extends to encompass successive historical breakthroughs and prospective developments in this dynamic field.

### Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma statement on structural racism, and the deaths of george floyd, ahmaud arbery, and breonna Taylor [^114QeCWB]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2016 EAST systematically reviewed the literature on firearm policy and concluded that there is an association between more restrictive laws, such as universal background checks, and lower firearm injury rates. Additionally, it concluded that there are no good data that demonstrate that concealed carry legislation has protective effects. Our knowledge of the risk of permissive laws has since been enhanced by recent independent analysis of available evidence by the RAND Corporation. They found that states that have passed "Stand Your Ground" laws experience higher rates of violent crimes and unjustified homicides. These injuries, as shown by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania examining 462,000 firearm deaths, disproportionately affect African American men, and most firearm legislation to date has shown no beneficial impact on this population. Although new evidence that firearm laws like universal background checks have been shown to decrease rates of firearm homicides in African American men by 19%, evidence is mounting that the recent expansion of laws loosening restrictions on possession and use of firearms, such as "shall-issue" conceal permit laws and "Stand Your Ground" laws, may actually serve to worsen homicide rates and contribute to excess mortality in this already vulnerable population. Efforts to address firearm homicide through restrictive measures are stymied by the patchwork of state legislation, as the persistent pattern is that firearms are transported across state lines from states with lax legislation and subsequently used in crime.

Significant evidence is mounting that lax firearm regulation may further worsen racial inequity and increase structural racism: part of a pervasive pattern of inequity experienced by African Americans in health and firearm policy. A 2015 National Task Force on "Stand Your Ground" laws commissioned by the American Bar Association reported that these laws lead to increased racial disparities in the criminal justice system. This Task Force also reported on uneven application of the law with implicit racial bias in the application of "Stand Your Ground" against African Americans. We already know that violence in African American communities tracks with historical and structurally racist policies such as redlining, which is the systematic denial of various services (like health care or bank loans) by government or private agencies to black people. Finally, racist attitudes themselves correlate with support for firearm possession and hostility to gun control measures which would likely decrease African American homicide.

### What to do about portion sizes? Roundtable discussion at the forefronts in portion size conference [^112qFqVA]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

As portion size has increased in the United States, greater concern has arisen regarding the positive relationship between portion size and consumption, and how this relationship may negatively impact weight management. This article is a summary of a roundtable discussion from the Forefronts in Portion Size Conference held in Philadelphia, PA, USA in May 2013. The roundtable included four discussants, five speakers who had presented research on various components of portion size at the conference, two organizers and the moderator. Topics discussed included methods to reduce portion size that can assist with reducing energy intake, societal norms about portion size, values associated with portion size and methods to promote smaller portion sizes. Areas needing additional research were also identified.

### Research integrity and the law that never was [^113ALzyD]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is arguably among the most important innovations of the modern era, but publication bias and inadequate research transparency are serious issues affecting the very foundation of evidence-based practice. Despite this truth, these crucial issues have gone largely unaddressed or inadequately addressed for a distressingly long period of time. Regulatory efforts have thus far proven insufficient in eliminating these issues. Fortunately, the last 5 years in particular have seen developments that one hopes will contribute to the eradication of these issues and a future where we can look back on these issues as a sordid story of our past. However, much like the purported fixes of the past, time will be the final arbiter of the efficacy of remedial measures currently underway. This article chronicles the history of these issues, failed attempts to fix these issues, and what can be and is being done with the hope of bringing about true resolution.

Legal summary — When deciding whether to use artificially administered nutrition and hydration (AANH) at the end of life (EOL), "The particular laws of state and national governments have to be considered". Laws and precedents evolve: "Laws may change over time as governments consider the current state of science and medicine and enact legislation", and "Within court systems, legal precedent also evolves as particular cases with ethical issues come up for decision". In the United States, courts rely on "the common law doctrine of informed consent, which includes the right of a competent person to refuse medical treatment", and "Courts will also look to the state legislative and constitutional authority for guidance".

### APA guidelines for psychological practice with military service members, veterans, and their families [^112JiPhL]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Guideline 4.2 — understanding effects of military status and deployment on SMVF states that psychologists strive to understand the effects of military status and of deployment on SMVF. Rationale describes that even during peacetime, military families contend with stressors that differ from those of civilian families, including more frequent geographic moves (including possible international moves), interruption of children's peer relationships, and living with the threat of injury or death of the military service member because of dangerous duty; the average child of a military service member moves six to nine times between kindergarten and the end of high school, and children may also have to deal with multiple separations from and reunions with their loved one. Recent geographic moves in military families have been associated with increased mental health visits in children and adolescents, and stressors include periods of separation from the military spouse, moving to a foreign country linked to poorer physical and psychological well-being, and fear for the service member's risk for injury or death. The document also notes beneficial effects, including increased capacity for flexibility, resiliency, and a sense of meaning and purpose, and that psychologists are encouraged to consider and understand both the potential positive and negative outcomes of the military lifestyle; deployment can create additional stress on families.

### Higher emissions scenarios lead to more extreme flooding in the United States [^115yNEcN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Projected changes in the main flood seasons during the historical (1985–2014) and future (2071–2100) periods for seven subregions.

At each streamgage, seasons that account for at least 30% of annual maximum discharge occurrence are defined as the main flood seasons. The numbers in parentheses in the title of each panel represent the number of streamgages within each region.

Projected changes in trends in flood extremes

Here we examine whether the historical trends in annual maximum discharge are expected to persist or not in the future. There is a significant change between historical and future trends depending on scenarios (Fig. 4). Under SSP1-2.6, trends in 0.01-AEP discharge are projected to remain not significant and/or to become smaller/more negative during the 2071–2100 period compared to 1985–2014. As we consider scenarios with higher emissions, however, trends are projected to be exacerbated over the future period, including trend-sign reversal from negative/not-significant to positive in the last 30 years of the 21st century compared to the historical past. This tendency is more intensified for larger flood peaks (i.e. smaller AEPs) (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10). The results are consistent with other studies whose results are derived from hydrological models, reinforcing the message against extrapolating the observed historical trends in flood extremes directly to project future changes in the magnitude of extreme flooding. Likewise, the lack of statistically significant trends over the historical period should not be used as a justification for not taking climate change into account.

### Coming home from war [^111mRT8W]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Many American military personnel who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars will need long-term management of war-related conditions. There is pressing need for expertise in veterans' care outside of the Military Health System (MHS) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), as many will seek care elsewhere: Veterans receive free MHS care only while on active duty; enhanced eligibility for VA healthcare ends 5 years after military discharge; many veterans eligible for VA healthcare use non-VA services instead; and the Affordable Care Act will expand Medicaid coverage for uninsured veterans. Families of veterans also may need care for conditions related to war service. Most medical schools lack veteran-focused curricula beyond VA clerkships, which often do not provide specific training on service-related conditions. The VA, Department of Defense (DoD), veterans groups, and medical professional organizations should partner to develop technical competencies in veteran and family health care for clinicians at all career stages, and cultural competencies to ensure contextually appropriate care. National and state licensing boards should assess these competencies formally. Partnerships between VA, DoD, and the community for care delivery can improve transitions and the quality of veterans' post-deployment care.
