## Question

What do you deescalate Zosyn to

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what antibiotic options are appropriate to switch to when de-escalating from piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "de-escalation" means in antimicrobial stewardship. Then, I should verify when de-escalation is appropriate and safe. Next, I will review what to de-escalate to based on culture results and infection source. After that, I need to check dosing adjustments, especially in renal impairment, and whether to use extended infusions. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, timing, and special scenarios like febrile neutropenia and intra-abdominal infections, and close with a concise decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misapply it: antimicrobial de-escalation is the act of narrowing the spectrum of therapy or reducing the number of agents based on microbiologic data and clinical response, typically within 48–72 hours of initiation, to reduce resistance pressure and adverse effects while maintaining efficacy [^112vfNNp] [^116UCJAG] [^113dFxkr] [^114JGk8m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to ensure de-escalation is actually indicated. I should confirm that cultures have returned with a susceptible pathogen, the patient is clinically improving, and there is no ongoing concern for resistant organisms or source control issues; if cultures are negative but the patient is improving, de-escalation can still be reasonable in selected contexts, but I should double-check local antibiograms and guideline cautions before narrowing therapy [^112vfNNp] [^112yzFRx] [^113ZHzMi].

> Next, I should review what to de-escalate to, and I need to be precise about the pathogen and site. For Enterobacterales bacteremia, switching from an antipseudomonal β-lactam like piperacillin-tazobactam to a narrower agent such as ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, or ertapenem (based on susceptibility) is supported as non-inferior to continuing the broader agent, with similar clinical cure and safety outcomes in a multicenter randomized trial [^114dKEHz]. For non-ESBL Enterobacterales, ceftriaxone is often appropriate; for ESBL producers, ertapenem or a carbapenem is preferred, and I should avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for serious AmpC-producing Enterobacterales infections given observational signals of worse outcomes, reserving piperacillin-tazobactam only for mild infections or special circumstances after clinical improvement [^114sctJP] [^113L9Jv2].

> Wait, let me verify the pneumonia scenario because it's easy to overgeneralize. In hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, if cultures are negative and the patient is improving, it is reasonable to empirically de-escalate to a single broad-spectrum agent aligned with local antibiograms, whereas documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically warrants maintaining antipseudomonal coverage and often combination therapy initially. I should confirm local prevalence and resistance risks before narrowing [^112yzFRx] [^11298qmH].

> I will now examine dosing and administration, because de-escalation isn't just about agent choice. If continuing piperacillin-tazobactam, extended infusion improves pharmacodynamic target attainment in critically ill patients; standard regimens include 3.375 g every 6 hours over 30 minutes for many indications, or 4.5 g every 8 hours as a 4-hour extended infusion for intra-abdominal and skin/soft tissue infections, which can optimize time above MIC in severe disease [^111NB3KQ] [^112LMVrw] [^116gYFKN] [^113bGebD]. But wait, I should verify renal function before finalizing the dose: for CrCl ≤ 40 mL/min, dose reductions are required, with typical maxima of 2.25 g every 6–8 hours depending on severity and indication, and for hemodialysis, 2.25 g every 12 hours with an additional 0.75 g post-dialysis on dialysis days; I need to ensure I'm applying the correct renal adjustment table for the specific product label in use [^112SCeEe] [^113fhWyH] [^111M56pc].

> Let me consider special populations and stewardship nuances. In febrile neutropenia, early de-escalation to monotherapy is increasingly practiced once patients are afebrile and clinically stable, with several studies and algorithms supporting earlier narrowing or discontinuation when cultures are negative and the patient improves, which can reduce toxicity without increasing harm. I should confirm institutional protocols and patient-specific risk before stepping down [^114joGUw] [^1168CkNW]. For intra-abdominal infections, once susceptibilities return, narrowing from piperacillin-tazobactam to a narrower β-lactam or even oral step-down is appropriate if the patient is improving and source control is adequate. I need to ensure anaerobic coverage is maintained when indicated by the clinical scenario [^116iS5Qw] [^111bPTgq].

> I should double-check the timing and safety monitoring plan. De-escalation is best executed within 48–72 hours of initiation once microbiologic data and clinical trajectory are available, with reassessment of fever curve, leukocyte counts, respiratory status, hemodynamics, and renal function; I need to monitor for clinical deterioration after narrowing and be prepared to broaden again if the patient worsens or new resistant pathogens emerge, consistent with stewardship-driven reassessment practices [^112vfNNp] [^113dFxkr] [^115axtRo] [^114JGk8m].

> But wait, what if cultures remain negative and the patient is not improving? In that case, I should verify that we have adequate source control, repeat cultures from the appropriate site, and reconsider alternative diagnoses before de-escalating; premature narrowing in the face of nonresponse risks undertreatment, so I need to ensure the clinical rationale for de-escalation is sound before proceeding [^112vfNNp].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check each step. First, confirm microbiologic data and susceptibilities; second, assess clinical stability and trajectory; third, select a narrower agent with proven activity against the identified pathogen and appropriate site penetration; fourth, adjust the dose for renal function and consider extended infusion if critically ill; fifth, document the stewardship rationale and set a stop date aligned with guideline-supported durations; finally, arrange follow-up to ensure continued response and no need for re-escalation, aligning with ATS/IDSA HAP/VAP guidance and contemporary stewardship principles [^112vfNNp] [^115ThFVL] [^113dFxkr].

> In summary, I need to ensure that de-escalating piperacillin-tazobactam means either switching to a narrower-spectrum active agent or simplifying from combination therapy to monotherapy once cultures and clinical status permit, with renal-adjusted dosing and, when appropriate, extended infusion to preserve PK/PD targets. This approach is guideline-endorsed, supported by randomized data in Enterobacterales bacteremia, and consistent with stewardship best practices that balance efficacy with resistance mitigation and safety [^1116qJJD] [^112vfNNp] [^113bGebD].

De-escalate Zosyn (piperacillin-tazobactam) by switching to a narrower-spectrum agent based on culture results and susceptibilities [^112vfNNp], typically a **third-generation cephalosporin** (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime) [^1116qJJD] for susceptible Enterobacterales, or an **antistaphylococcal penicillin** (nafcillin, oxacillin) or first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) for MSSA [^112Kiz8G]. For Pseudomonas, continue Zosyn or use cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem if susceptible; for ESBL-producing organisms, use a carbapenem [^116iS5Qw]. Always adjust for renal function [^112SCeEe] and monitor for clinical response and adverse effects [^117U7qwn].

---

## Indications for de-escalation

De-escalation is indicated when:

- **Microbiological data**: Cultures identify a specific pathogen with known susceptibilities [^111bPTgq].
- **Clinical improvement**: The patient is clinically stable or improving [^112yzFRx].
- **Spectrum reduction**: A narrower-spectrum antibiotic can adequately cover the identified pathogen [^114Emfry].

---

## Common de-escalation options

| **Pathogen** | **Susceptibility** | **Recommended de-escalation option** |
|-|-|-|
| Enterobacterales (e.g. E. coli, Klebsiella) | Susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins | Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime [^notfound] |
| Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) | Susceptible to antistaphylococcal penicillins or first-generation cephalosporins | Nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin [^notfound] |
| Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Susceptible to cefepime, ceftazidime, or carbapenems | Cefepime, ceftazidime, or carbapenem (e.g. meropenem) [^11298qmH] |
| ESBL-producing Enterobacterales | Susceptible to carbapenems | Carbapenem (e.g. meropenem, imipenem) [^116iS5Qw] |

---

## Clinical outcomes of de-escalation

De-escalation has been associated with:

- **Reduced resistance**: Lower risk of antimicrobial resistance [^117H1jGN].
- **Lower toxicity**: Reduced adverse effects and healthcare costs [^111GRV5a].
- **Non-inferior outcomes**: Similar clinical outcomes compared to continued broad-spectrum therapy [^1116qJJD].

---

## Risks and considerations

While de-escalation is generally safe, clinicians should consider:

- **Clinical vigilance**: Risk of undertreatment if the patient's condition deteriorates [^notfound].
- **Close monitoring**: Regular assessment of clinical response and microbiological data [^114Emfry].
- **Renal adjustment**: Adjust antibiotic dosing based on renal function to avoid toxicity [^113aM2FM].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing based on creatinine clearance [^112SCeEe].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No adjustment generally required [^113aM2FM].
- **Pediatric patients**: Dosing based on weight and age [^115HZmCJ].

---

De-escalation of Zosyn involves switching to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic based on culture results and susceptibilities, balancing efficacy with resistance and toxicity. It is a **key stewardship strategy** that maintains outcomes while reducing harm [^111bPTgq].

Finally, we noticed about 15% patients were prescribed Pip/Taz without a culture, sensitivity test request. We found that the improper empirical prescribe of Pip/Taz without culture work up is a common practice among cardiac surgeons with risk of infection after surgery, or even in patients with signs and symptoms of sepsis like fever and elevated white-blood-cell count.

The utilization and appropriate use of empiric antibiotics can be improved. Application of guidelines have been associated with better overall appropriate use, antibiotics Stewardship guidelines application has shown to improve overall correct use of antibiotics and potentially the overall cost.

In general, the physicians require good knowledge and experience about the use of antibiotics for management of nosocomial infections as per available guidelines. Differential diagnosis and the comorbidities of the critical ill subjects involved should be considered. It is important to modify antimicrobial therapy according to the sensitivity results in order to reduce costs, decrease the development of resistance and minimize the incidence of side effects and shortage.

Physicians should be vigilant about the need to stop and deescalate therapy when appropriate and early consultations with infectious disease services should be encouraged when nosocomial infections are suspected or documented. Modifications or de-escalation of antimicrobials help in minimizing the cost and reduce resistance.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^113sQzp1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Definitions

ICU-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of new pulmonary infiltrates plus at least two of the following criteria: fever ≥ 38°C, blood leukocytes ≥ 10,000/mm³ or ≤ 3,000/mm³ and purulent tracheal secretions occurring more than 48 hours after admission to the ICU and within 72 hours of discharge from the ICU. Only patients with first episodes of ICU-acquired pneumonia were eligible for the study. Appropriate antibiotic coverage was considered when at least one effective drug was included in the antibiotic treatment. Pneumonia-related deaths were considered related to the pulmonary infection if they occurred before any objective response to the antimicrobial therapy or if the pulmonary infection was considered a contributing factor to death in patients with comorbidity. Each death summary was independently reviewed by two study investigators who were blinded to the use of de-escalation treatment. Mortality was classified as pneumonia-related if pneumonia was an immediate or underlying cause of death or if it played a major role in the patient's death. Mortality was defined as pneumonia-unrelated if the pneumonia was neither an immediate nor an underlying cause of death and played only a minor role, no role or an unknown role in the cause of death. The overall mortality included all deaths that occurred during hospitalization.

De-escalation therapy

De-escalation was defined as streamlined antibiotic treatment driven by microbiological documentation, clinical data and the severity-of-illness index achieved by decreasing the number and/or spectrum of antibiotics. This approach to the management of ICU-acquired pneumonia involves changing the focus from the use of multiple agents to the use of a single agent if Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not present, shortening the therapy to < 5 days if the culture is negative and there have been > 48 hours of defervescence, and changing from a broad to a narrow agent in the light of culture data. Accordingly, patients receiving carbapenem were de-escalated to piperacillin and tazobactam, and patients receiving piperacillin and tazobactam were de-escalated to cefepime or a third-generation cephalosporin. Patients receiving combination therapy were de-escalated and switched to monotherapy by withholding fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides or glycopeptides.

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) — de-escalation versus fixed therapy recommendation states: For patients with HAP/VAP, we suggest that antibiotic therapy be de-escalated rather than fixed (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). De-escalation refers to narrowing an empiric broad-spectrum regimen by changing the antimicrobial agent or moving from combination therapy to monotherapy, whereas fixed therapy refers to maintaining a broad-spectrum regimen until therapy is completed.

### Antimicrobial de-escalation as part of antimicrobial stewardship in intensive care: no simple answers to simple questions-a viewpoint of experts [^113dFxkr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial de-escalation (ADE) is defined as the discontinuation of one or more components of combination empirical therapy, and/or the change from a broad-spectrum to a narrower spectrum antimicrobial. It is most commonly recommended in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient who is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as a strategy to reduce antimicrobial pressure of empirical broad-spectrum therapy and prevent antimicrobial resistance, yet this has not been convincingly demonstrated in a clinical setting. Even if it appears beneficial, ADE may have some unwanted side effects: it has been associated with prolongation of antimicrobial therapy and could inappropriately be used as a justification for unrestricted broadness of empirical therapy. Also, exposing a patient to multiple, sequential antimicrobials could have unwanted effects on the microbiome. For these reasons, ADE has important shortcomings to be promoted as a quality indicator for appropriate antimicrobial use in the ICU. Despite this, ADE clearly has a role in the management of infections in the ICU. The most appropriate use of ADE is in patients with microbiologically confirmed infections requiring longer antimicrobial therapy. ADE should be used as an integral part of an ICU antimicrobial stewardship approach in which it is guided by optimal specimen quality and relevance. Rapid diagnostics may further assist in avoiding unnecessary initiation of broad-spectrum therapy, which in turn will decrease the need for subsequent ADE.

Rate of de-escalation in the DE group, and regimen change or escalation in the NDE group

We identified 36 patients in the DE group eligible for DE of vancomycin, and 33 eligible for DE of imipenem/cilastatin. Vancomycin was discontinued in 30 of these 36 patients (83.3%), whereas imipenem/cilastatin was de-escalated in 28 (84.8%) of 33, including DEs to piperacillin/tazobactam, with or without ciprofloxacin, in 17 patients, to ceftriaxone in five, to ceftazidime in three, to ampicillin/sulbactam in three, and to cefazolin in two. Of the patients in the NDE group, 18 underwent change of escalation of their antimicrobial regimen, either to carbapenem alone (n = 10) or to carbapenem plus vancomycin (n = 8).

### Impact of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in an endemic region: a before-and-after, propensity-matched cohort study in a caribbean intensive care unit [^114JGk8m]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The 2-year study period was split into two 1-year periods, which differed by the antibiotic policy employed. During the first year, the "conventional strategy period" (CSP), antibiotic therapy was prescribed at the physician's discretion based on national and international guidelines. This strategy included the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic as initial empirical treatment in the case of sepsis or suspected infection, followed by de-escalation after 48 to 72 h, based on microbiological data. The main regimens were combination therapies with a cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for community-acquired infections, and carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam combined with amikacin for hospital-acquired infections. Dosage, timing and duration followed French guidelines.

As part of a stewardship program, a new set of guidelines with a restrictive antibiotic protocol was established by the ICU team, approved by a multidisciplinary team and implemented on 1 January 2015. The "restrictive strategy period" (RSP) was based on seven principles. (1) For suspected infection, microbiological samples were taken immediately, and antibiotic therapy was initiated only after microbiological identification, except for septic shock, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and meningitis. (2) For non-documented septic shock and severe ARDS, an empiric combination therapy including a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside was immediately started after microbiological sampling according to the ICU protocol. Combined therapy included either second or third cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) for community-acquired septic shock, or cefoxitin for hospital-acquired septic shock (owing to the resistance to the previously listed cephalosporins and the high rate of susceptibility to cefoxitin of the ESBL-E) or an anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) for late (> 5 days) ventilation-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The second antibiotic was amikacin, unless a Gram-positive pathogen was highly suspected. Due to the low prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our hospital, the first-line anti-staphylococcal treatment was cefazolin. (3) No use of piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems for empirical treatment, only for a documented infection without an alternative option. (4) Limited coverage on P. aeruginosa, unless indicated. (5) Limited coverage on subdiaphragmatic anaerobes, unless indicated. (6) Monotherapy as a definitive treatment. (7) Other characteristics of antibiotic treatment were short duration, high doses and de-escalation as soon as possible to the narrowest alternative, with a focus on penicillin, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, according to the attending physician and following ICU protocols (see detailed protocol in Additional file 1). The local epidemiology of resistant strains according to the unit and origin of samples in 2014–2015 is provided in Table 1: Additional file 1.

### Development and implementation of a performance improvement project in adult intensive care units: overview of the improving medicine through pathway assessment of critical therapy in hospital-acquired pneumonia (IMPACT-HAP) study [^114Emfry]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with risk factors for MDROs were to receive expanded-spectrum combination therapy with dual gram-negative coverage and either linezolid or vancomycin as anti-MRSA therapy. Of the ATS/IDSA options for primary gram-negative coverage (antipseudomonal cephalosporin, antipseudomonal carbapenem, or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor), centers chose the following three options: cefepime, imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Of the ATS/IDSA options for secondary gram-negative coverage (antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or aminoglycoside), most centers chose tobramycin or amikacin.

The intent of the IMPACT-HAP pathway (Figure 1) was to assist clinicians at the participating ICUs in recognizing the signs and symptoms of suspected nosocomial pneumonia and subsequently delivering antibiotics compliant with the ATS/IDSA guidelines as quickly as possible. Centers were permitted to adapt the consensus pathway based on their formulary and local susceptibility data determined by unit-specific antibiograms. Two centers had, as part of their educational tools, secondary gram-negative therapy for all patients with risk factors for MDROs and suspected HAP, VAP, or HCAP (see example in Additional file 1). Two centers reserved secondary gram-negative therapy for VAP only, on the basis of their local microbiology and the low risk of resistant gram-negative pathogens in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Although not in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, colistin was prospectively deemed an acceptable secondary gram-negative agent when carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter was of concern, as was the case in one ICU.

On Day 3, antibiotic therapy was to be discontinued in patients who met the criteria for short-course therapy as described by Singh and colleagues. Criteria for short-course therapy were clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) of ≤ 6 on days 0 and 3, and no sepsis, shock, or immunosuppression. De-escalation was to be considered on Day 3 if patients were not candidates for short-course therapy. Criteria for de-escalation were clinical improvement and cultures positive for a pathogen that allowed antibiotics to be narrowed or focused based on susceptibility. On Day 8, antibiotic therapy was to be discontinued if the patient had improved clinically and did not have cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. The total duration of antibiotics was not to exceed 14 days.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

ZOSYN is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin and tazobactam that is most predictive of clinical and microbiological efficacy is time above MIC.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The mean and coefficients of variation (CV%) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of piperacillin and tazobactam after multiple intravenous doses are summarized in Table 7.

Cmax: maximum observed concentration, AUC: Area under the curve, CL = clearance, CLR = Renal clearance

V = volume of distribution, T₁/₂ = elimination half-life

Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after completion of an intravenous infusion of ZOSYN. Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30‑minute infusion of ZOSYN, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.

### Characteristics and outcomes of anti-infective de-escalation during health care-associated intra-abdominal infections [^116cNfJ4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Management of antibiotic therapy

Empiric anti-infective therapy, systematically started at day 0, took into account the severity of the case and usually combined piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-cilastatin with amikacin and vancomycin, possibly associated with antifungal therapy (mainly fluconazole) based on presumed risk factors. Definitive anti-infective therapy was adapted on the basis of the results of identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (≥ 48 h). In both situations, therapy was considered appropriate when all cultured organisms (bacteria and fungi) were targeted. Anti-infective therapy was prescribed by the senior ICU physicians following discussion with the consultant microbiologist on a daily basis.

The following changes were considered to constitute de-escalation: withdrawal of one agent (β-lactam, aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, vancomycin, antifungal agent) or narrowing spectrum of activity (β-lactam agents) and/or switch from combination to monotherapy. Discontinuation of unduly administered agents was also recorded. Changes among cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate were not considered to be significant changes of the spectrum of coverage.

In patients without de-escalation, two situations were identified according to previous definitions. Maintained empiric treatment without modification was called unchanged therapy. Escalation was defined as addition or switch to a new broad-spectrum anti-infective agent (carbapenems, glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones) or upgrade to broader-spectrum β-lactams. When changes combined escalation and de-escalation, the patient was assigned to the escalation group. In summary, a patient receiving empiric therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam plus amikacin who was subsequently switched to piperacillin and vancomycin was classified as having withdrawal of one agent and escalation.

### Minimal impact of selective susceptibility reporting on the use of piperacillin-tazobactam forandbacteremia [^111ESScd]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance has resulted in > 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the United States as well as increased hospital length of stay (LOS) and high costs. Multiple antimicrobial stewardship interventions have been suggested to improve antibiotic use, slow resistance development resistance, and minimize adverse events. Selective reporting, as a stewardship strategy, involves not reporting antibiotic susceptibilities to providers when treatment is not indicated, preferentially reporting narrow-spectrum agents, or excluding specific antibiotics from the report to discourage use. Although the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends selective reporting as one possible stewardship intervention, the weak recommendation is based on low-quality evidence. Considering the potential for selective reporting to improve antibiotic utilization, patient outcomes, and susceptibility rates as well as the paucity of data in this area, we studied the effect of selective reporting on antibiotic de-escalation.

Antibiotic de-escalation — panel assessment and recommendation indicate that despite poor evidence and reliance on clinical rationale, the panel had a high level of confidence that de-escalation reduces costs, burdens, and side effects, judged benefits to outweigh harms, and recommended de-escalation, while calling for well-done randomized trials. The panel also noted possible increased recurrent pneumonia but had serious doubts that de-escalation increases superinfection or antimicrobial days.

5.1	Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with ZOSYN. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with ZOSYN, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, ZOSYN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.2	Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions

ZOSYN may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and ZOSYN discontinued if lesions progress.

5.3	Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with ZOSYN. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue ZOSYN immediately and institute appropriate management.

5.4	Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, ZOSYN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with ZOSYN administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration.

Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., ≥ 21 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5	Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, ZOSYN may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^115axtRo]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The randomized prospective MERINO trial, that compared therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem in patients with severe bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumonia e, supported early appropriate therapy. Non-inferiority of the piperacillin-tazobactam arm could not be established with 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam dying at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 patients (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6%).

Delayed administration of appropriate therapy can be due to both delays in recognition of infection and administration of the antibiotics, but the optimal timing of therapy depends on the population studied. A recent review suggested that a reasonable timeframe would be no later than three to five hours after infection onset, but immediately for patients with septic shock. The administration of early appropriate therapy must be balanced against the unnecessary use of antibiotics, especially broad-spectrum agents, in the absence of proven infection, with excess mortality associated with this practice, and an increased risk of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Thus, the use of rapid, broad-spectrum empiric therapy, especially in emergency settings, must come with a commitment to de-escalation, meaning shorter duration, less broad-spectrum therapy and fewer drugs, once clinical and microbiologic data become available (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
The need for immediate broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy for selected patients with severe sepsis may be life-saving, but may also put pressure to overuse antibiotics and drive antibiotic resistance. Thus, this approach comes with the obligation to try to control resistance by de-escalating therapy once serial clinical, microbiologic and laboratory data become available. De-escalation can be in the form of shorter duration of therapy, less broad-spectrum agents, fewer drugs, or a combination of these interventions

### The therapeutic challenge of Gram-negative sepsis: prolonging the lifespan of a scarce resource [^1153etMk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Mortality from severe bacterial sepsis remains high. The pathogenesis involves production of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines which mediate: neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium, diffuse capillary leak, disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasodilatation and mitochondrial dysfunction, all of which culminate in microcirculatory failure. Therapy is multifaceted. As described in 'the surviving sepsis guidelines', many therapeutic interventions, such as early goal-directed resuscitation, low dose intravenous steroids, strict glucose control, recombinant activated protein C and ventilation according to ARDS- net criteria are critical to survival. However appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy initiated early is pivotal. Empiric therapy should be designed with regard to the bacterial epidemiology within the unit and the aim should be to optimise outcome while yet attempting to reduce the potential for resistance development. Antibiotic therapy for resistant organisms consists of the carbapenems, including ertapenem for ESBL's, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and, on occasion, the Gram-negative quinolones, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Consideration should be given to the possibility of 'collateral damage', where overuse of an antibiotic predisposes to multi-drug resistance. Antibiotics should be limited, where possible, to those organisms that are pathogens and not colonisers and should be discontinued if sepsis is not confirmed or there is rapid resolution of clinical indicators of sepsis. De-escalation strategies should be consistently employed and the duration of therapy should be tailored to clinical response. Continuation beyond 8 days is generally detrimental in terms of the potential for superinfection with resistant organisms. Failure of response necessitates, initially, a re-evaluation of source control and obsessive culturing of likely sites of sepsis prior to random antibiotic changes.

### De-escalation as part of a global strategy of empiric antibiotherapy management. A retrospective study in a medico-surgical intensive care unit [^112qptDK]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is a major public health challenge and is directly correlated with over administration of antibiotics. Controlling their use is thus a major objective of health. Responsible for more than one third of hospital admissions, infectious diseases are common in intensive care units. Septic shock is present in 10% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a mortality rate of nearly 60%. Early and adequate introduction of antibiotics improve survival in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. Therefore, therapy such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or a combination of antibiotics must be started empirically. Guidelines recommend that physicians first combine broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by a reappraisal of the therapy as soon as bacteriological data and susceptibility tests are available in order to eventually reduce the number and the spectrum of the antibiotics.

This therapeutic strategy called de-escalation is particularly pertinent in case of serious infection. Its feasibility is quite variable across centers with figures varying from 10% to 90% of cases. The overwhelming majority of these studies were restricted to patients with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). However, empiric broad spectrum antibiotics are indicated in many others situations frequently encountered in an ICU.

We retrospectively evaluated the practice of de-escalation occurring over consecutive infections during a period of 16 months in a 10-bed intensive care unit, irrespective of type and severity of infection. The goal of the study was to assess the application of a de-escalation strategy on empirical antibiotics management. We particularly analyzed the clinical impact of this attitude in terms of re-escalation, recurrent infection and mortality and identified bio-clinical variables associated with de-escalation.

### De-escalation as part of a global strategy of empiric antibiotherapy management. A retrospective study in a medico-surgical intensive care unit [^1123tAB9]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

As part of a global management of empiric antibiotherapy in an ICU, de-escalation might be safe and feasible in a large proportion of patients and infections. De-escalation is not realized in more than 50% of the antibiotherapy. Identification of the reasons that impair the decision towards de-escalation could eventually help to curb the clinician's reluctance to generalize this strategy.

5.6	Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.7	Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

5.8 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ZOSYN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.9	Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing ZOSYN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Early use of imipenem / cilastatin and vancomycin followed by de-escalation versus conventional antimicrobials without de-escalation for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia in a medical ICU: a randomized clinical trial [^111PEWDL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Previous studies, however, have reported that DE was associated with higher antimicrobial adequacy and more favorable outcomes. The difference between these results and ours may be attributable to various factors. First, our strategy may have improved antimicrobial adequacy for Gram-positive organisms, most of which were MRSA. Despite increased antimicrobial adequacy of vancomycin against Gram-positive organisms in the DE group, vancomycin had only limited overall efficacy in the treatment of HAP, with no difference in treatment outcomes. Moreover, the mortality rate was higher in our DE than in our NDE group. Vancomycin has been the only antimicrobial available for the treatment of MRSA pneumonia for years, but its cure rate has been disappointing. Also, despite the broad antimicrobial spectrum of imipenem, its adequacy for Gram-negative organisms was similar in our DE and NDE groups (64.3% versus 85.7%; P = 0.19). In a previous study, the adequacy of treatment for Gram-negative organisms was found to be higher in patients treated with a DE regimen, in which the major comparison was between cefotaxime and imipenem, which were used in 39% and 100% of NDE and DE patients, respectively. In contrast, piperacillin/tazobactam (87.3%) and ciprofloxacin (61.8%) were the most frequently used initial antimicrobials in our NDE group. Previous studies have suggested that piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem/cilastatin have similar efficacy and safety profiles. Only one patient had ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and broad-spectrum antimicrobials may have different sensitivity patterns at other centers. In addition, the definition of "de-escalation" differed among studies, in that most defined DE with regard to Gram-negative organisms. For example, the activity spectrum of antimicrobials was ranked against Gram-negative bacteria, with DE defined as a switch to or discontinuation of a drug class with a less-broad spectrum of coverage. Others have defined de-escalation similarly, by ranking the antimicrobial spectra of these agents. In contrast, imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin were de-escalated individually, with the former de-escalated only in patients with Gram-negative organisms. Categorizing all these definitions by using the single term "de-escalation" is confusing and may result in divergent findings.

### We need to optimize piperacillin-tazobactam dosing in critically ill patients-but how? [^113bGebD]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Administering PIP-TAZ as a prolonged infusion — that is, either administering the antibiotic over half the dosing interval (e.g. over 3 h if given QID), or administering the total daily dose as a continuous infusion over 24 h after an initial loading dose — may help overcome subtherapeutic PIP concentrations in the critically ill. There are now observational studies as well as randomized controlled trial (RCT) data that show increased likelihood of PIP concentrations being maintained above the MIC of pathogens using the prolonged infusion strategy. Furthermore, there were higher rates of clinical cure associated with PIP-TAZ administered as a continuous infusion in the RCTs. Both of the RCTs included patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, and so, coupled with the results from the study by Zander et al. showing PK/PD target attainment being problematic in these groups of patients via intermittent bolus dosing, the use of prolonged infusions may be a simple strategy that ICUs can employ. Notably, however, prolonged infusions may still not achieve therapeutic targets in certain groups of patients, such as those displaying ARC. In these circumstances, dose up-titration may also be advisable, but can only be comfortably performed with use of TDM.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^111kDzJ3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The appropriate use of Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Pip/Taz), including the correct dose, escalating and or de-escalation according to the microbiological culture is essential to reduce the antibiotic resistance. Resistant to antimicrobials in a major global problem and contributes significantly to morbidity, mortality and cost of care. Guidelines exists to ensure appropriate use of Pip/Taz. Antibiotics Stewardship guidelines provides a detailed recommendation with regards to initiation, monitoring and escalation and de-escalation based on final culture results. Appling such guidelines ensures a more proper utilization of the empiric uses of antibiotics used in the hospital-based setting. Use of Pip/Taz in cases of suspected infection postoperatively is common practice in the cardiac surgery ward where this study was conducted.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study involving all patients who were admitted to the cardiac surgery unit of a tertiary care center. All patient prescribed at least 1 day of Pip/Taz as an empirical therapy were included and prospectively observed. We aimed to evaluate the use of Pip/Taz and its appropriateness based on Antibiotics Stewardship guidelines (ASG). Any deviation from the guidelines in initiation, escalation, de-escalation based on culture and sensitivity results was considered inappropriate use. Four patients died (1.3%) early as result of complications for surgery but included in the analysis. The study was conducted from October 2017 to October 2018.

Results

Of the 300 patients who received Pip/Taz Cultures were done in 250 patients (83%). The overall appropriate use of Pip/Taz was seen in 166 patients (55.3%).

Conclusion

The empirical use of Pip/Taz in the surgical cardiac unit was largely inappropriate and not entirely driven by the culture test results. Interventions are needed to optimize the use of Pip/Taz including appropriate culture and sensitivity driven use and timely de-escalation or de-escalation when indicated. This will prevent emergence of resistance and reduce the patient toxicity and financial costs.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^11298qmH]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Hospital- and ventilator-acquired pneumonia (HAP, VAP). Local antibiograms are recommended to guide empiric antibiotic coverage. All VAP patients should receive S. aureus and PSA/gram-negative coverage empirically, with additional consideration of resistant organisms in those with risk factors. These include prior antibiotic use within 90 days, septic shock or ARDS, at least 5 days of hospitalization in the past 90 days, and requirement of acute renal replacement therapy, although not all studies have validated these risk factors. MRSA coverage for VAP is recommended for patients with at least 1 of these risk factors and where local prevalence of MRSA is not known, or is > 10–20% of S. aureus isolates. Two anti-pseudomonal agents from different classes are recommended for VAP patients with at least 1 risk factor for resistant organisms and where the local prevalence of gram-negative resistance to a single anti-pseudomonal agent is not known, or is > 10% of gram-negative isolates. Treatment is identical in HAP as in VAP. Guidelines support empiric coverage for drug-resistant pathogens in at risk patients, with subsequent de-escalation if cultures are negative. For all at-risk patients, the initial empiric regimen should include coverage for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and PSA/gram-negatives (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ceftolozane/tazobactam). Recommended regimens for MRSA and resistant PSA are similar to those described above for severe CAP.

Organisms identified at the initiation of the study

Initially isolated organisms in both study groups are shown in Additional file 3. Overall, 54 (50%) patients were culture positive. Culture methods included bronchoalveolar lavage in 37 patients, endotracheal aspirate in 62, expectorated sputum in 11, and blood culture in 20. No significant between-group differences were found in isolation rates of Gram-positive (P = 0.173) and Gram-negative (P = 0.920) organisms. Gram-positive organisms were more frequently isolated than were Gram-negative organisms (33.3% versus 26.9%), with MRSA being the single most frequent organism isolated from patients with HAP (n = 31; 28.7%).

Initial antimicrobial agents and adequacy

The initial antimicrobial adequacy was significantly higher in the DE than in the NDE group (75.9% versus NDE, 48%; P = 0.035, Table 2). This was mostly due to the activity of vancomycin against Gram-positive organisms (P < 0.001 for Gram-positive and P = 0.190 for Gram-negative organisms). The most frequently prescribed antimicrobial combination in the NDE group was piperacillin/tazobactam plus ciprofloxacin (63.6%), followed by piperacillin/tazobactam plus aminoglycoside (20%), and ceftazidime plus either ciprofloxacin or aminoglycoside (9.1%).

2.1	Important Administration Instructions

If a dose of ZOSYN is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, ZOSYN injection in GALAXY Containers is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered.

2.2	Dosage in Adult Patients With Indications Other Than Nosocomial Pneumonia

The usual total daily dosage of ZOSYN for adult patients with indications other than nosocomial pneumonia is 3.375 g every six hours [totaling 13.5 g (12.0 g piperacillin and 1.5 g tazobactam)], to be administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The usual duration of ZOSYN treatment is from 7 to 10 days.

2.3	Dosage in Adult Patients With Nosocomial Pneumonia

Initial presumptive treatment of adult patients with nosocomial pneumonia should start with ZOSYN at a dosage of 4.5 g every six hours plus an aminoglycoside, [totaling 18.0 g (16.0 g piperacillin and 2.0 g tazobactam)], administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The recommended duration of ZOSYN treatment for nosocomial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. Treatment with the aminoglycoside should be continued in patients from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

2.4	Dosage in Adult Patients With Renal Impairment

In adult patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min) and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of ZOSYN should be reduced based on the degree of renal impairment. The recommended daily dosage of ZOSYN for patients with renal impairment administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is described in Table 1.

For patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dose is 2.25 g every twelve hours for all indications other than nosocomial pneumonia and 2.25 g every eight hours for nosocomial pneumonia. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75 g ZOSYN (0.67 g piperacillin and 0.08 g tazobactam) should be administered following each dialysis period on hemodialysis days. No additional dosage of ZOSYN is necessary for CAPD patients.

### Minimal impact of selective susceptibility reporting on the use of piperacillin-tazobactam forandbacteremia [^111zH3cQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations. We did not make adjustments for potential cofounders such as comorbidities, illness severity, or hospitalization. Patients who have multiple comorbidities or are critically ill might receive longer durations of broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to de-escalation. Moreover, source control of the etiology of bacteremia was not investigated. Additionally, this intervention was intentionally not coupled with provider education. Implementation of a multimodal intervention may have resulted in a greater decrease in PT utilization and may have improved the overall impact of selective reporting given that multifaceted interventions have been shown to be highly effective.

In this study, selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibilities did not have a significant impact on de-escalation from PT, duration of PT use, LOS, or rates of AKI and CDI. More research is needed to investigate opportunities for a standardized efficient and effective selective reporting framework. In addition, this intervention should likely be partnered with education and feedback to maximize the impact.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^111DD2ob]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Of the 137 patients, 117 microbiological pathogens were isolated from 109 patients (79.6%). The initial microbiological identification was based on quantitative information from the TA in 99 cases (73.8%), BAL fluid samples in 5 cases (3.6%), and blood cultures in 3 cases (2.2%). MRSA was the most common pathogen identified (n = 44, 37.6%), followed by Acinetobacter spp. (16.2%), Pseudomonas spp. (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.3%) and S. maltophilia (6.8%).

De-escalation was performed in 32 (29.4%) of 109 patients with positive cultures and in 12 (42.9%) of 28 patients with negative cultures. De-escalation was initiated in 34.5% of episodes with potentially resistant pathogens (nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) and MRSA) compared to 65.5% among the remaining pathogens (P = 0.45). Among the 95 patients in whom the antibiotics could be de-escalated, based on the antimicrobial susceptibility data, 32 patients (33.7%) received de-escalation therapy.

The most frequently prescribed empirical antibiotic was carbapenem (35%), followed by piperacillin and tazobactam (28.5%), third-generation cephalosporin (22.6%) and cefepime (6.6%). Vancomycin was prescribed in 60 cases (43.8%) as part of a combination regimen. The proportion of cases with appropriate initial antibiotic treatment was 69.3% (95 of 137). A two-agent combination regimen was prescribed in 103 (75.2%) of the total group of patients: 37 in the de-escalation group and 66 in the non-de-escalation group. Monotherapy was prescribed in 32 (23.4%) of all patients: 7 in the de-escalation group and 25 in the non-de-escalation group. Two patients received three antibiotics as empirical therapy. There was no difference between the groups with regard to the use of combination therapy versus monotherapy.

ADE consisted mainly of discontinuation of one or more components of combination therapy [52% (125/240)], whereas 35% (84/240) of ADE consisted of replacement of an antimicrobial agent by another drug. Both ADE approaches were applied in 13% (31/240) of ADE patients. The absence of microbiological confirmation and dual coverage of causative pathogens were the most prevalent incentives for discontinuation of a component of combination therapy. ADE in the form of replacement was mainly based on identification and susceptibility pattern of the causative pathogen (Table 4). The antimicrobial classes that were discontinued most often as components of a combination therapy were glycopeptides (n = 46), aminoglycosides (n = 43) and macrolides (n = 29). The most frequently performed switches in the setting of ADE were: piperacillin-tazobactam to a third-generation cephalosporin and piperacillin-tazobactam to penicillin in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. De-escalated beta-lactam prescriptions complied with the ranking developed by Weiss et al. in 91% (69/76) of the patients. Online supplement 8 contains detailed information on ADE practices. ADE took place on day 0, day 1, day 2 and day 3 in 21%, 30%, 25% and 25% of ADE patients, respectively.

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hematologic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with ZOSYN in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, ZOSYN was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with ZOSYN in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11.0%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Piperacillin and tazobactam is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin and tazobactam that is most predictive of clinical and microbiological efficacy is time above MIC.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The mean and coefficients of variation (CV%) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of piperacillin and tazobactam after multiple intravenous doses are summarized in Table 8.

Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after completion of an intravenous infusion of piperacillin and tazobactam. Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of piperacillin and tazobactam, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.

Distribution

Both piperacillin and tazobactam are approximately 30% bound to plasma proteins. The protein binding of either piperacillin or tazobactam is unaffected by the presence of the other compound. Protein binding of the tazobactam metabolite is negligible.

Piperacillin and tazobactam are widely distributed into tissues and body fluids including intestinal mucosa, gallbladder, lung, female reproductive tissues (uterus, ovary, and fallopian tube), interstitial fluid, and bile. Mean tissue concentrations are generally 50% to 100% of those in plasma. Distribution of piperacillin and tazobactam into cerebrospinal fluid is low in subjects with non-inflamed meninges, as with other penicillins (see Table 9).

Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, piperacillin/tazobactam parenteral combination, is a white to off-white sterile, cryodesiccated powder consisting of piperacillin and tazobactam as their sodium salts packaged in glass vials. The product does not contain excipients or preservatives.

Each piperacillin and tazobactam for injection 2.25 g single dose vial contains an amount of drug sufficient for withdrawal of piperacillin sodium equivalent to 2 grams of piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.25 g of tazobactam. Each vial contains 4.7 mEq (108 mg) of sodium.

Each piperacillin and tazobactam for injection 3.375 g single dose vial contains an amount of drug sufficient for withdrawal of piperacillin sodium equivalent to 3 grams of piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.375 g of tazobactam. Each vial contains 7.0 mEq (162 mg) of sodium.

Each piperacillin and tazobactam for injection 4.5 g single dose vial contains an amount of drug sufficient for withdrawal of piperacillin sodium equivalent to 4 grams of piperacillin and tazobactam sodium equivalent to 0.5 g of tazobactam. Each vial contains 9.4 mEq (216 mg) of sodium.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Patients over 65 years are not at an increased risk of developing adverse effects solely because of age. However, dosage should be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection contains 54 mg (2.35 mEq) of sodium per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 648 and 864 mg/day (28.2 and 37.6 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced to the degree of renal function impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is not warranted in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

As with other semisynthetic penicillins, piperacillin therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of fever and rash in cystic fibrosis patients.

### Current antimicrobial practice in febrile neutropenia across Europe and Asia: the EBMT infectious disease working party survey [^1168CkNW]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this survey was to summarize the current antimicrobial practice in febrile neutropenia and the presence of key aspects of antimicrobial stewardship. A questionnaire was sent to 567 centers, and complete responses were obtained from 194 (34.2%). Fluoroquinolone and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis are used in 57.1% and 89.1%, respectively. In 66.4%, the first-line empirical therapy is piperacillin/tazobactam, whereas 10.9% use carbapenems. Empirical combination therapy is used in stable patients without history of resistant pathogens in 37.4%. De-escalation to monotherapy is performed within 3 days in 35.3% and after 10 days in 19.1%. Empirical addition of a glycopeptide is performed when fever persists more than 2–3 days in 60.8%. Empirical escalation to a broader spectrum agent is performed when fever persists more than 3–5 days in 71.4%. In case of positive blood cultures with a susceptible pathogen and uncomplicated presentation, 76.7% of centers de-escalate and 36.6% discontinue before neutrophil recovery. In fever of unknown origin with uncomplicated presentation, 54.1% of centers de-escalate and 49.5% discontinue before neutrophil recovery. Recommendations put forward in the ECIL guidelines are not widely implemented in clinical practice. Specific problems include overuse of carbapenems and combination therapy and unjustified addition of glycopeptides without further de-escalation or discontinuation.

### De-escalation in lower respiratory tract infections [^117H1jGN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present article reviews recent data on the de-escalation of empirical antibiotic treatment on pneumonia, with special attention to newer strategies aimed at increasing adequacy and minimizing resistance emergence risks in ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Recent Findings

A de-escalation strategy is feasible in a large proportion of patients with pneumonia, and at least two reports have associated de-escalation with a significantly better survival. Combined with other strategies, such as using biomarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein or procalcitonin), antibiotic heterogeneity, adherence to local microbiological flora, objective clinical criteria of non-response and of clinical ventilator-associated pneumonia resolution, they contribute to rationalizing and individualizing antimicrobial therapy.

Summary

A patient-based approach with prompt adequate empirical therapy, using broad-spectrum antibiotics based on reliable local microbiological data with streamlining as soon as microbiological data become available, allow outcomes to be improved and the emergence of resistance to be minimized.

1.1 Intra-abdominal Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of appendicitis (complicated by rupture or abscess) and peritonitis caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Escherichia coli or the following members of the Bacteroides fragilis group: B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, or B. vulgatus.

1.2 Nosocomial Pneumonia

ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and by piperacillin and tazobactam-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Nosocomial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa should be treated in combination with an aminoglycoside) [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

1.3 Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and ischemic/diabetic foot infections caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.

1.4 Female Pelvic Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of postpartum endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Escherichia coli.

1.5 Community-acquired Pneumonia

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (moderate severity only) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae.

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZOSYN and other antibacterial drugs, ZOSYN should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Improving decision making in empiric antibiotic selection (IDEAS) for Gram-negative bacteremia: a prospective clinical implementation study [^112fMUyV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely selection of adequate empiric antibiotics has become increasingly difficult due to rising resistance rates and the competing desire to apply antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) principles. Individualized clinical prediction models offer the promise of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use and preserving/improving adequacy of treatment, but few have been validated in the clinical setting.

Methods

Multivariable models were used to predict the probability of susceptibility for gram-negative (GN) bacteria in bloodstream infections (bacteremia) to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and meropenem. The models were combined with existing resistance-prediction methods to generate optimized and individualized suggestions for empiric therapy that were provided to prescribers by an AMS pharmacist. De-escalation of empiric antibiotics and adequacy of therapy were analyzed using a quasi-experimental design comparing two 9-month periods (pre- and postintervention) at a large academic tertiary care institution.

Results

Episodes of bacteremia (n = 182) were identified in the preintervention and postintervention (n = 201) periods. Patients who received the intervention were more likely to have their therapy de-escalated (29 vs 21%; aOR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.09–2.87; p = 0.02). The intervention also increased the proportion of patients who were on the narrowest adequate therapy at the time of culture finalization (44% in the control and 55% in the intervention group; aOR = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.27–3.27; p = 0.003). Time to adequate therapy was similar in the intervention and control groups (5 vs 4 hours; p = 0.95).

Conclusions

An AMS intervention, based on individualized predictive models for resistance, can influence empiric antibiotic selections for GN bacteremia to facilitate early de-escalation of therapy without compromising adequacy of antibiotic coverage.

### Efficacy and safety of a structured de-escalation from antipseudomonal β-lactams in bloodstream infections due to enterobacterales (SIMPLIFY): an open-label, multicentre, randomised trial [^1116qJJD]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

De-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics is considered an important measure to reduce the selective pressure of antibiotics, but a scarcity of adequate evidence is a barrier to its implementation. We aimed to determine whether de-escalation from an antipseudomonal β-lactam to a narrower-spectrum drug was non-inferior to continuing the antipseudomonal drug in patients with Enterobacterales bacteraemia.

Methods

An open-label, pragmatic, randomised trial was performed in 21 Spanish hospitals. Patients with bacteraemia caused by Enterobacterales susceptible to one of the de-escalation options and treated empirically with an antipseudomonal β-lactam were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by urinary source) to de-escalate to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (urinary tract infections only), cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, or ertapenem in that order according to susceptibility (de-escalation group), or to continue with the empiric antipseudomonal β-lactam (control group). Oral switching was allowed in both groups. The primary outcome was clinical cure 3–5 days after end of treatment in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, formed of patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Safety was assessed in all participants. Non-inferiority was declared when the lower bound of the 95% CI of the absolute difference in cure rate was above the -10% non-inferiority margin. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2015–004219–19) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02795949) and is complete.

Findings

2030 patients were screened between Oct 5, 2016, and Jan 23, 2020, of whom 171 were randomly assigned to the de-escalation group and 173 to the control group. 164 (50%) patients in the de-escalation group and 167 (50%) in the control group were included in the mITT population. 148 (90%) patients in the de-escalation group and 148 (89%) in the control group had clinical cure (risk difference 1.6 percentage points, 95% CI -5.0 to 8.2). The number of adverse events reported was 219 in the de-escalation group and 175 in the control group, of these, 53 (24%) in the de-escalation group and 56 (32%) in the control group were considered severe. Seven (5%) of 164 patients in the de-escalation group and nine (6%) of 167 patients in the control group died during the 60-day follow-up. There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

De-escalation from an antipseudomonal β-lactam in Enterobacterales bacteraemia following a predefined rule was non-inferior to continuing the empiric antipseudomonal drug. These results support de-escalation in this setting.

### Antibiotic de-escalation for bloodstream infections and pneumonia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122rf9u]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic de-escalation is an appealing strategy in antibiotic stewardship programmes. We aimed to assess its safety and effects using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing adults with bacteraemia, microbiologically documented pneumonia or severe sepsis, comparing between antibiotic de-escalation and no de-escalation. De-escalation was defined as changing an initially covering antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen based on antibiotic susceptibility testing results within 96 hours. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A search of published articles and conference proceedings was last updated in September 2015. Crude and adjusted ORs with 95% CI were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Sixteen observational studies and three RCTs were included. Risk of bias related to confounding was high in the observational studies. De-escalation was associated with fewer deaths in the unadjusted analysis (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39–0.73), 19 studies, moderate heterogeneity. In the adjusted analysis there was no significant difference in mortality (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59–1.16), 11 studies, moderate heterogeneity and the RCTs showed non-significant increased mortality with de-escalation (OR 1.73, 95% 0.97–3.06), three trials, no heterogeneity. There was a significant unadjusted association between de-escalation and survival in bacteraemia/severe sepsis (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.67) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26–0.95), but not with other pneumonia (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45–2.12). Only two studies reported on the emergence of resistance with inconsistent findings. Observational studies suggest lower mortality with antibiotic susceptibility testing-based de-escalation for bacteraemia, severe sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia that was not demonstrated in RCTs.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^1162Vix2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Sixteen cases (5.3%) were resistant to Pip/Taz according to sensitivity test and Pip/Taz was changed to Meropenem and were considered appropriate. 50 (16.7%) cases were sensitive to Pip /Taz and other broad-spectrum antibiotics and continuation of treatment was justified.

Fourteen patients (4.7%) required dose adjustment based on renal functions. Most inappropriateness in dosing (8 cases) was mainly due to low dose in renal replacement therapy (5 cases) as about 25–30% of the drug is removed by dialysis and there is a need to add 0.75 mg post dialysis three times /week, while three patients had renal impairment and needed to adjust the dose with renal clearance. In 6 patients with renal issues the dosing remained appropriate.

In summary Antibiotics use was considered inappropriate if they are prescribed empirically without a culture-test request, dose was not adjusted with renal function o renal replacement therapy, if their use continued in the presence of a negative culture-test result in cases of delayed de-escalation (Fig. 1) (Tables 2 and 3).

Segmented linear regression of bacterial bloodstream infections per 1,000 patient days over time. Dotted vertical line, intervention month June 2016. (a) Gram-positive bacteria. (b) Gram-negative bacteria.

Real-world de-escalation and discontinuation strategies for management of empirical antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenia are increasing, and results from the present study contribute and support existing evidence. A phase 4 randomized trial (ie, the "How Long" study) conducted in Spainenrolled 157 high-risk adult patients with febrile neutropenia initiated on empirical antibiotic treatment and assigned patients to either de-escalation when afebrile for 72 hours (experimental group) or continued on empirical antibiotic treatment until neutrophil count recovery (control group). The experimental group had more antibiotic-free days and fewer adverse events without any observed increase in harms. Implementing a similar de-escalation approach may help to address the compensatory increase in cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam that we observed in our study.

La Martire et alalso reported similar results in their interrupted time series analysis following the implementation of a de-escalation and discontinuation protocol in their high-risk neutropenic patients in France. These researchers noted an overall decrease in carbapenem use with no changes in C. difficile infections, bloodstream infections, ICU transfers, and mortality. Results from these 2 and several other studies collectively support recommendations put forth in the European Conference of Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines that early de-escalation is safe in hemodynamically stable patients regardless of neutrophil recovery, though the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines still list this strategy as an "alternative" approach to continuation of broad-spectrum coverage until count recovery. In a secondary analysis of their trial comparing cefepime to imipenem-cilastatin, Cherif et alfound no association between early empirical antibiotic treatment discontinuation and rates of fever recurrences or mortality. Similarly, Slobbe et alfound that discontinuation of empirical antibiotic treatment was safe after 72 hours in patients without an microbiologically documented infection or clinically documented infection. Snyder et alevaluated early de-escalation of empirical antibiotic treatment in 46 neutropenic patients and found no differences in worse outcomes compared to 74 patients who did not receive early de-escalation of empirical antibiotic treatment. Taken together, results from these studies support earlier empirical antibiotic treatment discontinuation in patients without microbiologically documented infection or clinically documented infection, which will be a future focus for our institution.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^115BEHJu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A study by Rattanaumpawan and Youssif concluded that Piperacillin/tazobactam, Imipenem, and Meropenem were inappropriately used in 50% of hospitalized patients similar to our study.

Two studies by Khan and Wiskirchen the rate of appropriate prescription of Pip/Taz as empiric therapy was 57.0% Most inappropriate prescriptions were found mostly in surgical wards and the surgical intensive care units which seems similar to the setting of our patients.

Another study by Youssif found that the continuation of antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity results was justified in only 22 patients out of 163 and only 33/64 patient the antibiotics was de-escalated when indicated by culture and sensitivity results. They concluded that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in surgical floors at a tertiary care hospital was largely unjustified by culture-test result.

The rate of Pip/Taz appropriate use post-cultures was 62.4%. The inappropriateness after the culture and sensitivity results was mainly due to the inability to de-escalate therapy in many cases, and the continuation of Pip/Taz therapy despite negative cultures.

As compared to the other studies, our study showed a relatively high percentage of negative cultures post culture work-up. Most patients enrolled in other studies were elderly while mean age in our study was 62.9+/− 11.3. Nonspecific sepsis like symptoms, renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, and dehydration are toxic effects of pip/Taz common in the elderly population. Failure to discontinue antibiotics post negative cultures expose this group of patients to unnecessary potential toxicity.

Special care is needed in patients with renal impairment or those requiring renal replacement therapies. Although not a major cause of inappropriate use in our study. Other studies have show this to be n important cause.

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients

Clinical studies of ZOSYN in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults.

In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the ZOSYN group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the ZOSYN group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event.

In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with ZOSYN and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the ZOSYN and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with ZOSYN 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with ZOSYN 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours.

### Prospective evaluating the appropriate use of piperacillin / tazobactam in cardiac center of a tertiary care hospital [^116F23DU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study highlights that there is a major potential for improvement in the appropriate utilization of use of Pip/Taz specially in surgical wards. This improvement can be a multilevel starting with appropriate initiation of empiric therapy to observing the culture and sensitivity results, appropriate escalations and de-escalations according to results. Early discontinuations when appropriate and being vigilant for dose modifications as many patients can have renal impairment post operatively. These multistep interventions will result is overall appropriate utilization of these antibiotics. It will certainly reduce the incidence of overall resistance, potentially reduce toxicity and can reduce the overall health care costs. Also the application of guidelines like implementation of the antimicrobial stewardship program will help in improving the clinical practice. Education and training the staff aiming at a more appropriate use of antibiotics use has been identified.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^116iS5Qw]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines — empiric treatment options for resistant gram-negative pathogens in HA-IAI state that carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with de-escalation to piperacillin–tazobactam, cefepime, an aminoglycoside, a cephamycin, a fluoroquinolone, or tigecycline considered once susceptibilities are known, although ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are frequently resistant to these other agents and clinical experience with ceftolozane–tazobactam or ceftazidime–avibactam is still limited. Patients with extensive hospital exposure may be infected with AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter or other Enterobacteriaceae, for which broad-spectrum carbapenems are generally considered the treatment of choice; ceftazidime–avibactam shows good in vitro activity and cefotaxime–tazobactam has activity against 70% of these strains, but clinical experience is quite limited. For KPC-producing strains, combining a carbapenem with an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, or tigecycline has been associated with the highest efficacy when the minimum inhibitory concentration to carbapenems is not too high, and ceftazidime–avibactam has activity against KPC-producing strains. Treatment of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is more problematic because these bacteria are resistant to nearly all β-lactam antibiotic agents, although aztreonam may be an exception, and combination therapy using agents such as a polymyxin, tigecycline, or fosfomycin is generally advocated. For these MDR, XDR, and PDR pathogens, combination regimens are generally used and may or may not include a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic agent, an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, tigecycline (not applicable for Pseudomonas), rifampin, or fosfomycin.

10 OVERDOSAGE

There have been postmarketing reports of overdose with piperacillin and tazobactam. The majority of those events experienced, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have also been reported with the usual recommended dosages. Patients may experience neuromuscular excitability or seizures if higher than recommended doses are given intravenously (particularly in the presence of renal failure) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Treatment should be supportive and symptomatic according to the patient's clinical presentation. Excessive serum concentrations of either piperacillin or tazobactam may be reduced by hemodialysis. Following a single 3.375 g dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, the percentage of the piperacillin and tazobactam dose removed by hemodialysis was approximately 31% and 39%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

Methods

We included all patients who were prescribed Pip/Taz for more than 24 h in cardiac surgery unit of a tertiary hospital. The patient's demographic data, microbiology tests, renal function tests and the dose adjustment were all recorded from patients' electronic medical records.

We prospectively followed their clinical course after the empiric initiation. Final microbial culture and sensitivity and escalation or de-escalation/discontinuation based on results and (ASG). The overall appropriate use was measured.

Analysis of the appropriateness of Pip/Taz indication, dose, frequency and duration of therapy was based on the available ASG by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The guidelines summary is detailed below.

Pip/Taz prescription was deemed appropriate if:
Pip/ Taz was selected as an empirical therapy according to the hospital's guidelines
It was used as an alternative antibiotic with a narrow spectrum after culture result.
The dose was adjusted with renal function of the patient.
Pip/ Taz was discontinued once the culture was negative or showed a resistant organism.
If one of these conditions was not met, the prescription was considered inappropriate.

Inclusion criteria

All adult patients 18 years or older who were admitted to cardiac surgery ward from October 2017 to February 2019 and had received Pip/Taz for 1 day or more were included in the study. An informed consent was obtained.

Exclusion criteria

Patients who had received Pip/Taz for less than 1 day.

Patients less than 18 years old or who refused to give consent.

Data analysis

The analysis was performed using SPSS software version 21. Analysis was done by using simple descriptive statistics using mean and median for continuous data.

### Antibiotic de-escalation in the ICU: how is it best done? [^116EEcEC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

An antimicrobial policy consisting of the initial use of wide-spectrum antimicrobials followed by a reassessment of treatment when culture results are available is termed de-escalation therapy. Our aim is to examine the safety and feasibility of antibiotic de-escalation in critically ill patients providing practical tips about how to accomplish this strategy in the critical care setting.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies have assessed the rates of de-escalation therapy (range from 10 to 60%) in patients with severe sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as the factors associated with de-escalation. De-escalation generally refers to a reduction in the spectrum of administered antibiotics through the discontinuation of antibiotics or switching to an agent with a narrower spectrum. Diverse studies have identified the adequacy of initial therapy as a factor independently associated with de-escalation. Negative impact on different outcome measures has not been reported in the observational studies. Two randomized clinical trials have evaluated this strategy in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or severe sepsis. These trials alert us about the possibility that this strategy may be linked to a higher rate of reinfections but without an impact on mortality.

Summary

Antibiotic de-escalation is a well tolerated management strategy in critically ill patients but unfortunately is not widely adopted.

### Factors influencing the implementation of antibiotic de-escalation and impact of this strategy in critically ill patients [^115mPuiB]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective single-center study on critically ill patients, antibiotics were de-escalated in 117 (51%) patients. This finding is similar to what was observed by Morel and colleagues: in their retrospective study of 116 patients, the de-escalation rate was 45%. Studies focusing on specific subgroups of patients gave various results. The de-escalation rate ranged from 6% to 74% in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and was 43% in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Although the rate of de-escalation we observed appears acceptable in light of the literature, could it have been improved? Among non-de-escalated patients, an initial broad-spectrum antibiotherapy could have been stepped down in 17: thus, there is clear room for improving the rate of de-escalation. In univariate analysis, reasons for no de-escalation were (a) inadequate initial antibiotics (10.7%), (b) lack of microbiological documentation (50%), (c) initial appropriate antibiotic therapy that could not be de-escalated (narrow-spectrum) (20.5%), and (d) clinical worsening despite appropriate antibiotic therapy (7.1%). Eighteen escalations (7.9%) were necessary, and this rate is comparable to those of the study by Morel and colleagues (6.6%) and the study by Leone and colleagues (6%). Among these 18 escalated patients, hospital mortality was not higher (22.2%, n = 4).

### Minimal impact of selective susceptibility reporting on the use of piperacillin-tazobactam forandbacteremia [^114dKEHz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Antimicrobial utilization data from our institution in 2016 revealed that piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) was the most commonly prescribed broad-spectrum gram-negative agent. In addition, review of microbiology data in 2016 identified > 13,000 gram-negative bacterial isolates, of which > 85% were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Because of the overwhelming number of infections with E. coli and Klebsiella spp and the fact that treatment does not generally require PT at our institution where > 80% of isolates are susceptible to ceftriaxone, we focused on the impact of selective reporting for E. coli and Klebsiella in blood cultures on the use of PT. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of selective reporting on the de-escalation rate from PT at any time during the hospital stay in patients with E. coli and Klebsiella bacteremia. Secondary objectives included impact on the duration of PT use, LOS, and rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).

We performed a retrospective chart review of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years with monomicrobial bacteremia secondary to non-extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E. coli or Klebsiella isolates between March 7, 2016, and March 7, 2018. Exclusion criteria were polymicrobial blood cultures with either E. coli and/or Klebsiella in addition to another organism not deemed to be a contaminant and discontinuation of PT before release of antibiotic susceptibilities. The data are outlined in Table 1. Antibiotics considered to be a de-escalation from PT were aminopenicillins, first-, second- or third-generation cephalosporins, oral fluoroquinolones, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 50% from the lowest serum creatinine while on PT or as an absolute increase of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL between 2 consecutive values while on PT according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network classification system.

Piperacillin–tazobactam dosing ratios and susceptibility breakpoints — In a 4.5 g dose of piperacillin-tazobactam there is an 8:1 ratio of piperacillin to tazobactam (ie, 4 grams of piperacillin and 0.5 grams of tazobactam), whereas in a 3 g dose of cefotolozane there is a 2:1 ratio of cefotolozane to tazobactam. The piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoint for Enterobacterales has been based on PK/PD considerations and a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL of tazobactam in testing wells. In 2022, the CLSI lowered the piperacillin-tazobactam breakpoints for Enterobacterales: MICs of ≤ 8/4 μg/mL are considered susceptible and a MIC of 16 μg/mL is considered susceptible, dose-dependent; in the clinical trial mentioned in Question 1.3, 94% of isolates would have been considered susceptible or susceptible dose-dependent under the revised breakpoints, indicating that in the presence of ESBL production, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam may not correlate with clinical success.

5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions

As with other penicillins, ZOSYN may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically Ill Patients

The use of ZOSYN was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with ZOSYN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.8 Electrolyte Effects

ZOSYN contains a total of 2.84 mEq (65 mg) of Na+(sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^112bPMFQ]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the overall de-escalation rate was 32.1% (44 of 137 patients). This proportion increased to 33.7% (32 of 95 patients) when only episodes in which de-escalation was applicable based on antimicrobial susceptibility were considered. The de-escalation rate in this study was lower than the rates in previous studies, in which the de-escalation rates of patients with susceptible pathogens have been reported to be 38% to 51.9%. Alvarenz-Lerma et al. reported that a low de-escalation rate is probably due to a high prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. infection (30.6%), intensive prior use of antibiotics (79.1%) and a larger proportion of late-onset episodes (90.6%). Our study has shown a high incidence of NFGNB cases, including Pseudomonas spp. infection (38.4%) and MRSA infection (37.6%). In addition, a high rate of prior use of antibiotics (93.4%) and a larger proportion of cases with late ICU-acquired pneumonia (81%) were evident in our study. The low de-escalation rate in this study might be due to these factors.

Currently, de-escalation is significantly less frequent in patients with pneumonia who have NFGNB and MRSA. This is because the effectiveness of this approach varies according to local patterns of antibiotic sensitivity. Although Korea has a relatively high prevalence of multiresistant pathogens, the de-escalation rate in patients with NFGNB and MRSA in the present study was 34.5%, which is much higher than the 2.7% and 23.1% rates described in previous reports.

Among 44 patients in the de-escalation group, 12 patients received inappropriate initial antibiotics. Two patients were changed to narrow-spectrum antibiotics because they showed resistance to initial antibiotics. Four patients who harbored carbapenem-resistant, Gram-negative bacilli received carbapenem or piperacillin and tazobactam, because colistin was not available at that time. Two of these patients died.

Administration Instructions for ZOSYN Injection in GALAXY Containers to Adult Patients

Administer by infusion over a period of at least 30 minutes. During the infusion it is desirable to discontinue the primary infusion solution.

Administration Instruction for ZOSYN Injection in GALAXY Containers to Pediatric Patients Weighing up to 40 kg

If a dose of ZOSYN is required that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g, ZOSYN injection in GALAXY Containers is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of ZOSYN should be considered.

Storage of ZOSYN Injection

Store in a freezer capable of maintaining a temperature of -20°C (-4°F).

For GALAXY Containers, the thawed solution is stable for 14 days under refrigeration (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]) or 24 hours at room temperature 20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]. Do not refreeze thawed ZOSYN Injection.

2.7	Compatibility With Aminoglycosides

Due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, ZOSYN and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. ZOSYN and aminoglycosides should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

In circumstances where co-administration via Y-site is necessary, ZOSYN formulations containing EDTA are compatible for simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion only with the following aminoglycosides under the following conditions:

Only the concentration and diluents for amikacin or gentamicin with the dosages of ZOSYN listed above have been established as compatible for co-administration via Y-site infusion. Simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion in any manner other than listed above may result in inactivation of the aminoglycoside by ZOSYN.

ZOSYN is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous co-administration via Y-site infusion. Compatibility of ZOSYN with other aminoglycosides has not been established.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Pneumonia: initial empiric therapy for CAP, HAP, VAP

Severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). For patients without risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) infection, the currently recommended initial empiric therapy is (a) beta-lactam plus a macrolide or (b) beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (FQ), both of which are acceptable, although more evidence favors a beta-lactam/macrolide. While evidence supporting these recommendations is based upon observational studies, a meta-analysis and systematic review found improved mortality for treatment with beta-lactam/macrolide over a beta -lactam/FQ, especially with severe CAP. There are not sufficient data to recommend treatment with FQ monotherapy or a beta-lactam plus doxycycline in severe CAP.

Patients with risk factors for MRSA or PSA might have been characterized as healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in the past, but his term has been abandoned. Multiple studies demonstrated that HCAP risk factors did not necessarily predict the presence of resistant organisms and that coverage for these organisms did not improve clinical outcomes. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommends empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage for CAP patients with risk factors for these pathogens, followed by de-escalation of therapy, if cultures are negative. The best risk factors for MRSA and PSA infection are previous growth of these pathogens, as well as recent hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic exposure (within 90 days). The development of validated scoring systems that accurately predict risk for these pathogens has proven difficult, as have efforts to develop locally validated risk factors. Empiric MRSA and/or PSA coverage in severe CAP, with de-escalation, has proven to be a safe strategy. However, a recent study found a low overall rate of de-escalation in the setting of negative cultures, providing an opportunity to improve antibiotic use. Possible empiric regimens recommended for MRSA pneumonia include vancomycin or linezolid. Therapy for PSA includes piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, meropenem, or imipenem. Newer agents may also have a role.

### Elaboration of a consensual definition of de-escalation allowing a ranking of β-lactams [^116UCJAG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy prescribed in life-threatening situations should be de-escalated to mitigate the risk of resistance emergence. Definitions of de-escalation (DE) vary among studies, thereby biasing their results. The aim of this study was to provide a consensus definition of DE and to establish a ranking of β-lactam according to both their spectra and their ecological consequences. Twenty-eight experts from intensive care, infectious disease and clinical microbiology were consulted using the Delphi method (four successive questionnaires) from July to November 2013. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to reach a consensus. According to our consensus definition, DE purpose was to reduce both the spectrum of antimicrobial therapy and the selective pressure on microbiota. DE included switching from combination to monotherapy. A six-rank consensual classification of β-lactams allowing gradation of DE was established. The group was unable to differentiate ecological consequences of molecules included in group 4, i.e. piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, fourth-generation cephalosporin and antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin. Furthermore, no consensus was reached on the delay within which DE should be performed and on whether or not the shortening of antibiotic therapy duration should be included in DE definition. This study provides a consensual ranking of β-lactams according to their global ecological consequences that may be helpful in future studies on DE. However, this work also underlines the difficulties of reaching a consensus on the relative ecological impact of each individual drug and on the timing of DE.

The findings from this study suggest that an even more sophisticated method of optimization may be necessary in selected patients - patient-tailored antibiotic therapy - which is the adaptation of antibiotic therapy to the need of the individual patient in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity through therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adaptation. Unfortunately, TDM of β-lactam antibiotics is currently challenging with long turnaround times, expensive equipment, logistical problems related to the instability of the antibiotics in the samples and the need for well-trained personnel. Efforts to overcome these limitations, and clinical studies to assess utility in the clinical setting are urgently needed.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^111bPTgq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The results of microbiological testing may have great importance for the choice of therapeutic strategy of every patient, in particular in the adaptation of targeted antimicrobial treatment.

They provide an opportunity to expand antimicrobial regimen if the initial choice was too narrow but also allow de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad.

Antibiotic de-escalation has been associated with lower mortality rates in ICU patients and is now considered a key practice for antimicrobial stewardship purposes.

Recently, Montravers et al. valued the characteristics and outcomes of anti-infective de-escalation during healthcare-associated IAIs. They demonstrated that de-escalation is a feasible option in patients with polymicrobial infections such as HAI-IAIs. However, MDR non-fermenting Gram-negative organisms limit its implementation in the setting of IAIs.

Statement 27

In the settings with a high incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, the extended use of cephalosporins should be discouraged and should be limited to pathogen-directed therapy because of its selective pressure resulting in emergence of resistance (Recommendation 1C).

In the past, cephalosporins have often been used in the treatment of IAIs. In light of the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MRSA due to selection pressures related to overuse of cephalosporins, the routine use of these antibiotics should be strongly discouraged.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are two new cephalosporins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations approved for IAIs.

By adding beta-lactamase inhibitor (tazobactam or avibactam), ceftozolane and ceftazidime have a strong activity against Gram-negative MDROs including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

1.1	Intra-abdominal Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of appendicitis (complicated by rupture or abscess) and peritonitis caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Escherichia coli or the following members of the Bacteroides fragilis group: B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, or B. vulgatus.

1.2	Nosocomial Pneumonia

ZOSYN is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 months of age and older) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and by piperacillin and tazobactam-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Nosocomial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa should be treated in combination with an aminoglycoside) [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

1.3	Skin and Skin Structure Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated skin and skin structure infections, including cellulitis, cutaneous abscesses and ischemic/diabetic foot infections caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.

1.4	Female Pelvic Infections

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of postpartum endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Escherichia coli.

1.5	Community-acquired Pneumonia

ZOSYN is indicated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (moderate severity only) caused by beta-lactamase producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae.

1.6	Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZOSYN and other antibacterial drugs, ZOSYN should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### De-escalation as part of a global strategy of empiric antibiotherapy management. A retrospective study in a medico-surgical intensive care unit [^112EEmap]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions

De-escalation therapy was defined as either a switch to a narrower spectrum agent or the reduction in the number of antibiotics or the early arrest of antibiotic treatment.

A switch to a narrower antibiotic spectrum was considered when an antibiotic with activity against non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (nfGNB) (imipenem-cilastatin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin) was replaced by a molecule without nfGNB activity, an antibiotic with activity against meticillin resistant staphylococcus (MRS) was replaced by a molecule with an activity against methicillin sensible staphylococcus (MSS), or a third generation cephalosporin was replaced by a group A penicillin.

Reduction in the number of antibiotics was defined by the arrest of at least one antibiotic occurring before the fifth day of antibiotherapy.

Early arrest of antibiotics is defined as the early cessation of antibiotherapy (before the third day of treatment) either due to the absence of proven bacterial infection or due to the withholding of medical therapies.

Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined according to the classical criteria. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci; Enterobacteria producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or producing a cephalosporinase; and nfGNB resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, or imipenem-cilastatin or producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii).

8.5 Geriatric Use

Patients over 65 years are not at an increased risk of developing adverse effects solely because of age. However, dosage should be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection contains 54 mg (2.35 mEq) of sodium per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 648 and 864 mg/day (28.2 and 37.6 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be reduced to the degree of renal function impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Dosage adjustment of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection is not warranted in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.8 Patients with Cystic Fibrosis

As with other semisynthetic penicillins, piperacillin therapy has been associated with an increased incidence of fever and rash in cystic fibrosis patients.

### Concerns about study design and suggestion of additional analysis of therapeutic drug monitoring-guided piperacillin / tazobactam therapy for patients with sepsis. author's reply [^112Kiz8G]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We would like to thank for the opportunity to respond to the issues raised in the commentary by Shodai Yoshihiro and Shunsuke Taito. We also greatly appreciate their interest in our paper. Following are the concerns raised by them. First, they considered the therapeutic efficacy index used for the dose adjustment of piperacillin/tazobactam in our study was inappropriate. We agree with the colleagues that ß-Lactam antibiotics have a time-dependent antibacterial activity and increasing the time above the pathogens minimal inhibitory concentration is important for promoting antibacterial activity. In our trial, the predefined target plasma concentration of free piperacillin was defined as four times (range ± 20%) the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen causative of sepsis. All patients in the control and experimental therapy group received a 24 h continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam. Therefore, the once-daily measured piperacillin concentration represented a steady-state concentration. Hence, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target was 100% f T > 4MIC (range ± 20%) [percentage of time during a dosing interval that the free (f) drug concentration exceeded 4 times the MIC, (range ± 20%)]. This is in line with the proposed target of Shodai Yoshihiro and Shunsuke Taito. To illustrate, 41.3% of patients with piperacillin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) achieved the PK/PD target on day 2 after randomization. This means that in these patients, the piperacillin concentration was 100% of time (24 h) four times (range ± 20%) the MIC of the pathogen causative of sepsis. Second, the administration period was short since the study protocol involved de-escalation. This observation is correct and indeed complicates the interpretation of the overall study results. However, it would have been unethical not to permit de-escalation after identifying the pathogen causative of sepsis. For example, therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam compared to oxacillin/cefazolin is associated with a higher mortality in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection. Finally, sensitivity analyses were recommended for patients with, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Analyses of subgroups have been performed; however, due to low patient numbers, they are not meaningful.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114sctJP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.
