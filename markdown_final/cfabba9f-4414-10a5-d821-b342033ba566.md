## Question

how often should you recheck bone density scan while on alendronate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to recheck bone density (DXA) while taking alendronate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence for routine monitoring in the first few years. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for intervals during therapy. Next, I will consider special populations and scenarios that warrant shorter intervals. After that, I need to check the role of least significant change and measurement precision. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm the approach to bisphosphonate holidays and long-term management.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality evidence on early monitoring. The BMJ secondary analysis of the Fracture Intervention Trial found that within-person measurement variation exceeds between-person treatment effects in the first 3 years of alendronate, so routine BMD monitoring during this period is unnecessary and may be misleading; 97.5% of patients had clinically meaningful BMD gains by 3 years, supporting deferring early rechecks [^3ff6e6fc] [^b592ee75] [^d98f4487].

> Wait, let me verify guideline convergence before drawing conclusions. The Endocrine Society recommends DXA every 1–3 years during pharmacotherapy, with the caveat that intervals should be individualized and that early monitoring has limited utility for antiresorptives like alendronate; ACOG similarly suggests every 1–3 years until stable, then less frequent; AACE recommends every 1–2 years until stable, then spacing out; and NAMS advises reassessment at 1–2 years after initiation and again at 5 years to consider a holiday, reflecting a consensus that early frequent checks are not routinely required [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04] [^3856507f] [^6eaef4ad].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should reconcile this with the evidence signal. The BMJ analysis shows that changes in the first 1–3 years are often within measurement error, so repeating DXA too soon can generate noise and false alarms, whereas guidelines still allow 1–3 year intervals to accommodate clinical judgment and patient-specific factors; this is not contradictory, it just emphasizes tailoring rather than routine early rechecks [^3ff6e6fc] [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04].

> I need to ensure I account for special situations where earlier monitoring is justified. Shorter intervals are reasonable when there is high fracture risk, ongoing bone loss risk (e.g., glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation), new fragility fracture, suspected nonadherence, or when switching therapies; conversely, in low-risk, stable patients, extending beyond 2–3 years can be appropriate once BMD is stable [^b487ba04] [^5aee4b0a] [^f893e734] [^9d456e04].

> Next, I should review measurement precision and least significant change, because interpretation hinges on it. Most centers have an LSC around 3–5% at the hip and spine; changes smaller than the LSC are not statistically meaningful, so repeating DXA too frequently risks detecting spurious "changes". Using the same machine and protocol improves comparability and reduces apparent change due to technical factors [^5806f32a] [^cdc5c316].

> Let me think about the long-term plan and drug holidays. After about 3–5 years of alendronate, reassess fracture risk and BMD to decide on continuation versus a bisphosphonate holiday; if a holiday is taken, monitor BMD every 2–4 years and restart if there is significant BMD decline or rising fracture risk, recognizing that alendronate's skeletal effects persist after discontinuation [^4eeb93ca] [^c8ec833b] [^d0953d72].

> I should double-check the practical, risk-stratified recommendation. For most patients on alendronate, repeating DXA in 1–3 years is reasonable, with a typical sweet spot of 2 years; avoid routine checks at 6–12 months unless there are special circumstances; once BMD is stable for several years, extend to 2–3 year intervals; and at 3–5 years, reassess for a potential holiday or continuation based on risk profile and BMD trajectory [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04] [^4eeb93ca].

> But wait, what if the patient is on glucocorticoids or has a new fracture? In those cases, I should shorten the interval to 6–12 months to ensure we capture clinically meaningful change and address secondary causes or adherence issues, aligning with guidance for high-risk or rapidly changing clinical states [^b487ba04] [^5aee4b0a].

> In summary, I should confirm that the bottom line is individualized: avoid routine early monitoring in the first 1–3 years unless there are red flags, use 1–3 year intervals guided by risk and stability, and pivot at 3–5 years to holiday decisions with longer monitoring intervals thereafter. This balances the evidence that early changes are small and noisy with guideline flexibility for clinical judgment [^3ff6e6fc] [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04] [^4eeb93ca].

Recheck bone density every **1–3 years** while on alendronate, with **2 years typical** for most patients [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04]. Earlier rechecks at **1 year** are reasonable for high-risk patients (e.g. glucocorticoids, low baseline BMD, or recent fractures) [^b487ba04] [^5aee4b0a]. Routine monitoring in the first 1–3 years is not necessary for most, as alendronate reliably increases BMD and early changes are small relative to measurement error [^3ff6e6fc] [^b592ee75]. After 3–5 years, reassess to decide on continuation or a drug holiday, then monitor every 2–4 years if a holiday is taken [^4eeb93ca] [^c8ec833b]. Always use the same DXA machine and interpret changes using the least significant change threshold [^5806f32a] [^a19eb129].

---

## General recommendation for BMD monitoring frequency

- **Standard interval**: Every 1–3 years during therapy, with 2 years typical for most patients [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04].
- **High-risk patients**: Consider 1-year rechecks if on glucocorticoids, have low baseline BMD, or recent fractures [^b487ba04] [^5aee4b0a].
- **Stable patients**: Extend to 3 years if BMD is stable and risk is low [^notfound].

---

## Evidence supporting monitoring intervals

- **Early monitoring**: Routine 1–3 year checks are supported by guidelines and evidence that early changes are small and often within measurement error [^f3b262f0] [^3ff6e6fc].
- **Long-term monitoring**: After 3–5 years, reassess to decide on continuation or a holiday; if a holiday is taken, monitor every 2–4 years [^4eeb93ca] [^c8ec833b].
- **Measurement precision**: Use the same DXA machine and apply the least significant change (LSC) to interpret results [^5806f32a] [^a19eb129].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting more frequent monitoring

Certain scenarios justify **more frequent BMD monitoring**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended monitoring interval** |
|-|-|
| Glucocorticoid therapy | Every 1–2 years [^notfound] |
| Low baseline BMD (T-score ≤ -2.5) | Every 1–2 years [^a19eb129] |
| Recent fragility fracture | Every 1–2 years [^notfound] |
| Rapid bone loss or secondary osteoporosis | Every 1–2 years [^b487ba04] |
| Poor adherence or uncertainty about response | Every 1–2 years [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where monitoring can be extended

In stable, low-risk patients, **extending intervals to 3 years** is reasonable [^notfound].

---

## Role of bone turnover markers (BTMs)

BTMs can help assess adherence and response, with **CTX and PINP** typically decreasing 30–70% by 3–6 months on alendronate [^86a33290]. They are not routinely required but can be considered when adherence is uncertain or response is suboptimal [^3856507f].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial monitoring**: Repeat DXA 1–3 years after starting alendronate, typically at 2 years [^f3b262f0] [^9d456e04].
- **High-risk patients**: Consider 1-year rechecks if risk is elevated [^b487ba04] [^5aee4b0a].
- **Long-term monitoring**: After 3–5 years, reassess for continuation or a holiday; if a holiday is taken, monitor every 2–4 years [^4eeb93ca] [^c8ec833b].
- **Technical considerations**: Use the same DXA machine and apply LSC when interpreting changes [^5806f32a] [^a19eb129].

---

Rechecking bone density every **1–3 years** (typically 2 years) is appropriate for most patients on alendronate, with earlier rechecks for high-risk patients and longer intervals for stable, low-risk patients.

Discussion

In this large placebo controlled trial of alendronate treatment of postmenopausal women with low bone density and with serial bone mineral density measurements, we found that three years of treatment resulted in an average increase in hip bone mineral density of 0.030 g/cm 2 against a background average decrease in hip bone mineral density of 0.012 g/cm 2 with placebo. We found small between-person differences in the effects of alendronate on bone mineral density. These differences were small compared with background variation in bone mineral density measurements within patients. Moreover, treatment seemed beneficial for the vast majority of patients. Three years of treatment with alendronate resulted in increases in hip bone mineral density ≥ 0.019 g/cm 2 for 97.5% of patients. Increases in bone density of at least this size are likely to be considered sufficient to continue therapy in most clinical populations. This means that, even though we found the effects of alendronate to vary between individuals, the size of this variation is not clinically relevant and monitoring individual response is not needed. The high correlation between the effects of treatment on hip bone mineral density and spine bone mineral density (r = 0.90) confirms previous findingsthat there is minimal gain from taking measurement at two sites rather than one. Our findings suggest that bone density monitoring is not warranted at either hip or spine skeletal sites.

BONE MINERAL DENSITY MONITORING

Value of Routine Monitoring of Bone Mineral Density After Starting Bisphosphonate Treatment: Secondary Analysis of Trial Data

What was known?.

Screening bone densitometry is recommended for women aged 65 and over as well as for younger women with risk factors, however whether bone mineral density (BMD) should be monitored once treatment is started is controversial.-

What this study adds.

This study was a reanalysis of data from the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), in which women were treated with alendronate or placebo, received annual bone densitometry and were followed for fractures. Investigators compared "within- person" variation (measurement) with "between-person" variation (treatment effect) in serial bone density measurements. They found that within-person measurement-related variation was greater than between-person treatment- related variation, suggesting that routine monitoring of BMD during the first three years of bisphosphonate treatment is unnecessary. The vast majority of individuals (97.5%) gained bone mineral density with alendronate treatment.

How should I change my practice?.

Monitoring BMD in postmenopausal women after starting bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis is not necessary. Treatment "failure" is best described by fracture while on therapy rather than a decrease in BMD.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^3c30c2d7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

In this paper we investigate the effects of alendronate on bone density at the individual level. We compare the variability of bone density for patients receiving placebo with that for patients taking treatment, using mixed modelsto make inferences about whether the effect of treatment varies among individuals or is uniform. If the treatment effect did not vary between individuals we could infer that monitoring individuals' response to treatment is unnecessary as the effect of the bisphosphonate on the individual could be predicted before treatment is started. A finding that treatment effect varied between individuals may imply that monitoring individuals' response to treatment is necessary if the variation is great enough to be clinically relevant. This would occur if a substantial proportion of patients failed to meet a treatment threshold — for example, if the treatment effects ranged from no effect (or even reduction in bone density) up to a large gain in bone density (see Bell et alfor a more detailed discussion on when variation in treatment effects is likely to be clinically relevant). We used data from a large randomised trial to determine whether routine monitoring of bone mineral density is warranted after starting alendronate treatment.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^1d64f4d4]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Our findings support a recommendation against routine monitoring in the first three years after potent bisphosphonate therapy is started. Other work with data from the Fracture Intervention Trial also supports not monitoring bone density in the first few years of alendronate treatment. Women observed to have no net change in bone mineral density after four years of treatment were found to have a high probability of responding to treatment. Reductions in fracture risk with alendronate treatment were shown for women who were observed to lose bone density during treatment. Failure to recognise this measurement variation may lead clinicians to make inappropriate changes to treatment or to delay taking action when they should intervene.

In summary, bone density increases sufficient to continue therapy unaltered occurred in virtually all osteoporotic women treated with a potent oral bisphosphonate for three years. Monitoring bone mineral density in this early period after starting treatment is unnecessary, and, because of the potential to mislead, it is best avoided.

### A model of BMD changes after alendronate discontinuation to guide postalendronate BMD monitoring [^0643aba9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Women stopping alendronate are commonly monitored with serial bone mineral density (BMD) measurements, yet no information exists on how frequently or for whom these measurements should be performed.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop a tool to guide post-alendronate BMD monitoring.

Design

A predictive model was constructed to estimate the time until a given percentage of women's BMD T-scores drop below a given threshold that indicates a management change (such as retreatment) would be considered. This model was then used to estimate the time it would take for groups of women defined by their baseline BMDs to drop below the given threshold.

Setting

Data were derived from the Fracture Intervention Trial Long Term Extension (FLEX), the largest multicenter clinical trial of its type to date.

Participants

Four hundred four women who had received an average of 5.1 years of alendronate during the Fracture Intervention Trial and were subsequently observed for 5 treatment-free years (on placebo) during the FLEX trial were used to estimate the change in BMD over time.

Results

If a management change such as alendronate reinitiation would be considered when BMD T-score drops below -2.5, the model shows that women with total hip BMD greater than -1.9 T-scores at the time of alendronate discontinuation have less than a 20% probability that at follow-up, monitoring BMD will be below the threshold within 5 years. The model performed similarly, and results are provided over a range of management change thresholds from -1.75 to -3 T-scores.

Conclusions

Using the tool developed in this analysis, it is possible to estimate when BMD repeat measurement after alendronate discontinuation could potentially be useful. Measuring BMD within 5 years after alendronate discontinuation is unlikely to change management for women with total hip BMD 0.6 T-scores above a prespecified retreatment threshold within the range of -1.75 to -3 T-scores.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^6eaef4ad]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring and follow-up: Bone mineral density (BMD) testing should be repeated 1 to 2 years after beginning osteoporosis therapy, with patients on bisphosphonates reassessed again at 5 years to determine whether a bisphosphonate holiday would be considered; routine use of bone turnover markers is not recommended and follow-up contact by an office nurse may be the most effective means to enhance adherence; depending on treatment, an appropriate interval for repeat BMD testing is 1 to 2 years after beginning treatment or when a change in therapy is considered, and initial dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and follow-up scans should ideally be performed on the same instrument using the same procedure, with careful attention to DXA quality control; if progressive loss of BMD or fractures occur on therapy, evaluate for reasons for suboptimal response, even when treatment increases T-score values above −2.5 ongoing management is required, and referral to bone specialists is recommended for women with very low T-scores, inadequate treatment response, or additional factors requiring special management.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^b592ee75]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective: To assess the value of monitoring response to bisphosphonate treatment by means of measuring bone mineral density.

Design Secondary analysis of trial data using mixed models.

Data source The Fracture Intervention Trial, a randomised controlled trial that compared the effects of alendronate and placebo in 6459 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density recruited between May 1992 and May 1993. Bone density measurements of hip and spine were obtained at baseline and at one, two, and three years after randomisation.

Main outcome measures Between-person (treatment related) variation and within-person (measurement related) variation in hip and spine bone mineral density.

Results The mean effect of three years' treatment with alendronate was to increase hip bone mineral density by 0.030 g/cm 2. There was some between-person variation in the effects of alendronate, but this was small in size compared with within-person variation. Alendronate treatment is estimated to result in increases in hip bone density ≥ 0.019 g/cm 2 in 97.5% of patients.

Conclusions: Monitoring bone mineral density in postmenopausal women in the first three years after starting treatment with a potent bisphosphonate is unnecessary and may be misleading. Routine monitoring should be avoided in this early period after bisphosphonate treatment is commenced.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^56d02325]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually. In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period. In this Beyond the Guidelines, 2 experts discuss management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient, the role of bone density monitoring during and after a 5-year course of alendronate, and treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after a 5-year course of alendronate.

Objective

To assess the value of monitoring response to bisphosphonate treatment by means of measuring bone mineral density.

Design

Secondary analysis of trial data using mixed models. Data source The Fracture Intervention Trial, a randomised controlled trial that compared the effects of alendronate and placebo in 6459 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density recruited between May 1992 and May 1993. Bone density measurements of hip and spine were obtained at baseline and at one, two, and three years after randomisation.

Main Outcome Measures

Between-person (treatment related) variation and within-person (measurement related) variation in hip and spine bone mineral density.

Results

The mean effect of three years' treatment with alendronate was to increase hip bone mineral density by 0.030 g/cm(2). There was some between-person variation in the effects of alendronate, but this was small in size compared with within-person variation. Alendronate treatment is estimated to result in increases in hip bone density ≥ 0.019 g/cm(2) in 97.5% of patients.

Conclusions

Monitoring bone mineral density in postmenopausal women in the first three years after starting treatment with a potent bisphosphonate is unnecessary and may be misleading. Routine monitoring should be avoided in this early period after bisphosphonate treatment is commenced.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^de5cd888]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ms BPS has been taking alendronate for 15 years, a duration of treatment that should be generally discouraged due to the cumulative efficacy of bisphosphonates and concern of rare adverse effects, albeit ones that are more strongly associated with very prolonged bisphosphonate use. A detailed history should explore any previous drug holidays or temporary discontinuation (prescribed or self‐administered). This could help to tailor the length of a new, possible drug holiday. Clinical evaluation should include assessment for thigh or groin pain indicative of prodromal symptoms of AFF and oral examination for dental health status that might affect ONJ risk.

Diagnostic evaluation should include a current DXA scan to assess BMD changes over time. If her BMD has remained stable or improved, and her fracture risk is now moderate to low, initiating a drug holiday might be considered. In addition, DXA images sometimes (if the window of interest is slightly lowered) can be used to screen for AFF and may add value. During her drug holiday, she should be under regular monitoring of BMD and BTMs. A significant decline in BMD or a significant increase in BTMs toward baseline levels may indicate the need to resume therapy. The duration of her drug holiday might vary but is typically less than one year.

Methods

Study design and population

We analysed data from the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), a randomised trial that compared the effects of alendronate with placebo in 6459 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density (≤ 0.68 g/cm 2 at baseline). The trial had two arms — the vertebral fracture arm, which included 2027 women who had vertebral fractures identified on radiographs at baseline, and the clinical fracture arm, which included 4432 women without baseline vertebral fractures. Patients for both arms were recruited between May 1992 and May 1993. Data from both arms are included in this paper, with an adjustment made for the arm a particular patient was in by including a term to represent trial arm in the models. Analysis was by intention to treat, and all subjects were included regardless of compliance with study treatment or fracture outcomes.

Patients were randomly allocated to daily alendronate or placebo. Alendronate dose was initially 5 mg/day for two years but was increased to 10 mg/day at the second annual visit because other trials suggested that 10 mg/day had greater effects on bone mineral density. Women in each treatment group who had dietary calcium intakes < 1000 mg/day at baseline (82% of participants) were asked to take a daily supplement containing 500 mg of elemental calcium and 250 IU of vitamin D.

Monitoring measurements

Bone mineral density was measured at the hip and posterior-anterior (PA) spine on all participants with Hologic QDR 2000 densitometers at baseline and at yearly intervals after randomisation. Serial measurements were made with the same machine at each clinical centre. Quality control measures have been described previously. We used bone mineral density data from baseline and the first three years after randomisation to evaluate response to treatment.

### Bone mineral density: clinical relevance and quantitative assessment [^b0ecadd0]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an internationally accepted standard-of-care screening tool used to assess fragility-fracture risk. Society guidelines have recommended which populations may benefit from DXA screening and the use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to guide decisions regarding pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis. According to the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, postmenopausal women and men at least 50 y old with osteopenic BMD warrant pharmacologic treatment if they have a FRAX-calculated 10-y probability of at least 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with osteoporosis defined by a clinical event, namely a fragility fracture, or with an osteoporotic BMD should also be treated. Patients who are treated for osteoporosis should be monitored regularly to track expected gains in BMD by serial DXA scans. With some drug therapies, BMD targets can be reached whereby further improvements in BMD are not associated with further reductions in fracture risk. Although reaching this target might suggest a stopping point for therapy, the reversibility of most treatments for osteoporosis, except for the bisphosphonates, has dampened enthusiasm for this approach. In the case of denosumab, it is now apparent that stopping therapy at any point can lead to an increase in multiple-fracture risk. For patients who do not respond to antiosteoporosis pharmacologic therapy with an improvement in BMD, or who have an incident fragility fracture on therapy, secondary causes of osteoporosis or non-compliance with medical therapy should be considered.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^165fe7e9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) changes with osteoporosis therapies and implications for monitoring indicate that "the usual time point for monitoring is after 2 years of treatment". Expected mean lumbar spine BMD changes for alendronate 70 mg weekly, risedronate 35 mg weekly, ibandronate 150 mg monthly, zoledronate 5 mg annually, denosumab 60 mg 6-monthly, and raloxifene 60 mg daily are "7%, 3%, 7%, 7%, 8%, and 3%, respectively", while total hip BMD changes are "5%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and 1%, respectively". Teriparatide "(20 μg/d) increased the BMD of the spine and total hip by ∼13% and 4%, respectively, after 24 months". Regarding monitoring utility, "Evidence to support the use of BMD for monitoring the treatment response is weak but suggests that BMD can be used for this purpose", and "serial BMD measurements in treated subjects may identify patients who are not adhering to treatment or patients who have a secondary cause for bone loss", with a retrospective study showing BMD monitoring "was associated with improved compliance".

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^0252ec47]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis and associated fragility fractures are major threats to the health of ageing populations worldwide. Evidence based clinical guidelines provide advice on how to identify and treat individuals at high risk of fracture. Bisphosphonates in particular are important for preventive treatment. What is less certain is how to determine an individual's true response once treatment is started.

Guidelines for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis differ in their recommendations for monitoring after starting bisphosphonates. The US National Osteoporosis Foundation and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend routine monitoring of bone mineral density within two years of starting treatment. The UK National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group, US National Institutes of Health, and the Osteoporosis Society of Canada do not make a recommendation either way on monitoring. The UK guidelines recommend that further research is needed and the North American guidelines recommend that treatment should not be stopped or changed because of a modest observed loss in density.

Bone density monitoring of patients receiving treatment consumes considerable health resources. The availability of bone densitometry varies substantially between countries, with about 10 times as many densitometers per million population in the US as in the UK (35.8 v 3.7 scanners/million population). Although this reflects use of densitometry for case finding as well as for monitoring treatment, it is likely that over half of all measurements done are for monitoring.

Meta-analyses of trials of anti-resorptive agents such as bisphosphonates have found significant association between treatment effects on bone mineral density and fracture risk, with the relation seeming to be stronger for non-vertebral facturesthan vertebral fractures. Although this suggests that bone density may be considered as an intermediate outcome for monitoring treatment effects at a population level, more evidence is needed before we can decide whether it should be used for monitoring treatment effects at an individual level.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b535d413]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) includes evidence, dosing, and monitoring: A phase 3 study randomized 1468 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing ADT, and at 24 months denosumab increased bone mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%); denosumab also was approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastasis. Currently, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy. A baseline DEXA scan before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA scan after one year of therapy is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry to monitor response, use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended, and there are no existing guidelines on the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

### Monitoring treatment for osteoporosis by using bone densitometry [^ab42f19f]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In recent years, the range of treatments available for patients with osteoporosis has greatly increased. A decade ago, the only proven therapy was estrogen, but today the choices include bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone. Clinical trials involving bone mineral density (BMD) scans of the spine and femur have had an important role in the evaluation of these new therapies. In particular, the efficacy of treatments has now been verified in large studies powered to show reductions in fracture risk. In contrast with the use of BMD scans in research studies, their value for monitoring response to treatment in individual patients is less certain. In many cases, the increases in BMD are too small to reliably distinguish between true changes and measurement error. However, experience with estrogen and bisphosphonates suggests that these treatments have a beneficial effect on bone in most patients. Follow-up scans for patients taking these agents are therefore of limited value, apart from offering reassurance to the patient and the doctor. However, when new therapies are first introduced, follow-up scans have a useful role in building up the physician's experience and confidence.

Results

The results of the primary mixed models analysis (where hip bone mineral density was the outcome) are shown in figures 1 and 2 (the full statistical results are presented in appendix 2 on bmj.com). Fig 1shows the mean bone mineral density trajectories for alendronate and placebo groups from year 1 to year 3 after starting treatment. These represent the mean effects (based on both the fixed and random effects) found in the final mixed model. The mean effect of time in the placebo group was a decrease of 0.004 g/cm 2 per year (P < 0.001), shown by the downward slope for the placebo mean trajectory in fig 1. The mean effect of one year's treatment with alendronate (relative to placebo) was an increase of 0.013 g/cm 2 (P < 0.001), which is shown in fig 1 by the difference in the mean trajectories for alendronate and placebo at year 1 (the intercept). The mean effect of time in the alendronate group (relative to the placebo group) was an increase in bone mineral density of 0.0085 g/cm 2 per year (P < 0.001), shown by the diverging trajectories (difference in slopes) of the two treatment groups in fig 1. There was no evidence that treatment effect was modified by baseline bone density (P = 0.65), age (P = 0.65), body mass index (P = 1.0), general health (P = 0.11), or trial arm (P = 0.32).

Fig 1 Mean bone mineral density over time for 6459 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density treated with alendronate or placebo. (As this is a randomised trial, at year 0 the mean bone mineral density is similar for the alendronate and placebo groups)

Fig 2shows the variance between individuals at the three time points and represents the variances of the random effects of the final mixed model (excluding residual variances). We first consider the placebo variance trajectory. There was considerable variation between patients in the placebo group at one year (P < 0.001), which is shown in fig 2 by the variance of the placebo group at year 1. In addition, there was variation between individuals in how their bone mineral density changed over time (P < 0.001), shown by the increasing variance in both groups over the three years.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^c754e5a3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG repeat BMD screening and monitoring — ACOG suggests repeat osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal patients with initial BMD test results near treatment thresholds or with significant changes in risk factors; for most patients, repeat BMD testing should be performed no sooner than 2 years after initial screening, which ACOG labels as "CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE". Individuals most likely to benefit from a shorter interval include those with a low baseline BMD or a BMD near treatment thresholds and those with medical conditions or medication use that place them at risk of accelerated bone loss; the American College of Radiology recommends a 2-year monitoring interval. Serial bone density measurements should be performed at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and because of device differences and calibration, follow-up ideally should use the same DXA device; authors also concluded that 3-year repeat BMD testing should not routinely be performed.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^bdfd48f5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of this analysis should be considered. First, denosumab was only administered for 1 year before transition to alendronate. With longer-term denosumab treatment, there will be continued gains in BMD and the potential for greater bone loss after treatment is stopped, and it could be more difficult to preserve bone mass when transitioning to bisphosphonates. Determining the optimal timing, dose, and bisphosphonate medication to administer after denosumab cessation warrants further study. Second, this post hoc analysis had a modest sample size, particularly for the analysis of participants divided into BMD response groups (ie, lost, maintained, and gained). However, the current sample size is larger than that reported in other ad-hoc case series investigating denosumab discontinuation and bisphosphonate follow-on therapy. Third, the analysis was not powered to detect statistical relationships between participant characteristics and their BMD response in year 2, and all analyses were descriptive in nature. Fourth, the effectiveness of alendronate to maintain BMD in this study may have been unrealistically high, given the difficulties with compliance and dosing faced in clinical practice. Finally, DXA assessment for this study was not centralized; therefore, BMD results may vary by center.

Denosumab treatment increased BMD at all skeletal sites examined, and the gains in BMD achieved with denosumab were maintained in the majority of participants after transitioning to alendronate. Among participants who lost BMD in year 2 with alendronate, the majority remained above their pretreatment baseline value. Those with larger BMD increases in year 1 often showed greater BMD losses in year 2, with other participant characteristics not related to the response in year 2. These data highlight the need for oral bisphosphonate therapy following denosumab cessation and BMD monitoring of patients transitioning from denosumab to bisphosphonates.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^b9996c82]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk, and bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy; in a population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration had a lower fracture risk than medical castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; P = 0.01). A baseline bone mineral density study should be considered for the patients on ADT; the National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include calcium (1000–1200 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily), and additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) at specified sites and a 10-year probability of hip fracture greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%; fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX®, and ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis" using the FRAX® algorithm. Evidence includes a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients in which, at 24 months, denosumab increased bone mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared to placebo. When drug therapy is warranted by absolute fracture risk, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is recommended; a baseline DEXA before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA after one year is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry; use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended, and there are no existing guidelines on the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^6af86c48]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures

Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.

Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture.

Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.

5.6 Renal Impairment

Alendronate sodium is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min.

5.7 Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

The risk versus benefit of alendronate sodium for treatment at daily dosages of glucocorticoids less than 7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent has not been established [see Indications and Usage (1.4)]. Before initiating treatment, the gonadal hormonal status of both men and women should be ascertained and appropriate replacement considered.

A bone mineral density measurement should be made at the initiation of therapy and repeated after 6 to 12 months of combined alendronate sodium and glucocorticoid treatment.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^880569c7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Fig 2 Between-person variances in bone mineral density over time for 6459 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density treated with alendronate or placebo. (As this is a randomised trial, at year 0 the between-person variance is similar for the alendronate and placebo groups)

There was also considerable within-person variation over time (not shown in the figures). The within-person variation was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the group receiving alendronate (standard deviation 0.012 g/cm 2) compared with the placebo group (SD 0.014 g/cm 2). Bland-Altman plotsshowed that within-person variation did not depend on the individual's mean level of bone mineral density (data not shown).

After allowing for the statistically significant random effects of background sources of variation, there remained strong evidence of variation between individuals in the effects of alendronate on hip bone mineral density (P = 0.008), shown in fig 2by the difference in the variance trajectories for alendronate and placebo at year 1. Although the variation in treatment effects was statistically significant, it was small in size with a standard deviation of 0.006 g/cm 2, which is about half the standard deviation of within-person variation on treatment. A comparison of variances was even more marked, with the variance of between-person variation in treatment effects being only about one tenth the variance of background within-person variation. The 95% distribution for the between-person effects of one year's treatment on hip bone density did not overlap zero, ranging from an increase in hip bone mineral density of 0.002 g/cm 2 (2.5th centile) to an increase of 0.024 g/cm 2 (97.5th centile).

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^3f596a4e]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) provided guidance on managing the discontinuation of denosumab to mitigate the rebound effect. The ECTS strongly recommended initiating an alternative antiresorptive treatment at the time the patient is due for the next denosumab injection. Moreover, in patients who have been taking denosumab for only one year, switching to alendronate has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing rebound bone loss. The most commonly recommended approach is to administer a potent bisphosphonate such as zoledronate six months after the final dose of denosumab. This timing is crucial because it coincides with the period when denosumab's effects start to wane and the risk of rebound increases. The exact timing of bisphosphonate administration following denosumab discontinuation is still an open question. For example, if bisphosphonates are administered too late (ie, more than nine months after the last denosumab injection), the maximum rebound in bone turnover might have already occurred, reducing the efficacy of bisphosphonates in preventing BMD loss and fractures. Administration of a pulsatile bisphosphonate too early also might not be maximally effective. Indeed, six months after the last dose of denosumab, many patients still have a closed remodeling phase with less exposed bone available for binding by a bisphosphonate. In patients with prolonged denosumab use, the rebound effect is more pronounced, and a single dose of bisphosphonate might not be sufficient, potentially necessitating additional doses or alternative strategies.

If clinically available, monitoring of BTMs after denosumab discontinuation can help tailor subsequent therapy more effectively. For patients showing significant increases in these markers, rapid BMD loss or not responding to a single dose of zoledronic acid, additional doses may be required. If BTMs are not available, then redosing as soon as three months or as late as six months after the first zoledronic acid dose is prudent. Moreover, the ECTS guidance on denosumab discontinuation may present challenges for implementation in the United States and other health systems due to payment concerns. Specifically, the recommendation for BMD assessment at six months after discontinuation, followed by a zoledronic acid infusion at the same time, is often not covered or reimbursed by some health plans. As an alternative approach, if BTMs remain elevated at 6 months, clinicians could consider adding alendronate for 6 months before administering a second dose of zoledronic acid 12 months after denosumab discontinuation.

### Effects of continuing or stopping alendronate after 5 years of treatment… [^d0953d72]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

BMD indicates bone mineral density; FIT, Fracture Intervention Trial; FLEX, Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension. BMD indicates bone mineral density; FIT, Fracture Intervention Trial; FLEX, Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Data are shown for the period spanning the beginning of FIT through the completion of FLEX, a total of 10 years. *Measured in clinical fracture arm only. Intervention Randomization to alendronate, 5 mg/d or 10 mg/d, or placebo for 5 years. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was total hip bone mineral density; secondary measures were BMD at other sites and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. An exploratory outcome measure was fracture incidence. Similarly, those discontinuing alendronate had increased serum markers of bone turnover compared with continuing alendronate:

55. 6% for C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen,
59.

5% for serum N = propeptide of type 1 collagen, and 28. 1% for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, but after 5 years without therapy, bone marker levels remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT 00398931 Osteoporosis is common among postmenopausal women, and the disease process is characterized by increased bone turnover, progressive loss of bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration, and increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates, which are antiresorptive drugs, are the most commonly used pharmacologic treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate, a potent bisphosphonate, decreases bone turnover, increases bone mineral density, and decreases vertebral, nonspine, and hip fracture risk in women with osteoporosis. 1–4.

Among women previously treated for 5 years with alendronate, those who were randomly assigned to continue alendronate for 5 additional years maintained higher BMD at the hip and spine than those randomized to placebo. In those continuing alendronate, biomarkers of bone remodeling remained reduced, while those who stopped had a gradual increase in bone remodeling that, however, remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^43405d92]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Treatment monitoring — dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) interval and labs: ACOG suggests DXA testing every 1–3 years during osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, depending on clinical circumstances, until findings are stable. Expert guidelines recommend repeat bone mineral density (BMD) testing after 1–3 years, preferably on the same DXA machine, and recommend evaluation of renal function and serum calcium and vitamin D levels every 1–2 years. Patients with progressive BMD loss or a new or recurrent fragility fracture should be evaluated for causes of suboptimal response to therapy.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^289f0102]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Monitoring therapy in osteoporosis — We suggest that clinicians monitor bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the spine and hip every 1 to 2 yr to assess the response to treatment, and if BMD appears to reach a plateau, the frequency of BMD measurements may be reduced. Evidence shows that alendronate increased BMD of the spine and femoral neck by about 7 and 2.5%, respectively, after 2 yr; risedronate increased BMD of the spine and femoral neck by about 6 and 1.5%, respectively, after 2 yr; teriparatide (20 μg/d) increased BMD of the spine and femoral neck by about 6 and 1.5%, respectively, after 9 months; and in hypogonadal men, testosterone enanthate (200 mg every 2 wk) increased spine, trochanter, and total hip BMD by about 8, 5, and 3.5%, respectively, after 2 yr. Evidence to support the use of BMD for monitoring treatment response is weak but suggests that it can be used for this purpose; serial BMD measurements may identify patients who are not adhering to treatment or who have an overlooked cause for bone loss, and although total hip BMD changes reflect medication compliance, use of serial BMD to identify subjects with secondary osteoporosis is anecdotal.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

A longitudinal pilot imaging study comparing the effects of alendronate with those of placebo (calcium and vitamin D) on bone microarchitecture was conducted in a total of 53 community-dwelling, ambulatory, postmenopausal women defined as osteopenic by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A detailed baseline characterization of this study group has been reported elsewhere. The women were between the ages of 45 and 65 years, with a mean age of 55.6 years (Table 1). The women were postmenopausal for at least 1 but not more than 6 years, with a mean duration of 31 months postmenopause. The subjects had low BMD levels (T -score range −1.1 to −2.5) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at either the lumbar spine or the total proximal femur, trochanter, or neck regions of interest. A total of 53 women were randomized 1:1 — 26 in the treatment group [70 mg of alendronate once weekly and daily 2800 IU of vitamin D 3 and OSCal + D (1000 mg of calcium + 400 IU of vitamin D 3)] and 27 in the placebo group [daily 2800 IU of vitamin D 3 and OSCal + D (1000 mg of calcium + 400 IU of vitamin D 3)]. The study size was based on power calculations of previous longitudinal µMRI data indicating a required sample size of 23 per group in order to detect a treatment difference of 5% (power = 0.95, α = 0.05) in trabecular number at the distal radius. Exclusion criteria included a history of fracture after age 50, history of or evidence for metabolic bone disease other than postmenopausal bone loss, treatment within the previous year with any compound known to influence bone turnover, and estrogen use within the past 6 months. Other exclusion criteria related to indications for specific imaging techniques included in the full study protocol (DXA, HR-pQCT, and MRI) were subject weight greater than 250 lb (113.4 kg), the presence of a pacemaker, and claustrophobia. The UCSF Committee of Human Research approved the study protocol, and all patients gave written informed consent prior to participation.

### Alendronate does not interfere with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scanning [^0019946f]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Several studies have found that administration of etidronate results in competitive interference with 99mTc-labeled bone scanning reagents. In contrast, in other studies this problem was not encountered with other bisphosphonates.

Methods

We prospectively studied 9 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scanning was performed before they received alendronate, and scanning was repeated a mean of 16.6 d afterward, when the patients had been receiving 40 mg alendronate daily for a mean of 6 d. In addition, 7 patients who underwent delayed scanning when they had been receiving alendronate for a mean of 111 d were also restudied. Quantitative whole-body bone scanning was performed, and radioactivity deposited in the bone metastasis was determined using region-of-interest analysis.

Results

A < 6% increase in whole-body retention of 99mTc-MDP was seen on the initial postalendronate scan compared with the baseline scan. No significant differences in activity were seen in the bone lesion evaluated on the baseline and initial postalendronate studies. The delayed postalendronate scan generally showed similar or higher tracer accumulation compared with the baseline scan.

Conclusion

Alendronate did not competitively inhibit uptake of 99mTc-MDP in the skeleton or tumor metastasis. Use of alendronate before bone scanning is unlikely to result in decreased detection of lesions or falsely decreased 99mTc-MDP activity at metastatic bone tumor sites.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^b487ba04]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update adds the following:
Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy.
Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management.
Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, but should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.
Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment.
Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors which are associated with bone loss.
Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies, medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases, and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.
If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care.
A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison is available, and the precise timing depends particular clinical circumstances.
If the DXA interpreter has adequate clinical information, a precise timing for the next BMD should be recommended; otherwise, a general recommendation about repeat testing should still be part of the report.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^5fda75fc]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Mixed models are a powerful method for analysing data from longitudinal studies, in which there are multiple measurements on each subject. This approach allows explicit modelling of the within-person and between-person variation in the outcome, while taking into account the correlation between measurements taken on the same individual. In this type of analysis, predictive factors may be fitted to have the same effect for everyone, in which case they are said to be fixed effects (these effects are equivalent to the estimated effects in ordinary least squares regression models). Alternatively, the predictive factors may be fitted to have effects that differ between individuals, in which case they are said to have random effects (these effects are not allowed for in ordinary least squares regression models). These alternative models can be compared using likelihood ratio tests to determine which model provides the best fit for the data. If there is no variation in the treatment effect between patients then we would expect the mixed models to find that treatment has a fixed effect and no random effects. Conversely, if there is variation in the treatment effects between patients then we would expect the mixed models to find that treatment has random effects.

We fitted a series of mixed models using bone mineral density measurements over three years. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare models where treatment effect was the same for everyone (treatment had a fixed effect) with models where treatment effect differed between individuals (treatment had random effects). (For a more detailed explanation of model fitting, see appendix 1 on bmj.com and Bell et al).

For fixed effects we estimated the mean effect applicable to all patients, whereas for random effects we estimated the mean and standard deviation of effects across patients. For random effects we also estimated a 95% distribution of treatment effects, an interval in which the treatment effect for 95% of the study population should lie (mean value +/− (1.96 × standard deviation)).

As the primary analysis we used hip bone mineral density measurements alone (or univariate response models). The hip is the best site for predicting risk of hip fracture and osteoporotic fractures overall. However many clinicians use both hip and spine bone density measurements to monitor treatment effects. Hip and spine bone mineral density measurements made at the same time on the same individual are correlated. As an extension to the analysis outlined above, we also fitted models that considered both hip and spine bone mineral density simultaneously, while allowing for their correlation (or bivariate response models).

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^5aee4b0a]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement 100. We recommend that patients starting corticosteroids should be assessed for risk of osteoporosis. Those at high risk should be started on bisphosphonate therapy at the onset of corticosteroid therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), after ensuring adequate calcium intake and supplementing vitamin D (Agreement: 90.7%).

Reduction in bone mineral density and fracture risk are worsened by oral corticosteroid use, and the greatest bone loss occurs in the first 6 months of treatment. Before starting oral steroids, patients should have their fracture risk assessed as shown in figure 5. For patients aged over 40, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) can be used to assess the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with a high FRAX score (score ≥ 20% major fracture and ≥ 3% hip fracture), those aged under 40 with risk factors or those receiving prolonged (more than 3 months) or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density assessed by bone densitometry. Note that FRAX does not discriminate past versus current corticosteroid use, nor does it stratify risk according to doses beyond 7.5 mg, and risk should be adjusted accordingly. Patients on long-term steroids should have a repeat bone densitometry at 1 year, and if stable, repeated at 2–3-year intervals, but if declining, repeated annually. Women and men aged 70 or more, with past fragility fracture, taking high-dose steroids (7.5 mg or more prednisolone-equivalent), or at high risk based on FRAX score, should be considered for bone-protective therapy at the start of steroid treatment. Alendronate or risedronate should be used, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated, in which case intravenous zoledronate or teriparatide should be given. For women of childbearing age requiring bone-protective therapy, if they are taking effective contraception (or not sexually active), oral bisphosphonates are the first-line therapy followed by teriparatide if oral bisphosphonates cannot be used. Denusomab and high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates should not be used in this situation due to lack of data on the risk of fetal harm should an unplanned pregnancy occur. There is a lack of safety data on use of denosumab with immunosuppressive therapy, and on all osteoporosis therapies during pregnancy, other than calcium and vitamin D.

### A longitudinal HR-pQCT study of alendronate treatment in postmenopausal women with low bone density: relations among density, cortical and trabecular microarchitecture, biomechanics, and bone turnover [^6fa75ea6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

There are several technical limitations to this study that should be acknowledged. First, common VOIs between baseline and follow-up scans are determined based on 2D periosteal cross-sectional area matching. This approach inherently assumes a constant cross-sectional area between measurements. A change in cross-sectional area via periosteal apposition would be expected to introduce an erroneous longitudinal offset between baseline and follow-up VOIs registered in this fashion. Recently, Boyd reported a pronounced structural variation along the distal-proximal axis of the radius in the distal region measured by HR-pQCT. Collectively, this raises the possibility of specific biases in longitudinal changes determined with area-based registration. Full 3D image registration techniques, which have been shown previously to moderately improve short-term reproducibility of HR-pQCT measurements, potentially would improve true region matching between longitudinal measurements. For this study, it is worth noting that clinical doses of alendronate in animal models have not been found to significantly increase periosteal apposition and therefore cross-sectional area. Accordingly, malregistration owing to periosteal changes is not likely to be an important source of error.

A critical assumption of the standard analysis is a reliance on fixed-intensity thresholds and the derivation of trabecular BV/TV directly from Tb.vBMD. Alendronate has been found previously to modify tissue matrix mineralization by as much as 10%. This has been shown to introduce moderate overestimation of changes in Ct. Th when calculated based on the cortical area and perimeter and also would be expected to result in an overestimation of changes in densitometric trabecular BV/TV. As discussed previously, direct 3D quantification of cortical thickness was applied in this study in addition to the standard areal estimate and confirmed a true affect on tibial cortical geometry independent of matrix mineralization changes.

Recent phantom studies have found that Tb.vBMD measured by HR-pQCT is subject to geometric biases (ie, cortical thickness) likely related to beam-hardening and X-ray scatter. While this is an important consideration for cross-sectional comparisons with large biologic variability, it is not expected to be a substantial source of error for measures of longitudinal change in an individual. Whereas the range of Ct. Th (0.5 to 3.5 mm) and Tb.vBMD (60 to 360 mg HA/cm 3) considered by Sekhon and colleagues spanned broad cross-sectional extremes, the longitudinal changes in Ct. Th and Tb.vBMD in this study were very small by comparison (< 4%).

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^c8ec833b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate holiday — monitoring and dose adjustment in postmenopausal osteoporosis states that fracture risk and bone mineral density (BMD) should be re-evaluated every 2 to 4 years after discontinuation, and that a significant drop in BMD (or a large increase in bone turnover markers) may lead to reinitiation of therapy before the 5-year maximum holiday is completed; some data suggest that a lower dose of alendronate (5 mg/d) after 5 years can maintain BMD and bone turnover marker levels as effectively as continuing the full dose (10 mg/d), but whether dose reduction decreases atypical femoral fracture (AFF) risk is unknown.

### Monitoring osteoporosis therapy: bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, or both? [^193c8538]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Monitoring the efficacy associated with antiresorptive therapy is an intuitive yet integral part of successful osteoporosis management. Although response rates to bisphosphonates in clinical trials — as judged by changes in bone mineral density (BMD) — are generally high, a small percentage of compliant patients do not respond. Accordingly, monitoring may help identify noncompliant patients and allow for other, possibly more successful, therapeutic interventions. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is the accepted method of assessing BMD to determine the need for treatment and to monitor its effects. Change in BMD is considered a valid intermediate end point for efficacy of fracture risk reduction. However, clinical trials have shown that the reduction in fracture risk associated with antiresorptive therapy may occur before changes in BMD become apparent. Vertebral fracture benefit is observed even among women who maintain rather than gain BMD during antiresorptive therapy. Clinical trials show that suppression of bone turnover markers after as little as 3 months of therapy is strongly associated with reductions in risk for fracture. Although formal guidelines for monitoring bone turnover markers do not yet exist, there are data to suggest that changes in these markers are valid intermediate endpoints for efficacy of fracture risk reduction that may provide valuable additional data on therapeutic success, particularly early in treatment and before changes in BMD become apparent.

### Efficacy of alendronate in the treatment of low bone density in the pediatric and young adult population [^cd517adf]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric osteoporosis is uncommon but can result in painful and debilitating insufficiency fractures. Treatment options for osteoporosis in children are few. Bisphosphonate therapy for children has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, but its use in that population has been increasing. Randomized controlled studies have not been done because of the small subject pool and the difficulty in randomizing a child with an insufficiency fracture to a placebo arm of a study. This retrospective case-control study of a population of children with primarily neuromuscular disease was done to review changes in bone mineral density as reflected by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.

Methods

Medical records and DXA scans were screened to identify children with low bone density who had been treated with alendronate as well as similar control subjects with low bone density for their age who had not received alendronate. Medication acquisition was confirmed by refill records, and cumulative exposure was calculated. Interval DXA scans were reviewed to correlate bone mineral density change in grams per square centimeter as well as the percent change and percent change over time for both alendronate-treated and control subjects.

Results

Twenty-eight alendronate-treated subjects and thirty control subjects met the inclusion criteria. No significant improvement in bone mineral density was seen in the alendronate-treated subjects as compared with the control subjects. Some patients in both groups exhibited marked improvement, with improvement of > 31% seen only in the alendronate-treated subjects.

Conclusions

Alendronate does not reliably improve bone density in children and young adults with primarily neuromuscular disease and without osteogenesis imperfecta. Individual patients treated with bisphosphonates must be carefully followed to ensure medication compliance and appropriate response.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^3b82bcd5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density

The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years' duration. Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See Figure 3 for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean).

In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.

Bone Histology

Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate sodium is of normal quality.

Daily Dosing

The efficacy of alendronate 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials. Study 1, a three-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, US clinical study enrolled 478 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 2, a three-year, multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Multinational clinical study enrolled 516 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 3, the Three-Year Study of the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) a study which enrolled 2027 postmenopausal patients with at least one baseline vertebral fracture; and Study 4, the Four-Year Study of FIT: a study which enrolled 4432 postmenopausal patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture.

Effect on Fracture Incidence

To assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate sodium experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate sodium had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).

The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e., had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^b1d286c2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up VFA or radiographic lateral spine imaging should be used in patients with continued high risk [e.g. historical height loss > 4 cm (> 1.5 inches)], self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to ≥ 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for greater than or equal to three months).

When used to monitor the effects of treatment, the frequency of BMD measurements should be guided by a number of factors, including the therapy used, availability of resources, national guidelines and reimbursement policies, and the clinical site being measured. Changes are generally greater at the lumbar spine than total hip and greater for osteoanabolic therapy than antiresorptive therapy. These data suggest the most likely result will be 'no change' for non-anabolic treatments if a DXA scan is repeated within 2–3 years from the beginning of anti-resorptive therapy. In addition, an incident fragility fracture while on treatment is generally regarded as an indication for bone densitometry. Based on the ISCD minimum acceptable LSC of 5% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine, significant changes in BMD are unlikely to be seen before 3 years in individuals treated with most anti-resorptive drugs but may be evident in the LS after one year with anabolic therapies.

### Alendronate sodium [^6780ec60]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Alendronate reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the Three-Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p = 0.035).

Thus, alendronate reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic vertebral fracture.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density: The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years' duration.

Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. meta-analysis of alendronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women [^edae0526]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effect of alendronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women.

Data Source

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled trials registry from 1980 to 1999, and we examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

Study Selection

We included 11 trials that randomized women to alendronate or placebo and measured bone density for at least 1 yr.

Data Extraction

For each trial, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data.

Data Synthesis

The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in patients given 5 mg or more of alendronate was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43–0.65]. The RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 10 mg or more of alendronate was 0.51 (95% CI 0.38–0.69), an appreciably greater effect than for the 5 mg dose. We found a similar reduction in RR across nonvertebral fracture types; in particular, RR reductions for fractures traditionally thought to be "osteoporotic", such as hip and forearm, were very similar to RR reductions for "nonosteoporotic" fractures. Individual studies showed similar results, reflected in the P values of the test of heterogeneity (P = 0.99 for vertebral and 0.88 for nonvertebral fractures). Alendronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density, which increased with both dose and time. After 3 yr of treatment with 10 mg of alendronate or more, the pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between alendronate and placebo was 7.48% (95% CI 6.12–8.85) for the lumbar spine (2–3 yr), 5.60% (95% CI 4.80–6.39) for the hip (3–4 yr), 2.08% (95% CI 1.53–2.63) for the forearm (2–4 yr), and 2.73% (95% CI 2.27–3.20) for the total body (3 yr). Heterogeneity of the treatment effect of alendronate was not consistently explained by any of our a priori hypotheses; in particular, the effect was very similar in prevention and treatment studies. The pooled RR for discontinuing medication due to adverse effects for 5 mg or greater of alendronate was 1.15 (95% CI 0.93–1.42). The pooled RR for discontinuing medication due to gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects for 5 mg or greater was 1.03 (0.81–1.30, P = 0.83), and the pooled RR for GI adverse effects with continuation of medication was 1.03 (0.98 to 1.07) P = 0.23.

Conclusions

Alendronate increases bone density in both early postmenopausal women and those with established osteoporosis while reducing the rate of vertebral fracture over 2–3 yr of treatment. Reductions in nonvertebral fractures are evident among postmenopausal women without prevalent fractures and have bone mineral density (BMD) levels below the World Health Organization threshold for osteoporosis. The impact on fractures appears consistent across all fracture types, casting doubt on traditional distinctions between osteoporotic and nonosteoporotic fractures.

### Value of routine monitoring of bone mineral density after starting bisphosphonate treatment: secondary analysis of trial data [^8d004863]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

There was no strong evidence of additional between-person variation in treatment effects after one year (P = 0.07), shown in fig 2by the parallel variance trajectories of the two treatment groups. After three years, the mean cumulative treatment effect was 0.030 g/cm 2 (0.013 g/cm 2 + (2 × 0.0085 g/cm 2)). The standard deviation of between-person variation in cumulative treatment effect was 0.006 g/cm 2, the same as the variation in treatment effect after one year. The 95% distribution for the effects of three years' treatment ranged from an increase in bone mineral density of 0.019 g/cm 2 (2.5th centile) to an increase of 0.041 g/cm 2 (97.5th centile).

The bivariate response analysis (where both hip and spine bone mineral density were considered together) yielded similar conclusions to the univariate response analysis presented above. We found strong evidence of between-person variation in the effects of treatment (P < 0.001), but again the absolute size of this variation was small (standard deviation of between-person variation in treatment effect was 0.006 g/cm 2 for hip and 0.007 g/cm 2 for spine). In the bivariate response analysis the 95% distributions for the effect of one and three years' treatment with alendronate on hip bone mineral density were the same as the univariate analysis. The 95% distribution for the effects of one year's treatment on spine bone mineral density did not overlap zero and ranged from an increase of 0.015 g/cm 2 (2.5th centile) to an increase of 0.042 g/cm 2 (97.5th centile). At the end of three years, the 95% distribution for the effects of treatment on spine bone mineral density ranged from an increase of 0.037 g/cm 2 (2.5th centile) to an increase of 0.064 g/cm 2 (97.5th centile). The correlation between the effects of treatment on hip bone mineral density and spine bone mineral density over the three year time period for an individual was 0.90.

### Alendronate in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroid-related osteoporosis: a 2-year study [^69c43fcb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

We investigated the effect of alendronate on calcium, PTH, and bone mineral density in 27 female and 5 male patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The treatment group [n = 14; T score ≤ -2.5 SD at the femoral neck (FN) or T ≤ -1.0 SD plus previous nonvertebral fracture] was given alendronate 10 mg/d for 24 months. The second group (n = 18; T score > -2.5 SD at the FN) was untreated. Biochemistry was repeated at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at 12 and 24 months. There were no significant between-group baseline differences in calcium, creatinine, or PTH. Alendronate-treated patients gained bone at all sites [lumbar spine (LS), 1 yr gain, +7.3 ± 1.7%; P < 0.001; 2 yr, +7.3 ± 3.1%; P = 0.04). Untreated patients gained bone at the LS over 2 yr (+4.0 ± 1.8%; P = 0.03) but lost bone elsewhere. Calcium fell nonsignificantly in the alendronate group between baseline (2.84 ± 0.12 mmol/liter) and 6 wk (2.76 ± 0.09 mmol/liter), with a nonsignificant rise in PTH (baseline, 103.5 ± 14.6 ng/liter; 6 wk, 116.7 ± 15.6 ng/liter). By 3 months, values had reverted to baseline. In primary hyperparathyroidism, alendronate is well tolerated and significantly improves bone mineral density at the LS (with lesser gains at FN and radius), especially within the first year of treatment. Short-term changes in calcium and PTH resolve by 3 months.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Ideally, BMD monitoring should occur at the same facility using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine, the same technologist if possible, and the same regions of interest for spine and hip; the 1/3 radius site is acceptable when spine and hip sites are not evaluable, whereas other peripheral sites should not be used for monitoring. AACE recommends a repeat DXA 1 to 2 years after initiation of therapy until bone density is stable, with longer intervals between testing when there is continued BMD stability, and significant change is likely to occur earlier at the spine than at the hip. Skeletal status can also be examined by assessing asymptomatic vertebral fractures with repeat X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine or VFA.

Selecting treatment to achieve treatment targets

Initial treatment: Selection of initial treatment should consider the probability that a treatment target can be attained over a reasonable period of time, with greater urgency for patients at imminent fracture risk (recent fracture or some multiple prior fractures). Data to guide these decisions include the likelihood that a treatment can provide at least a 50% probability of attaining the T-score target over 3 yr, depending on the initial BMD. For some patients, it might be appropriate to select treatment to achieve a higher T-score target, reach the treatment target faster, or provide a higher probability of achieving the treatment target.
Sequence of treatment: Treatment sequence is important for attaining T-score targets particularly in patients with baseline T-scores far below the treatment target. Selection of initial therapy should acknowledge the differential impact on BMD for osteoanabolic-first versus antiresorptive-first treatment sequences. Greater and faster BMD increases at the hip and spine are seen with osteoanabolic-first followed by antiresorptive treatment strategies, compared with the reverse order.

Determining if treatment targets have been achieved

To determine whether a treatment target has been achieved requires repeat BMD testing and assessment for new fractures, including vertebral imaging. Having a baseline vertebral image before starting treatment allows confirmation that an incident vertebral fracture has occurred on follow-up vertebral imaging. If a patient experiences one or more new fractures, it indicates that the most important treatment target has not been met, regardless of the T-scores achieved. Monitoring for achievement of a treatment target is distinct from monitoring for treatment responses. To achieve a treatment target, a treatment response is necessary. Treatment response, which can be assessed by measurement of biochemical turnover markers, depends on patient adherence and type and duration of prior osteoporosis medication.

When a treatment target has not been achieved or is unlikely to be achieved, consider changing to more potent therapy (or continuing the highest potency treatment sequence).
When a treatment target has been reached, maintenance of BMD is the focus. This may involve continuing treatment, changing treatment, pausing treatment, or administering intermittent bisphosphonates.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^22c813c4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

There are few studies on patients transitioning from denosumab to bisphosphonates.

Objective

To investigate patient characteristics and changes in bone mineral density (BMD) after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate.

Design

Randomized, open-label, 2-year crossover Denosumab Adherence Preference Satisfaction (DAPS) study (NCT00518531).

Setting

25 study centers in the US and Canada.

Patients

Treatment-naïve postmenopausal women with BMD T-scores from -2.0 to -4.0.

Interventions

This post hoc analysis evaluated women randomized to subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months in year 1 followed by once-weekly oral alendronate 70 mg in year 2.

Main Outcome Measure

A 3% BMD threshold identified participants who lost, maintained, or gained BMD in year 2 on alendronate.

Results

Of 126 participants randomized to denosumab, 115 (91%) transitioned to alendronate in year 2. BMD increased by 3% to 6% with denosumab in year 1 and by 0% to 1% with alendronate in year 2. After transitioning to alendronate, most participants maintained or increased BMD; 15.9%, 7.6%, and 21.7% lost BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively. Few participants fell below their pretreatment baseline BMD value; this occurred most often in those who lost BMD in year 2. Women who lost BMD with alendronate in year 2 also showed a greater percent change in BMD with denosumab in year 1. The BMD change in year 2 was similar regardless of baseline characteristics or adherence to oral alendronate.

Conclusion

Alendronate can effectively maintain the BMD gains accrued after 1 year of denosumab in most patients, regardless of baseline characteristics.

### Alendronate sodium (Binosto) [^6cf30886]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density

The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of 2 or 3 years' duration.

Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate sodium 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

Figure 2	 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in Postmenopausal Women Increase in BMD Alendronate Sodium 10 mg/day at Three Years

At 3 years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as 3 months and continued throughout the 3 years of treatment. (See figures below for lumbar spine results.) In the 2-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean).

In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.

Bone Histology

Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate sodium is of normal quality.

### Long-term predictions of the therapeutic equivalence of daily and less than daily alendronate dosing [^7c2491a4]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

Less than daily alendronate dosing has been identified as an attractive alternative to daily dosing for patients and physicians. A recent 2-year study found bone mineral density (BMD) changes caused by weekly alendronate dosing therapeutically equivalent to that caused by daily dosing. There are no methods that can be used to predict how long therapeutic equivalence will be maintained after the first 2 years of treatment. In addition, it is unclear if dosing less frequently than weekly also might be therapeutically equivalent to daily dosing. In this study we use a computer simulation to develop predictions of the therapeutic equivalence of daily and less than daily dosing over time periods as long as a decade. The computer simulation uses a cell-based computer model of bone remodeling and a quantitative description of alendronate pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD). The analyses suggest that less than daily dosing regimens do not increase BMD as much as daily dosing. However, model predictions suggest that dosing as frequent as weekly still may be therapeutically equivalent to daily dosing over periods as long as 10 years. In addition, the simulations predict dosing less frequently than weekly may be therapeutically equivalent to daily dosing within the first year of treatment but may not be therapeutically equivalent after 10 years. Hypotheses based on these simulations may be useful for determining which dosing regimen may be most attractive for clinical trials.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^54dd79dd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

ECTS 2020

The ECTS have updated their guidance in a position paper published in October 2020. They reference the "treat to target" approach to osteoporosis treatment, BMD being the sole discussed marker of fracture risk. It is acknowledged that a BMD-only based concept has not been universally accepted and it is prudent to consider other risk factors such as prevalent fractures and continued glucocorticoid or aromatase inhibitor use. The ECTS thus state that in patients with high fracture risk, long-term treatment is supported by safety and efficacy data up to 10 years. The Society advise that pending longer term data the decision to extend denosumab treatment beyond 10 years should be decided in individual cases (for example those with limited life expectancy, significant renal impairment or an explicit patient wish). Mindful of the increased risk of unscheduled treatment cessation with longer treatment duration they recommend to thoroughly assess the indication to start denosumab before commencing, particularly in younger patients where the longer duration may predispose to unscheduled discontinuation. The guidelines also comment on the issue of dentist-initiated treatment interruption, advising that it is preferable to wait for 5 months after last administration before undergoing a procedure and to withhold further treatment until the lesion is healed. Regarding treatment cessation and sequential therapy after denosumab, the ECTS recommend that denosumab may be ceased once the patient is no longer considered at high risk of fragility fracture but that it is then necessary to prescribe a potent antiresorptive, particularly a bisphosphonate. Oral bisphosphonate can be considered in patients reaching this threshold prior to exceeding 2.5 years of denosumab therapy, but if opting for an oral bisphosphonate the advice is to perform a DXA at the time the next denosumab dose is due and to measure bone turnover markers 3 months later to monitor efficacy and adherence, aiming for a level below the mean found in healthy premenopausal women. If there is an adequate response, then they recommend to continue for 1–2 years and reassess with repeat DXA and decide about continuation or discontinuation of bisphosphonate as per the guidance of Kanis et al. Intravenous zoledronate is recommended when there is gastric intolerance of oral bisphosphonate, inadequate response to therapy, or in patients with a long duration of denosumab exposure (longer than 2.5 years). As discussed, the optimal timing of the infusion is yet to be clarified but the ECTS recommend the pragmatic approach of beginning treatment 6 months after the last denosumab injection, and monitoring the bone turnover markers at 3 and 6 months; if bone remodelling is increased, then a second infusion could be considered. The subsequent duration of zoledronate treatment is also yet to be optimally assessed. For patients who have received denosumab for over 2.5 years, the option is also provided to continue denosumab up to 10 years. Despite these guidelines the evidence behind the sequential therapy recommendations is limited and summarized below.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^f16c4394]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2016 American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) guidance on drug holidays for patients on long‐term bisphosphonates offers emphasizes the balance between the benefits of fracture prevention with bisphosphonate and the need to reassess fracture risk over time(see Figure 1). High‐risk patients, such as persons age > 70 years, those with a low hip T score (less than −2.5), those who have had a major osteoporotic fracture, or those who continue to fracture while on therapy, may benefit from extended treatment for up to 10 years with oral bisphosphonates or 6 years with intravenous zoledronic acid. For patients deemed to be at low or moderate fracture risk after the initial treatment period, a drug holiday of two to three years may be considered. During this period, patients should undergo periodic reassessment of their fracture risk, including monitoring BMD and possibly bone turnover markers (BTMs). This reassessment helps determine the appropriate time to reinitiate therapy if the patient's fracture risk increases. A decrease in BMD of > 3% (usually more than the least significant change on dual x‐ray absorptiometry [DXA]) is considered significant at an individual patient level.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^a4ca18b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p < 0.001) in the Three- Year Study of FIT. In the Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p = 0.035).

Thus, alendronate sodium reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic vertebral fracture.

The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of two or three years' duration.

Figure 2 shows the mean increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies.

### Bone mineral density testing: one and done… [^bbb3cfe1]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is repeat bone mineral density testing necessary to identify women who are susceptible to fracture. Bottom Line Rechecking BMD after three years does not add additional prognostic information. Serial BMD testing is not useful in estimating fracture risk and assessing the need for treatment because BMD does not change much within three years. Another study found similar results in older patients, and a third study found that BMD monitoring is not necessary after starting treatment with a bisphosphonate. Synopsis This study evaluated 7, 419 women who were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative study. The postmenopausal women, between 50 and 79 years of age, had a baseline BMD measurement and a second BMD measurement in three years and did not have treatment other than calcium and vitamin D supplementation in the intervening years. Follow-up was an average of 12. 1 years after the initial test.

Over this time, 1. 9% of the women experienced a hip fracture, and
9. 9% had a major osteoporotic fracture, defined as hip, clinical spine, forearm, or shoulder fracture. Compared with the baseline BMD test result, a change in BMD over three years or the combination of change in BMD with baseline BMD did not predict subsequent hip or major fracture to a greater degree. The follow-up BMD testing after three years did not provide any more clinical information. Associations between bone density and fracture risk were the same when analyzed by risk factors such as the presence of diabetes mellitus, age, race and ethnicity, body weight, and baseline T-score.

### One year of alendronate after one year of parathyroid hormone (1–84) for osteoporosis [^e3c11f80]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Since the use of parathyroid hormone as a treatment for osteoporosis is limited to two years or less, the question of whether antiresorptive therapy should follow parathyroid hormone therapy is important. We previously reported results after the first year of this randomized trial comparing the use of full-length parathyroid hormone (1–84) alone, alendronate alone, or both combined. In the continuation of this trial, we asked whether antiresorptive therapy is required to maintain gains in bone mineral density after one year of therapy with parathyroid hormone (1–84).

Methods

In the data reported here, women who had received parathyroid hormone (1–84) monotherapy (100 microg daily) in year 1 were randomly reassigned to one additional year with either placebo (60 subjects) or alendronate (59 subjects). Subjects who had received combination therapy in year 1 received alendronate in year 2; those who had received alendronate monotherapy in year 1 continued with alendronate in year 2. Bone mineral density at the spine and hip was assessed with the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography (CT).

Results

Over two years, alendronate therapy after parathyroid hormone therapy led to significant increases in bone mineral density in comparison with the results for placebo after parathyroid hormone therapy, a difference particularly evident for bone mineral density in trabecular bone at the spine on quantitative CT (an increase of 31 percent in the parathyroid hormone-alendronate group as compared with 14 percent in the parathyroid hormone-placebo group). During year 2, subjects receiving placebo lost substantial bone mineral density.

Conclusions

After one year of parathyroid hormone (1–84), densitometric gains appear to be maintained or increased with alendronate but lost if parathyroid hormone is not followed by an antiresorptive agent. These results have clinical implications for therapeutic choices after the discontinuation of parathyroid hormone.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, clinical indications

Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers, if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on the overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient who is taking high dose glucocorticoids may lose bone much more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessment may be appropriate in older individulas. A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with T-score between − 1.50 and − 1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between − 2.0 and − 2.49) for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^ce14cc1e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

### Zoledronate after denosumab discontinuation: is repeated administrations more effective than single infusion? [^3a377188]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Although it is well known that Dmab discontinuation is followed by the loss of the BMD gained and possible FX occurrence, it is still not completely clear how to prevent this circumstance. The DATA-switch study highlighted how a subsequent therapy with teriparatide does not offer any advantage, whereas romosozumab might further increase the BMD. Nevertheless, so far, most of the studies have focused on the use of a sequential therapy with BPs. In case of Dmab therapy duration < 2.5 years, a sequential therapy with both alendronate and ZOL has been suggested to be sufficient to prevent the BMD loss and to reduce the occurrence of rebound FX after Dmab discontinuation. However, such therapies might not be effective if administered at the standard doses (ie, the doses approved to treat osteoporosis) if Dmab has been administered for longer time. Furthermore, the best timing of ZOL administration is still unknown, as the only randomized clinical trial (ZOLARMAB), which compared 3 different schedules (at 6 months, at 9 months, or on the basis of the CTX levels above the postmenopausal reference range) found a significant decrease in the BMD in all groups after 12 months, with no differences among the schedules.

In keeping with the available data, in 2020 the ECTS released a position statement about the management of Dmab discontinuation, where the authors recommended to always introduce a sequential therapy with BPs after Dmab, starting from 6 months after the last injection. Whereas patients treated for Dmab for < 2.5 years can be either managed with oral BPs or intravenous ZOL, those treated for a longer time must undergo ZOL and subsequently CTX should be monitored 3 and 6 months later. The ECTS based the definition of an adequate response on the presence of CTX levels < 280 ng/L (mean levels found in healthy premenopausal women), since previous data from the ReoLaus cohort showed that patients who retained BMD 12 months after discontinuing Dmab, during follow-up, had CTX close to this threshold (336 ng/mL) and suggested that in case of finding of higher levels, additional ZOL doses should be given.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^195efa32]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The current analysis sought to better understand patient characteristics linked to loss of BMD after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate treatment, and our results identified the change in BMD with denosumab treatment from baseline to month 12. Specifically, the BMD gain in year 1 on denosumab was numerically higher in individuals who lost BMD in year 2 on alendronate than in those who maintained or gained BMD in year 2. This result may be attributable to "regression to the mean", a characteristic of imprecision of measurement. Bone remodeling differs between individuals and is influenced by a variety of factors. Closure of the remodeling space with antiresorptive treatment in high remodelers might produce greater gains in BMD with treatment. In these individuals, subsequent discontinuation of reversible treatment may result in resumption of the same level of remodeling, which may not be fully inhibited with a bisphosphonate. However, alendronate treatment was able to maintain BMD above the pretreatment baseline level in the majority of women who lost BMD in year 2.

No other baseline or year 1 participant characteristics could consistently identify participants who lost BMD after transitioning to alendronate treatment in this analysis. This finding suggests that all patients, regardless of baseline characteristics and fracture history, may benefit from follow-on therapy with bisphosphonates after discontinuation of denosumab. We did not observe a meaningful effect of adherence to oral alendronate treatment on the change in BMD in year 2 after denosumab discontinuation. However, this may be the result of the overall good adherence in our clinical trial patient population, as compared to clinical practice where adherence can be low. Thus, it is likely that the low rate of nonadherence did not allow us to detect an effect of nonadherence on BMD decline in our patient population. Our findings also stress the importance of BMD monitoring while on treatment to identify those at greatest risk for fracture, as those patients with the largest increase in BMD with denosumab might also be the most vulnerable to BMD loss while receiving alendronate. Unfortunately, in clinical practice, most patients who discontinue denosumab treatment do not receive any osteoporosis treatment in the year following discontinuation; moreover, approximately half of those who begin a prescription medication for osteoporosis after denosumab cessation stop the therapy in the subsequent year.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — monitoring of therapy: Obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and repeat DXA every 1 to 2 years until findings are stable, with continued follow-up DXA every 1 to 2 years or at a less frequent interval depending on clinical circumstances (Grade B; BEL 2). Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD); if these sites are not evaluable, monitoring by 1/3 radius site may be acceptable but is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change (LSC) (Grade B; BEL 1, downgraded due to limited evidence). Follow-up should ideally be in the same facility with the same DXA system, adhering to International Society for Clinical Densitometry best practices (Grade C; BEL 2, downgraded due to limited evidence). Consider using bone turnover markers (BTMs) to assess compliance and efficacy; significant reductions in BTMs are seen with antiresorptive therapy and have been associated with fracture reduction, and significant increases indicate good response to anabolic therapy (Grade B; BEL 1, adjusted down due to limited evidence).

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^4eeb93ca]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Bisphosphonate duration and holiday — postmenopausal osteoporosis — should follow risk reassessment: in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are taking bisphosphonates, we recommend that fracture risk be reassessed after 3 to 5 years; women who remain at high risk should continue therapy, whereas those at low-to-moderate risk should be considered for a "bisphosphonate holiday". A bisphosphonate holiday is operationally defined as a temporary discontinuation of bisphosphonate for up to 5 years, which may be longer depending on BMD and clinical circumstances; evidence is stronger for retention of benefits during a holiday for alendronate and zoledronic acid where randomized extension trials exist. For annual IV zoledronic acid (5 mg), a shorter reassessment period of 3 years is more appropriate based on RCTs showing residual effects after 3 years of annual use, and once a bisphosphonate holiday is initiated, reassess fracture risk at 2- to 4-year intervals.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^b83337bc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Limited data are available regarding the optimal post-denosumab bisphosphonate treatment regimen. In a small case series evaluating women followed for up to 2 years after the FRAME trial, zoledronic acid (n = 11) infusion after denosumab discontinuation showed 73% to 87% preservation of the gains in BMD at the TH or LS after 1 year, with minimal further BMD loss at any skeletal site in year 2; participants given risedronate (n = 5) showed only partial preservation of BMD (41%–64%). These findings are somewhat inconsistent with a previous, smaller case series showing only minimal efficacy to preserve BMD after denosumab treatment cessation. This difference in outcome may be related to the inclusion of participants with different ages, previous osteoporosis treatments, and durations of denosumab treatment, and it should be noted that intravenous zoledronic acid was administered 6 or 8 months after the last denosumab injection. In the current analysis, which included a larger number of participants, 1 year of alendronate treatment following 1 year of denosumab led to maintained or increased BMD at the TH or LS in 84% to 92% of participants. These findings demonstrate the potential for bisphosphonate treatment to prevent reversible bone loss in patients who discontinue denosumab treatment and may suggest that oral alendronate helps maintain BMD in the period immediately following denosumab discontinuation when the effects of treatment on bone turnover have dissipated. Ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating bisphosphonate use after denosumab discontinuation should provide clarity on the optimal treatment regimen.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^7d5013d3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

BMD at the LS, TH, and FN was measured by DXA at baseline (day 1 visit) and at months 12 and 24 of the treatment period. DXA scans were performed at the local study sites, and the same DXA machine was used for all study procedures for a particular participant. Bone turnover markers (BTMs), including fasting serum C-telopeptide (CTX-1) and N-terminal propeptide type I procollagen (P1NP), were assessed at baseline and months 12, 18, and 24 of treatment. Adherence to oral alendronate was defined as a composite endpoint of A) taking ≥ 80% of weekly alendronate tablets (overall treatment compliance) and at least 2 tablets in the last month (treatment persistence), as monitored using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) technology, and B) completing the relevant treatment period. We evaluated participant characteristics including baseline age, history of fracture, baseline BMD, change in BMD at months 12 and 24, change in BTM at months 12 and 24, and adherence to alendronate.

Statistical analyses

BMD and BTM values were summarized using descriptive statistics and plotted as the mean with 95% confidence interval (CI) and median with interquartile range (IQR), respectively. BMD change during the study period was also plotted at the level of individual participants. Descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate baseline and month 12 and 24 characteristics in groups of participants that lost, maintained, or gained BMD after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate in year 2, defined using a 3% BMD least significant change threshold. The 3% threshold was selected according to DXA scanner precision of approximately 1% corresponding to an approximate least significant change in BMD of 3%, as applied previously in responder analyses of drugs used to treat osteoporosis or increase BMD. For LS BMD assessment, participants were excluded if there were fewer than 4 evaluable vertebrae. A change in BMD ≤ −3% indicated lost BMD, change from > −3% to < 3% indicated maintained BMD, and change ≥ 3% indicated gained BMD. This grouping was applied separately for each skeletal site. All analyses were descriptive in nature. A summary of incidence of adverse events was generated for each treatment year.

Repeat BMD technical considerations

When possible, repeat BMD measurements should be conducted in the same facility with the same DXA system, same software, same scan mode, and same patient positioning and same hip and forearm to enable precise and accurate comparisons over time. Additionally, scans should be obtained at a facility with a skilled DXA technologist who has performed precision assessment. It is critical that both the initial and subsequent scans are of high quality and use the same protocol. Modern DXA systems include a 'copy' feature and other modifications to assist those performing and analyzing the scan to ensure that repeat scans are comparable to measurement parameters used in the previous scan. Quantitative BMD comparison with serial measurments is based on absolute BMD values in g/cm 2, and not T-scores or Z-scores. Each centre should calculate its own measurement (precision) error for each skeletal site using 30 duplicate or 15 triplicate scans from a representative group of patients in their practice. This value, known as the least significant change (LSC), is calculated with a 95% level of confidence as 2.77 x the precision error. The ISCD recommends evaluation of changes in BMD using absolute values, although reporting of changes is often expressed as percentages, which is easier for clinicians and patients to interpret [. When the precision error is 1%, the LSC is 2.8% and when the precision error is 2% the LSC is 5.6%.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^6efd8056]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate indicated for:

Treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1, 1.2)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.3)
Treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (1.4)
Treatment of Paget's disease of bone (1.5)

Limitations of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. (1.6)

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, alendronate sodium tablets increase bone mass and reduce the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis

[See Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women receiving glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who have low bone mineral density [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Alendronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone who have alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their disease. [See Clinical Studies (14.5).]

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of alendronate sodium tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

Denosumab discontinuation and sequential antiresorptive therapy — bone mineral density (BMD) changes and timing are described as follows: Discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a BMD decrease of 6.6% in the lumbar spine and 5.3% in the total hip within the first 12 months of treatment discontinuation. After 1 year of denosumab, alendronate retained BMD gains for at least 12 months. Case series suggest zoledronic acid after denosumab is most effective for BMD retention when administered 8 months, rather than 6 months, after the last dose, with a second annual infusion needed to continue retention; risedronate showed only a partial retention of benefits. Several studies indicate alendronate after anabolic treatment will retain and perhaps increase BMD gains, and thus alendronate after anabolic therapy is usually given.

Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The ARCH trial included a protocol‐specified substudy that had an imaging component in which a subset of eligible patients had QCT scans of the lumbar spine taken at the specified time points for assessing volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and corresponding bone strength by FEA. The substudy was performed to characterize the effect of romosozumab and alendronate on vBMD and bone strength of different bone compartments, which may contribute to a better understanding of the greater vertebral fracture risk reduction observed with romosozumab versus alendronate in ARCH. In this article, we report results from the QCT/FEA imaging component of the ARCH substudy to determine the effect of romosozumab followed by alendronate on changes in aBMD, vBMD, and bone strength at the lumbar spine compared with alendronate alone. We also report results of additional outcomes from the substudy including effect on bone volume and bone mineral content (BMC) at the lumbar spine; relationships of changes in bone strength with changes in aBMD, vBMD, and BMC at the lumbar spine; and characteristics of patients who developed new vertebral fractures on study.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring: Serial BMD testing may be done to determine if or when to initiate treatment and to monitor the response; age-related bone loss occurs at an average rate of 0.5 to 1.0% per year, menopause-related bone loss begins 3 to 5 years before the last menstrual period and continues for 3 to 5 years after, occurring at 1 to 2% per year, and more rapid loss of 3 to 5% a year may occur in some women; one SD is about a 10% deviation from the young-adult mean, so a 10% bone loss will result in a decrease of about 1.0 T-score units, and serial monitoring is based on absolute BMD and not T-scores; for patients on treatment or near a fracture intervention threshold, BMD testing every 1 to 2 years is an option; in patients on treatment, stable or increasing BMD at the spine and hip indicates a satisfactory response, whereas if BMD decreases significantly, patients should be evaluated for noncompliance, secondary causes, or medications that might cause bone loss; facilities should determine their least significant change (LSC), with ISCD guidance of 30 patients in duplicate or 15 in triplicate, the LSC usually set at the 95% confidence limit for change, and if the difference exceeds the LSC the probability that it is real is greater than 95%.

### Long-term outcome of weekly bisphosphonates [^b3cf1071]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Bisphosphonates currently are the preferred therapy for treating osteoporosis. Treatment with potent bisphosphonates such as alendronate or risedronate decreases biochemical markers of bone turnover and increases bone mineral density. These changes are associated with significant reductions in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk. Clinical trial data with up to 10 years of followup shows these agents are effective and well tolerated for long-term periods. Daily administration is effective and generally well tolerated. However, once weekly doses are more convenient, which may enhance long-term compliance and lead to more successful outcomes. The pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action predict the short-term and long-term skeletal effects and safety profile of once-weekly doses of bisphosphonates are similar to daily doses. These predictions are supported by authors of trials of up to 2 years who report once-weekly doses are therapeutically equivalent to daily doses in terms of BMD and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Once-weekly bisphosphonate doses have safety and tolerability profiles as good as daily doses and are comparable with the placebo.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^58df1895]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the majority of participants maintained or gained BMD after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate in the current analysis, 15.9%, 7.6%, and 21.7% lost BMD at the LS, TH, and FN, respectively, with only 1 participant losing BMD at all sites. These differences between sites in the response to treatment may be due to differences in the proportions of cortical versus trabecular bone as well as load-bearing parameters. Also, degenerative artifact is likely to have a greater impact on BMD at the LS compared with TH. In general, cortical bone may respond less rapidly to antiresorptive therapies compared with trabecular bone, as cortical bone has less surface area per unit volume of mineralized bone matrix upon which bisphosphonates can be adsorbed. Specifically, denosumab is likely to have superior effects on cortical bone as compared with alendronate. In a head-to-head study using high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT), there was greater reduction in cortical porosity at the radius and tibia in patients receiving denosumab compared with alendronate. Supportive data using another technology to measure cortical porosity indicate the efficacy of denosumab in reducing cortical porosity at the hip, a load-bearing site. Although the FN is included in the TH region of interest, the FN comprises a much smaller region and provides a less precise measurement than the TH, which is the preferred region of interest for following individual patients. Together, these differences can lead to variability in the clinical response to osteoporosis therapies.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely? [^bd4f517d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Kendler et al.in 2020 published the results of a post hoc analysis of the Denosumab Adherence Preference Satisfaction (DAPS) study. DAPS was a randomized crossover open labelled study of treatment naïve post-menopausal women with low BMD (−2.0 to −4.0) where the participants received 12 months of denosumab or alendronate before crossing over. This sub-analysis examined the cohort randomized to denosumab/alendronate. With denosumab treatment, change in BMD from baseline to month 12 was +5.4% at lumbar spine, +3.1% at total hip, and +2.7% at femoral neck. After changing to alendronate for month 12 to month 24 the mean percentage change between 12 and 24 months was +0.5% at lumbar spine, +0.5% at total hip and −0.2% at femoral neck; 84.1% maintained or gained BMD at the lumbar spine, 92.4% maintained or gained at the total hip and 78.3% at the femoral neck. Subjects who lost BMD with alendronate in year 2 had shown a greater change in BMD in year 1, but the majority still remained above their pre-treatment baseline. There were no VF events during the study. Bone turnover markers were assessed, CTX was suppressed by 12 months of denosumab with a percentage change of −69.1%; this suppression was partially lost with alendronate as evidenced by a median percentage change of −64.7% at month 18 and −54.8% at month 24. Median percentage change of PINP was −67.7%, −57.0% and −53.1% for the same time points. This study presented positive data to suggest a role for alendronate. This is particularly important for those countries where denosumab therapy is widely prescribed in primary care and where access to bone turnover marker monitoring and to infusion facilities post denosumab discontinuation is limited. It is important to note that the short duration of denosumab therapy prior to switching is atypical when compared with real world practice.

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^c9e2faea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year who received alendronate at doses of up to 10 mg/day.

Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into a one-year double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 3.7% and 5% relative to placebo with alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total body.

After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with alendronate 5 or 10 mg/day (pooled) vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced a new vertebral fracture (not significant). However, in the population studied for two years, treatment with alendronate (pooled dosage groups: 5 or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients with a new vertebral fracture (alendronate 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).

### Ten years' experience with alendronate for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [^5f94bcca]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antiresorptive agents are widely used to treat osteoporosis. We report the results of a multinational randomized, double-blind study, in which postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated with alendronate for up to 10 years.

Methods

The initial three-year phase of the study compared three daily doses of alendronate with placebo. Women in the original placebo group received alendronate in years 4 and 5 and then were discharged. Women in the original active-treatment groups continued to receive alendronate during the initial extension (years 4 and 5). In two further extensions (years 6 and 7, and 8 through 10), women who had received 5 mg or 10 mg of alendronate daily continued on the same treatment. Women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. Randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. We report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study.

Results

Treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit.

Conclusions

The therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in the gradual loss of its effects.

### Monitoring after discontinuing alendronate therapy… [^7dee1a3f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The clinical utility of medication monitoring has been a controversial issue in osteoporosis management. In the 19981 and 20012 coverage rules commonly called the "Bone Mass Measurement Act, " the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services outlined provisions for bone mineral density and bone turnover marker measurements for Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS covers BMD testing for 5 indications and bone turnover marker testing for 3 indications, including monitoring of US Food and Drug Administration–approved osteoporosis drug therapy. The CMS authorizes BMD measurements if at least 23 months have passed since the last measurement, or more frequently "when medically necessary. "1 The CMS also summarized appropriate use of bone turnover markers, assuming documentation of medical necessity: "because of significant specimen to specimen collagen crosslink physiologic variability, current recommendations for appropriate utilization include: one or two base-line assays from specified urine collections on separate days; followed by a repeat assay about three months after starting anti-resorptive therapy; followed by a repeat assay in 12 months after the three-month assay; and thereafter not more than annually, unless there is a change in therapy in which circumstance an additional test may be indicated three months after the initiation of new therapy.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^86a33290]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Osteoporosis pharmacotherapy — bone turnover marker (BTM) changes and monitoring in postmenopausal women: In postmenopausal women, alendronate reduces serum CTX and serum P1NP by 80% and 60%, respectively, with reductions becoming maximal within several months and remaining stable; with teriparatide, bone formation and resorption markers increase during the first 6 to 12 months then decline toward baseline. Monitoring requires attention to diurnal and food effects, with samples for bone resorption markers collected fasting in the morning, and changes should be compared only if the same assay is used. Least significant change estimates are ~56% for serum CTX and 38% for serum P1NP; by 12 weeks on oral bisphosphonates, between 70% and 90% of women are expected to respond, and the BTM response may account for 30% to 75% of the fracture risk reduction with standard treatments. Some experts recommend measuring BTMs before and 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and if the change exceeds the least significant change (~40%), then one goal has been met; a low risk of fractures while on treatment is associated with BTMs below the median of the reference interval for young women. If markers do not change, options include questioning medication compliance, considering secondary osteoporosis, or changing the medication or route of administration.

### A randomized trial of alendronate as prophylaxis against loss in bone mineral density following lymphoma treatment [^b71e7136]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids inhibit bone formation and vascularity, especially in the initial treatment phase, by promoting apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, resulting in a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). Glucocorticoids increase the lifespan of osteoclasts, leading to increased bone resorption, which contributes to further bone loss. International consensus guidelines recommend the use of primary prophylaxis against glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO), provided certain criteria are fulfilled. A working group from the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the European Society of Calcified Tissues recommend GIO risk assessment for patients ≥ 18 years when oral glucocorticoid therapy is planned for a duration of ≥ 3 months. Several recent studies have highlighted the risk of poor bone health, including the risk of fractures, after glucocorticoid-containing chemotherapy for lymphoma. In a study from our institution, vertebral compression fractures were identified on surveillance computed tomography (CT) scans in 14% of patients treated with R-CHOP after 2 years of follow-up, and a significant decrease in CT-assessed BMD was seen. In a large observational study of 13 570 elderly non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with up to 11 years follow-up, those receiving chemotherapy had an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures compared with patients not receiving chemotherapy (10.1% vs 8.3% and 31.1% vs 18.5%, respectively). Population-based data from 2589 DLBCL and follicular lymphoma (FL) patients treated with R-CHOP (-like) or R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) showed a 10-year cumulative risk of osteoporotic events of 16.3% vs 13.5% in the background population of 12 945 age and sex-matched persons (P < .01).

The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of alendronate (ALN), an easy to administer, inexpensive oral therapy against osteoporosis, as primary prophylaxis against the observed GIO complications in lymphoma patients.

### Romosozumab improves lumbar spine bone mass and bone strength parameters relative to alendronate in postmenopausal women: results from the active-controlled fracture study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk (ARCH) trial [^f3ddc2ce]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

aBMD was measured by DXA (Lunar, GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI, USA or Hologic, Hologic, Inc. Bedford, MA, USA) at screening/baseline and every 12 months thereafter at the lumbar spine; in a subset of 167 patients enrolled in the substudy, aBMD was also measured at months 6 and 18. A central laboratory (BioClinica, previously known as Synarc, Newark, CA, USA) analyzed the scans blinded to treatment assignments and provided quality control of the individual scans and densitometers.

QCT scans of the lumbar spine were obtained using whole‐body spiral CT scanners (with at least six detector rows) from four CT manufacturers (Siemens, Munich, Germany; GE, Boston, MA, USA; Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Toshiba, Minato, Tokyo, Japan). Scans were performed at baseline and at months 6, 12, and 24. By default, the CT scan covered the range from mid‐T 12 to mid‐L 3 and vertebrae L 1 and L 2 were analyzed. However, if any of these two vertebrae were fractured at baseline, the scan range was adjusted to analyze a different set of two unfractured vertebrae; for example, if L 2 was fractured, the scan was adjusted, covering the range from mid‐T 11 to mid‐L 4, to analyze T 12 and L 1, L 1 and L 3 (Supplemental Figure S 2), or T 12 and L 3.

Lumbar spine scans were performed at 120 kV with a pitch of 1 using default 100 mAs. Automatic exposure control techniques integrated into the CT scanner acquisition software were used, if available, to reduce radiation exposure. Patients were scanned while lying supine on top of the bone density calibration (BDC) phantom (QRM GmbH, Möhrendorf, Germany). For each scan, two datasets were reconstructed: a large field of view (FOV) reconstruction of 360 mm, which was selected for the analysis of the calibration phantom; and a smaller FOV reconstruction of 120 mm centered on the vertebrae selected for the analysis of vBMD, bone volume, and BMC of the different bone compartments. A medium kernel and a slice thickness of 1 or 1.25 mm were used to reconstruct the CT datasets using the technique of filtered back projection.

### Prevention of glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis with alendronate or alfacalcidol: relations of change in bone mineral density, bone markers, and calcium homeostasis [^f23f9840]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the relation of changes in measures of bone turnover and changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and total hip over 18 months in a double-blinded, randomized trial, comparing the effect of alfacalcidol (101 patients) versus alendronate (100 patients) on BMD in patients who recently started treatment with glucocorticoids for various rheumatic diseases.

Methods

Associations between changes in serum procollagen type I C-propeptide (P1CP), fasting urine N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx), serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, and change from baseline in BMD over 18 months were explored with regression and correlation analyses.

Results

In both treatment groups, there was a statistically significant decrease in NTx. In the alfacalcidol group there was also a significant increase in P1CP and osteocalcin, in contrast to the alendronate group, but BMD in the alfacalcidol decreased versus an increase in the alendronate group (p < 0.001). In neither treatment group were changes in biochemical measures correlated with the change in BMD, with the exception of a negative correlation in the alendronate group between changes in total hip BMD and NTx. Use of alendronate resulted in an increased PTH in 27 patients, but the increase in BMD of these patients was not statistically significantly different compared to patients taking alendronate with normal PTH levels.

Conclusion

Changes in BMD were not associated with changes in bone measures, with the exception of NTx in the alendronate group. For the patient taking glucocorticoids in clinical practice, the value of serial assessment of bone markers is low; changes in markers are no substitute for changes in BMD.

### Addressing the needs of breast cancer survivors [^68983865]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Bone Mineral Density in Breast Cancer Survivors

Breast cancer treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, chemotherapy, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can contribute to bone loss and increase fracture risk. Clinical trials have shown that women taking anastrozole or exemestane experience greater bone mineral density (BMD) loss compared to those on tamoxifen. Meta-analyses of adjuvant trials further confirm that AIs significantly increase fracture risk relative to tamoxifen or placebo, with extended endocrine therapy duration correlating with higher risk. Given these risks, it is essential to assess BMD via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at baseline and at regular intervals for women on long-term endocrine therapy [168]. While there are no formal guidelines on DEXA scan frequency, monitoring should be individualized to each patient based on baseline T-scores and additional osteoporosis risk factors. Bone targeted therapies can be instituted in women with BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 or between −1.0 and −2.5 with additional risk factors for fracture, or history of fragility fractures. Bone-targeted therapies, such as IV or oral bisphosphonates, are typically first-line due to their cost-effectiveness and established safety profile. However, denosumab is a suitable alternative for patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or have contraindications. Potential side effects of bisphosphonates include flu-like symptoms, renal impairment, atypical femur fractures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Notably, denosumab carries a risk of rebound fractures after discontinuation. The optimal duration of bone-protective therapy remains uncertain but should be tailored based on BMD trends, treatment response, and ongoing fracture risk.

### Bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^1c1bbb69]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by bone loss, which leads to impaired bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. Two million fractures are attributed to osteoporosis annually in the United States and they are associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fracture by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone strength, and they have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, the use of these drugs for the management of osteoporosis remains a clinical challenge. There are several important considerations including appropriate patient selection, pretreatment evaluation, potential adverse effects, patient preferences, and adherence. This review will discuss the evidence informing the clinical strategy for using bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and those at high risk of fracture, focusing on the benefits and risks of treatment. We will also consider issues related to the monitoring and duration of treatment.

### Bone health and denosumab discontinuation in oncology populations [^8831b947]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Alendronate

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that has the added benefits of being orally administered, making it a relatively convenient option in the treatment of the post-denosumab "rebound phenomenon". Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the benefits of alendronate on BMD in cancer populations. One such study was performed in individuals with prostate cancer. In this retrospective cohort study, 47 men with prostate cancer who received ADT and had ≥ 2 BMD measurements (baseline and follow-up) were identified. Twenty-two patients received weekly alendronate during the follow-up period (17.6 ± 8.3 months), while 25 did not receive any antiresorptive therapy. There was a greater loss in BMD per year at the LS (–1.29 ± 0.7% vs. +1.41 ± 0.7%), total hip (–0.94 ± 0.6% vs. +0.97 ± 0.5%), and FN (–2.17 ± 0.7% vs. +0.32 ± 0.6%) in the patients not treated compared with those treated with alendronate.

The use of alendronate post denosumab cessation has also been limited to data from non-cancer osteoporosis populations. In a post hoc analysis of a 2-year RCT, 126 postmenopausal women (mean age 65 years) without cancer who had received 2 doses of denosumab for the treatment of osteoporosis were transitioned to once-weekly alendronate. Alendronate was commenced 6 months after the second dose of denosumab and was continued for a total duration of 12 months. Alendronate for 12 months appeared to either maintain or increase BMD at the LS and hip following denosumab discontinuation. A limitation of this study was that denosumab was only administered for 1 year. With longer durations of treatment there is a greater potential for bone loss post treatment cessation, and therefore it may be more difficult to preserve bone mass when transitioning to alendronate.

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^047615ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.

Search Methods

We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

Eligibility Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

Outcomes

Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral, non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane risk of bias 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Based on the previous review experience, in which the clinical and methodological characteristics in the primary and secondary prevention studies were homogeneous, we used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis and estimated effects using the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. Our base case analyses included all eligible placebo-controlled studies with usable data. We selected the data available for the longest treatment period. We consider a relative change exceeding 15% as clinically important.

Included Studies

We included 119 studies, of which 102 studies provided data for quantitative synthesis. Of these, we classified 34 studies (15,188 participants) as primary prevention and 68 studies (29,577 participants) as secondary prevention. We had concerns about risks of bias in most studies. Selection bias was the most frequently overlooked domain, with only 20 studies (19%) describing appropriate methods for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Eight studies (8%) were at low risk of bias in all seven domains.

Synthesis Of Results

The base case analyses included 16 primary prevention studies (one to five years in length; 10,057 women) and 20 secondary prevention studies (one to three years in length; 7375 women) which compared alendronate 10 mg/day (or 70 mg/week) to placebo, no treatment, or both. Indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias emerged as the main factors contributing to the downgrading of the certainty of the evidence. For primary prevention, alendronate may lead to a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (16/1190 in the alendronate group versus 24/926 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.84; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.9% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence) and non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97; ARR 1.6% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.3% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, clinically important differences were not observed for the following outcomes: hip fractures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; ARR 0.2% fewer, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 0.2% more; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49; ARR 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.4% fewer to 1.1% more; low-certainty evidence); withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18; ARR 0.2% more, 95% CI 0.9% fewer to 1.5% more; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; ARR 0.5% more, 95% CI 1.2% fewer to 2.8% more; low-certainty evidence). For secondary prevention, alendronate probably results in a clinically important reduction in clinical vertebral fractures (24/1114 in the alendronate group versus 51/1055 in the placebo group; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; ARR 2.7% fewer, 95% CI 3.5% fewer to 1.3% fewer; moderate-certainty evidence). It may lead to a clinically important reduction in non-vertebral fractures (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99; ARR 2.8% fewer, 95% CI 5.1% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); hip fractures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.96; ARR 1.0% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% fewer to 0.1% fewer; low-certainty evidence); wrist fractures (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; ARR 1.8% fewer, 95% CI 2.6% fewer to 0.4% fewer; low-certainty evidence); and serious adverse events (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; ARR 3.5% fewer, 95% CI 5.8% fewer to 0.6% fewer; low-certainty evidence). However, the effects of alendronate for withdrawals due to adverse events are uncertain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.16; ARR 0.4% fewer, 95% CI 1.7% fewer to 1.3% more; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, the updated evidence for the safety risks of alendronate suggests that, irrespective of participants' risk of fracture, alendronate may lead to little or no difference for gastrointestinal adverse events. Zero incidents of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fracture were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

For primary prevention, compared to placebo, alendronate 10 mg/day may reduce clinical vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, but it might make little or no difference to hip and wrist fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse events. For secondary prevention, alendronate probably reduces clinical vertebral fractures, and may reduce non-vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, and serious adverse events, compared to placebo. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alendronate on withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^9c6bcc78]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent study evaluated patients treated with bisphosphonates in primary care. The subjects monitored with PINP were more likely to start oral bisphosphonate treatment, switch to zoledronate and have follow-up BMD measurements. They also had greater increases in hip BMD. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed, which showed that PINP monitoring has the potential to be cost-effective.

There have been a few studies that have evaluated whether BTM monitoring can improve adherence to treatment. One study found that monitoring patients increased adherence by 57% at 1 year, but there was no difference between nurse-led monitoring and BTM monitoring. In the Improving Measurements of Persistence on Actonel Treatment (IMPACT) study, it was found that reinforcement (information given to patients regarding their BTMs) resulted in improved persistence, but just in the cases where the result was positive (ie, decrease in BTMs). This was also associated with a 60% lower incidence of new radiologically determined vertebral fractures.

In a study of postmenopausal women with low BMD, treated with either zoledronate or alendronate, there was a greater and faster reduction of BTMs in the zoledronate group. The suppression of BTMs after annual zoledronate infusions for 6 years is maintained over the whole duration of treatment. Similar results were observed in a study of 3-monthly intravenous ibandronate.

More recently, TRACP5b has also been proposed for the monitoring of patients on oral bisphosphonates and zoledronate, since it has similar diagnostic accuracy to PINP and CTX.

The current recommendation is that treatment with oral bisphosphonates should continue for 5 years and intravenous bisphosphonate for 3 years. After this period, a pause in treatment should be considered. It has been shown that bisphosphonates have this distinct characteristic which other anti-osteoporosis medications do not have; they can accumulate in the skeleton and can still provide benefit to the bones even when treatment is stopped. Moreover, after discontinuing treatment, the antifracture efficacy persists. Long-term treatment with bisphosphonates has been related to rare side effects like atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw and their risk may be minimized by discontinuing treatment. The discontinuation of bisphosphonates has been associated with rapid decreases in the risk of atypical femoral fractures. Continuation for a duration greater than the one described above (ie, 10 years for oral bisphosphonates and 6 years for intravenous ones) should be considered in high-risk patients (vertebral or hip fracture, T-score below −2.5).

Two trials provided evidence for long-term BP use. In the Fracture Intervention Trial Long-term Extension (FLEX), postmenopausal women receiving alendronate for 10 years had fewer clinical vertebral fractures than those switched to placebo after 5 years. In the HORIZON extension, women who received 6 annual infusions of zoledronic acid had fewer morphometric vertebral fractures compared with those switched to placebo after 3 years. Low hip T-score, between -2 and -2.5 in FLEX and below -2.5 in HORIZON extension, predicted a beneficial response to continued therapy. Hence, the Task Force suggests that after 5 years of oral BP or 3 years of intravenous BP, reassessment of risk should be considered. In women at high risk, for example, older women, those with a low hip T-score or high fracture risk score, those with previous major osteoporotic fracture, or who fracture on therapy, continuation of treatment for up to 10 years (oral) or 6 years (intravenous), with periodic evaluation, should be considered. The risk of atypical femoral fracture, but not osteonecrosis of the jaw, clearly increases with BP therapy duration, but such rare events are outweighed by vertebral fracture risk reduction in high-risk patients. For women not at high fracture risk after 3 to 5 years of BP treatment, a drug holiday of 2 to 3 years can be considered. The suggested approach for long-term BP use is based on limited evidence, only for vertebral fracture reduction, in mostly white postmenopausal women, and does not replace the need for clinical judgment. It may be applicable to men and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, with some adaptations. It is unlikely that future trials will provide data for formulating definitive recommendations. © 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^f893e734]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Bone health in prostate cancer — fracture risk assessment and monitoring on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) states that annual assessment of fracture risk using the FRAX risk assessment tool is recommended for all patients on ADT or those who remain hypogonadal after completion of ADT, and depending on fracture risk and prior DEXA results, repeat DEXA scan in 1 to 2 years is recommended for those patients on ADT. For individuals initiated on antiresorptive therapy, a follow-up DEXA scan after 1 year of treatment is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry, use of biochemical markers of bone turnover to monitor response to therapy is not recommended, and there are currently no guidelines on how often to monitor vitamin D levels.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^4d1658e9]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Key points — postmenopausal osteoporosis assessment and monitoring state that bone mineral density (BMD) testing is indicated for all postmenopausal women with risk factors for low BMD or fracture, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the preferred technique. For untreated postmenopausal women at low fracture risk, repeat DXA testing is not useful until at least 5 years have passed unless rapid bone loss is anticipated. Fracture risk is especially high in the first 2 years after an incident fracture, and the routine use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in the evaluation of patients with osteoporosis is not recommended.

### Osteoporosis management [^247f4e4c]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical update serves as a brief review of recently published, high-impact, and potentially practice changing journal articles summarized for our readers. Topics include menopause, sexual dysfunction, breast health, contraception, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. In this clinical update, we selected recent publications relevant to osteoporosis management. We highlight articles on the safety of long-term use of denosumab and bisphosphonates, fracture risk after discontinuing menopausal hormone therapy, calcium intake and cardiovascular risk, as well as the value of repeat dual X-ray absorptiometry scanning to monitor those on osteoporosis treatment.

### Incidence and predictors of repeat bone mineral densitometry: a longitudinal cohort study [^0b09323c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines for repeat screening and treatment monitoring intervals regarding the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are conflicting or lacking. The Choosing Wisely campaign recommends against repeating DXA scans within 2 years of initial screening. It is unclear how frequently physicians order repeat scans and what clinical factors contribute to their use.

Objective

To estimate cumulative incidence and predictors of repeat DXA for screening or treatment monitoring in a regional health system.

Design

Retrospective longitudinal cohort study PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5992 women aged 40–84 years who received initial DXA screening from 2006 to 2011 within a regional health system in Sacramento, CA.

Main Measures

Two- and five-year cumulative incidence and hazard rations (HR) of repeat DXA by initial screening result (classified into three groups: low or high risk of progression to osteoporosis, or osteoporosis) and whether women were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after initial DXA.

Key Results

Among women not treated after initial DXA, 2-year cumulative incidence for low-risk, high-risk, and osteoporotic women was 8.0%, 13.8%, and 19.6%, respectively, increasing to 42.9%, 60.4%, and 57.4% by 5 years after initial screening. For treated women, median time to repeat DXA was over 3 years for all groups. Relative to women with low-risk initial DXA, high-risk initial DXA significantly predicted repeat screening for untreated women [adjusted HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.40–2.00)] but not within the treated group [HR 1.09 (95% CI 0.91–1.30)].

Conclusions

Repeat DXA screening was common in women both at low and high risk of progression to osteoporosis, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeat scans within 2 years of initial screening. Conversely, only 60% of those at high-risk of progression to osteoporosis were re-screened within 5 years. Interventions are needed to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeat use of DXA scans.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — bisphosphonate holidays and long-term trials note that longer-acting bisphosphonates accumulate and may have a prolonged residence time in bone, so "bisphosphonate holidays" may be considered. In a post hoc FIT/Long Term Extension (FLEX) analysis of 10 versus 5 years of alendronate, higher-risk women (those with a T-score −2.5 and below) who stopped treatment had nearly twice as many nonvertebral fractures: 21 (28%) versus 15 (15%) with continued treatment, and in the first 2 years the Kaplan-Meier curve for clinical vertebral fractures showed no difference between those who stopped and those who continued. In the HORIZON zoledronate extensions, patients who continued yearly zoledronate for 6 years had significantly fewer morphometric spine fractures than those who switched to placebo after 3 years of treatment, with no differences in clinical vertebral fractures or nonvertebral fractures; in the second extension, after 6 years of treatment and an additional 3 years randomized phase, Three morphometric vertebral fractures were reported with 9 years of treatment compared with 5 with 6 years, and clinical fractures were similar, reported in 10 of the patients who continued for 9 years and in 9 patients who received 6 years of therapy.

### Randomized trial of effect of alendronate continuation versus discontinuation in women with low BMD: results from the fracture intervention trial long-term extension [^d109578f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To determine the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of alendronate on BMD and markers of bone turnover, we conducted an extension trial in which 1099 older women who received alendronate in the FIT were re-randomized to alendronate or placebo. Compared with women who stopped alendronate, those continuing alendronate for 3 years maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing benefit of continued treatment. However, among women who discontinued alendronate and took placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher, and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline, showing persistence of alendronate's effects on bone.

Introduction

Prior trials including the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) have found that therapy with alendronate increases BMD and decreases fracture risk for up to 4 years in postmenopausal women with low BMD. However, it is uncertain whether further therapy with alendronate results in preservation or further gains in BMD and if skeletal effects of alendronate continue after treatment is stopped.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a follow-up placebo-controlled extension trial to FIT (FIT long-term extension [FLEX]) in which 1099 women 60–86 years of age who were assigned to alendronate in FIT with an average duration of use of 5 years were re-randomized for an additional 5 years to alendronate or placebo. The results of a preplanned interim analysis at 3 years are reported herein. Participants were re-randomized to alendronate 10 mg/day (30%), alendronate 5 mg/day (30%), or placebo (40%). All participants were encouraged to take a calcium (500 mg/day) and vitamin D (250 IU/day) supplement. The primary outcome was change in total hip BMD. Secondary endpoints included change in lumbar spine BMD and change in markers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide).

Results

Among the women who had prior alendronate therapy in FIT, further therapy with alendronate (5 and 10 mg groups combined) for 3 years compared with placebo maintained BMD at the hip (2.0% difference; 95% CI, 1.6–2.5%) and further increased BMD at the spine (2.5% difference; 95% CI, 1.9–3. 1%). Markers of bone turnover increased among women discontinuing alendronate, whereas they remained stable in women continuing alendronate. Cumulative increases in BMD at the hip and spine and reductions in bone turnover from 8.6 years earlier at FIT baseline were greater for women continuing alendronate compared with those discontinuing alendronate. However, among women discontinuing alendronate and taking placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline.

Conclusions

Compared with women who stopped alendronate after an average of 5 years, those continuing alendronate maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing benefit of continued alendronate treatment on BMD and bone turnover. On discontinuation of alendronate therapy, rates of change in BMD at the hip and spine resumed at the background rate, but discontinuation did not result in either accelerated bone loss or a marked increase in bone turnover, showing persistence of alendronate's effects on bone. Data on the effect of continuation versus discontinuation on fracture risk are needed before making definitive recommendations regarding the optimal length of alendronate treatment.
