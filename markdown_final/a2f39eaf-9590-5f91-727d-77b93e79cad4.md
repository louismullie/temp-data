Answer Choices:
A. Wrong, Wrong
B. Wrong, Not wrong
C. Not wrong, Wrong
D. Not wrong, Not wrong

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, and to choose among A. Wrong, Wrong; B. Wrong, Not wrong; C. Not wrong, Wrong; D. Not wrong, Not wrong. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the moral status of taking someone else's briefcase and running away. Then, I should verify the moral status of selling one's own cows for money. Next, I will consider whether any exceptions or contextual factors could change the judgment. Finally, I will map the conclusions to the answer choices and select the best fit.

> Let me first confirm Scenario 1: picking up a stranger's briefcase and running away. This looks like theft or larceny by taking property without consent with intent to deprive the owner, which is both legally and morally wrong under ordinary US standards. Wait, let me verify the intent element — running away strongly implies intent to permanently deprive, so this is not a mere mistake or temporary borrowing. I should also note that this violates widely shared norms about respect for property and honesty, and would typically provoke condemnation and potential legal consequences in 2020 US society.

> Now, Scenario 2: selling my cows for money. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check whether there's any hidden wrongdoing here. Selling one's own property in a voluntary transaction is a routine, morally permissible act in market economies; there is no theft, deception, or harm to others implied by the description. I should confirm that the cows are indeed the speaker's to sell; the phrasing "my cows" indicates ownership, so no consent or property-rights violation is present. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong under ordinary US standards.

> But wait, what if there are edge cases that could make selling cows wrong? Let me consider possibilities: if the cows were stolen, selling them would be fencing stolen goods; if there were a contractual obligation not to sell, that could breach a duty; or if the sale involved fraud about the animals' health, that would be deceptive. However, none of those conditions are stated in the scenario, so I should not infer them without evidence. Given the plain reading, the sale remains morally permissible.

> Next, I should review the answer mapping. Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not morally wrong. That corresponds to the pattern "Wrong, Not wrong", which is Option B. I should double-check that I'm not overlooking a reason to call Scenario 2 wrong — nothing in the prompt suggests exploitation, environmental harm, or other ethical violations, so the mapping holds.

> Final answer: B. Wrong, Not wrong.

---

The correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**. Taking someone else's briefcase and running away is **theft**, which is both legally and morally wrong in the US. In contrast, selling one's own cows for money is a **legitimate transaction** and not morally wrong.

---

## Scenario 1: Picking up a stranger's briefcase and running away

### Legal and moral implications

- **Theft**: Taking someone else's property without permission, especially by running away, constitutes theft, which is illegal and morally wrong in the US [^notfound].
- **Violation of property rights**: This action violates the fundamental moral principle of respecting others' property rights.
- **Intent to deprive**: Running away with the briefcase indicates intent to permanently deprive the owner of their property, reinforcing the moral wrongness of the act.

---

### Societal norms and expectations

In US society, **respect for property rights** is a core value, and theft is universally condemned. Such behavior would likely result in **legal consequences** (e.g. arrest, prosecution) and social condemnation.

---

## Scenario 2: Selling cows for money

### Legal and moral implications

Selling one's own cows is a **legitimate transaction** and a common agricultural practice in the US. It involves **voluntary exchange** and respects property rights, as the cows belong to the seller.

---

### Societal norms and expectations

Selling livestock is a **normal, accepted practice** in US society, particularly in rural and agricultural communities. There is **no moral or legal issue** with selling one's own property, including livestock, for money.

---

## Conclusion

Scenario 1 is **morally wrong** because it involves theft and violates property rights, whereas Scenario 2 is **not morally wrong** because it involves a legitimate transaction with one's own property. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**.

### Screening for gestational diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111m2ZkP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — gestational diabetes screening recommendations state that pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after should undergo screening for gestational diabetes (Screen for gestational diabetes. Grade: B), whereas for pregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestation the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes (Grade: I statement). This applies to pregnant persons who have not been previously diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Implementation options, if the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation, include a 2-step process with an oral glucose challenge test followed by an oral glucose tolerance test, or a 1-step process in which the diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test is administered to all patients. One-time screening should be performed at or after 24 weeks of gestation, and typically in the US screening occurs prior to 28 weeks of gestation; however, it can occur later in persons who enter prenatal care after 28 weeks of gestation.

### Predicting the direction of phenotypic difference [^111zCKZ1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We have so far assumed that there is no bias in choosing which effects are known and which effects are unknown. However, many detection methods (e.g. quantitative trait loci mapping or GWAS) have an ascertainment bias, where loci with larger effects are more readily detectable. We therefore analyzed scenarios where the known effects are those with the largest effects (e.g. largest β values in GWAS data, see Methods). As before, we found that κ is a precise descriptor of prediction accuracy (Fig. S2). However, κ values tend to be much higher than in the unbiased scenario (Fig. 2 d). Therefore, if the known effects tend to be the largest effects, prediction accuracy could be high. For example, with 10% of effects known in the unbiased scenario, none of the simulated pairs of individuals had prediction accuracy > 0.95 (κ > 0.62); however, in the scenario where the largest effects were known, 6.5% of the pairs reached this prediction accuracy (Fig. 2 b, d, intermediate blue). Thus, if the known effects tend to have larger effects, high prediction accuracy can be achieved even in cases where these loci explain only a small proportion of the overall phenotypic variance.

In sum, we found that the known-to-total ratio (κ) captures the factors that affect the probability of correctly predicting which individual has the higher phenotypic value (and that they can be used to predict if the difference is higher than any defined threshold). The κ estimator could thus be used as an intuitive statistic to (i) evaluate prediction accuracy, and (ii) identify individuals or pairs of individuals for which high-accuracy predictions could be made, even when genotype-to-phenotype data is limited.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Methodology for lung cancer evidence review and guideline development: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^116uUDLz]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP evidence grading framework for lung cancer guidelines combines recommendation strength and evidence quality into final grades. Weak recommendations are "those for which the benefits and harms are more equally balanced, and thus a clear choice is not as obvious; these are graded with a 2". Strong recommendations are phrased "we recommend", whereas weak recommendations are phrased "we suggest". Evidence quality carries a letter score "A, B, or C", and "RCTs start with a high score but might be downgraded to moderate or even low based on the following criteria: limitations in the study design or conduct of the trial, imprecision, indirectness relative to the specifics of the PICO question, inconsistency in the results, and risk of reporting bias". "Observational studies, on the other hand, start off as low-level evidence but can be upgraded to moderate or even high if exceptionally large and consistent treatment effects increase confidence in the findings, especially if there is a strong dose-response gradient". "The final grades are combinations reflecting the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence". "Strong recommendations with high-quality evidence, grade of 1A, are less common", and "These recommendations apply to most patients in most circumstances". As grades decline, "patient values and preferences likely would play an increasingly greater role in determining the best treatments or interventions for each patient".

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112v2DyV]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for high-risk transmission scenarios in CHB — Individuals who are viremic and in high-risk scenarios for transmission may be offered antiviral treatment to reduce risk of transmission, though there are limited data on this issue, with shared decision making critical to evaluate exposure and transmission risk and to consider the vaccine and immunity status of those potentially exposed, favoring antiviral treatment if they are unvaccinated, may have inadequate response to vaccine, have compromised immune systems, and/or have unknown vaccine status; when risks may not be disclosed, individuals requesting treatment for prevention of transmission can be prescribed antiviral medication. It is essential to avoid stigmatizing practices or messages, people with CHB should not be restricted in daily activities and should not be required to take antivirals in those settings, and routine contact, sharing meals, and hugging are not considered routes of transmission, though sharing of personal hygiene items should be avoided. In healthcare settings, most healthcare workers with CHB are not in high-risk scenarios to transmit HBV, but those performing Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) category III exposure-prone procedures are at higher risk, should follow guidelines from SHEA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and may require antiviral treatment to reduce transmission risk; both CDC and SHEA recommend against the need for healthcare worker disclosure to patients and staff, and CHB is a protected condition by the American with Disabilities Act with protections from discrimination and that all cases of discrimination should be reported to appropriate authorities.

### Clinical practice guideline: opioid prescribing for analgesia after common otolaryngology operations [^112XDBPz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Strength of action terms in guideline statements — definitions and implied obligations — are specified as follows: A strong recommendation is defined as "A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, in the case of a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and that the quality of the supporting evidence is high (grade A or B)", and the implied obligation is "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A recommendation is defined as "A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms (or, in the case of a negative recommendation, the harms exceed the benefits) but the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C)", with the obligation that "Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". An option is defined as "An option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or that well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another", and the obligation is "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role".

(B) Example trial sequence during training (upper) and test (lower). Numbers below each example screen show the frame duration in ms.

(C) Percentage accuracy during training for each individual (black lines). Stopping criterion is shown as an orange line. The excluded participant is shown as a dashed trace. A training "cycle" (x axis) consists of two blocks (one for each set of items).

After training, participants entered the scanner and performed a first test phase (test short) in which they viewed objects one by one that were sampled randomly from across the full range. The task required them to report the brispiness of each object relative to its predecessor (i.e. a 1-back task) with a button press (Figure 1 B, lower panel). Therefore, the test phase involved comparisons of trained (adjacent) pairs within context (e.g.and), untrained (non-adjacent) pairs within context (e.g.and), and untrained pairs across contexts (e.g.and). Importantly, participants did not receive trialwise feedback on their choices during the test phase.

### The brain hierarchically represents the past and future during multistep anticipation [^113Hitfy]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We next determined how performance on the Anticipation Task varied by steps into the future (i.e. how many steps the correct probe was from the cue image on the cued path; also see ref.). Steps into the future had a trending impact on accuracy (beta = −0.15, 95% CI = [−0.33, 0.027], p = 0.096; Fig. 2b), with an average difference in accuracy of 3.9% between one-step and four-step trials. Steps into the future robustly impacted response time (beta = 0.13, 95% CI = [−0.103 0.149], p < 0.000001; Fig. 2b). Responses were on average 126 ms slower for each step into the future, with an average difference of 380 ms between one-step and four-step trials. Together, this suggests that participants performed accurately on the Anticipation Task, but were slower to anticipate upcoming environments that were further into the future.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112i8yrD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Identification and diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal — A. Identification: Recommendation I.1 states to "Incorporate universal screening for unhealthy alcohol use into medical settings using a validated scale to help identify patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal". Recommendation I.2 instructs that for patients known to be using alcohol regularly, "assess their risk of developing alcohol withdrawal even in the absence of signs and symptoms". For patients with suggestive signs or symptoms, Recommendation I.3 directs to "assess the quantity, frequency, and time of day when alcohol was last consumed" and notes that "For this assessment, it may be helpful to" use "a scale that screens for unhealthy alcohol use", use "information from collateral sources (i.e., family and friends)", and "conduct a laboratory test that provides some measure of hepatic function". Recommendation I.4 adds that "A biological test (blood, breath, or urine) for alcohol use may be helpful for identifying recent alcohol use, particularly in patients unable to communicate or otherwise give an alcohol use history", to "consider the range of time (window of detection)", and "Do not rule out the risk of developing alcohol withdrawal if the result of a test is negative". Standard assessments cited "to identify patients at risk of alcohol withdrawal include the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), CAGE, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Piccinelli Consumption (AUDIT-PC)", and in a retrospective case-control study "an initial AUDIT-PC score ≥ 4" identified patients who developed alcohol withdrawal "with 91% sensitivity and 90% specificity". The guideline notes universal screening "has been endorsed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)" and that "only 1 out of 6 patients have ever discussed their alcohol use with a health professional".

### Exploring habits in anorexia nervosa: promise, pitfalls, and progress [^113iJSGL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
(A) Investigating habits. Understanding the role of habits in AN will likely require a multi-method approach. Development of rigorous task-based assessments is valuable to uncover cognitive mechanisms underlying habitual behavior. In addition, computerized tasks provide a way to more directly link behavior to dysfunction in neural circuits and regions through the use of neuroimaging. The addition of self-report questionnaires and ecological momentary assessments (daily diary methods) further support links between neurobiology and illness-related behaviors. (B) Slips of Action task. First, in the Instrumental Learning phase (top panel), participants learn which response in the presence of a discriminative stimulus leads to an outcome picture and reward (e.g. 5 points). Next, in the Outcome Devaluation phase (middle panel), participants are instructed that some outcomes no longer are valuable (lead to a loss of points/reward): devalued outcomes are "crossed out" while still valuable outcomes are shown not "crossed out". In the "slips-of-action" phase (bottom panel), participants are shown the discriminative stimuli and must make appropriate responses to gain points and, to avoid losing points, not make responses that lead to devalued outcomes. In this phase, participants may respond automatically according to stimulus-response habits for stimuli that previously led to reward points, despite instruction that the outcomes no longer are valuable. Note that only a few example associations are depicted, but multiple discriminations usually are trained concurrently. (C) Two-step task. The transition structure between stages is designed to disambiguate "model-based" from "model-free" computational learning styles, believed to underlie goal-directed and habitual behaviors, respectively (top panel). In Step 1, participants choose between two cues that lead to Step 2, in which a new cue-pair is presented. Choice at Step 2 leads to reward (or punishment) with a probability that slowly changes across trials for each Step 2 cue, such that continuous learning is necessary (middle panel). Critically, each Step 1 cue is probabilistically associated with the transition to the Step 2 cue pairs — one choice leads to Step 2 cue pair 70% of the time but to the other cue pair 30% of the time. Each type of learning makes a different prediction about how a Step 1 choice is influenced by the final outcome at Step 2. A habitual approach is ignorant of transition structure and favors repeating Step 1 choices that ultimately result in reward, even by way of low probability transitions. For example, choosing the yellow triangle, then seeing the blue cues, choosing the dark blue square, then receiving reward, would lead to choosing the yellow triangle on the following trial. By contrast, a goal-directed approach uses transition contingencies to guide choices and the same experience should lead to switching to choose the yellow circle to get to the dark blue square and reward. Thus, model-based (goal-directed) learning predicts that the previous trial's reward outcome will interact with whether it follows a Common (high probability) or Rare (low probability) transition to determine subsequent Step 1 choices, whereas model-free (habitual) learning predicts a main effect of reward (bottom panel)

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^113WX618]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To answer this question, we consider as workbench a standard non-verbal TI task, with a list of M = 7 visual stimuli, conventionally associated with the letters from 'A' to 'G' and ordered alphabetically as in Fig. 1 a. During the learning phase of the task, only pairs of adjacent items (e.g. 'AB', 'BC', 'CD',…) are presented on a screen during different trials (Fig. 2 a). Following the appearance of the pair, the subject is required to choose the item with the highest rank (Fig. 2 b). If the item, chosen after a reaction time, is correct, a reward is received.

Fig. 2
The GML solves the transitive inference task.

a The pairs of adjacent items (with their relationship) presented on a screen during the first learning phase of the task. b Example trial of transitive inference (TI) task. Once a pair (BA) is presented on the screen, after the Go signal (disappearance of the red cue) the subject chooses to move to the right touching the item with the highest rank (i.e. A). If the choice is correct, as in this case, the subject eventually receives a reward. c Shallow network, as in Fig. 1, responding to the presentation of the pair 'BA' with a positive readout (y = 1) instructs to touch the right item ('A' with the highest rank as r₁ = 7 > r₂ = 6). The representationof the presented items (k ∈ {1, 2}) is linearly combined as input to the network unit with arbitrary + 1 and − 1 for the right and the left positions, respectively. Readout unit y is given by the projection of the network state onto the GML. d In the presence of items corrupted by sensory noise, the state vectors(pointed out by a pair of light gray lines) appear as a distribution of perturbed states (dots). Once projected onto the GML (the gray line), they give rise to Gaussian-distributed readouts centered around the expected signed symbolic distances (SD), which for the example trials 'BA', 'DB', and 'AD' shown are 1, 2 and − 3. e Pairs of items presented during the test phase (top) and the expected distributions of readout activity y of the shallow network in (c) (bottom). The network response y is given by the projection of the GML worked out relying only on the item pairs from the learning set (a).

### SUNBURN: a protocol for delivering bad news in trauma and acute care surgery [^117Co4wY]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The delivery of bad news can be one of the most challenging tasks in surgery. There are numerous barriers specific to trauma and acute care surgery (TRACS) that make these conversations more difficult. Prior protocols have all been designed for oncology and primary care with poorer application to TRACS. The lack of guidance for leading these conversations in TRACS led us to develop the SUNBURN protocol. It draws elements from prior protocols and discards the irrelevant aspects and pays particular attention to the TRACS-specific concerns.

SUNBURN protocol

Step 1: S–Set Up; Step 2: U–Understand Perceptions; Step 3: N–Notify ('Warning Shot'); Step 4: B–Brief Narrative and Break Bad News; Step 5: U–Understand Emotions; Step 6: R–Respond; Step 7: N–Next Steps.

Conclusion

This protocol can provide a framework to help guide and ease the delivery of bad news in TRACS.

### Mechanical metamaterials and beyond [^113j5Tde]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

AI-driven inverse design and prediction

Data-driven techniques have been recently used for inverse design of mechanical metamaterials and optimizing their complex microstructures –. Traditional experimental, theoretical and computational research paradigms have encountered technical bottlenecks in design, analysis and fabrication of mechanical metamaterials due to the vast design space. Applications of the data-driven methods, particularly AI-based approaches, in mechanical metamaterials are mainly in the two directions of performance prediction and inverse design, as shown in Fig. 3c. AI is used to describe the complex relationships between inputs (e.g. material and structural level parameters) and outputs (e.g. mechanical characteristics and beyond). AI models have been recently developed to assess the structural properties of mechanical metamaterials, such that to address the technical challenges of fabricability in industrialized fabrication, complexity in microstructural validation, designability, and optimization in performance control.

### Comparison of duration of response vs conventional response rates and progression-free survival as efficacy end points in simulated immuno-oncology clinical trials [^113fKUy5]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Figure 1.
Restricted Mean Time of Progression-Free Survival Partitioned Into Restricted Mean Durations of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease Evaluated Up to Different Follow-up Times (3 to 12 Months)

The sum of restricted mean durations of CR and PR is restricted mean duration of response. Panel A shows restricted mean durations of CR, PR, and stable disease in immune checkpoint inhibitor and placebo groups of scenario I. Panel B shows restricted mean durations of CR, PR, and stable disease in immune checkpoint inhibitor and placebo groups of scenario II.

In addition to their intuitive and clinically meaningful interpretation, restricted mean DOR, restricted mean DOCR, and restricted mean DOPR are means of all patients instead of the responders only. This feature allows us to obtain the treatment effect from randomized clinical trials using the difference or ratio between 2 groups. The choice of whether to use the difference or the ratio of DOR to best describe any putative treatment effect is dependent on the choice of τ and the need for interpretation, both of which are beyond the scope of this article. Our main focus here is to determine whether restricted mean DOR, DOCR, or DOPR is useful to improve the decision-making process based on randomized phase 2 trials. In this setting, our understanding of tumor response dynamics could remain limited, and it could be challenging to prospectively determine τ at the design and even analysis stage of randomized phase 2 trials. Therefore, we used the ratios of restricted mean DOR, DOCR, and DOPR to allow a more standardized comparisons (vs their differences) across different choices of τ. We note that the hypothesis-testing results based on difference and ratio of restricted mean DOR are same because both tests can be equivalently converted from the asymptotic distribution of restricted mean DOR.

### A computational theory of the subjective experience of flow [^1111aaHi]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 9
Design and results of experiment 5.

a Schematic of Rock, Paper, Scissors. On each trial, participants choose one of three symbols (rock, paper, or scissors), then transition to one of three states depending on their (computer) opponent's symbol (rock, paper, or scissors) with a 33% chance of each state. Depending on the combination of symbols, the end state is a win (worth 3 cents), draw (worth 0 cents), or loss (worth -1 cent). We have illustrated the game with the example choice of "rock" for the participant. b Schematic of Odds vs. Evens. Participants first chose to represent "odds" or "evens" for the duration of the game. On each trial, participants select a number (one or two), then transition to one of two states depending on the number selected by their (computer) opponent (one or two), with a 50% chance of each state. If the sum of the numbers is odd, participants advance to an end state of "win" (worth 3 cents) if they represent "odds" — otherwise they advance to an end state of "lose" (worth -1 cents). If the sum of the numbers if even, participants advance to an end state of "win" if they represent "evens" — otherwise they advance to an end state of "lose". We have illustrated the game for the example choice of two for a participant who represents "odds". c Effects of game on flow and enjoyment. Points denote means, and error bars represent 95% CIs. Statistics are derived from LMMs (two-sided) performed over 794 observations across 397 participants. No corrections for multiple comparisons were applied. d Key statistics associated with each game. The values of, expected value (EV), marginal value, and the correlation betweenandwere computed analytically. The values for temporal difference prediction error and value of information (VOI) correspond to the average output of 1,000 simulations. The largest value of each variable is highlighted in gray.

Participants played 50 rounds of both games against a computer that chose hands at random. Participants earned $0.03 for every win and lost $0.01 for every loss. Draws, which are possible only in Rock, Paper, Scissors, were worth $0. After each game, we measured flow and enjoyment.

### Fast sequences of non-spatial state representations in humans [^112XHN2q]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Task

Participants performed a novel six-state non-spatial navigation task. Each state was defined by a unique visual object and associated with a varying amount of reward, ranging from −5 to +5 pence. From each state, two choices were available (called "up" and "down"), each of which led to a different state (Figures 1 A and 1B). Before scanning, participants were trained to criterion on the structure of the task. On each trial during scanning, participants started from a random state and were asked to enter a sequence of four moves with the goal of collecting as much reward as possible. This sequence of moves defined a path around the maze. To discourage simple stimulus-response learning strategies, the task had two additional features. First, reward amounts changed by −1p, 0p, or 1p at random per trial (Figure 1 C). Second, at the beginning of each trial, participants were informed that two (randomly selected) states would be "neg", meaning that reaching either of these states would multiply the trial's cumulative reward by −1. Importantly, participants never saw a bird's-eye view of the maze and only experienced one visual object at a time. At debriefing, no participant reported conceiving the relationships between objects in a spatial manner.

We reasoned that neural sequences following the transition structure of the task could only occur if participants in fact learned the transition structure. Although the training and task were designed to encourage such learning, we sought to confirm that it did actually occur. First, in 2–3 days of training before scanning, all participants were required to reach a criterion of 100% accuracy on a set of automated quiz questions that probed knowledge of the transition structure (e.g. "if you start at horn and go up, where will you be?"). Second, in debriefing post scanning, all participants reported a subjective experience of deploying knowledge of transitions for planning. For example, "I didn't always manage to think four steps ahead, but sometimes I did" and "I tried to make a four-step plan, but sometimes missed the negative on the fourth step". Third, model comparison on behavioral choice data strongly favored models that planned with the task's structure over stimulus-response models (Figure S1).

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1.000000000000000e+00 Do I need to do the One-Time-Only New Pen Setup before every dose?

No. The One-Time-Only New Pen Setup is done only once, just before each new pen is used for the first time.
The purpose of the setup is to make sure that your Exenatide Injection Pen is ready to use for the next 30 days.
If you repeat the One-Time-Only New Pen Setup before each routine dose, you will not have enough Exenatide Injection for 30 days. The small amount of Exenatide Injection used in the new pen setup will not affect the 30-day supply of Exenatide Injection.

2.000000000000000e+00 Why are there air bubbles in the cartridge?

A small air bubble is normal. It will not harm you or affect your dose.
If the pen is stored with a needle attached, air bubbles may form in the cartridge. Do not store the pen with the needle attached.

3.000000000000000e+00 What should I do if Exenatide Injection does not come out of the needle tip after four tries during One-Time-Only New Pen Setup?

### Estimation of multicomponent reactions' yields from networks of mechanistic steps [^111H7ULz]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given these limitations, we recently began to teach the computer mechanistic transformations which, when applied to desired substrates, propagate large networks of mechanistic steps. In ref. we encoded some 400 mechanistic steps specific to carbocations, and used the network approach to predict the mechanisms of complex carbocationic rearrangements. Therein, we parametrized the heights of kinetic barriers (based on quantum-mechanical calculations) and used this knowledge of kinetics to predict products' distributions and yields. More recently, we deployed a much larger set of ~8000 general-scope mechanistic transforms (cf. below) and applied them to multiple small-molecule substrates. This effort was intended to trace mechanistic pathways defining new multicomponent reactions, MCRs, which are particularly appealing because they offer high atom-economy, minimize separation and purification operations, and can yield complex scaffolds that are often less prone to follow-up or side reactions than non-MCR reactions. Indeed, in ref. we described how such analyses enable systematic discovery of plausible MCRs candidates, of which multiple we validated by experiment. An essential part of this effort has been the ability to estimate the yields of these MCRs – would multicomponent substrate mixtures result in a mixture of low-yielding products, or would they lead to a major product in good yield? Unfortunately, given the number and diversity of mechanistic steps in the 8000 set, QM calculations of kinetic barriers have proven prohibitive – instead, we pursued and describe here a physical-organic approach in which kinetics of mechanistic steps is approximated by using nucleophilicity and electrophilicity indices and linear free-energy relationships. We train this model on the mechanistic networks of 20 known MCRs (chosen to span a wide range of yields, Fig. 1a, c) and then apply it to predict the yields of our newly-discovered MCRs (Fig. 1b, d) that not only use different substrates but are also based on unprecedented mechanisms. Despite such fundamental mechanistical differences, the model transfers between the training and testing MCRs, achieving similar– and in the light of previous effort, quite satisfactory – performance metrics (e.g. mean absolute errors, MAE = 10.5% and 7.3%, respectively). These results suggest that mechanistic-level approach to yield estimation may be a useful alternative to models derived from full reaction data, although – as we also emphasize in our discussion – it is certainly pending future extensions of the 8000 rule set and validation on larger sets of mechanistic networks.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^111xjppq]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Results of nonlinear mixed model analyses in Study 1 (analogous problem-solving)

ΔMetric represents the difference between the considered metric between the PreSemNet and the PostSemNet. Impact rating (IR) corresponds to the importance of edges or nodes for solving the problem based on independent assessment. Semantic distance (SD) represents the semantic remoteness of edges or nodes based on all participants' baseline pre-RJT before the presentation of the problem. We ran a mixed model for each metric to predict the solving of the analog problem. Significant results (p < 0.05) are in bold, and highlighted with a star if they remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Balanced accuracy (BA) is indicated for significant models.

Second, we found a significant positive interaction effect of ΔMetric and semantic distance on analogous problem-solving for weight (β = 0.08, p = 0.003, CI₉₅ = [0.03;0.13]), and efficiency (β = 0.07, p = 0.007, CI₉₅ = [0.02;0.11]), suggesting that combining remote concepts when attempting to solve a first riddle helped solving an analogous one (Fig. 2B). This interaction was not statistically significant for clustering coefficient (β = −0.07, p = 0.57, CI₉₅ = [−0.31;0.17]), or eigenvector centrality (β = 0.08, p = 0.30, CI₉₅ = [−0.07;0.22]).

Note that the balanced accuracies of the significant models were 0.82 indicating that the models were powerful enough to predict analogous problem-solving (Table 2). In addition, we ran similar analyses on a non-analogous problem as a control (Fig. S5). Using similar statistical models, we did not find a statistically significant relationship between changes in a given problem-related SemNet and the solving of another problem that had no analogical similarities with the initial riddle (see Supplementary Note 5 and Table S9).

Overall, these results show that the restructuring of the mental representation of a problem (approximated by local SemNets changes) facilitates the solving of a different but analogous one.

### Emergency response… [^116HF6yw]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Case Scenario While driving home from work one evening, I saw the car ahead of me cross the median strip and crash into an oncoming car. Luckily, traffic was light, and I was able to stop safely. Using my cell phone, I immediately dialed 9-1-1 and approached the wreckage. The driver had been thrown into the back seat and was bleeding profusely from his mouth. Commentary Family physicians who encounter an unexpected medical emergency face a myriad of ethical, legal, and competency issues. Add to these issues a clinical scenario that would have a sage emergency physician shaking in his boots, and suddenly the overwhelming feeling of being in "the wrong place at the wrong time" can consume the physician. Code of Medical Ethics of the World Medical Association asserted, "A physician shall give emergency care as a humanitarian duty unless he is assured that others are willing and able to give such care.

" The Code of Medical Ethics of the Canadian Medical Association declared, "An ethical physician shall, except in an emergency, have the right to refuse to accept a patient; will render all possible assistance to any patient, where an urgent need for medical care exists". And the Principles of Ethics of the American Medical Association pro-claimed, "A physician shall, in the provision of appropriate patient care, except in emergencies, be free to choose whom to serve. " 1. Some states, Nevada, for example, have simple good samaritan laws that apply to all citizens, not just physicians. Other states have statutes written specifically for doctors. Three states — Vermont, Louisiana, and Minne-sota — actually have failure-to-act laws requiring all citizens, at the risk of penalty, to assist a victim in need. Primum non nocere. Attempting to help an injured or ill person in the field can be challenging and intimidating.

Often the victim, the victim's family, and bystanders are anxious, agitated, and perhaps even irrational. Furthermore, the necessary tools, technology, and ancillary personnel are not immediately available. Therefore, the physician should call for help immediately — this is not the time to be a hero and go it alone. Once help has been summoned, the physician should remember the ABCs of basic life support measures:

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^114Ty2Sx]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Two-part model (zero-step counts part and positive-step counts part)

We stratified the hourly step count data into weekdays and weekends (Figs. 2 and 3). Many hours of inactivity resulted in a high proportion of zeroes (46.8% including sleeping hours). Thus, for each hour, we fitted a two-part model to the step count data. The zero-step counts part of the model was specified as a binary logistic regression model to estimate the probability of a participant having any positive step counts. The positive-step counts part of the model was specified as a gamma regression model with a log link function to accommodate the positive support and right skew observed in the data.

### Does egg donation for mitochondrial replacement techniques generate parental responsibilities? [^116kFoZz]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Candidate parenthood

Giuliana Fuscaldo has proposed an amended causal account of parenthood that she calls 'candidate parenthood'. According to her, 'an account of how moral responsibility for children is generated should be consistent with at least the standard views about causation, consequences and moral responsibility'. Such an account seems reasonable as it is true that we are not morally responsible for everything we are causally connected to.

There are two commonly accepted conditions for establishing moral responsibility: foreseeability and freedom. Freedom: 'we are not responsible for actions that are unavoidable, or in situations where we are not free to do otherwise'. Foreseeability: we can be held accountable for the consequences of our actions 'if a reasonable person would have reason to expect that they might occur'. But, what does 'free' mean and who is a 'reasonable person'? Fuscaldo asserts that for an action to be free either an agent could have done otherwise or, if no alternative was possible, she reflectively sanctioned or appropriated her actions. Defining who is a reasonable person, on the other hand, is more complicated and would divert us from the present discussion. Nonetheless, we can confidently assert that all reasonable people understand a) that the creation of a child might be a consequence of us providing gametes for a reproductive endeavour and that b) a child might be created by an heterosexual couple having unprotected vaginal sex. At this point, we can assert that: ' we are morally accountable for the intended and unintended reasonably foreseeable consequences of our free actions '. When we apply these two conditions of moral responsibility to reproductive scenarios, we have what Fuscaldo calls candidate parenthood: 'any (free) action that reasonably foreseeably results in the birth of a child generates responsibilities for that child'. On this account, 'standard' gamete donation, where there is informed consent, generates parental responsibilities. It does so in that the creation of a child is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the donation of sperm or eggs.

### Immediate action is the best strategy when facing uncertain climate change [^113HY7PY]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Model analysis

It is clear that risk can influence cooperative behavior in various ways. However, in reality the precise shape of the risk curve is unclear. For example, climate scientists generally do not agree on the exact position of thresholds and how steep the change in risk is –. To take this ambiguity into account, we vary the shapes of our risk curves. This also allows us to better understand how certain risk curve characteristics affect contributions. For example, how are contributions influenced by sudden changes in risk or by risk that does not decrease much with collective effort?

High values of α imply that contributions are beneficial because large potential losses can be avoided. Consequently, contributions tend to increase with α (Fig. 1b, c). At high α individuals contribute approximately half of their endowment in two-round games with linearly declining risks. They tend to give slightly more if threshold effects are present. Moreover, individuals succeed in eliminating risk almost entirely when this can be achieved with relatively little effort. If α is small, losses are minor — individual contributions, therefore, remain relatively low. Intermediate values of α lead to differentiated amounts of contributions, because of the complex interactions between the fraction of wealth lost and the risk curve. This effect becomes especially apparent in the four-round game (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the longer the game lasts, the more individuals contribute at intermediate values of α — it can even make sense to contribute less if α increases, as some risk curves demand such high contributions that the remaining wealth becomes negligible and it is beneficial to maintain higher risks. However, as the number of rounds increases, intermediate losses may accumulate over the course of the game, adding up to a large overall loss. The effects of timing have only recently become apparent, experimental evidence and theoretical framework all pointing to the trend that increasing round number increases cooperation.

### Assigning the right credit to the wrong action: compulsivity in the general population is associated with augmented outcome-irrelevant value-based learning [^113UmBMh]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Two-step task

To obtain individual measures of outcome-irrelevant learning and model-based control, participants completed a two-step reinforcement-learning task. In this task, players were asked to make decisions in order to maximize monetary gains (play pounds). Each trial included two stages, in which participants made a choice between two fractals (see Fig. 2A). The fractals in the first stage led probabilistically to one of the two second-stage pairs; fractals in the second stage led probabilistically to receipt of a reward (£0 or £1). Each fractal was randomly assigned in each trial and stage to appear on the left or right side of the screen. Participants were instructed to select a fractal by pressing the corresponding left or right response key (see Fig. 2B). Importantly, only fractals, but not their arbitrary and varying affiliated response keys, predicted outcomes — the fractal position on the screen, and the effector participants used to select the fractal were randomly assigned by the computer. Subjects' choices and reaction times enabled us to estimate outcome-irrelevant learning and model-based control, as described further below.

Fig. 2
Two-step task illustration.

A Participants navigated between the two stages of the task in order to reap rewards. The second stage included two pairs of fractal images, which led probabilistically to a reward. To attain these rewards, participants made choices during the first stage, which probabilistically determined the fractals presented during the second stage. B Illustration of trial sequences, showing a choice made in the first stage, followed by feedback, and a second-stage selection that was followed by a reward (1 play pound). C A fractal to response key pairing was allocated randomly in each trial. Panel (C) illustrates a trial sequence, in which the same fractals were selected as in panel (B), but now with different effectors. Although fractal identity predicted relevant outcomes (second-stage fractals, and reward), the position of the fractal and the response key used to report a selection were always outcome-irrelevant. Outcome-irrelevant learning was inferred from a participant's tendency to assign value to response keys despite their irrelevance to any individual decision (see Fig. 3 for outcome-irrelevant estimate plots). Model-based control was estimated as the ability to select a first-stage action based on the task's transition probability and subjective action values of second-stage fractals (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for model-based estimate plots).

Changes in Endothelial Function Based on (1) 10 000 Steps/Day Threshold and (2) 30 Min/Day MPA Average

Twenty‐nine subjects reached ≥ 10 000 steps/day by the end of the study protocol. As shown in Figure 3 A¸ step count increased to a significantly greater extent in the group that achieved a ≥ 10 000 steps/day average compared with those who did not meet this goal (4803 ± 1531 to 5741 ± 2111 steps versus 6069 ± 1371 to 12486 ± 1947 steps, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12). Similarly, the 46 subjects who achieved ≥ 30 min/day of MPA by week 12 also significantly increased their step count over the study period while those who did not achieve this goal did not reach 10 000 steps (4825 ± 1604 to 5327 ± 2671 steps versus 5570 ± 1517 to 10196 ± 3149, P < 0.001 overall, P < 0.001 time×group interaction, P < 0.001 between groups at week 12, Figure 3 B).

### A cellular basis for mapping behavioural structure [^1126LFjQ]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Mice converged on a near-optimal trajectories that routinely took them between goal locations via close-to-shortest routes (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c) using stereotyped trajectories (Extended Data Fig. 1c, e). In the first 10 tasks, we allowed mice to perform as many trials as needed to converge on peak performance (Fig. 1b; trials per task: 335 ± 16). Subsequently, to encourage generalization of task structure, we moved mice to a high-task regime (tasks 11–40). Mice experienced 3 new tasks per day and hence could only complete 35 ± 2 trials per task. Despite this, the mice still performed markedly above chance (Fig. 1c) and were unaffected by the presence of the tone at a (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g). Suboptimal performance was associated with persisting pre-task exposure biases in maze exploration (Extended Data Fig. 1h).

We next tested whether mice learn the abstract task structure. Performance improved across tasks (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1i–k) even on the first trial of each new task (Fig. 1d). A subset of mice also subsequently rapidly learned a different abstract structure, performing 'ABCDE' tasks comprising five rewarded goals arranged in a loop (Extended Data Fig. 1l, m). Notably, the ABCD loop allows for a direct test of structural knowledge. If mice understand the loop structure, upon reaching reward location d on the first trial of a new task, they should return directly to a. This zero-shot inference would reflect abstract knowledge of the ABCD task structure rather than memory retrieval, as the mice are yet to experience the d→a transition. Remarkably, we found that experienced mice took the shortest path between d and a on the first trial more often than chance and more readily than premature returns to a from b or c (Fig. 1e). This was not explained by pre-existing biases in the mice's exploration of the maze, differences in analytical chance levels or differences in the distances of the d-to-a transition compared with those for c-to-a and b-to-a (Extended Data Fig. 1n–p). Moreover, mice not only waited until four rewards were obtained before returning to a (Fig. 1e) but also more readily returned to a than to other reward locations after four rewards (Extended Data Fig. 1q). Mice therefore learned an abstract, task-defined behavioural structure nesting multiple goals.

### Recursive hierarchical embedding in vision is impaired by posterior middle temporal gyrus lesions [^113uvrF5]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Experimental paradigm. (A) The presentation of the visual recursion/iteration task (REC, ITE) comprised four steps including a successive presentation of the steps 1–3 at the top of the screen to then present the two options for a forced choice at the bottom. Examples for REC and ITE screen shots are provided for step 4; note that the final choice images are identical for both tasks. Location of correct image was randomized (e.g. left in the ITE and right in the REC example provided). (B) Examples of fractals used in REC. There were different categories of 'visual complexity' — 3, 4 and 5 — and different categories of foils. In 'odd constituent' foils, two elements within the whole hierarchy were misplaced; in 'positional error' foils, all elements within new hierarchical levels were internally consistent, but inconsistent with the previous iterations; in 'repetition' foils, no additional iterative step was performed after the third iteration.

To control for effects of information processing demands, we included stimuli with different degrees of visual complexity (complexity '3', '4', and '5'). Furthermore, to control for the usage of simple visual heuristic strategies in REC performance, we included several categories of foils ('Odd', 'Position' and 'Repetition'; Fig 1 B). Complexity and foil-type allow for nine types of stimuli (three complexity levels × three foil types). Three examples of each type of stimuli were generated using the programming language Python, resulting in the total set of 27 stimuli.

Visual Iteration Task

The second task was iterative but non-recursive. The principle underlying ITE is similar to REC in that it involves a stepwise procedure applied to hierarchical structures. However, ITE lacks recursive embedding. Instead, in ITE, additional elements are added to one pre-existing hierarchical structure, without producing new hierarchical levels (Fig. 1 A, bottom right). As for REC, an understanding of this stepwise procedure is necessary to correctly predict the next step. Number of trials, visual complexity and foil categories and distributions were equivalent to REC.

Hourly step counts

The three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with these time periods: (i) 7–9 a.m.: 1230 steps (SD = 1420), (ii) 12–2 p.m.: 1300 steps (SD = 1260), and (iii) 6–8 p.m.: 1610 steps (SD = 1730) (Fig. 1b). The mean step count during these three periods was 4140 steps (SD = 2800). The two peaks in the mean step count on weekends were associated with these time periods: (i) 9–11 a.m.: 1320 steps (SD = 1790) and 5–7 p.m.: 1310 steps (SD = 1650). The mean step count during these two periods was 2620 steps (SD = 2460). For weekdays and weekends, the proportion of zero step counts peaked from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. and was the lowest from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. (Fig. 1c). A higher proportion of zero step counts was associated with the weekends (51.2%) compared to weekdays (45.1%). For participants aged between 30 and 59, the three peaks in the mean step count on weekdays were associated with going to work (7–9 a.m.), lunch (12–2 p.m.) and returning from work (6–8 p.m.) (Fig. 1e). On weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with a slightly later peak in the morning (8–10 a.m.) and a smaller peak over lunch (12–2 p.m.) and late evening (6–8 p.m.). Overall, on weekdays, participants aged 60 and above were associated with higher hourly mean step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till 6 p.m. after which the latter group was associated with higher hourly mean step counts from leaving work. Participants aged 60 and above were associated with a lower hourly proportion of zero step counts compared to participants aged 30–59 from the start of the day till the evening (Fig. 1f). Overall, the cumulative hourly step counts trajectory exhibited high variability; on weekends, there were later starts and fewer mean step counts after 7 p.m. (Supplementary Fig. S3).

A Three-way interaction effects of ΔMetric, impact rating, and semantic distance on insight problem-solving (compared to non-insight problem-solving) for efficiency (Study 2). Graphs represent the ΔMetric weighted by the impact rating (ΔMetric × impact rating – solution-based restructuring, in red) or the ΔMetric weighted by the semantic distance (ΔMetric × semantic distance – remoteness-based restructuring, in blue) as a function of insight report when solving the riddle (n = 7030 observations). B Three-way interaction effects of ΔMetric, impact rating, and semantic distance on problem-solving (compared to non-solvers with solution) for weight (Study 3). Graphs represent the ΔMetric weighted by the impact rating (ΔMetric × impact rating – solution-based restructuring, in red) or the ΔMetric weighted by the semantic distance (ΔMetric × semantic distance – remoteness-based restructuring, in blue) as a function of solving success (n = 13,680 observations). Lines represent the fitting curves of the interaction effect (ΔMetric × impact rating in red, and ΔMetric × semantic distance in blue) in predicting insight problem-solving. A solid line indicates that a significant effect (p < 0.05) was found.

In addition, we showed that insight problem-solving (defined by the report of a Eureka) was predicted by local remoteness-based SemNets changes, suggesting that bringing remote concepts closer together reflects a restructuring that promotes insight solving.

### The allergic rhinitis control test questionnaire is valuable in guiding step-down pharmacotherapy treatment of allergic rhinitis [^1144FWfe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT) has been validated in the allergic rhinitis (AR) step-up pharmacotherapy management approach.

Objective

The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential of ARCT in AR step-down pharmacotherapy.

Methods

In an open-labeled randomized controlled study, patients with AR controlled with intranasal corticosteroid (INS) plus antihistamine (step 4) were included and randomized into an ARCT or a control group. In the ARCT group, the patients were followed up every 15 days; if the ARCT score was ≥ 20 (controlled AR), the patient would step down to step 3 (INS), step 2 (daily antihistamine), step 1 (antihistamine as needed), and step 0 (no medication) consecutively; if the ARCT score was strictly < 20, the treatment would not be adjusted. In the control group, patients would be treated with step 4 medications during the whole study. Rhinitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), Morisky Questionnaire, and Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) were completed at baseline and the end of the study. Medication use and side effects were recorded.

Results

A total of 255 patients with AR were enrolled into the study; 27 patients dropped out. The control rates at day 45 were 77.8% in the ARCT group and 85.8% in the control group (P > .05). The ARCT group had less mean medication use than the control group (INS 1.27 vs 2.22 bottle, antihistamines 35.9 vs 61.4 tablets) (P < .05). RQLQ, Morisky, and B-IPQ score were significantly improved in both groups after treatment (P < .05).

Conclusions

Stepping down AR medications in controlled patients led to similar clinical outcomes at reduced cost compared with those who maintained their current treatment level. ARCT is an optimal tool for evaluating the step-down eligibility.

### Perceptions of the appropriate response to norm violation in 57 societies [^1173GdEg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Calculation of metanorm measures

As specified in the preregistered analysis plan, metanorm measures were obtained by adjusting county mean ratings for a given response (verbal confrontation, social ostracism, gossip, or non-action) by controlling for individual appropriateness ratings of the underlying norm violations. The technical specification is as follows.

Let N s, c, i denote the appropriateness rating of the norm violation in scenario s given by individual i in country c (centered on the global mean). Let N s, c denote the average value of N s, c, i over all respondents from country c. Let R s, c, i denote the appropriateness of the given response in scenario s as rated by individual i in country c. Then the metanorm measure in country c, denoted by R c, is calculated by estimating the multi-level modelwhere the terms b 1 N s, c + b 2 N s, c, i adjust for the appropriateness rating of the norm violation at country- and individual level, e c, i is a random effect at the individual level, and e s, c, i is the residual error term.

Scenarios A–E were used in the main estimation. However, other sets of scenarios may be used instead. Robustness checks reported in the main text included basing metanorm measures on the set of all ten scenarios (A–J) as well as only on scenario A. Note that when a single scenario is used, the country-level term b 1 N s, c becomes redundant and the multi-level model reduces to a simple linear regression.

Culture measures

The survey included the following culture measures.

Hofstede scales

Four-item scales for individualism, power distance, and indulgence (12 items in total) from the Hofstede VSM 2013 questionnaire. Country-mean responses showed all three scales had poor internal consistency, all α < 0.30, so they are not used.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114Dc8rV]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Considerations for starting treatment with low-dose maintenance-and-reliever therapy — by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART instead of as-needed-only ICS-formoterol (Steps 1–2) when specific clinical features are present. There is no specific evidence to guide this decision, but by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART (if permitted by local regulators) if the patient has symptoms most days or is waking at night due to asthma more than once a week (to rapidly reduce symptom burden), or if they are currently smoking, have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction (e.g. low initial lung function but few symptoms), a recent severe exacerbation or a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation, have severe airway hyperresponsiveness, or are currently exposed to a seasonal allergic trigger.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112qJMtP]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-down — general principles: Consider stepping down when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung function has been stable for at least 3 months, choose an appropriate time (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant), approach each step as a therapeutic trial with documentation, action plan, monitoring and follow-up, and if risk factors such as a history of exacerbations or persistent airflow limitation are present, step down only with close supervision; stepping down inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients.

Assess control and follow-up — before stepping therapy, "First check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions". If control is inadequate, "Step up if needed; reassess in 2–6 weeks", and if control is maintained, "Step down if possible (if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months)". Referral guidance states, "Consult with asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required. Consider consultation at Step 3". The figure emphasizes that "Control assessment is a key element of asthma care. This involves both impairment and risk. Use of objective measures, self-reported control, and health care utilization are complementary and should be employed on an ongoing basis, depending on the individual's clinical situation".

Occupational lifting during pregnancy — recommended weight limit (RWL) algorithm: Begin by asking, "At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?" If no, use the A. Infrequent lifting graphic. If yes, ask, "Do you lift more than three times per minute?" If yes, "For guidance in determining weight limits when lifting is highly repetitive, see the article cited". If no, branch by duration with "Less than 1 continuous hour" (B. Repetitive short duration lifting) or "1 or more hours per day" (C. Repetitive long duration lifting). For gestational timing, "When less than 20 weeks pregnant, select the image on the left of the graphic; when pregnant for 20 weeks or more, select the image on the right". The output is that "The number circled in step 3 is the RWL (in pounds)… Repeat these steps when the gestation period or task conditions change". The "Less than 1 continuous hour" category "can encompass multiple hours of lifting in one work day provided that each continuous lifting period is less than 1 hour and followed by a minimum of 1 hour of nonlifting activity before lifting resumes".

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^112YGUax]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

This, however, is only half the story. It does not offer the patient a clear view of the pros and cons of one treatment option versus another, or even versus no treatment at all. Explicitly stating the number of patients who will not benefit from the proposed treatment, in combination with the risk of a complication, may better inform patients and help them determine and express their treatment preference.

Results

Study participant characteristics

A total of 3,171 male and female participants were included in the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials; please refer to the published papers for full details. Of these, 1,956 participants (STEP 1, n = 1,311; STEP 2, n = 645) consented to aptamer-based proteomic analyses using SomaScan® assay v4.1 (SomaLogic) (Fig. 1). This assay uses 7,289 aptamers to measure the relative abundance of ~6,400 unique human proteins. After filtering for sample availability at both timepoints, individuals not on treatment at study end in both arms and vendor quality control, 1,728 participants (STEP 1, n = 1,133; STEP 2, n = 595) remained. For the majority of the analyses, only the placebo and semaglutide 2.4 mg arms from the STEP 2 trial were analyzed (n = 395). Baseline characteristics of consenting participants are shown in Table 1 and were similar to those of the overall study populations of the STEP 1 and STEP 2 trials. Similarly, a post hoc analysis of changes in weight, waist circumference and HbA₁c for this subset of participants is shown in Supplementary Table 1.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^11748BDs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

GRADE methodology in practice — weak recommendation categories — includes the following definitions and implications. "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence" has "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burdens", with interpretation "Weak recommendation; best action may differ depending on patient values", and implications that "For patients, most would want the recommended course of action but some would not depending on their circumstances and values. For clinicians, different choices will be appropriate for different patients and patient-centered decision making should be the goal based on patient values, preferences and circumstances. For policy makers, policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders". "Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" may be supported by "RCTs with important limitations or strong evidence from observational studies" and shares the interpretation "Weak recommendation; best action may differ depending on patient values". "Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence" reflects "Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risks and burden may be closely balanced", is supported by "Observational studies or case series", and has the interpretation "Very weak recommendations; other alternatives may be equally reasonable".

### Improvement of both fasting and postprandial glycemic control by the two-step addition of miglitol and mitiglinide to basal insulin therapy: a pilot study [^112tTggk]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

At STEP 0, the 7-point glucose monitoring values exhibited sustained levels of post-breakfast hyperglycemia. With the administration of miglitol, the 7-point glucose monitoring values from after breakfast until after dinner were suppressed, but the values before sleep and before breakfast did not decrease significantly (Figure 3 A). When the glycemic profiles were examined more precisely using CGM, the 24-h AUC and each of the 4-h postprandial AUC values were significantly decreased.

### Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period: ACOG committee opinion, number 804 [^1148pFPr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy — an on-page algorithm and stepwise method describe how to determine a recommended weight limit (RWL). The algorithm asks, "At work do you perform lifting tasks more than once every 5 minutes?" and, if yes, "Do you lift more than three times per minute?", then queries "How many hours per day do you spend lifting at work?" with categories "Less than 1 continuous hour" or "1 or more hours per day", corresponding to infrequent, repetitive short duration, or repetitive long duration lifting panels. Steps instruct to "select the one graphic (A, B, or C) that best describes the lifting frequency or frequency/duration pattern", then "When less than 20 weeks pregnant, select the image on the left of the graphic; when pregnant for 20 weeks or more, select the image on the right", to underline all relevant numerical values along the lift path and circle the lowest, and that "The number circled in step 3 is the RWL (in pounds)" with a proviso that the short-duration category can include multiple hours per day provided each continuous bout is less than 1 hour and followed by at least 1 hour of nonlifting before resuming; the figure presents "Provisional recommended weight limits for lifting at work during pregnancy".

Step 6 — Experimental phase and fMRI acquisition

In the main experimental phase, participants underwent 8 fMRI scanning runs in a single session. Before the scanning began, participants saw the correct button-colour mappings and all 78-word pairs briefly presented on the screen to remind them of the task and items. After the brief refresher, the fMRI acquisition started. During each fMRI run, participants performed 8 blocks of the Think/No-Think task interleaved with 8 blocks of the Stop-signal task. All blocks lasted 30 s. To minimise carry-over effects, we interspersed 4 s rest periods (blank screen with a grey background) between blocks. Each block began with items that we did not score (the filler items) to reduce task-set switching effects between blocks. Within each block, we pseudo-randomly ordered all trials, and the trial timings for both tasks were identical to those used in their respective practice phases (steps 2 and 4; Fig. 2a and b).

Four of the Stop-signal task blocks contained Go trials only. We did not use these blocks in this report. Each of the other four Stop-signal blocks contained 12 trials, yielding 384 trials in total (8 runs × 4 blocks per run × 12 trials per block). On average, across participants, Stop trials constituted 32% (SD = 2%) of the trials. As in the practice phase, a staircase tracking algorithm varied the delay between cue onset and stop-signal tone according to each participant's performance, keeping the stopping success at ~50%.

Each of the Think/No-Think blocks contained 6 trials, starting with a filler item as a Think trial followed by 5 Think or No-Think items in a pseudo-random order. Within each fMRI run, participants saw all 20 critical Think and 20 critical No-Think items once. Thus, across the 8 runs, participants recalled or suppressed each memory item 8 times. The proportion of the Think trials (58%) exceeded the proportion of the No-Think trials (42%) to better resemble the higher frequency of Go trials than Stop trials during the Stop-signal task. We accomplished this by assigning Think trials to the filler items, without changing the frequency of Think trials on critical experimental items. After the fourth (middle) run, to allow participants to rest, we acquired their anatomical scan and administered the diagnostic questionnaire to ensure that participants closely followed the instructions of the Think/No-Think task.

The posterior sample size is 20,000. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Method. The bars denote the 95% CIs, and the dots denote the mean. The means and the 95% CIs were plotted assuming the participant had accumulated total step counts in intervals of 500 steps at the start of the hour from 0 to 12,500 steps (x -axis). The daily step goals (diagonal lines) were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps.

For the first half of the day (12 a.m. to 12 p.m.), the logistic and gamma regression covariates were dummy variables for age group, BMI group and sex, as these covariates were associated with physical activity.

Accounting for the financial incentive structure of NSC3, the daily step goals were 5000, 7500, and 10,000 steps, which earned participants 10, 25, and 40 HealthPoints, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). For the second half of the day (12 p.m. to 12 a.m.), we defined four disjoint intervals: (i) 0–4999 steps, (ii) 5000–7499 steps, (iii) 7500–9999 steps, and (iv)10,000 steps. The model was stratified into the above four disjoint intervals based on the sum of the step counts up to the previous hour. The logistic and gamma regression covariates were age, BMI, sex, and the sum of step counts up to the previous hour divided by 10,000. This scaling ensured that the variable was equal to one when participants had just completed all their daily step goals. A value that exceeded one meant that the participant exceeded the daily 10,000-step goal. Furthermore, the scaling ensured that the prior was uninformative.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure thresholds and recommendations for treatment and follow-up — The algorithm categorizes normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension with associated actions and reassessment intervals. Normal BP (< 120/80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 1 y, while elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 3–6 mo. Stage 1 Hypertension (130–139/80–89 mm Hg) begins with lifestyle therapy and reassess in 3–6 mo, then proceeds to the decision nodes "Stage 1 Hypertension? (130–139/80–89 mm Hg)" and "DM, CKD or increased short-term risk of CVD (10-year PREVENT risk ≥ 7.5%)?"; if yes, the pathway specifies BP-lowering medication AND reassess in 1 mo, followed by "BP goal met?" with "YES" leading to reassess in 3–6 mo and "NO" prompting to consider intensification of therapy while optimizing adherence. Stage 2 Hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) is displayed with lifestyle therapy, a left-hand directive states "Promote Lifestyle Therapy at All Thresholds", and the legend lists recommendation categories COR 1, COR 2a, COR 2b, COR 3: No Benefit, and COR 3: Harm; the figure notes it is "Based on the PREVENT calculator".

ACOG clinical practice guideline development — topic selection, timeline, team composition, and grading indicate that each committee selects 2–3 new topics annually and the development process typically spans 24–36 months from initial topic selection to final publication. The process is led by a document writing team composed of committee members and subject matter experts, and Two committee members are selected to serve on the document writing team with the subject matter expert to develop the outline, synthesize evidence, propose recommendations, and author the manuscript. ACOG's guideline development process incorporates a modified GRADE framework, with recommendations classified by quality of evidence and strength of recommendation, and ungraded Good Practice Statements may be incorporated when evidence is extremely limited or nonexistent.

Discussion

Studies have shown that prompts are an effective intervention in changing step behaviour for most participants. As different demographic groups exercise at different timings (e.g. working versus older adults), personalised prompts may be more beneficial at specific times convenient for individuals. We provide the step counts that participants should achieve in the evenings to ensure they achieve the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) by the end of the day (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). These recommendations could then be experimentally tested in future studies.

The results suggest that the daily step goals (5000, 7500, or 10,000 steps) influenced the steps behaviour of the participants. The number of participant days rose sharply from 1090 (2.08%) with 9500–9999 steps to 7507 (14.3%) with 10,000 to 10,499 steps (Fig. 1a). The increase in the HealthPoints earned (from 25 (7500–9999 steps) to 40 (10,000 steps and above) HealthPoints) would reduce the days required to complete the first tier from 30 to 19 days (Supplementary Table S1). By setting a 10,000 daily step goal, participants whose daily step counts were just below 10,000 could have been motivated by the incentives to put in extra effort to achieve the goal, leading to the observed spike. However, we also observed a decreasing number of participant days after each goal, which may indicate that participants lose motivation once the goal has been achieved.

### Nutritional redundancy in the human diet and its application in phenotype association studies [^114ikwSE]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The personal NR of each diet assessment is closely related to the phenomenon of population-level NR observed over a collection of diet assessments. Let's consider highly personalized food profiles from a population. There are two extreme cases: (i) Each food has its own unique nutrient content (Fig. 2b1), hencefor any. In this case, for each individual we haveand(representing the lowest level of nutritional redundancy), and the nutrition profiles vary drastically across different individuals (Fig. 2c1). (ii) All food share exactly the same nutrient contents (Fig. 2b3), renderingfor alland. In this case, for each individual we haveand(representing the highest level of nutritional redundancy), and the nutrition profiles are exactly the same for all individuals (Fig. 2c3). These two extreme scenarios are of course unrealistic. In a more realistic intermediate scenario, the FNN has certain topological features such that different foods share a few common nutrients, but some foods are specialized to include some unique nutrients (Fig. 2b2). In this case, theandof each individual's diet assessment can both be quite comparable, and the nutritional profiles can be highly conserved across individuals (Fig. 2c2).
