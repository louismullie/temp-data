## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework of evidence-based medicine and how to appraise guidelines. Then, I should verify how to extract and apply PICO elements from a clinical question. Next, I will examine disease-specific treatment examples to illustrate principles, followed by precision and personalized medicine considerations. After that, I need to check how to handle multimorbidity, complexity, and patient-centered trade-offs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight limitations and uncertainties that require shared decision-making and ongoing monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: treatment decisions should be anchored in evidence-based medicine, integrating the best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values, and using trustworthy guidelines that employ GRADE or similar methods to grade certainty and strength of recommendations, which I should verify in users' guides and major society statements before proceeding [^e807bcaf].

> Wait, let me verify the PICO framework because mis-specifying it can derail the entire plan. Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, and sometimes Time and Setting, should be explicitly defined for each question; for example, in COVID-19, population includes risk for progression, intervention includes nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir, comparator is usual care or alternative therapy, and outcomes include hospitalization and mortality, with timing of symptom onset guiding eligibility, which the IDSA guideline operationalizes clearly [^4dd6952a].

> I will now examine disease-specific treatment exemplars to ground this. For COVID-19 in patients at risk for progression, I should confirm that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and remdesivir are first-line within 5–7 days of symptom onset, with molnupiravir as an alternative when first-line agents are unsuitable, and I need to ensure I note that inhaled corticosteroids are conditionally recommended against outside trials due to uncertain benefit, which aligns with IDSA guidance and CDC summaries [^9863a7c0] [^1dc76d62] [^e5b16f68].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal rules. For acute pancreatitis, I initially thought there might be a specific pharmacotherapy, but wait, I should double-check the WSES guideline, which explicitly recommends against any specific pharmacological therapy beyond organ support and nutrition, reminding me that "treatment" is disease-specific and sometimes the best treatment is supportive care rather than drugs [^6910f562].

> Next, I should review precision and personalized medicine, and I need to ensure I distinguish them. Precision medicine stratifies patients into subgroups with shared biology to tailor therapy, whereas personalized medicine integrates individual patient data, preferences, and context; both aim to move beyond one-size-fits-all, but implementation requires systems-aligned approaches and, often, companion diagnostics or pharmacogenomic tools, which I should confirm in contemporary frameworks and regulatory perspectives [^489a4bd1] [^614c83f4] [^9b0fda9c].

> Let me consider pharmacogenomics and therapeutic drug monitoring as concrete levers. I should confirm that pharmacogenomic annotations can guide drug selection and dosing across common diseases, and that therapeutic drug monitoring helps individualize dosing when pharmacokinetic variability matters, which supports the practical application of precision principles at the bedside [^d0228b4a] [^050ed6ba].

> But wait, what if the patient has multiple chronic conditions or atypical presentations. I need to check how guidelines handle multimorbidity and complexity, and I should remember that most evidence and guidelines are disease-specific, so clinicians must reconcile competing outcomes, drug interactions, and patient goals; the Vector Model reminds me to assess biological, socioeconomic, cultural, environmental, and behavioral forces, and to anticipate trade-offs that are rarely addressed in single-disease guidelines [^c1cbc9db] [^b4e224f1].

> I should confirm how to operationalize patient-centeredness in complex patients. Older adults with multimorbidity often prioritize global outcomes like function and symptom relief over disease-specific targets, and clinicians should elicit these preferences explicitly; likewise, in SLE, the ACR emphasizes shared decision-making, equity, and individualized choices when evidence does not clearly favor one therapy over another, which I should integrate into counseling and documentation [^df325a47].

> Next, I should review how to appraise and apply guideline recommendations. I need to ensure I assess whether the recommendation is strong or conditional, whether the evidence certainty is high, moderate, or low, and whether the patient's circumstances align with the guideline's population and setting; when applying a conditional recommendation, I should discuss uncertainties, alternatives, and patient values, and when evidence is limited, I should consider enrollment in trials or a more conservative approach [^e807bcaf] [^c036f094].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm and sanity-check it. First, define the clinical question in PICO terms. Second, retrieve and appraise the highest-quality guideline or systematic review. Third, extract the strength and certainty of recommendations. Fourth, verify applicability to the specific patient, including comorbidities, preferences, and feasibility. Fifth, implement the intervention with appropriate monitoring. Sixth, reassess response and adjust iteratively, documenting rationale and shared decision-making throughout [^c036f094] [^e807bcaf].

> I should double-check limitations and uncertainties that commonly derail care. Evidence gaps, indirectness, and heterogeneity of treatment effects can limit applicability; harms may be underreported or measured narrowly; and real-world constraints like access, cost, and workforce capacity can thwart even strong recommendations, so I need to plan mitigations and set expectations transparently with patients [^1cb8cdeb] [^c1cbc9db].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan remains dynamic. As new evidence emerges, guidelines are updated, and patient circumstances evolve, so I should schedule reassessment, consider deprescribing when benefits wane, and remain open to alternative pathways, including clinical trials or off-label use when justified by evidence and patient preferences, which aligns with iterative, systems-aligned precision care [^22e313de] [^3c5a4d51].

Treatment selection should be **individualized** based on disease, severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, using the **best available evidence** [^c036f094] and guidelines [^e807bcaf]. For many chronic diseases, **first-line therapy** is lifestyle change (diet, exercise, smoking cessation); pharmacotherapy is added when needed, and escalated or switched if response is inadequate. In complex or refractory cases, consider combination therapy, device-based options, or referral to specialists. Always monitor for efficacy and adverse effects, and adjust the plan over time [^notfound].

## General principles of treatment

- **Evidence-based practice**: Use the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values to guide decisions [^e88b376d].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor treatment to disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^1d246ad3].
- **Shared decision-making**: Engage patients in decisions to improve adherence and outcomes [^1d246ad3].
- **Monitoring and adjustment**: Regularly assess response and adverse effects, and modify therapy as needed [^b74c31aa].

---

## Challenges and considerations

- **Multimorbidity**: Manage competing priorities and potential drug interactions [^c1cbc6db].
- **Adherence**: Address barriers to improve persistence with therapy [^d263061d].
- **Resource limitations**: Adapt treatment to available resources and access [^3c5a4d51].
- **Emerging evidence**: Continuously update practice with new evidence [^22e313de].

---

## Special populations

- **Pediatrics**: Use age-appropriate therapies and dosing; consider growth and development [^f38c89a3].
- **Geriatrics**: Account for frailty, polypharmacy, and functional status [^df325a47].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid teratogenic drugs; prioritize maternal-fetal safety [^d545fcd7].
- **Transgender patients**: Align care with gender-affirming goals and monitor hormone-related risks [^144796e5].

---

## Emerging trends

- **Precision medicine**: Tailor therapy to genetic, molecular, and phenotypic profiles [^489a4bd1].
- **Digital health**: Use telemedicine, wearables, and AI to optimize care [^notfound].
- **Patient-reported outcomes**: Incorporate PROs to guide treatment decisions [^f7a69fe9].
- **Systems-aligned care**: Integrate social determinants and context into treatment planning [^3c5a4d51].

### Why health services should use generic PROMs and PREMs [^f7a69fe9]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Generic measures

Generic PROMs and PREMs apply across all adult patient populations, medical conditions and treatments. Generic measures assess each patient's health and healthcare experience in the round, while condition-specific measures focus on a single condition (such as diabetes or heart disease). Condition-specific measures have been used successfully in clinical trials to compare one type of treatment against another for a given disease. However, this disease must be diagnosed accurately. Condition-specific measures cannot work if the diagnosis is unknown or when the patient has multiple diagnoses.

Generic PROMs and PREMs help in healthcare settings where patients may have either multiple conditions or undiagnosed symptoms, such as in primary healthcare or emergency medicine. They are not tied to a specific condition, so the results allow comparison across different diseases, treatments and healthcare settings. Policy makers need generic measures to assess healthcare performance at the population level. Generic PROMs and PREMs help them identify which services provide the best value for money and where improvements are needed.

### Herpes-STI treatment guidelines… [^8b061fa9]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Acyclovir† 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days OR Famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times/day for 7–10 days OR Valacyclovir 1 gm orally 2 times/day for 7–10 days Treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy. †Acyclovir 200 mg orally five times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing. Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by 70%–80% among patients who have frequent recurrences. Persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

OR Famciclovir 500 mg once, followed by 250 mg 2 times/day for 2 days OR Famciclovir 125 mg 2 times/day for 5 days OR Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days OR Valacyclovir 1 gm orally once daily for 5 days Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day is also effective, but are not recommended because of frequency of dosing. Severe Disease Intravenous acyclovir therapy should be provided for patients who have severe HSV disease or complications that necessitate hospitalization or CNS complications. HSV-2 meningitis is a rare complication of HSV-2 genital herpes infection that affects women more than men; however, acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement is observed, followed by high-dose oral antiviral therapy to complete a 10- to 14-day course of total therapy, is recommended.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e7f24845]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### The clinical content of preconception care: women with chronic medical conditions [^d545fcd7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

This article reviews the medical conditions that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes for women and their offspring. We also present the degree to which specific preconception interventions and treatments can impact the effects of the condition on birth outcomes. Because avoiding, delaying, or achieving optimal timing of a pregnancy is often an important component of the preconception care of women with medical conditions, contraceptive considerations particular to the medical conditions are also presented.

### The concept of difficult-to-treat disease in rheumatology: where next? [^a5f309c7]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

New pathogenesis-based therapeutics and evidence-based consensus treatment recommendations, often with predefined treatment goals, have remarkably improved outcomes across many chronic diseases. However, a clinically significant subgroup of patients responds poorly to interventions and show a progressive decline in the disease trajectory, which poses an increasing health-care challenge. Difficult-to-treat approaches exist in several areas of medicine and the need for similar definitions has recently also emerged in rheumatology. The term difficult-to-treat refers not only to patients with pathology-driven, treatment-refractory disease, but also implicates multiple other factors that can contribute to patients being in this state, including having few treatment options, misdiagnosis, and coincident psychosocial factors. Therefore, the difficult-to-treat state requires a comprehensive, holistic, multidisciplinary approach that considers the specific characteristics of each disease and the personalised needs of the patient. In this Personal View, we provide an overview of the different aspects of the concept of difficult-to-treat disease, highlight its advantages, and propose the importance of incorporating this concept more widely in the design of rheumatological treatment strategies.

### Multimorbidity and evidence generation [^c1cbc9db]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Most people with a chronic disease actually have more than one, a condition known as multimorbidity. Despite this, the evidence base to prevent adverse disease outcomes has taken a disease-specific approach. Drawing on a conference, Improving Guidelines for Multimorbid Patients, the goal of this paper is to identify challenges to the generation of evidence to support the care of people with multimorbidity and to make recommendations for improvement. We identified three broad categories of challenges: 1) challenges to defining and measuring multimorbidity; 2) challenges related to the effects of multimorbidity on study design, implementation and analysis; and 3) challenges inherent in studying heterogeneity of treatment effects in patients with differing comorbid conditions. We propose a set of recommendations for consideration by investigators and others (reviewers, editors, funding agencies, policymaking organizations) involved in the creation of evidence for this common type of person that address each of these challenges. The recommendations reflect a general approach that emphasizes broader inclusion (recruitment and retention) of patients with multimorbidity, coupled with more rigorous efforts to measure comorbidity and comorbidity burden and the influence of multimorbidity on outcomes and the effects of therapy. More rigorous examination of heterogeneity of treatment effects requires careful attention to prioritizing the most important comorbid-related questions, and also requires studies that provide greater statistical power than conventional trials have provided. Relatively modest changes in the orientation of current research along these lines can be helpful in pointing to and partially addressing selected knowledge gaps. However, producing a robust evidence base to support patient-centered decision making in complex individuals with multimorbidity, exposed to many different combinations of potentially interacting factors that can modify the risks and benefits of therapies, is likely to require a clinical research enterprise fundamentally restructured to be more fully integrated with routine clinical practice.

### Thoroughly modern medicine [^dea786ed]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine is receiving increasing attention in the medical literature and lay press as one way to optimize therapy and reduce complications of treatment for almost any disorder. However, understanding the systemic complexities necessary to implement the ambitious goals of personalized medicine is unlikely to arise from the study of common disorders. Rather, dissecting out the individual components to therapeutic response is far more feasible with defined disorders of known cause. Inborn errors of metabolism offer an attractive opportunity to better define the hyperbole surrounding development and institution of personalized medicine.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^5f55349a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) seek to aid clinical decision making by recommending specific interventions for common clinical conditions or problems, and when well chosen and properly implemented they may result in improved patient outcomes. CPGs have typically been based on a synthesis of available clinical research, but as efforts to minimize bias have grown, development has increasingly depended on statisticians and methodologists in addition to clinician expertise, a shift that likely decreases bias but may also reduce clinical relevance and applicability; ideally, development would include both content experts and methodologists. Beyond traditional evidence hierarchies, more recent efforts acknowledge that other factors are important for determining the strength of a recommendation, and CPGs are generally designed to assist with treatment decisions for typical presentations of common disorders, whereas individual patients often present with a variety of conditions or atypical manifestations.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^144796e5]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Statement 5.3.e — physical health and gender-affirming medical treatments (GAMSTs): Ensure any physical health conditions that could negatively impact the outcome of gender-affirming medical treatments are assessed, with risks and benefits discussed, before a decision is made regarding treatment. Some physical health conditions may complicate treatment or produce undesirable drug interactions or sequences or may exacerbate pre-existing physical health conditions, so care should be taken, whenever possible, to manage pre-existing physical health conditions while initiating (if appropriate) or continuing gender-affirming treatments, and any interruptions in treatment should be as brief as possible and with treatment re-initiated as soon as practicable. Limited data and inconsistent findings suggest an association between cardiovascular and metabolic risks and hormone therapy in TGD adults, and because of the possible harm related to long-term treatment and the probable benefits expected from preventive measures before and during hormone treatment, a careful assessment of physical health conditions prior to initiation of treatment is important; some specific conditions, such as a history of hormone-sensitive cancer, may require further assessment and management that may preclude hormone treatment.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^785ae753]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment requirements — The following recommendations are made regarding the requirements for gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment (should be met), and we recommend health care professionals assessing transgender and gender diverse adults for gender-affirming medical and surgical treatment: only recommend gender-affirming medical treatment requested by a TGD person when the experience of gender incongruence is marked and sustained; ensure fulfillment of diagnostic criteria prior to initiating gender-affirming treatments in regions where a diagnosis is necessary to access health care; identify and exclude other possible causes of apparent gender incongruence prior to the initiation of gender-affirming treatments; ensure that any mental health conditions and any physical health conditions that could negatively impact the outcome of gender-affirming medical treatments are assessed, with risks and benefits discussed, before a decision is made regarding treatment; assess the capacity to consent for the specific physical intervention; and assess the capacity to understand the effect of gender-affirming treatment on reproduction and explore reproductive options prior to initiation. We suggest, as part of the assessment for gender-affirming hormonal or surgical treatment, that professionals with competencies consider the role of social transition together with the individual. We recommend transgender and gender diverse adults who fulfil criteria require a single opinion from a competent professional for initiation. We suggest for those seeking gonadectomy that clinicians consider a minimum of 6 months of hormone therapy as appropriate to the TGD person's gender goals before irreversible surgical intervention unless hormones are not clinically indicated. We recommend adults who wish to detransition and seek gender-related interventions utilize a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment that will include additional viewpoints from experienced health care professional in transgender health and that considers, together with the individual, the role of social transition.

### How to interpret and use a clinical practice guideline or recommendation: users' guides to the medical literature [^c036f094]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Clinicians may rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for management of patients.

Observations

A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting.

### Clinical course: progression, management, and treatment… [^1dc76d62]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention. For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death. Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness.
- Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir – This oral antiviral has been approved by FDA for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progression to severe illness. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is available under the emergency use authorization for eligible children ages 12–17 years who are not covered by the approval. For more information about nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, please see the FDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and the approved label. Molnupiravir is recommended as a second-line or alternative option for those unable to receive Remdesivir or Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir.
- Molnupiravir – FDA has issued an EUA for molnupiravir, an oral antiviral to treat patients with mild or moderate illness who are at risk for progression to severe illness. Management Clinical treatment recommendations for people with severe to critical COVID-19 are based on the severity of illness.

Management often includes care of complications, including:

- Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Sepsis and septic shock
- Elevation in inflammatory cytokines
- **Complications from prolonged hospitalization, including**:
- Thromboembolism
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia
- Hospital-acquired bacterial and fungal infections
- Thromboembolism.

### Precision medicine for all? Challenges and opportunities for a precision medicine approach to critical illness [^c7b6d6e7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Terminology

The broad lexicon of "precision" medicine includes many overlapping and somewhat confusing terms (Table 1). Initially, the terms "individualized medicine" and "personalized medicine" were used. However, as researchers sought specific biologic pathways, they recognized that such pathways might apply to a group of patients, and not necessarily to a single or unique individual. Hence, at least in the near future, the goal is not necessarily to generate a unique treatment for every individual or person, but, rather, tailored treatments for groups with tightly grouped biologic features. These groups, in turn, need a name.

Table 1
Key terms in precision medicine

Strata, phenotypes, endotypes, subphenotypes, and subtypes

Some use the term "stratified" medicine instead of precision medicine, and advance the idea that groups are "strata". Others borrow from genomic medicine and use the term "phenotype" to describe a group or cluster of patients, albeit more broadly than in its original framing. The original use of phenotype would include the entire clinical expression of a condition, including its trajectory and outcome. For example, the phenotype for some severe genetic mutations is intrauterine death. But phenotype in the lexicon of precision medicine can be used quite differently. For example, a clinical trialist typically uses the term phenotype to describe a set of presenting features that could be used as criteria for enrollment into an experimental study. In this example, the subsequent trajectory and outcome are not part of the definition of phenotype. Neither use is wrong, but it is key that researchers are explicit in delineating whether phenotype is restricted to presenting features, and if so at what time point, or not.

If a group of patients look similar (share a presenting phenotype) but have subclinical differences (e.g. two different gene expression patterns or metabolic profiles), then they might be further divided into "endotypes". Thus, a particular phenotype may be expressed by two endotypes. However, endotype in its strictest sense implies an understanding of the exact mechanism of disease, or at least the mechanistic relationship between the molecular signature defining the endotype and the disease in question. In reality, researchers may often be able to associate particular patterns of gene expression or biomarker profiles with disease characteristics, but fall short of proof of mechanism and causality. Thus, the term "endotype" may be used rather loosely, prompting others to prefer the term "subphenotype" (or "subtype").

### Personalized medicine: a personal view [^e86e3690]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine is a strategy to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease so as to achieve an optimal result for the individual. The sequencing of the human genome and other technological advances have revealed the extent of genetic diversity and the relative contribution of genetic and nongenetic factors to human health, disease, and drug response. The challenge is to translate this knowledge into tangible benefits for the patient.

### The imperative of the person in personalized medicine [^01ecdc8a]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding Remarks

It is insufficient to differentiate a disease based solely on its distinctive molecular characteristics and claim that the treatment is personalized. Scientific policy cannot continue to separate biology and biography in studies of disease risk and treatment response. The integration of biology and biography can be facilitated through advanced analytics, machine learning, and clinical decision support systems that enable researchers and clinicians to select the best treatment options for the individual while minimizing adverse effects. This multi-dimensional approach, which differentiates the disease from characteristics of the person, represents the core promise of personalized medicine. Moving beyond a one-size-fits-all treatment to therapy tailored to the unique biology of the disease and the biography of the person with the disease is key to progress medicine and uphold the implementation of Precision Medicine.

### Challenges in systematic reviews that evaluate drug efficacy or effectiveness [^37cb14df]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Increasingly, consumers, clinicians, regulatory bodies, and insurers are using systematic reviews of drug interventions to select treatments and set policies. Although a systematic review cannot provide all the information a clinician needs to make an informed choice for therapy, it can help decision makers distinguish what claims about effectiveness are based on evidence, identify critical information gaps, describe features of the evidence that limit applicability in practice, and address whether drug effectiveness differs for particular subgroups of patients. To improve the relevance and validity of reviews of drug therapies, reviewers need to delineate clinically important subgroups, specific aims of therapy, and most important outcomes. They may need to find unpublished trials, studies other than direct comparator (head-to-head) trials, and additional details of published trials from pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory agencies. In this paper, we address ways to formulate questions relevant to specific clinical therapeutic aims; discuss types of studies to include in drug efficacy and effectiveness reviews and how to find them; and describe ways to assess applicability of studies to actual practice.

### From precision interventions to precision health [^489a4bd1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of cost-effective high-throughput biomedical assays, such as DNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics platforms, has enabled research designed to identify and characterize molecular processes that, when perturbed, underly diseases. The results of this research are unequivocal and suggest that most rare and common chronic conditions are multifactorial and exhibit etiologic heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises important clinical and healthcare issues, such as the best way to make and categorize disease diagnoses, the best strategies for optimizing and deploying prevention and treatment practices, and the most appropriate ways to monitor intervention responses and overall health trajectories of individuals. Efforts to address these issues have led to the realization that for many conditions there is a need to precisely tailor (i.e. 'personalize' or 'individualize') prevention, treatment, and health monitoring strategies to an individual's nuanced or unique genetic, molecular, physiologic, behavioral, and exposure profiles. How best to match, discover, and/or develop precision interventions for individual patients are open questions, as recent experience suggests –.

There are two important distinctions in the practice of precision medicine. The first distinction is between interventions that only benefit a single individual or subgroup of individuals vs. those that have a more ubiquitous effect. The second distinction is between health interventions that are meant to affect a very specific phenotype or circumscribed set of symptoms based on their mechanisms of action (MOA) vs. those that have a broad effect on the body, potentially enhancing or treating multiple phenotypes and symptoms. The definition of precision medicine emphasizes the need for crafting interventions that are truly tailored to an individual, implying that those interventions may need to have a limited clinical or symptom effect, because that is all that is needed for a particular individual. In this light, it is easy to accept aspects of precision medicine as inevitable with or without the use of interventions that have actually been tailored to specific individuals, since the combination of interventions any one individual may need over a lifetime would distinguish the unique health needs of that individual.

### Personalized reproductive medicine: regulatory considerations [^9b0fda9c]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine has many definitions. This term is often used synonymously with precision medicine, which is defined as the classifying patients with a disease or condition based on their phenotypic findings, such as biomarkers or genomics, into subpopulations that differ in their response to a specific treatment. Personalized medicine, however, can also mean the treatment of individual patients based on many contextual factors, such as response to therapy and patient preferences, in addition to predefined phenotypic findings. Regulatory approval for the marketing of a new drug or a new indication for a marketed drug requires a positive benefit risk profile and substantial evidence of effectiveness. The indication is based on the eligibility criteria and outcomes of the clinical trial(s) underpinning the regulatory approval. For precision medicine, drugs are often developed with companion diagnostics that are necessary for selection of the subgroup of patients, in contrast to personalized medicine which may be directed at a single patient. Most drugs are approved with a fixed dosage regimen for the approved population, but some drugs and biologics are approved with instructions to tailor therapy for individual patients, whether it be dosing, combination with other therapies, or selection among a class of medications. Hence, more often than not, personalized medicine directed at individual patients is achieved through the practice of medicine rather than regulatory action.

### The prospects for "personalized medicine" in drug development and drug therapy [^665e6635]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

There has been much recent discussion about the advent of "personalized medicine", but controversy exists over its exact definition; how, when, and whether it will be brought about, and what means could be used to measure its attainment. In fact, the concept of "personalized medicine" is a sort of shorthand used to represent the logical next steps in progression of medical science toward greater mechanistic understanding of health, disease, and treatment. This shorthand is attractive to the public because of its intuitive appeal, and irritating to the biomedical community because it glosses over the very real scientific and implementation challenges. This paper evaluates the trajectory and promise of these next steps for the currently problematic states of both drug development and therapy.

### Systems-aligned precision medicine-building an evidence base for individuals within complex systems [^3c5a4d51]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

An evidence base shaped by scientific methods that remove the variability in the actions, interactions, and environments of patients and clinicians alike, whether intentionally or unintentionally, will not address this real-world complexity. Health and health care decisions are shaped, and often constrained, by complex systems. While we tend to focus on formal systems, such as governmental or health care systems, a system can be any set of interconnected elements embedded in a structure that interact to determine outcomes of interest. What will work best for a given patient at a certain point in time is shaped by a web of patient factors (eg, symptoms, clinical history, preferences) in addition to clinician and institutional factors (eg, constrained time/resources) and societal factors (eg, access to care and differing SDOH-related health outcomes).

A new strategy for generating and evaluating evidence for precision medicine is needed — a strategy primed to translate data-driven individualized care strategies to be useful in complex systems. We call this strategy systems-aligned precision medicine, the goal of which is to deliver on the "right treatment, right patient, right time" tagline, but also to consider patients in their specific contexts.

Working at the systems level presents unique challenges. Problem-driven pragmatic solutions in precision medicine must thus start with defining the relevant system and its components. A systems-aligned approach then relies on broad and ongoing patient and other stakeholder engagement using structured participatory systems science methods to help untangle the clinical and nonclinical complexity relevant to a medical problem or population. This approach can illuminate diverse perspectives and priorities surrounding the potential interventions and identify constraints on decision-makers who represent the end users of future precision medicine decision support tools. A deep understanding of the relevant system also will facilitate the generation of complexity-aware precision medicine problem statements and subsets of discrete, solvable questions contained therein to increase the usefulness of precision medicine evidence in practice. Grounding precision medicine interventions in their specific systems will require new adjustments to traditional study designs, collection of varied process and outcome measures, and methodological triangulation to embed a system lens into evidence generation and evaluation. Additional quantitative modeling tools from the interdisciplinary field of systems science will be essential to design context-specific, data-driven clinical decision support algorithms.

### Managing medical comorbidities in patients with depression to improve prognosis [^2edefe7e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Medical comorbidities contribute to poor antidepressant response, treatment resistance, and poor outcomes in many patients with depression. Depression can co-occur with thyroid conditions, chronic pain conditions, central nervous system disorders, and more. Inflammatory conditions such as diabetes and obesity are also associated with depression, and the connection between inflammation and depression may lead to testing that could better match patients to specific antidepressant treatment. Interventions for patients with depression and a comorbid medical condition include careful selection of antidepressant therapy as well as psychotherapy and adjunctive agents.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^4a5dcf27]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology — development of the recommendations and manuscript explains how recommendations are crafted from the mapped evidence. Authoring team members review the evidence included in the evidence maps and propose key recommendations, and Clinical Consensus recommendations include a description of the relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, setting, and dosing regimens as appropriate. When evaluating evidence, authors consider benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, resource use, cost, effect on equity, and generalizability, and they identify evidence related to specific segments of the U.S. population that may be disproportionately or differentially affected and propose specific recommendations based on the evidence review when possible. Articles in the evidence map not cited in the draft manuscript undergo additional review, and if after additional review it is determined that an article should not be included, the article is then removed from the evidence summary.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^9863a7c0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Institutionalising an evidence-informed approach to guideline development: progress and challenges at the World Health Organization [^466befdc]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Two design features of WHO's guideline development process seem to particularly need adaptation to fully incorporate the evidence base needed to inform recommendations. The first design feature is the use of systematic reviews to critically appraise relevant research underpinning WHO recommendations. Systematic reviews are among the cornerstones of guideline development processes and are critical for reducing the risk of bias and reaching reliable evidence-informed conclusions. By way of background, systematic reviews are commonly conducted by formulating a clear and specific question most commonly using the PICO format (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) and by having explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. This rigorous approach helps to identify and include studies that are comparable and able to respond to questions about effectiveness of interventions (what works). This approach works sufficiently well for evaluating the effectiveness of a medical treatment. However, many health systems and public health interventions are 'complex' interventions, characterised by multiple interacting components, requiring the involvement of different organisational levels, having a number of different points of interactions between interventions and the settings in which the interventions are implemented and affecting different outcomes. For complex interventions, framing systematic review questions too narrowly and relying solely on assessing evidence of effectiveness risks excluding the broader range of relevant evidence needed to inform recommendations. This includes evidence for factors important for implementing an intervention, for bringing an intervention to scale, for assessing the resources needed to implement interventions across different settings, for understanding the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention, for identifying the interactions among various components of complex interventions and for probing the systems in which the interventions were implemented. These represent factors that are not easily identifiable if systematic review questions are narrow and solely include experimental intervention studies focused on safety and effectiveness. Currently, the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development do not offer comprehensive guidance for adapting the PICO format or considering alternative frameworks when dealing with systematic reviews for health systems and public health interventions. In light of new tools and frameworks for conducting systematic reviews for complex interventions, WHO might consider adapting its guidance.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^20e3ac8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### The personal physician's role in helping patients with medical conditions stay at work or return to work [^f6d5f9e3]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidance for physicians — encouraging routine activity, minimizing time off work, and structuring return-to-work plans is specified as follows. Physicians should encourage patients to minimize life disruption due to illness, injury, or other health conditions and to keep as closely as possible to their usual daily routine; for employed patients this includes finding a way to stay at work. If work must be interrupted, the time away from employment should be minimized, and the patient returned to transitional work or full duty as soon as it is medically reasonable and safe. If a patient cannot safely perform the usual job, the physician should encourage some type of productive work activity through temporary restrictions, with exceptions when serious medical or safety hazards would be involved or when existing laws or regulations prohibit specific occupations. Patients whose care includes attention to occupational issues have faster recoveries and a more sustainable return to work, and in the workers' compensation arena there is a time-sensitive window: by the 12th week off work, there is a 50% probability that the individual will still be off at 1 year. Programs to return patients to work should include medical treatment or care plans that consist of current best medical practices that are evidence-based; treatment plans should identify the optimal sequence and timing of interventions, the physician should understand typical durations of treatment and anticipated time off work, and should provide rationale for any delay in return to full or light duty; and prompt addressing of causality.

### Views of older persons with multiple morbidities on competing outcomes and clinical decision-making [^df325a47]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the ways in which older persons with multiple conditions think about potentially competing outcomes in order to gain insight into how processes to elicit values regarding these outcomes can be grounded in the patient's perspective.

Design

Qualitative study consisting of purposefully sampled focus groups.

Setting

Community.

Participants

Persons aged 65 and older taking five or more medications.

Measurements

Participants were asked their perceptions about whether their illnesses or treatment interacted with each other, goals of their treatment, and decisions to change or stop treatment.

Results

Although participants were largely unaware that treatment of one condition could worsen another, many had experience with adverse medication effects as a competing outcome. Participants initially discussed their conditions in terms of disease-specific outcomes, such as achieving a target blood pressure or lipid level. In the context of decision-making, participants shifted their discussion from disease-specific to global, cross-disease health outcomes, such as survival, preservation of physical function, and relief of symptoms. Despite having some misconceptions regarding the likelihood of these outcomes, they weighed the outcomes against one another to consider what was most important to them. Their preference was for the treatment that would achieve the most desired outcome.

Conclusion

Because of their experience with adverse medication effects, older persons with multiple morbidities can understand the concept of competing outcomes. The task of prioritizing global, cross-disease outcomes can help to clarify what is most important to seniors who are faced with complex healthcare decisions.

### Management of nonpsychiatric medical conditions presenting with psychiatric manifestations [^d872f07f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

There is a significant dilemma when underlying medical disorders present as psychiatric conditions. It is important to identify the medical condition because treatment and management strategies need to be directed to the presenting symptoms and also to the underlying medical condition for successful treatment of the patient. Some systemic disorders present with psychiatric manifestations more often than others. The pattern of psychiatric disturbance seen may be specific for a particular medical disorder but may also be varied. Many drug formulations and medications also may produce psychiatric presentations. This article considers the management of nonpsychiatric medical conditions presenting with psychiatric manifestations.

### Considerations in the determination of medical necessity in children: application to contractual language [^f38c89a3]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Considerations for medical necessity — evidence standards and expected benefit — state that 'Medically necessary services should be reasonably expected to produce the intended results for children to whom they are delivered and should have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effects'. Coverage determinations align with evidence frameworks: 'Evidence-based and evidence-informed practices are widely embraced as appropriate frameworks to guide which health care services should be included in what is covered by a payer or health care agency', and 'Evidence-based practice is rooted in the acquisition and interpretation of scientific evidence'. Evidence hierarchy is specified: 'Robust randomized, controlled clinical trials that demonstrate a salutary effect of the intervention on health outcomes provide the highest level of evidence'; if absent, 'methodologically sound observational studies that support a causal relationship between the intervention and improved health outcomes can be used', whereas 'Less methodologically sound observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive but cannot be used to document a causal salutary relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed far exceeds what would be expected' given natural history or bias, and 'the amount and quality of available scientific evidence may not always be sufficient to determine the efficacy of a given service or intervention'.

### Precision medicine, diabetes, and the U.S. food and drug administration [^bac911a5]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has long sought to achieve the broader use of personalized medicine, which is better targeting of FDA-approved therapies through incorporating precise knowledge of a patient's underlying condition to therapies optimally chosen to match those needs. While some strides have been made in precision medicine-particularly in oncology and rare genetic diseases-most of the standard general medicine indications have yet to realize the benefits of precision-guided therapies. This includes those for diabetes mellitus (DM), both type 1 and type 2. Although the scientific and regulatory considerations needed to move to a more "precise" future of DM prevention and treatment differ between the two disease subsets, scientific advances in both must occur before the FDA can incorporate precision medicine into its oversight of DM drug development and approval. This article provides an overview of the regulatory expectations and challenges in realizing a future where the therapeutics for DM are informed by precise knowledge of a patient's genetics and specific phenotype.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### The complexity underlying treatment rankings: how to use them and what to look at… [^f5b34e58]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

If obtaining a treatment hierarchy is one of the aims of the synthesis, we recommend reviewers to specify the treatment hierarchy question a priori in the protocol, together with the appropriate ranking metric to answer that treatment hierarchy question. This is the first step to avoid misinterpreting the findings of the chosen ranking. The presented treatment hierarchy must be interpreted together with the relative treatment effects, with particular attention to the uncertainty in the estimations, as well as the quality of the synthesised evidence. More work focusing on the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the confidence in the rankings of treatments is needed.

### Medical cannabis: a review from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^4ac4b496]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cannabinoids have recently gained a renewed interest due to their potential applicability to various medical conditions, specifically the management of chronic pain conditions. Unlike many other medications, medical cannabis is not associated with serious adverse events, and no overdose deaths have been reported. However, both safety and efficacy data for medical cannabis treatment of chronic, nonmalignant pain conditions are lacking. Therefore, representatives from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience summarize the evidence, according to level and grade, for medical cannabis treatment of several different pain conditions. Treatment of cancer-related pain has prospective evidentiary support for the use of medical cannabis. Although 3 large and well-designed randomized controlled trials investigated cannabis treatment of cancer-related pain, the evidence yielded only a grade D recommendation. Neuropathic pain has been investigated in prospective studies, but a lack of high-quality evidence renders cannabis treatment for this indication a grade C recommendation. Both safety and efficacy data are lacking for use of medical cannabis to treat chronic nonmalignant pain conditions.

### Can we personalize treatment for kidney diseases? [^027f7da9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The idea of individualizing therapies to obtain optimal clinical results is not new but has only recently been applied to kidney diseases. Nonetheless, kidney disorders present a variety of opportunities to personalize medicine. Here, the heterogeneity of kidney disorders is reviewed to provide a rationale for pursuing personalized medicine. Data on adjusting therapy on the basis of pharmacogenetics/genomics and pharmacodynamics are summarized to demonstrate where the field is, and biomarker studies that reflect the future of personalized medicine are discussed. The goal of this review is to demonstrate that we can personalize therapy for kidney diseases but that considerable investment in new research will be required for personalized medicine to be routinely used in nephrology clinics.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^41b00fe4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase — choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^98f0c1c6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Understand stakeholder product needs

Following molecule discovery, structured, widely‐inclusive and interactive input from key decision‐makers (i.e. regulators, HTAs, payers, prescribers and patients), in conjunction with industry, would provide realistic establishment and clear definition of need at the very outset, as is currently done with adaptive/flexible approaches.

Stakeholders would first define disease management gaps and then identify the types of treatments needed, in light of those gaps. For example, where there is a treatment gap in management of chronic pain (including palliative, non‐palliative and neuropathic), specific characteristics of desired products would be identified among stakeholders in the larger healthcare context — such as nonopioid/non‐addictive product(s) best suited to the specific patient population(s) in need. 95

Next to be delineated would be the characteristics of the developed product that would be desired; for example: (1) specific positive attributes that the putative product should have, as well as the particular unwanted negative effects it should avoid; (2) its performance regarding overall effectiveness; (3) its value to patients and to the health system; and (4) any specific delivery requirements with respect to the healthcare system. These attributes would be set by stakeholders based on considerations of the disease/condition, the subgroups of patients with the disease/condition, stakeholders' experiences with available therapies and regimen optimization, if any. Larger, societal considerations and practical, context considerations would also be included in these discussions, so that realistic goals and expectations could be set regarding product indication scope to be developed, and performance and "effect size" with respect to alternative therapies if available. This is also the appropriate time to try to resolve any outstanding differences between stakeholders in their perceptions of product need and requisite attributes. Considerations, expectations and goals would be taken in anticipation of, and in context with, the activity domains to come, the next of which is to tackle stakeholders' evidence needs.

Management of patients traditionally starts with establishing a diagnosis, a process that relies heavily on how diseases are defined. But definitions of disease vary with time and are influenced by, amongst other things, culture, politics, sociology and economics.

### Vulnerability as practice in diagnosing multiple conditions [^bb74239a]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Research participants struggled further as a result of this compartmentalisation of treatment processes as corresponding to particular problematic divisions of aspects of bodily difference. A number of accounts of those living with multiple conditions reveal how this is embodied as an integrated experience rather than as a set of discrete conditions. As such, the embodied experiences of those living with what medicine terms 'multimorbidity' breach and blur the boundaries and categories that are fundamental to diagnosis. Kelly describes her medical encounters:

I've grown so weary of trying to work out which specific symptoms might be relevant to making a diagnosis of yet another condition. For instance, at my last appointment I complained about not being able to get to sleep at night. The doctor said this 'insomnia' (another problem to add to the list) could be caused by any one of the ailments previously listed in my medical records. It has just become impossible to isolate any one of my existing (or new) symptoms to a particular illness category.

Kelly illustrates well how those living with multiple conditions are exposed to and incorporate the medical notion of multiple sets of symptoms and diagnostic labels, so that both patients and physicians must be seen as embedded within a culture of medical practice. In dealing with the health services, they feel they must continually rework their experiences into acceptable formats for presentation. Physicians' specific aim to try to isolate particular diagnoses from other diagnoses enacts a form of vulnerability in which people feel excluded from some diagnoses and treatment processes. This, in turn, can be hugely damaging to emotional well-being and to a sense of identity, and, unsurprisingly, some research participants no longer engaged with mainstream medical care at all.

### Diabetes mellitus: what the neurologists need to know [^b6dfa2ea]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a common condition associated with numerous complications and comorbidities. The diabetes spectrum includes type 1, type 2 and other forms of diabetes, which may be associated with medical therapies and genetic factors. Type 2 diabetes is managed with lifestyle, oral therapies, non-insulin-based injectables and subsequently insulin. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin from the time of diagnosis. In recent years, there have been considerable developments in the therapies available to treat type 2 diabetes and some of these also afford cardiorenal protection. This review summarises the nature, complications and therapeutic advances in the field of diabetes and provides a concise review for neurologists. Managing diabetes optimally prevents complications and all medical specialties need a basic understanding of the principles involved in diabetes care.

ASAM guideline document types — Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG), Clinical Consensus Statement, and Clinical Consideration — are differentiated by definition, scope, and methodology. Clinical Practice Guideline is "The most rigorous clinical and scientific document ASAM develops informed by a formal systematic review" that "addresses prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions within the scope of Addiction Medicine", and CPGs "include Full CPG Updates and Focused CPG Updates". Clinical Consensus Statement "While remaining informed by evidence, these statements are more relevant to topics with observational evidence, case studies, and consensus agreement", and "may also provide consensus agreement when several conflicting clinical guidelines are available", with these statements "meant to have high clinical relevance". Clinical Consideration is described as "Expert consensus-based clinical documents that discuss existing evidence for a focused topic. This document is based on less rigorous methods of development than a Clinical Practice Guideline or Clinical Consensus Statement", and "This document is meant to have high clinical relevance and address real-practice complexities of care". Regarding scope, CPGs cover "High priority, far reaching topics", Clinical Consensus Statement aims to "Reconcile clinical guidelines", and Clinical Consideration "Tackles issues that emerge as being clinically relevant at a given point in time". Methodologically, CPG recommendations follow a "Formal process. Recommendations follow a formal process with systematic review of evidence as outlined by the new 2023 ASAM methodology", Clinical Consensus Statement uses a "Rigorous review of available evidence and/or existing CPGs and their evidence base is used to develop consensus statements based on reported benefits, harms, costs, patient preferences, and values", and Clinical Consideration "Incorporates some evaluation of evidence but can be a narrative review and involve consensus opinion".

### From precision interventions to precision health [^8e039496]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Vetting interventions with precise MOAs or that act broadly

Standard clinical trials seek to determine if the average intervention response is meaningful (ignoring the fact that no one is actually 'average'). This is consistent with both current regulatory practices and the way clinical medicine is pursued; i.e. putting a greater focus on treating disease within an organ system-based, singular symptom, and diagnosis framework as opposed to preventing disease, maintaining healthy states, and promoting whole body health. This legacy way of vetting interventions downplays the limits of an intervention in certain individuals, or subgroups of individuals, and tends to ignore the breadth of the intervention's effects on different health sustaining processes and clinical endpoints. Interestingly, over thirty years ago, Topol and Califf argued for balancing large population-based clinical trials that provide 'definitive evidence about the mortality reduction afforded by a class of therapy so that broad changes in clinical practice can be justified' with more focused trials that consider an intervention's MOA and the breadth of its activity and clinical effects.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^e88b376d]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines are part of modern interventional pain management. As in other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine appears to motivate the search for answers to numerous questions related to costs and quality of health care as well as access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence based practice brings together pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas. In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government are looking for a sensible approach to health care with practical evidence-based medicine. All modes of evidence-based practice, either in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through a methodological, rational accumulation, analysis, and understanding of the evidentiary knowledge that can be applied in clinical settings. Historically, evidence-based medicine is traceable to the 1700s, even though it was not explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Evidence-based medicine was initially called "critical appraisal" to describe the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolve into application in daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based practice is defined based on 4 basic and important contingencies, which include recognition of the patient's problem and construction of a structured clinical question, thorough search of medical literature to retrieve the best available evidence to answer the question, critical appraisal of all available evidence, and integration of the evidence with all aspects and contexts of the clinical circumstances. Systematic reviews provide the application of scientific strategies that limit bias by the systematic assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. While systematic reviews are close to meta-analysis, they are vastly different from narrative reviews and health technology assessments. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that aim to help physicians and patients reach the best health care decisions. Appropriately developed guidelines incorporate validity, reliability, reproducibility, clinical applicability and flexibility, clarity, development through a multidisciplinary process, scheduled reviews, and documentation. Thus, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines represent statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of care, efficiency and effectiveness and achieve cost containment by improving the cost benefit ratio. Part 1 of this series in evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management provides an introduction and general considerations of these 3 aspects in interventional pain management.

### To expand the evidence base about harms from tests and treatments [^1cb8cdeb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rigorous evidence about the broad range of harms that might be experienced by a patient in the course of testing and treatment is sparse. We aimed to generate recommendations for how researchers might more comprehensively evaluate potential harms of healthcare interventions, to allow clinicians and patients to better include this evidence in clinical decision-making. We propose seven domains of harms of tests and treatments that are relevant to patients: (1) physical impairment, (2) psychological distress, (3) social disruption, (4) disruption in connection to healthcare, (5) labeling, (6) financial impact, and (7) treatment burden. These domains will include a range of severity of harms and variation in timing after testing or treatment, attributable to the service itself or a resulting care cascade. Although some new measures may be needed, diverse data and tools are available to allow the assessment of harms comprehensively across these domains. We encourage researchers to evaluate harms in sub-populations, since the harms experienced may differ importantly by demographics, social determinants, presence of comorbid illness, psychological state, and other characteristics. Regulators, funders, and editors might require either assessment or reporting of harms in each domain or require justification for inclusion and exclusion of different domains.

### Systemic therapies in managing sinonasal inflammation [^f43fbd58]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a condition characterized by persistent inflammation due to intrinsic mucosal hypersensitivity or persistent infection. Proper medical treatment with antibiotic, leukotriene modifiers, oral corticosteroids, or even aspirin desensitization for the sinus inflammation can prevent the need for surgical intervention. The key to delineating the specific medical application is to determine the cause of the sinus mucosa dysfunction and its specific inflammatory pathway. Such targeted antiinflammatory medical therapy will lead to improved efficacy in the management of CRS. Even if surgical intervention is required, postoperative medical treatment is essential to minimizing the intrinsic mucosal inflammation and therefore preventing revision endoscopic procedures.

### Precision medicine for cardiometabolic disease: a framework for clinical translation [^614c83f4]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic disease is a major threat to global health. Precision medicine has great potential to help to reduce the burden of this common and complex disease cluster, and to enhance contemporary evidence-based medicine. Its key pillars are diagnostics; prediction (of the primary disease); prevention (of the primary disease); prognosis (prediction of complications of the primary disease); treatment (of the primary disease or its complications); and monitoring (of risk exposure, treatment response, and disease progression or remission). To contextualise precision medicine in both research and clinical settings, and to encourage the successful translation of discovery science into clinical practice, in this Series paper we outline a model (the EPPOS model) that builds on contemporary evidence-based approaches; includes precision medicine that improves disease-related predictions by stratifying a cohort into subgroups of similar characteristics, or using participants' characteristics to model treatment outcomes directly; includes personalised medicine with the use of a person's data to objectively gauge the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of therapeutics; and subjectively tailors medical decisions to the individual's preferences, circumstances, and capabilities. Precision medicine requires a well functioning system comprised of multiple stakeholders, including health-care recipients, health-care providers, scientists, health economists, funders, innovators of medicines and technologies, regulators, and policy makers. Powerful computing infrastructures supporting appropriate analysis of large-scale, well curated, and accessible health databases that contain high-quality, multidimensional, time-series data will be required; so too will prospective cohort studies in diverse populations designed to generate novel hypotheses, and clinical trials designed to test them. Here, we carefully consider these topics and describe a framework for the integration of precision medicine in cardiometabolic disease.

### EMBASE search strategies for identifying methodologically sound diagnostic studies for use by clinicians and researchers [^e8fd58de]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate diagnosis is essential for both the clinical care of patients and research about disease conditions. Clinicians increasingly use online access to evidence in the course of clinical care as well as for continuing education and research. For most clinicians and researchers the current best evidence published in health care journals is usually first widely accessible through major biomedical databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE. However, information retrieval in these databases can be problematic due to the scatter of relevant articles across a broad array of journals, the very dilute concentration of high quality, relevant studies in a very large database, and the inherent limitations of indexing in any large bibliographic database, amplified by clinicians' lack of search skills. EMBASE searches, for example, take place in the milieu of over 9 million citations from over 4,600 journals with between 6,000 and 8,000 citations added weekly.

Researchers have developed search strategies to assist clinicians with searching, the majority of which have been developed for MEDLINE when searching for therapy and review articles. More recently, search strategies have been reported for the retrieval of diagnostic studies in MEDLINE. This is an important development because clinicians must be able to efficiently retrieve the increasing amount of innovation and new knowledge concerning diagnosis and the burgeoning number of validated treatments for specific conditions that are contained in these large electronic databases. Using search strategies or filters can assist clinicians with this retrieval. In addition to searching MEDLINE, clinicians may wish to search other electronic databases such as EMBASE to cover their topic of interest more comprehensively. EMBASE is complementary to MEDLINE in that EMBASE provides greater coverage of the European and non-English language publications and provides broader coverage in such areas as psychiatry and toxicology.

In the early 1990s, our group at McMaster University developed search filters for use by clinicians and researchers on a small subset of 10 journals and for 4 types of journal articles (therapy, diagnosis, prognosis and causation [etiology]). This research was updated and expanded using data from 161 journals indexed in MEDLINE from the publishing year 2000. These search strategies have been adapted for use in the Clinical Queries interface of MEDLINE. Clinicians can easily access and use these search strategies by going to the Clinical Queries page in PubMed. We now report the extension of this research for EMBASE, including the information retrieval properties of single terms and combinations of terms for maximizing the sensitivity and specificity of identifying methodologically sound primary (original) studies on the diagnosis of health disorders. These search strategies will assist clinicians and researchers when searching for relevant, high-quality articles in EMBASE.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^fb1578d7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — scope and methods summarize that a panel reviewed available evidence supporting practices for acute management and treatment of drowning in out-of-hospital and emergency medical care settings, with literature about definitions and terminology, epidemiology, rescue, resuscitation, acute clinical management, disposition, and drowning prevention; the panel graded available evidence according to the American College of Chest Physicians criteria and made recommendations, including basing recommendations on the panel's collective clinical experience and judgment when published evidence was lacking, and this is the first update to the original practice guidelines published in 2016. Methods state the authors reviewed each section of the original document to determine relevance and need for updating, identified articles through PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar using a keyword search appropriate to each topic, reviewed randomized controlled trials, observational studies, case series, and review articles, excluded abstracts for which the full article could not be obtained, and graded recommendations using the American College of Chest Physicians classification scheme in accordance with prior versions of the Wilderness Medical Society Practice Guidelines.

### The many faces of diabetes. is there a need for re-classification? A narrative review [^336fa13d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diabetes Mellitus is a complex multifactorial disease, leading to high morbidity and mortality. With the development of newer drugs and improved surgical options, our knowledge of diabetes and its physiology increased incrementally. However, with this increase in knowledge, we are still not able to fully understand its pathophysiology and therefore based on the current literature a new reclassification is difficult to made. Future research will hopefully guide clinicians to optimal medical and/or surgical treatment for diabetes and provide further structure in a potential reclassification of diabetes.

### Patient complexity: more than comorbidity. the vector model of complexity [^b4e224f1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The conceptualization of patient complexity is just beginning in clinical medicine.

Objectives

This study aims (1) to propose a conceptual approach to complex patients; (2) to demonstrate how this approach promotes achieving congruence between patient and provider, a critical step in the development of maximally effective treatment plans; and (3) to examine availability of evidence to guide trade-off decisions and assess healthcare quality for complex patients.

Methods/Results

The Vector Model of Complexity portrays interactions between biological, socioeconomic, cultural, environmental and behavioral forces as health determinants. These forces are not easily discerned but exert profound influences on processes and outcomes of care for chronic medical conditions. Achieving congruence between patient, physician, and healthcare system is essential for effective, patient-centered care; requires assessment of all axes of the Vector Model; and, frequently, requires trade-off decisions to develop a tailored treatment plan. Most evidence-based guidelines rarely provide guidance for trade-off decisions. Quality measures often exclude complex patients and are not designed explicitly to assess their overall healthcare.

Conclusions/Recommendations

We urgently need to expand the evidence base to inform the care of complex patients of all kinds, especially for the clinical trade-off decisions that are central to tailoring care. We offer long- and short-term strategies to begin to incorporate complexity into quality measurement and performance profiling, guided by the Vector Model. Interdisciplinary research should lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of the multiple sources of patient complexity and their interactions, and how provision of healthcare should be harmonized with complexity to optimize health.

### Definitions of chronic disease need to be more patient centred [^137883e0]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Effect on patients

Another important consequence of defining an abnormal test or examination result as disease is that patients will lose, and in fact have often already lost, their say in whether they are sick, whether they need a treatment, and whether the treatment is effective. This loss is of no small matter. As a result, their health and rights cannot be adequately protected partly because of the competing interests of other stakeholders in the business of healthcare. Furthermore, interventions cannot make patients truly satisfied if they cannot sense what is wrong with their body and the benefit of interventions on it. Lastly, making small abnormal changes a disease may also increase overdiagnoses, cause health inequity, and compromise care quality and safety. Even the best evidence based policies will fail if clinicians do not have sufficient time to follow them, not to say the unsubstantiated recommendations, as clinicians have already been overloaded.

It is now evident that disease is not a black and white entity and ever earlier or smaller forms always exist. Undoubtedly, health technology will continue to advance so that in the future we can see even smaller changes in the body. Early detection and treatment are certainly beneficial for many diseases. The question is whether we should make a small abnormality a disease for which early diagnosis has little or no benefit and how much further we should go in this direction. Given the widely existent overdiagnosis and ever increasing health expenditure, we argue, for the purpose of patient care that is medicine's fundamental goal, we should rethink the way we define chronic diseases and make early, small abnormal changes a disease only if there are effective interventions that can make a clinical difference that is worthwhile to patients. To this end, the interventions' absolute benefit and cost effectiveness in the newly labelled patients should be highly emphasised and carefully evaluated before changing a diagnostic cut-off point or modifying a disease definition.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^b3ed17fb]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG clinical consensus methodology — evidence review for clinical consensus describes how literature is searched, screened, prioritized, and mapped to support recommendations. Just before publication submission, a final supplemental literature search is performed, and study inclusion and exclusion criteria are developed by the authoring team members, committee leadership, and the methodologist; titles and abstracts are screened by staff with priority given to high-quality systematic reviews, published evidence-based guidelines by clinical or public health organizations, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. Authors complete full-text review based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria with standardized reasons for article exclusion, and the development process does not involve a risk of bias analysis or grading of the evidence. After identifying a final list of relevant studies and guidelines, ACOG staff develop summary evidence maps that provide a concise display organized by the hierarchy of evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, observational studies, case studies, and narrative reviews), summarize guidelines from professional societies and other relevant stakeholders, and are used by the writing team and committee when developing full recommendation statements and descriptions of supportive evidence.

### Unpacking the notion of "serious" genetic conditions: towards implementation in reproductive decision-making? [^2a86e26b]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Tension between clinical care and population health

In clinical care, patients (i.e. prospective parents) together with their healthcare providers, make decisions about reproductive and prenatal testing options based on the would-be parent's understanding of the foetal diagnosis, their needs, their values, and their familial/personal context. The focus here is on subjective and contextual elements that impact patient well-being. Therefore, relying solely on an objective or biomedical qualification of "serious" in clinical care would be dismissive of the person's experience and fail to account for a variety of factors that may influence their understanding of seriousness, as well as concepts such as health and disease (e.g. ethnocultural and spiritual-religious). In population health, assessments of a genetic condition's seriousness are typically made in aggregate and ex ante, based on a medical model (i.e. seriousness as the objective, quantifiable, and measurable qualifier). Decisions are applied in a top–down manner, so as to foster a more consistent and coherent application of laws, regulations, and policies. Such decisions require operational definitions and more consensual perspectives. Population health policy and its implementation are undertaken with specific resources, targets, and groups of individuals (i.e. sub-populations/communities) in mind. The western paradigm has been predominant in this context, with a focus on objective, measurable outcomes, which often involves the use of more collectively focused criteria and measures to ensure an equitable and justified use of resources. Governments may also have to address conflicting interests between different lobbying patient organizations, even when they represent the same condition. In this context, the focus is on the prevalence of a genetic condition in a given population and on the potential impacts for the population (e.g. funding for and equitable access to screening, treatments, or to social support), as well as improving the overall health of the population, while also promoting plural values and upholding reproductive autonomy (e.g. PGT; NIPT; carrier screening; newborn screening). The number and type of genetic conditions deemed to be "serious" enough to offer a population-scale intervention will likely be narrower than conditions for which testing may be offered in clinical care (e.g. prenatal screening for common aneuploidies versus prenatal testing for a rare genetic condition). It is the ability of clinical care to attend to and incorporate the context of an individual and their circumstances into decision-making that allows for the broader scope and number of conditions deemed "serious".

### Disease-drug database for pharmacogenomic-based prescribing [^d0228b4a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Providers have expressed a strong desire to have additional clinical decision-support tools to help with interpretation of pharmacogenomic results. We developed and tested a novel disease-drug association tool that enables pharmacogenomic-based prescribing to treat common diseases. First, 324 drugs were mapped to 484 distinct diseases (mean number of drugs treating each disease was 4.9; range 1–37). Then the disease-drug association tool was pharmacogenomically annotated, with an average of 1.8 pharmacogenomically annotated drugs associated/disease. Applying this tool to a prospectively enrolled > 1,000 patient cohort from a tertiary medical center showed that 90% of the top ∼20 diseases in this population and ≥ 93% of patients could appropriately be treated with ≥ 1 medication with actionable pharmacogenomic information. When combined with clinical patient genotypes, this tool permits delivery of patient-specific pharmacogenomically informed disease treatment recommendations to inform the treatment of many medical conditions of the US population, a key initial step towards implementation of precision medicine.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1d246ad3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

### Making narrative statements to describe treatment effects [^8f367a78]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Accurately describing treatment effects using plain language and narrative statements is a critical step in communicating research findings to end users. However, the process of developing these narratives has not been historically guided by a specific framework. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Evidence-based Practice Center Program developed guidance for narrative summaries of treatment effects that identifies five constructs. We explicitly identify these constructs to facilitate developing narrative statements: (1) direction of effect, (2) size of effect, (3) clinical importance, (4) statistical significance, and (5) strength or certainty of evidence. These constructs clearly overlap. It may not always be feasible to address all five constructs. Based on context and intended audience, investigators can determine which constructs will be most important to address in narrative statements.

### Clinical consensus methodology [^91b2619d]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus methodology — topic selection, development, outline formulation, and literature search — states that topics are chosen for clinical importance due to high incidence or prevalence, emergence of new or conflicting evidence, uncertainty in management, or significant variations in practice, and that Clinical Consensus topics have a narrow scope with one to two focused clinical questions or issues. The development process typically spans 12–18 months and is led by two committee member authors who draft the outline, synthesize evidence, develop recommendations, and author the manuscript, with scheduled conference calls with ACOG staff and frequent electronic communication, and committee review culminating in final approval. For outlines, a formal topic outline uses PICOTS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Time, and Setting), incorporates health equity using the PROGRESS Plus tool, and may consult clinical and methodologic experts and conduct a scoping search, with the Clinical Consensus Committee reviewing, revising as necessary, and providing final approval. Literature search procedures specify identifying literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsychInfo, performed by ACOG staff medical librarians using reference manager software, with prior references reviewed when revising documents and exclusion of studies that do not meet the PICOTS criteria or are outside the scope.

### Association between depression and disease-specific treatment [^d263061d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression is a known risk factor for noncompliance to medical treatment. However, it remains unclear whether comorbidities alter the relationship between depression and treatment compliance. We explored whether depression is associated with disease-specific treatment service utilization.

Methods

This cross-sectional study utilized data from 499,492 individuals who had at least one comorbidity in the Korean Community Health Survey, 2009–2013. Self-reported lifetime depression diagnosis by a physician, current depressive symptoms, and utilization of medical services were queried. The association between depression status and the use of overall treatment services was investigated using multiple logistic regression models and further stratified by use of specific medical treatment under conditions predefined with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).

Results

Compared with non-depressed people, individuals with a "lifetime history of depression with current depressive symptom" showed higher odds of using overall medical treatment services in both men (OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.00–1.47) and women (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02–1.25). However, depressed individuals with CCI comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus or angina) exhibited less utilization of treatment services than non-depressed individuals.

Limitations

The nature of the cross-sectional study limits the ability to infer a temporal causal relationship.

Conclusion

Overall, depressed individuals with a lifetime history of depression used treatment services more frequently than non-depressed individuals; however, depressed individuals with major illnesses tended to seek treatment for their medical conditions less. The mental health of patients who seek for medical services should be carefully considered in primary care for the proper health service utilization.

### A practical guide about tattooing in patients with chronic skin disorders and other medical conditions [^7430d023]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

With tattoos becoming increasingly mainstream, dermatologists are more and more often consulted by patients who are considering getting an ornamental, cosmetic, or even a medical tattoo, and who subsequently ask for advice. This includes not only patients with chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis but also patients with other medical conditions. This review first explores the reasons why patients may want to get a tattoo and aims to offer some key information to dermatologists on what they should know about tattooing and the main risks associated with this procedure. Second, the risks and recommendations of tattooing in patients with specific skin diseases are described more in detail, and the relative and strict contraindications discussed, including the necessity to discontinue certain treatments that could influence the outcome of the procedure and the final result. Our aim was to provide dermatologists with the current knowledge they need to help their patients make adequate and informed choices on skin art, focusing specifically on considerations in patients with chronic skin conditions. Finally, other aspects regarding some general systemic conditions and concomitant diseases that the patient could present are also addressed. In particular, the risks of tattooing in patients with diabetes, coagulation disorders, heart conditions, immunosuppressive treatments, and pregnancy are discussed.

### Prednisone [^b74c31aa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^8c21006d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Human GH use by athletes with short stature without GH deficiency: therapeutic use exemptions [^816f2496]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Organized sports are governed by specific rules that aim to create or preserve fair play. An unfair advantage can be obtained by the use of specific substances or methods, also referred to as doping. The World Anti-Doping Agency leads the international doping-free sport movement and annually publishes the List of Prohibited Substances and Methods (List), which is used by most sport federations and organizations around the world. However, some athletes have legitimate medical conditions that require treatments that are included on the List. These athletes may apply for a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE), which, if approved, would allow them to take the required prohibited treatments. A challenging scenario concerns adolescents with short stature receiving treatment with human GH (hGH) who are not GH-deficient. Such treatment for short stature conditions is an approved indication for GH therapy in only a few countries, including the United States. Development of TUE Physician Guidelines for hGH for adolescent athletes with short stature required determining whether and to what extent such treatment constituted medical therapy or "enhancement". The group of experts contributing to the TUE Physician Guidelines concluded that hGH treatment for athletes with non-GH-deficient short stature could be considered therapeutic-and could be granted a TUE if they are below 2.25 SD on the growth curve-until the athlete reached a height at the 5th percentile of adult normal range on the appropriate growth chart pertaining to a specific country or region or another relevant chart. Beyond that point, a TUE for hGH treatment is not medically necessary and a TUE should no longer be considered.

### Development of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess emotional impact of treatment for type 2 diabetes [^cc0f866d]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medical treatment can have broad effects beyond symptom improvement, including effects on multiple aspects of quality of life. In some cases, treatment can have an emotional impact as improvement in symptoms and other aspects of disease can lead to improvement in mood disturbance, emotional role limitation, anxiety, and depression. Because the emotional impact of disease and treatment is subjective, it must be measured using patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

Many generic PRO instruments include items assessing emotional status. For example, the Short Form Health Survey-36 (v2) includes items in a role-emotional subscale related to "problems with work or other daily activities as a result of emotional problems (such as feeling depressed or anxious)" and additional items with emotional content such as "nervous", "calm and peaceful", "downhearted and blue", and "happy". The EQ-5D includes a single item on anxiety and depression. However, it should be noted that the emotion-related items from these generic instruments assess one's overall emotional state, rather than the emotional impact of treatment or any specific medical condition. Across a range of medical conditions, condition-specific PROs have been designed to assess aspects of emotional functioning. For example, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale includes a subscale for emotional well-being. Measures developed for use in chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as the Minnesota Living with Health Failure Questionnaire, the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review, and the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire also assess emotional functioning. Compared to generic instruments, these condition-specific measures allow for a more targeted assessment of specific types of emotional impact that may be associated with particular medical conditions or treatments.

### Treatment resistance in psychiatry: state of the art and new directions [^66c78e0c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Inherent to the concept of treatment resistance is the idea that there is inadequate treatment response. Of the 23 guidelines identified, we observed that criteria for defining inadequate treatment response varied widely and were not provided in two definitions. Three defined inadequate treatment response in absolute terms using statements such as 'no effect', four recommended assessments of quantitative change in symptom severity using symptom rating scales and thresholds to define response, and fourteen used amorphous terms such as 'inadequate' or 'minimal' response. Failure to objectively quantify symptom severity increases risk of inter-rater variability, where one clinician may differ from another based on their subjective opinions of what constitutes treatment response. Using 'no effect' as a criterion is likely to be too restrictive in most clinical scenarios given natural variation in the course of disorder and placebo response, even without considering what level of therapeutic response might be adequate. In contrast, many criteria focus on definitions of failure to meet a minimum response threshold, which allows for natural variation and placebo response, but implies there may be a response, albeit inadequate. Failure to achieve a specific therapeutic response, but achieving a partial response to treatment, is not equivalent to no change in symptoms at all, particularly where the response threshold is high, and results in different conceptualisations of treatment resistance and potentially leading to very different patients being included in studies. Although defining response in a binary fashion is necessary to guide subsequent management (e.g. a change in medication), grouping patients together with putatively different presentations (i.e. absolute non-responders with partial-responders) may result in ineffective and inappropriate treatment being offered to certain patients. Partial response to a given pharmacological treatment could indicate that the drug is having some benefit, but the dose or duration of treatment may not be sufficient. In contrast, absolute non-response to treatment suggests the drug's mechanism of action is not relevant for this patient, and thus a treatment with a medication with an alternate mode of action may be more appropriate. The potential consequence of grouping partial-responders and absolute non-responders together is that absolute non-responders may then be offered a treatment that is ineffective, and partial-responders may be unnecessarily offered riskier or experimental treatments. Inconsistency and lack of clarity in definitions of treatment resistance also has implications for interpretation of findings across clinical trials, as characteristics of patients in one study population may contrast markedly with the characteristics in another. Inconsistencies in definitions of treatment resistance between studies may be responsible for surprising results from meta-analyses examining efficacy of pharmacological treatments in treatment resistant psychiatric disorders.

### Advancing precision medicine in inflammatory skin disease [^ff9e38cf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to Precision Medicine for Inflammatory Skin Disease

Medications inhibiting specific inflammatory pathways are now so commonly prescribed to treat chronic skin conditions that precisely matching drug to disease presentations is deterministic in patient outcomes. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted immunomodulatory therapies, treatment selection remains largely empirical. Within well-defined disease categories, molecular heterogeneity leads to varying drug responses. In other cases, overlapping clinicopathologic features complicate diagnosis and medication selection. As a result, therapeutic decisions are often shaped more by trial-and-error and insurance constraints than by underlying biology. This disconnect between disease heterogeneity and therapeutic strategy not only undermines clinical outcomes, it also contributes to escalating costs, as biologic medications represent a substantial share of prescription drug expenditures.

Precision medicine offers a framework to address these challenges by tailoring diagnosis and treatment to the key molecular features of each patient's disease. We identify three clinical contexts where such approaches can be transformative. First, overlapping features of distinct conditions (such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) complicate diagnosis in some cases and increase the risk of erroneous drug selection (Fig. 1 A). Second, as in most cases where the diagnosis is clear (e.g. psoriasis), therapeutic response varies. While many patients with psoriasis respond to either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, a subset responds to neither. Identifying these individuals in advance could avoid delays in effective care (Fig. 1 B). Finally, for clinical presentations lacking a clear diagnosis or diseases without a defined mechanism, molecular testing can provide partial yet actionable insight into disease presentations whose etiology is unclear. In such unusual cases, a growing number of existing targeted treatments can be redirected to inhibit the candidate abnormality (Fig. 1 C).

### Therapeutic drug monitoring: a patient management tool for precision medicine [^050ed6ba]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The precision medicine initiative is designed to better understand the causes of disease, to develop target therapies, and to identify patients that would benefit from treatment. Prescribing the right dose, which is not always the same to all patients, is needed for a successful outcome. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss the role of dose individualization based on therapeutic drug monitoring as a clinical patient management tool in the application of precision medicine.
