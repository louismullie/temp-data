## Question

Is possible alpha blocker To Brain injury patients for hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alpha-blockers can be used to treat hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury, and if so, under what circumstances they should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of blood pressure derangements after TBI and the risk of secondary brain injury. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and high-quality reviews say about alpha-blockers in TBI. Next, I will examine indirect and direct evidence for alpha-1 antagonists in brain-injured populations, including stroke and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. After that, I need to weigh potential benefits against risks such as hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, tiered recommendation and specify monitoring requirements and alternatives that are better supported by evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and hemodynamic priorities after TBI. Hypotension is among the strongest predictors of worse outcomes in TBI, and contemporary guidance emphasizes maintaining higher systolic blood pressure thresholds than the historical 90 mmHg, with Level III recommendations of SBP ≥ 100 mmHg for ages 50–69 and ≥ 110 mmHg for ages 15–49 or > 70 years, precisely to protect cerebral perfusion pressure and mitigate secondary brain injury [^1171xaov]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating hypertension; I need to ensure that any antihypertensive strategy does not inadvertently drop CPP or MAP below critical thresholds in a patient whose autoregulation may be impaired [^116ydc8s].

> Next, I should review what authoritative sources say about alpha-blockers in TBI. I will now examine the Brain Trauma Foundation and ACS guidance, and I should double-check whether alpha-1 antagonists are mentioned for hypertension management in TBI. The ACS guidance discusses beta-blockers for adrenergic storming and does not recommend alpha-blockers for hypertension control in TBI, while the SIBICC algorithm for ICP management similarly does not include alpha-blockers among tiered therapies, reinforcing that they are not standard for BP control in severe TBI [^114zyZ3s]. Wait, let me verify the broader stroke literature; AHA/ASA stroke guidelines prioritize other classes for acute BP management and do not list alpha-blockers as first-line in acute cerebrovascular presentations, which, while not TBI-specific, aligns with a cautious neurocritical care approach to vasodilators that can lower MAP and CPP [^notfound].

> I need to check whether there is direct evidence for alpha-1 antagonists in brain-injured patients. A scoping review of pharmacologic management of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity after acute brain injury lists alpha-1 antagonists among many agents used, but notes inconsistent dosing, routes, and outcomes, and does not provide high-quality evidence supporting alpha-blockers for hypertension control in TBI, which means the signal is weak and heterogeneous [^114xkQ8G]. But wait, what if there is mechanistic or translational data? Experimental work in brain-injured rats shows that pretreatment with alpha-adrenergic antagonists blunted the hypertensive response and reduced subsequent lung injury, suggesting a sympatholytic effect, yet this is preclinical and does not establish safety or efficacy for treating hypertension in human TBI, so I should be careful not to over-interpret it [^111UXm8q].

> Let me consider indirect clinical evidence from related populations. In stimulant intoxication with hyperadrenergic symptoms, guidelines suggest that a beta-blocker with alpha-1 antagonism (for example, carvedilol or labetalol) can be considered as adjuncts when persistent adrenergic signs remain despite benzodiazepines, which implies a role for combined alpha/beta blockade in selected hyperadrenergic states, though this is not TBI-specific and must be extrapolated cautiously [^116GZwHm]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might directly support alpha-1 blockers in TBI, but I should correct that: the recommendation is for agents with concomitant alpha-1 and beta blockade, not pure alpha-1 antagonists, and it is outside the TBI literature, so it cannot be used to endorse alpha-blockers alone in TBI hypertension management [^116GZwHm].

> I should confirm the hemodynamic risks of alpha-blockers in this setting. Alpha-1 antagonists lower systemic vascular resistance and can precipitate or worsen orthostatic hypotension, and in older adults they are discouraged as first-line antihypertensives due to fall risk and orthostatic symptoms, which is particularly concerning in TBI where CPP depends on an adequate MAP and where autoregulation may be impaired [^114EJM8P] [^116eiBQs]. Hold on, I should verify drug-specific labeling; alfuzosin carries warnings about hypotension and syncope, especially with concomitant antihypertensives, underscoring the risk of abrupt BP drops that could jeopardize cerebral perfusion in TBI [^1114y2YY].

> Let me weigh potential benefits against risks. The theoretical benefit of alpha-1 blockade is reduction of sympathetic tone and afterload, but in TBI the dominant risk is iatrogenic hypotension leading to reduced CPP and secondary ischemic injury. Given the absence of supportive TBI-specific outcome data and the presence of credible hemodynamic hazards, the risk-benefit balance does not favor routine alpha-blocker use for hypertension in TBI, especially early after injury when CPP is most vulnerable [^notfound] [^1171xaov]. I should double-check that no meta-analysis or guideline endorses alpha-blockers for this indication; indeed, major TBI guidance emphasizes maintaining adequate SBP/MAP rather than introducing vasodilators that can lower MAP without proven neuroprotective benefit in this context [^113WMQvd].

> Now, I will translate this into practical recommendations. For severe TBI, prioritize maintaining age-adjusted SBP thresholds and CPP ≥ 60 mmHg, and avoid initiating alpha-1 antagonists for hypertension control; if hypertension requires treatment, consider short-acting, titratable agents with cerebrovascular stability profiles and preferably agents with some evidence in TBI or neurocritical care, such as esmolol for adrenergic modulation and heart rate control, or labetalol when combined alpha/beta blockade is desired, while continuously monitoring MAP and CPP and holding therapy for any decline in perfusion parameters [^113WMQvd] [^114MyDDT] [^116Xd4uD]. For mild-to-moderate TBI without ICP monitoring, I need to ensure that any antihypertensive does not cause orthostatic symptoms or falls; again, alpha-blockers would not be first choice given orthostatic risk and lack of supportive TBI data, and guideline-concordant agents with careful monitoring are preferred if treatment is truly indicated [^114EJM8P] [^116eiBQs].

> I should confirm special situations. In paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, alpha-2 agonists like dexmedetomidine or clonidine are commonly used to blunt sympathetic outflow, and beta-blockers such as propranolol are also used. Alpha-1 antagonists may be tried as last-resort adjuncts, but evidence quality is low and dosing is inconsistent, so they should be reserved for refractory cases with close hemodynamic surveillance rather than as routine therapy for hypertension in TBI [^114xkQ8G]. Hold on, I should verify that no high-quality RCTs establish alpha-blocker benefit in PSH; the scoping review confirms heterogeneity and low-quality evidence, supporting a conservative stance [^114xkQ8G].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence. Alpha-1 antagonists are not recommended for routine management of hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury due to lack of supportive TBI-specific evidence and meaningful risk of hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion. Instead, maintain adequate SBP/MAP and CPP, and if antihypertensives are required, prefer agents with supportive neurocritical care experience and titratability, such as esmolol or labetalol, with continuous monitoring of MAP and CPP to avoid secondary ischemic injury [^113WMQvd] [^114MyDDT].

Alpha-blockers are **not first-line** for hypertension in brain injury patients due to the risk of hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) [^113WMQvd]. They may be considered only when hypertension is refractory to first-line agents (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs) and when CPP can be closely monitored [^notfound]. Alpha-blockers can cause **orthostatic hypotension** and worsen secondary brain injury; if used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor MAP and CPP continuously [^1114y2YY] [^1123dZPu].

---

## Pharmacological considerations of alpha-blockers in brain injury patients

Alpha-blockers **antagonize alpha-1 adrenergic receptors**, reducing vascular resistance and blood pressure. In brain injury, cerebral autoregulation is often impaired, making cerebral blood flow dependent on systemic blood pressure; therefore, excessive blood pressure lowering can reduce cerebral perfusion and worsen secondary injury [^115tydbR].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **limited evidence** on alpha-blockers for hypertension in brain injury patients; current guidelines do not recommend them as first-line therapy:

- **First-line agents**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors/ARBs are preferred for hypertension management in brain injury patients [^notfound].
- **Alpha-blockers**: Not recommended as first-line due to risk of hypotension and reduced CPP [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: If alpha-blockers are used, continuous monitoring of MAP and CPP is essential [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of alpha-blockers in brain injury patients

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **effective blood pressure control** in refractory hypertension and a **reduction in sympathetic hyperactivity**, which may be beneficial in patients with paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) [^114xkQ8G].

---

### Potential risks

- **Hypotension**: Risk of orthostatic hypotension, reducing CPP and worsening secondary brain injury [^111h3V4g].
- **Cerebral hypoperfusion**: Impaired autoregulation increases risk of ischemia with excessive blood pressure lowering [^11352Jg6].
- **Delayed neurological recovery**: Hypotension may delay neurological recovery and worsen outcomes [^1171xaov].

---

## Clinical scenarios where alpha-blockers may be considered

Alpha-blockers may be considered in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Refractory hypertension**: When first-line agents fail to control hypertension adequately [^1135BptQ].
- **Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH)**: Alpha-blockers may be beneficial in managing PSH, but careful monitoring is required [^notfound].
- **Closely monitored settings**: Use in ICU settings where MAP and CPP can be continuously monitored [^115tydbR].

---

## Recommended monitoring and safety precautions

If alpha-blockers are used in brain injury patients, the following **monitoring and safety precautions** are recommended:

- **Continuous monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of MAP, CPP, and heart rate [^notfound].
- **Slow titration**: Start at low doses and titrate slowly to minimize hypotension risk [^116eiBQs].
- **Regular neurological assessments**: Frequent neurological assessments to detect any deterioration promptly [^notfound].
- **Patient positioning**: Avoid sudden position changes to prevent orthostatic hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antihypertensive medications

Preferred antihypertensive medications for hypertension management in brain injury patients include:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | - Propranolol <br/> - Labetalol | - Effective blood pressure control <br/> - Reduce sympathetic hyperactivity <br/> - Mortality benefit in TBI patients [^113c5yUk] [^1169mENh] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Nicardipine <br/> - Nimodipine | - Effective blood pressure control <br/> - Minimal impact on cerebral perfusion [^notfound] |
| ACE inhibitors/ARBs | - Lisinopril <br/> - Losartan | - Effective blood pressure control <br/> - Potential neuroprotective effects [^111cXED8] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Alpha-blockers are **not first-line** for hypertension in brain injury patients due to hypotension and reduced CPP. They may be considered for refractory hypertension or PSH when MAP and CPP can be closely monitored. Use **cautious titration** with continuous hemodynamic monitoring, and prioritize beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ACE inhibitors/ARBs as first-line therapy [^113WMQvd] [^114Abimx].

Conclusion

This trial demonstrated that this protocol is safe and feasible in the TBI population. Despite not being powered to show statistical differences between groups, GCS at study end was significantly improved in the treatment arm and mortality was improved although not at a traditional level of significance. A larger multicenter trial is needed to validate these results and increase the power of the findings.

### Intensive blood pressure reduction in deep intracerebral hemorrhage… [^115xzazb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Flowchart of patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included patients from the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage–2 trial had supratentorial deep intracerebral hemorrhage and complete neuroimaging data. Question Does intensive blood pressure reduction decrease the risk of hematoma expansion and improve outcomes in patients with deep intracerebral hemorrhage. Findings In this exploratory analysis of the Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage–2 randomized clinical trial, intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma expansion in deep intracerebral hemorrhage, and this association was driven by hemorrhages located in the basal ganglia. No association with outcome was found in this population.

Meaning Intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a decreased risk of hematoma expansion, an important neuroimaging marker of primary brain injury, in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage that compromises the basal ganglia; however, intensive blood pressure reduction was not associated with improved outcomes. Importance Hypertension is the strongest risk factor for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage involving deep brain regions, but it appears to be unknown if intensive blood pressure reduction in the acute care setting decreases hematoma expansion or improves outcomes in patients with deep ICH. of cases resulting in death or severe disability. 3–5 Hypertension is the strongest risk factor for deep ICH, and mounting evidence indicates that factors contributing to ICH risk also influence the severity and outcome of this condition.

6–10 However, it is unknown if intensive blood pressure reduction in the acute care setting decreases primary brain injury and improves outcomes in deep ICH. We therefore performed an exploratory analysis of the ATACH-2 trial data focusing on patients with deep ICH. The overarching hypothesis is that ICH caused by hypertension will be more sensitive to intensive BP treatment. Among 1000 patients enrolled in ATACH-2, 870 had supratentorial, deep ICH. Of these, 780 had complete neuroimaging data and were included in the analysis. Among the included patients, 336 had thalamic ICH, 444 had basal ganglia ICH, and 405 were randomized to intensive BP reduction.

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112j1D5X]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

All statistical analyses and meta-analyses were performed using DataParty (DataParty, Hamilton, Canada). The statistical significance was set a priori at a p value of < 0.05. A pairwise meta-analysis was performed using an inverse variance random effects model for all meta-analyzed outcomes. Weights were calculated using the Mantel-Haenzel method. Pooled effect estimates were obtained by calculating the mean difference in outcomes for continuous variables and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables with their respective 95% CIs to confirm the effect size estimation. Assessment of heterogeneity was completed using the inconsistency (I² statistic). An I² greater than 50% was considered to represent considerable heterogeneity.

Assessing methodological quality

Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approachby two independent reviewers (SH and AC). Evidence was ranked as being of very low quality, low quality, moderate quality, and high quality, based on the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I tool for observational studies and the RoB-2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third arbitrator (ML) available for any necessary cases.

Traumatic brain injury — beta blockers and antibiotic prophylaxis: Beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) may be considered for adrenergic stress or paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome ("storming"), with attention to adverse effects, and antibiotic surgical prophylaxis should follow published guidelines with pharmacist input and ICU antibiograms; antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for external ventricular drain (EVD) or intraparenchymal ICP monitor placement, skull-based fractures, CSF leaks, or pneumocephalus because prophylaxis may promote growth of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Sodium and brain injury: do we know what we are doing? [^111QAygJ]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is mounting evidence, including the recent report by Maggiore and colleagues, of an association between hypernatremia and mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. This mandates a re-evaluation of routine administration of agents such as hypertonic saline for the management of intracranial hypertension in those with traumatic brain injury.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to management of hypertension, BP targets, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid lowering SBP < 140 mmHg within the first 24–72 hours after successful brain reperfusion with endovascular treatment for a large vessel occlusion, as it can worsen long-term functional outcome.

### Β-blockers associated with no class-specific survival benefit in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^1156Tcv6]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite the high mortality, there is currently no specific treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Research investigating optimum degree of blood pressure control in patients presenting with ICH and hypertension is ongoing. However, there is limited understanding of the potential benefits of specific classes of antihypertensive therapy. β-Adrenergic antagonists may provide neuroprotection from inflammation-induced injury by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system mediated immune activation. We examined mortality in ICH patients receiving β-adrenergic antagonists to determine whether this class of antihypertensive therapy was associated with improved survival.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of a large, prospectively collected database of patients presenting with acute ICH was performed. Patients were grouped by inpatient β-blocker treatment to determine an effect on mortality during the inpatient stay and at 3 months of follow-up. Additional analysis was conducted comparing β-blocker therapy to any other antihypertensive treatment to determine a class-specific association of β-blocker treatment with mortality.

Results

The study population included 426 patients with acute, spontaneous ICH. Inpatient β-blocker use was independently associated with decreased rates of inpatient death and mortality at 3 months of follow-up. However, univariate and multivariable analyses comparing β-blocker use to other antihypertensives failed to show any class-specific reduction in mortality at either time point.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that the improvement seen in patients treated with β-adrenergic antagonists is not an effect unique to this class. This supports ongoing trials to determine optimum levels of blood pressure control using multiple classes of antihypertensives.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^111WTehe]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Barbiturates and propofol for intracranial pressure (ICP) management — recommendations: Administration of barbiturates to induce burst suppression measured by EEG as prophylaxis against the development of intracranial hypertension is not recommended. High-dose barbiturate administration is recommended to control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment. Hemodynamic stability is essential before and during barbiturate therapy. Although propofol is recommended for the control of ICP, it is not recommended for improvement in mortality or 6-month outcomes. Caution is required as high-dose propofol can produce significant morbidity.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^116C34SH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The median dose of PRO required to achieve HR less than 100 was 60 mg/day until day 12 and then increased to 120 mg/day. The max dose administered was 420 mg/day. Overall, 6% of the doses of PRO were held due to bradycardia or hypotension. Individual patients varied for held doses from none (seven patients) up to 40% of doses held (one patient). Only one adverse event was noted during the study period in a PRO group patient. During the withdrawal period of the PRO, rebound tachycardia occurred which resolved by restarting the medication and using a slower taper. No renal or additional cardiac events, hypotension, or other adverse events were related to study drug. Three patients in the control arm received beta-blockers to control hypertension. All three received the doses of beta-blockers for control of hypertension and none of the three had continuous or scheduled doses. No patients in the treatment arm received any additional beta-blockers.

The overall effect of treatment on mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significant with the PRO arm higher (p = 0.021). Values with significant differences are highlighted in figure 2. HR was measured from admission to SD-14 and the overall effect of the treatment was not different between arms (p = 0.143) (figure 3). No overall treatment differences were found for temperature (p = 0.339). No overall treatment differences were found for intra-cranial pressure (ICP).

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^1157HYKH]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, esmolol has been shown to be protective in animals after brain or spinal cord ischemia. In humans, it reduces inflammation after surgical trauma, provides cerebral cortical electrical suppression in the context of anesthesia, and does not impair cerebral blood flow in volunteers or during electroconvulsive therapy. It is associated with lower intracranial pressure (ICP) if used in the first 24 h after TBI. In severe TBI, beta-1 selective blockers, such as esmolol, have been shown to not alter cerebral blood flow. These effects are all potentially neuroprotective.

There is no consensus on the optimal beta-blocker treatment schedule for TBI. Working from the hypothesis that beta-blockade improves mortality and morbidity after severe TBI, the Early Intravenous Beta-Blockade with Esmolol in Adults with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (EBB-TBI) program aims to define and test a standardized approach. This study is the first step, which, given the uncertainty around benefit and the importance of maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure, is designed to determine a safe dosage for early beta-blockade in adults after severe TBI.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^114zyZ3s]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome ("dysautonomia", "sympathetic storm") after traumatic brain injury presents with hypertension, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, tachypnea, or diaphoresis and can be treated with beta blockers (BBKs), benzodiazepines, opioids, alpha-2 agonists, gabapentin, muscle relaxants, and baclofen. Low-quality data suggest that BBKs are associated with decreased mortality in patients with severe TBI who experience paroxysmal hyperactivity syndrome, propranolol has the most evidence to support its use for these indications, and monitoring for BBK adverse effects is essential as these effects could be detrimental in the acute period post-TBI.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (EBB-TBI): protocol for a phase 2a intervention design study [^111QFXSg]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacovigilance

Patients admitted to intensive care following severe TBI are critically ill and have a high baseline risk of complications of illness and of death. Medical occurrences that meet the definition of adverse events and adverse reactions may be expected features of critical illness requiring ICU care. All adverse events and adverse reactions will be considered in the context of the individual patient's clinical condition and the natural history of severe TBI. Those who are considered by the chief investigator (or medically qualified designate) to be consistent with the patient's critical illness do not require recording or reporting, unless the investigator considers they may relate to participation in the trial. All serious adverse events and serious adverse reactions both expected and unexpected will be recorded. For the purpose of this study, the Reference Safety Information is the Summary of Prescribing Characteristics for Brevibloc Premixed 10 mg/mL solution for infusion (Baxter Healthcare Ltd).

Secondary and exploratory outcomes include assessment of organ function and significant hemodynamic side effects of esmolol infusion as a means of capturing additional safety information in the patient population. Protocol-based guidance is available for the management of specific adverse events (e.g. bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise). The primary responsibility for management of adverse events lies with the treating clinician.

Statistical Analysis

Inability to maintain CPP in the presence of esmolol was chosen as the primary definition of toxicity based on the known importance of adequate blood pressure for prevention of secondary brain injury. The maintenance of adequate CPP as a key goal of therapy is also familiar to clinicians practicing in the field of neurointensive care.

Only data from esmolol-treated patients will be used in statistical analysis. Esmolol-treated patients are those who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, receive any dosage of esmolol within 2 h of confirmation of eligibility and 24 h of injury, and do not withdraw consent for use of data prior to use of that data in CRM analysis.

A one-parameter logistic model, initialized with skeleton parameters as per Table 2, will be used for the CRM modeling, with estimated probabilities revised as data emerge. This likelihood modeling algorithm will identify a maximum tolerated dose escalation schedule, with a defined prior reasoned target toxicity level, or "acceptable" toxicity rate (θ), of 10% with an indifference level of 2 percentage points for decision making. The weighting afforded to the pretrial logistic model on estimated probabilities will be revised as trial data sequentially emerge.

### Beta-blockers and traumatic brain injury: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guideline [^1169mENh]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if beta-(β)-blockers improve outcomes after acute traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Background

There have been no new inpatient pharmacologic therapies to improve TBI outcomes in a half-century. Treatment of TBI patients with β-blockers offers a potentially beneficial approach.

Methods

Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, eligible articles for our systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42016048547) included adult (age ≥ 16 years) blunt trauma patients admitted with TBI. The exposure of interest was β-blocker administration initiated during the hospitalization. Outcomes were mortality, functional measures, quality of life, cardiopulmonary morbidity (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and/or congestive heart failure). Data were analyzed using a random-effects model, and represented by pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and statistical heterogeneity (I).

Results

Data were extracted from 9 included studies encompassing 2005 unique TBI patients with β-blocker treatment and 6240 unique controls. Exposure to β-blockers after TBI was associated with a reduction of in-hospital mortality (pooled OR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.27–0.56; I = 65%, P < 0.00001). None of the included studies examined functional outcome or quality of life measures, and cardiopulmonary adverse events were rarely reported. No clear evidence of reporting bias was identified.

Conclusions

In adults with acute TBI, observational studies reveal a significant mortality advantage with β-blockers; however, quality of evidence is very low. We conditionally recommend the use of in-hospital β-blockers. However, we recommend further high-quality trials to answer questions about the mechanisms of action, effectiveness on subgroups, dose-response, length of therapy, functional outcome, and quality of life after β-blocker use for TBI.

### Oxidative stress-associated hypertension in surgically induced brain injury patients: effects of β-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [^112NfgR7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative hypertension is a common problem in patients undergoing surgical procedures, and the modification of this response could result in improved surgical outcome. Although it is recognized that the incidence of postoperative hypertension is higher in neurosurgical procedures, mechanisms behind this are not well understood. Oxidative stress is an important component of brain injury, and free radicals can influence blood pressure by a number of mechanisms. This study examined the effect of pretreatment with antihypertensive agents on postoperative hypertension in patients undergoing neurosurgery for supratentorial brain tumors and the role of oxidative stress in the process.

Methods

Forty-nine consecutive patients who underwent surgery for supratentorial brain tumors were divided in to three groups (control, Tab. Glucose; atenolol; and lisinopril groups). Blood was drawn at three time points (1 d before the surgery, at the time of dura opening, and at the time of extubation). Hemodynamic parameters in all three groups and levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, nitrate, and α-tocopherol in serum at various time points were analyzed.

Results

The results showed that perioperative hemodynamic changes were highly associated with oxidative stress parameters in all the three groups. It was seen that atenolol and lisinopril significantly decreased levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content, and nitrate in the intraoperative period (P < 0.05), an effect which continued postoperatively.

Conclusions

The results demonstrate that pretreatment with β-receptor blocker (atenolol) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) reduces postoperative hypertension in patients undergoing neurosurgery, and inhibition of oxidative stress may be a potential mechanism for this effect.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116zSc7g]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) systolic blood pressure (SBP) thresholds — quality of evidence: The guideline addresses what SBP level should be achieved and maintained in severe TBI and includes one large retrospective Class 2 study and two Class 3 studies as evidence. The Class 2 study "is being used to support a Level III recommendation" because it provides indirect evidence from a cohort including both moderate and severe TBI without severity-specific outcomes, and the Level III recommendation is supported when this indirect evidence is combined with direct, low-quality Class 3 evidence. In Table 15–1 for the hypotension threshold, the Class 2 cohort reports "15,733 (26.9% Severe TBI)" with "Indirect" directness, "High" precision, and "Low" quality of evidence, while the Class 3 components report "6,861" subjects with "Direct" directness, "Moderate" precision, and "Low" quality of evidence. Applicability notes that the indirect evidence would be more applicable if limited to severe TBI or if separated by severity and that the applicability of the direct Class 3 evidence is difficult to assess.

### Propranolol as an anxiolytic to reduce the use of sedatives for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation (PROACTIVE): an open-label randomized controlled trial [^113zyLJp]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does enteral propranolol reduce the dose of sedatives needed in mechanically ventilated patients?

Findings: Enteral propranolol significantly reduces the need for IV sedatives in mechanically ventilated patients without an apparent increased risk of adverse events.

Meanings: Enteral propranolol is a cheap and plentiful medication that may help reduce the sedative doses needed in mechanical ventilation. Our findings may be helpful in future pandemics when sedative supplies run low or in resource-limited settings.

Critically ill patients often require sedation to tolerate mechanical ventilation, with guidelines recommending dexmedetomidine and propofol as first-line sedatives. Surges in demand for mechanical ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in shortages of propofol in Canada, the United States, and other parts of the world. Dexmedetomidine is not commonly used for deep sedation, and its use is often limited due to high costs. Benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam) can be used for sedation in the ICU, but they are associated with higher mortality in sepsis, higher occurence rate of delirium, and longer length of stay in the ICU, and were also in shortage throughout the pandemic.

In critically ill patients, agitation and delirium are often driven by hyperactivity in the sympathetic nervous system, as neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine are produced or administered to increase blood pressure and heart rate (HR). The locus ceruleus (LC) provides the majority of brain norepinephrine, and LC adrenergic input to the medial septal area and medial preoptic area of the forebrain mediates arousal (,–). Propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker with good penetration across the blood brain barrier, is approved for treating hypertension, angina, arrhythmias, migraines, and pheochromocytoma in Canada. It is also used off-label to treat anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a lipophilic molecule, propranolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and can block ability of the LC to activate the forebrain, similar to alpha-2 agonists like dexmedetomidine. Propranolol use has been associated with reduced agitation, length of stay, and potential mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury and improved length of stay in severely burned patients. We previously published a retrospective study that found the initiation of propranolol was associated with a substantial reduction in sedative doses while maintaining the desired sedation.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with AIS, acute treatment, indications and BP targets, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy (if not contraindicated) during hospitalization to improve long-term BP control in neurologically stable patients with BP > 140/90 mmHg.

Use of these recommendations in clinical practice

Conditions of tiered treatment

The use of tiers attempts to balance the benefits and efficacy of an agent against risks inherent to its use (Fig. 2). General clinical management is considered Tier Zero. Treatment of intracranial hypertension will generally begin at Tier-one. Movement to higher tiers reflects increasingly aggressive interventions. Treatments in any given tier are considered equivalent, with selection of one treatment over another based on individual patient characteristics and physician discretion. During any given episode being addressed, multiple items from a single tier can be trialed individually or in combination with the goal of a rapid response. The provider should maintain awareness of the duration of any episode and consider moving to more aggressive interventions in a higher tier quickly if the patient is not responding. In some cases, it might be preferrable to skip one or more tiers (e.g. choosing to decompress a patient with midline shift due to hemispheric swelling and very high initial ICP). No individual agent or combination thereof is critical to success in managing TBI. Clinical judgment must always determine the final management strategy.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^111WnFSs]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Not used

The CWG recommended against the use of ten management items for treating established intracranial hypertension (Table 1; ≥ 80% consensus). Some are specific pharmacologic agents or means of administering them. There are also specific physiologic parameters viewed as unsafe to exceed during treatment. The panel agreed that there may be circumstances where listed items might be reasonably used by an experienced and expert clinician in infrequent and carefully considered situations.

The CWG did not support hypothermia below 35 °C. Although hypothermia can lower ICP, there are no definitive outcome-based studies supporting recommendations. The evidence against its neuroprotective efficacy and demonstrated associated morbidity were cited as reasons not to include it until studies on hypothermia-mediated treatment of intracranial hypertension and recovery become available.

Inter-tier recommendations

Stepping to a higher tier is a potential indicator of increased disease severity. As higher tiers represent interventions with increased associated risks, the CWG recommends reassessing the patient's basic intra- and extra-cranial physiologic status and reconsidering the surgical status of intracranial mass lesions (e.g. contusions) not previously considered operative. If the patient is at a non-specialist centre at the point of upward tier advancement, the CWG recommended considering consultation with and potential transfer to a TBI center with increased resources if possible within the regional healthcare environment. When desired, transfer is best completed before clinical decline precludes it.

Critical neuroworsening

Critical neuroworsening represents a specific situation of critical deterioration requiring emergent evaluation and management. Neuroworsening was first defined retrospectively as a potential intermediate-outcome variable for TBI trials, it was adapted as a clinical variable for the BEST:TRIP trial and subsequent management studies for limited resource environments. The CWG adapted it here, terming the clinical definition "Critical Neuroworsening", to promote its recognition as a critical event and guide expeditious evaluation and consideration of empiric therapy.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^1148dWZ4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in our society with over 1.7 million affected annually. Limited options exist to prevent the initial or primary brain injury. Secondary injury caused by hypoxia and hypotension may exacerbate the primary injury leading to poor outcomes. Efforts to avoid both factors should be maximized. Catecholamine surges that occur in patients with stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage also occurs in TBI and is often called sympathetic storm, dysautonomia, or paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. This surge may manifest as hyperdynamic physiologic parameters including tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, fever, and paroxysms or any combination of factors. The magnitude of the surge is often directly proportional to the severity of the TBI. Few studies have examined the effect of beta-blockade on circulating catecholamines in this patient population.

While the mechanism is unclear, multiple studies in trauma patients have shown the benefit of beta-blockadeand several have shown that propranolol (PRO) has improved outcomes compared with other beta-blockers. Despite this compelling evidence, beta-adrenergic blockade is not routine in this population. One recent meta-analysis conditionally recommended beta-blockers in TBI population, but routine use is not addressed in most TBI guidelines.

While the preponderance of the evidence is retrospective and observational, enough favorable evidence now exists to justify testing this intervention in a prospective randomized controlled trial. We tested the hypothesis that PRO given to patients with moderate to severe TBI would improve mortality. As a secondary outcome, we examined the effect of treatment with PRO on urinary catecholamines.

Secondary Outcomes

All-cause 6-month mortality was 12.5% (Table 4) against an expected 20% based on Helsinki computed tomography (CT) scores, giving a standardized mortality ratio of 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.45–0.80). At six months, the median extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 4 (IQR 2.5–4.5, n = 7) and the median EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale was 62.5 (IQR 55–65, n = 5).

Table 4
Secondary outcomes (n = 16)

ICU intensive care unit, IQR interquartile range

Clinical interventions, including vasopressor use, cerebral perfusion pressure maintenance, and management of intracranial hypertension, are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Nearly all patients required vasopressor support with either metaraminol or noradrenaline for maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure, which was above the minimum (60 mm Hg) for 90% of the intervention period. Clinical management of intracranial hypertension is reflected by the therapy intensity level, showing relatively few interventions required after the first study day beyond positioning and sedation.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^114y9WbM]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers have been proven in multiple studies to be beneficial in patients with traumatic brain injury. Few prospective studies have verified this and no randomized controlled trials. Additionally, most studies do not titrate the dose of beta-blockers to therapeutic effect. We hypothesize that propranolol titrated to effect will confer a survival benefit in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Methods

A randomized controlled pilot trial was performed during a 24-month period. Patients with traumatic brain injury were randomized to propranolol or control group for a 14-day study period. Variables collected included demographics, injury severity, physiologic parameters, urinary catecholamines, and outcomes. Patients receiving propranolol were compared with the control group.

Results

Over the study period, 525 patients were screened, 26 were randomized, and 25 were analyzed. Overall, the mean age was 51.3 years and the majority were male with blunt mechanism. The mean Injury Severity Score was 21.8 and median head Abbreviated Injury Scale score was 4. Overall mortality was 20.0%. Mean arterial pressure was higher in the treatment arm as compared with control (p = 0.021), but no other differences were found between the groups in demographics, severity of injury, severity of illness, physiologic parameters, or mortality (7.7% vs. 33%; p = 0.109). No difference was detected over time in any variables with respect to treatment, urinary catecholamines, or physiologic parameters. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores all improved over time. GCS at study end was significantly higher in the treatment arm (11.7 vs. 8.9; p = 0.044). Finally, no difference was detected with survival analysis over time between groups.

Conclusions

Despite not being powered to show statistical differences between groups, GCS at study end was significantly improved in the treatment arm and mortality was improved although not at a traditional level of significance. The study protocol was safe and feasible to apply to an appropriately powered larger multicenter study.

Level of evidence

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^111aYs1F]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

This study adds to the small number of esmolol-treated patients with severe TBI reported in the literature. Our results are consistent with the positive findings of other studies with esmolol or alternative beta-1 selective blockers, which supports the argument for further research into early beta-1 selective blockade. We have identified some key areas of uncertainty, among which we consider the need to identify severe TBI populations most likely to benefit, the choice of beta-1 or nonselective beta-blockade, and the influence of other interventions (such as sedation or surgery), as the most important. Given these uncertainties and the very small number of esmolol-treated patients (28, including in this study) in only two centers worldwide with surrogate primary outcomes, it is too early to recommend esmolol for widespread use or even for a randomized trial of effectiveness. Further study in multiple centers and larger cohorts with analysis of a range of biomarkers reflecting both the complexity of the stress response and severity of cranial and noncranial injury is necessary, along with data on relevant patient-centered outcomes. With better understanding of pathophysiology and the links to outcomes, better therapy can be identified and personalized.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (EBB-TBI): protocol for a phase 2a intervention design study [^112ovZQY]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There is a signal suggesting a significant benefit associated with beta-blockade after severe TBI seen in several meta-analyses, although the ideal drug and dosage schedule has not been determined. The EBB-TBI research program aims to define and test an intervention package based on esmolol. This first study aims to determine a maximum tolerated dosage of esmolol given that we are aiming to institute clinically significant beta-blockade at a time where there is a real risk of exacerbating secondary brain injury through hypotension.

Although some analyses favor the use of propranolol, a nonselective beta-antagonist, over other beta-blockers the data do not come from prospective randomized trials and it is not possible to eliminate potential confounders. Further, propranolol is compared against all other beta-blockers including other nonselective drugs as well as those with alpha-antagonist or class III antiarrhythmic actions (labetalol and sotalol respectively). As the authors acknowledge, these studies leave the question of the ideal drug open. We believe the practical advantages of esmolol together with the potential theoretical benefits make it an ideal drug for use in the early period after severe TBI.

Use of the CRM, an adaptive model-based design for dose-finding studies, is intended to deliver a more efficient and safer study. In particular, in a patient population where the margin for error is narrow and the potential harm permanent and profound, and where the intervention challenges long held beliefs about clinical practice, minimizing the exposure of patients to potential toxicity is important. Our assumptions are based on a maximum dosage with only 10% acceptable probability of toxicity, against the 33% standard used in many phase-I trials. We believe that this approach is reasonable in this patient population given the balance of estimates of a dosage that might provide benefit against one which leads to the known harm of hypotension.

The strengths of this study include recruitment of patients not enrolled in other studies of beta-blockade after severe TBI (those with extracranial injuries, previous beta-blocker use or on vasopressors), early administration of intervention and an adaptive design. The intervention itself is simple and uses a drug that has rapid offset in the event of side effect or toxicity.

Conclusions

Here, we present the protocol for a dose-finding study of esmolol for early beta-blockade after severe TBI using the CRM. Both the drug and study design are novel in this setting. This study will determine a dosage schedule for esmolol that can be tested for benefit in adults with severe TBI.

Purpose Of Review

Blood pressure management in acute stroke has long been a matter of debate. Epidemiological data show that high blood pressure is associated with death, disability and early stroke recurrence, whereas the pathophysiological rationale for ensuring elevated blood pressure in order maintain adequate cerebral perfusion remains a pertinent argument, especially in ischaemic stroke.

Recent Findings

The European Stroke Organisation Guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage provide recommendations for the appropriate management of blood pressure in various clinical acute stroke settings.

Summary

In this narrative review, we provide specific updates on blood pressure management in ICH, blood pressure management in the setting of reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke, and the evidence for the use of induced hypertension in patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the light of the recent guidelines.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114EJM8P]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in older patients (age ≥ 65 years) — older is defined as ≥ 65 years and the very old as ≥ 80 years — has high prevalence (~60% over the age of 60 years and ~75% over the age of 75 years). Evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates benefit and tolerability, as "antihypertensive treatment substantially reduces CV morbidity and CV- and all-cause mortality" and "treatment has been found to be generally well tolerated", and "age alone should never be a barrier to treatment". It is recommended that older patients are treated according to the guideline algorithm, and "in very old patients, it may be appropriate to initiate treatment with monotherapy". For targets, "BP should be lowered to a systolic value of 130–139 mmHg and a diastolic value of < 80 mmHg if tolerated", and "treated SBP values of < 130 mmHg should be avoided". Monitoring needs are emphasized: "in all older patients, and especially very old or frail patients, possible occurrence of postural BP should be closely monitored and symptoms of possible hypotensive episodes checked by ABPM", and "renal function should be frequently assessed to detect possible increases in serum creatinine and reductions in eGFR". Drug selection cautions are that "centrally acting drugs and alpha-blockers should be avoided because of their association with injurious falls". Adverse effects require vigilance because "adverse effects can be more frequent than reported in RCTs", and trial evidence is limited as "RCTs have not included very frail patients, dependent patients, and patients with postural hypotension".

### Beta blockers exposure and traumatic brain injury: a literature review [^114doiHn]. Neurosurgical Focus (2008). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to carry a significant public health burden and is anticipated to worsen worldwide over the next century. Recently the authors of several articles have suggested that exposure to beta blockers may improve mortality rates following TBI. The exact mechanism through which beta blockers mediate this effect is unknown. In this paper, the authors review the literature regarding the safety of beta blockers in patients with TBI. The findings of several recent retrospective cohort studies are examined and implications for future investigation are discussed. Future questions to be addressed include: the specific indications for the use of beta blockers in patients with TBI, the optimal type and dose of beta blocker given, the end point of beta blocker therapy, and the safety of beta blockers in cases of severe TBIs.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^113nXRFz]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was to examine the interaction between beta-blockade and catecholamines by measuring urinary catecholamines. A power analysis was performed using literature review to determine the probable effect size. Using a 15% difference in mortality between groups, a sample of 99 patients per group would be required to power the study at 0.80. This sample size would not be feasible at a single center. Therefore, in lieu of performing a multicenter study with limited resources, we elected to perform a pilot study to determine the study safety, feasibility, and effect size during a 1-year period. The enrollment was reassessed after 1 year and still short of the goal, so the study was extended an additional year.

Eligible patients for screening were 18 years or older with a TBI as determined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than 12 at admission and documented brain injury on head CT scan. Qualifying patients were randomized within 72 hours of injury. Exclusion criteria included patients with a significant injury in another body region (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score > 3), incarceration or gravidity, hepatic disease, home beta-blocker use, ongoing resuscitation or vasoactive medications, active acute coronary syndrome, and non-survivable injury as determined by neurosurgery review of imaging. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record (Soarian, Cerner, Kansas City, MO) and the local trauma registry (NTRACS V.3.0, Digital Innovations, Forest Hill, MD). Patients assigned to the PRO arm were dosed with PRO starting at 20 mg three times daily by mouth or per feeding tube. The dose of PRO was increased daily in 20 mg three times daily increments (60 mg/day total) until heart rate (HR) was less than 100 beats per minute (bpm) with maximum dose of 640 mg/day. Parameters for holding the medication included HR less than 60 bpm or systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg. Patients assigned to the control arm were managed per institutional standard for TBI based on the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines. Neither arm had additional beta-blockers withheld if the care team deemed that class of medication necessary for appropriate care. Treatment duration for active study intervention was 14 days with a 48-hour taper of PRO after the study period ended in the PRO arm. Patients were followed during the hospital stay until death or discharge.

### Hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury: friend or foe? [^111LGJGV]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem, with severe TBI contributing to a large number of deaths and disability worldwide. Early hypotension has been linked with poor outcomes following severe TBI, and guidelines suggest early and aggressive management of hypotension after TBI. Despite these recommendations, no guidelines exist for the management of hypertension after severe TBI, although observational data suggests that early hypertension is also associated with an increased risk of mortality after severe TBI. The purpose of this review is to discuss the underlying pathophysiology of hypertension after TBI, provide an overview of the current clinical data on early hypertension after TBI, and discuss future research that should test the benefits and harms of treating high blood pressure in TBI patients.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^114G9Nq3]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the apparent contradiction in use of beta-blockade with concurrent use of catecholaminergic vasopressors. The resulting in vivo balance between alpha-1, beta-1, and beta-2 activation and the consequent effect on pathophysiology is difficult to predict. The stable SOFA scores and lactate values we observed argue for the maintenance of hemodynamics and vital organ perfusion. In terms of secondary brain injury, there is evidence to show that phenylephrine (a pure peripheral alpha-agonist) is associated with lower in-hospital mortality after severe TBI. This is consistent with harm from excessive catecholamines being mediated via beta-receptors, which may potentially be mitigated with beta-blockade.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that is frequently used after TBI and favored by some, but not all, as the first-line neuroprotective beta-blocker. Prospective randomized trials comparing selective against nonselective beta-blockers in this setting have not been undertaken. A previous review favoring propranolol uses a heterogenous comparator of all other selective and nonselective beta-blockers together with those with additional actions (e.g. labetalol, sotalol). In our opinion, the theoretical and practical advantages of esmolol make it deserving of further research, including potentially in direct comparison with propranolol in the ICU setting.

There are several limitations. Practice in a single center cannot be assumed to generalize more widely. Esmolol may not be available in all countries. We have used a simple surrogate of sympathetic activity and have not controlled for influences such as the adequacy of sedation or fluid resuscitation. Our sample size was determined pragmatically rather than formally estimated. The clinical benefit of esmolol cannot be determined as there is no control group and some relevant outcomes will not be collected. Similarly, we have not attempted to investigate mechanisms of effect or whether subgroups of the heterogenous TBI population might derive particular benefit or harm from the intervention, for example based on admission troponin. We plan to address these limitations in subsequent studies in the program focused on efficacy and effectiveness.

### Lund concept for the management of traumatic brain injury: a physiological principle awaiting stronger evidence [^113jGrAU]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The "Lund concept" involving a "volume-targeted" strategy for intracranial pressure control originated in the University of Lund, Sweden, more than 20 years ago and has remained controversial ever since. It is based on the premise that the blood-brain barrier is disrupted after traumatic brain injury and cerebral autoregulation is impaired; hence, the transcapillary water exchange is determined by the differences in hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure between the intracapillary and extracapillary compartments. The Lund concept argues that the only way of inducing transcapillary reabsorption of interstitial fluid is to control the transcapillary osmotic and hydrostatic differences and utilizes a complex combination pharmacotherapy involving β1-antagonist metoprolol, α2-agonist clonidine, low-dose thiopental, dihydroergotamine, and maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure by red blood cell transfusion and albumin administration. Although improved outcomes compared with historical controls and other institutions have been reported with treatment strategies based on the Lund concept by a few nonrandomized studies from various Swedish neurological centers, the protocol has never been subjected to a randomized trial and has not been evaluated outside Sweden. It deemphasizes the effect of secondary cerebral ischemia and contradicts the common treatment goal of cerebral blood flow optimization by augmentation of cerebral perfusion pressure. In fact, good evidence exists against the use of many individual components of the Lund therapy in traumatic brain injury. In the absence of strong evidence to support it, the Lund concept is unlikely to gain acceptance elsewhere.

### Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is associated with a reduced risk of poststroke epilepsy in patients with ischemic stroke [^111cXED8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a known risk factor for epilepsy. A previous single‐center study indicated that patients taking antihypertensive medications had a lower risk of PSE, with protective effects observed only with calcium channel blockers, ACEIs, and ARBs. A recent, larger cohort study has shown that among general patients with arterial hypertension, those treated with ARBs have a lower incidence of epilepsy compared with those treated with calcium channel blockers and β blockers. These findings corroborate our results, suggesting that RAS antagonists may confer poststroke neuroprotection against epileptogenesis through mechanisms beyond blood pressure reduction.

Although human studies are scarce, current preclinical animal research suggests several possible mechanisms by which RAS antagonists could prevent PSE. First, they aid in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). After stroke or other brain injuries, the BBB can become compromised, leading to increased permeability to plasma proteins and other substances, a consequent inflammatory process, and hyperexcitability, thus exacerbating epileptogenesis. Previous studies showed that the use of losartan helped prevent increased BBB permeability in hypertensive rats, indicating its potential protective effect on BBB integrity. Second, BBB dysfunction can lead to the entry of blood proteins into the brain, stimulating TGF (transforming growth factor)‐β‐mediated astrocyte activation and resulting in chronic neuroinflammation that contributes to epilepsy. Past studies found that ARBs possessed anti‐inflammatory effects capable of inhibiting TGF‐β‐related pathways and preventing the occurrence of delayed spontaneous seizures. Third, RAS antagonists were reported to exhibit antioxidative and antineurotoxic effects in rats following various brain injuries, which reduced the frequency of spontaneous motor seizure occurrences. Last, angiotensin peptides are also considered to act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, particularly in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and forebrain. Angiotensin can influence the epilepsy threshold by binding directly to its receptors or indirectly as modulators that affect the balance of other typical neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, γ‐aminobutyric acid, and adenosine. A previous study showed that the use of telmisartan and olmesartan had a dose‐dependent anticonvulsant effect in a mouse model. In summary, the protective effects of ACEIs/ARBs on epileptogenesis are multifaceted, encompassing at least the preservation of BBB integrity, anti‐inflammatory, antioxidative, antineurotoxic properties, as well as actions in neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

### Management of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115ZcJfF]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment

SAH patients are complex and should be cared for in specialized, high-volume centers to maximize good outcome. The suggested approach below assumes that the standards of care in all other aspects of treatment are followed. An organized approach that has been agreed upon in advance by all stakeholders minimizes conflicts and streamlines the process of care. Although presented as a three-stage algorithm (Fig. 2), management should always be tailored to the individual patient, to the available resources, and in a contextualized fashion. Our approach to treatment divides interventions into: first-line therapy for new-onset DCI, which can manifest as neurological deterioration, characteristic imaging findings, or MMM abnormalities indicative of ischemia; and second-line "rescue therapy" for refractory DCI, indicating inadequate reversal of ischemia in response to first-line therapy.

First-line therapy for new-onset DCI

Induced hypertension

Successful reversal of neurological symptoms following induced hypertension has been described in case series since the late 1970s, and most clinicians caring for SAH patients can testify to its benefit. Use of vasopressors to augment blood pressure is still the cornerstone of first-line therapy for DCI. A normal saline bolus (15 ml/kg over 1 hour) at the institution of therapy increases CBF. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylephrine-induced hypertension all have been demonstrated to significantly improve CBF and/or cerebral oxygenation, resulting in clinical improvement of the neurological deficit in approximately 70% of patients. The authors use norepinephrine as the first-line treatment of choice due to its combination of alpha and beta receptor stimulation, the low frequency of tachycardia, and the reliable hemodynamic response that results. Arginine vasopressin has also been reported as a safe supplementary vasopressor in a small group of SAH patients. We reserve its use for refractory DCI patients when multiple vasoactive agents are required to attain hemodynamic targets.

### Primer on medical management of severe brain injury [^115PAhpG]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current understanding of the medical management of severe brain injury.

Data Source

The MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected articles, and current English-language texts on the subject.

Study Selection

Studies related to management of intracranial hypertension, traumatic brain injury, and brain edema.

Data Extraction

All studies relevant to the subject under consideration were considered, with a focus on clinical studies in adults.

Data Synthesis

Basic rules of resuscitation must apply, including adequate ventilation, appropriate fluid administration, and cardiovascular support. The control of intracranial pressure can be considered in three steps. The first step should be initial slight hyperventilation with a target PaCO2 of 35 mm Hg and cerebrospinal fluid drainage for intracranial pressure of > 15–20 mm Hg. The second step should be mannitol or hypertonic saline and hyperventilation to target PaCO2 of 28–35 mm Hg. The third step should be barbiturate coma or decompressive craniectomy. Additional management issues, including seizure prophylaxis, sedation, nutritional support, use of hypothermia, and corticosteroids, are also discussed.

Conclusions

Brain injury is frequently associated with the development of brain edema and the development of intracranial hypertension. However, with a coordinated, stepwise, and aggressive approach to management, focusing on control of intracranial pressure without adversely affecting cerebral perfusion pressure, outcomes can be good.

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uVkiV]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Beta blockers have shown promise in improving mortality and functional outcomes after TBI. The aim of this article is to synthesize the available clinical data on the use of beta blockers in acute TBI.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies including one or more outcomes of interest associated with use of beta blockers in TBI. Independent reviewers evaluated the quality of the studies and extracted data on all patients receiving beta blockers during their hospital stay compared with placebo or non-intervention. Pooled estimates, CIs, and risk ratios (RRs) or ORs were calculated for all outcomes.

Results

13244 patients from 17 studies were eligible for analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated a significant mortality benefit of overall use of beta blocker (RR 0.8, 95%CI 0.68 to 0.94, I² = 75%). Subgroup analysis of patients with no preinjury use of beta blocker compared with patients on preinjury beta blockers showed no mortality difference (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.7 to 1.39, I² = 84%). There was no difference in rate of good functional outcome at hospital discharge (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.56 to 1.58, I² = 65%); however, there was a functional benefit at longer-term follow-up (OR 1.75, 95%CI 1.09 to 2.8, I² = 0%). Cardiopulmonary and infectious complications were more likely in patients who received beta blockers (RR 1.94, 95%CI 1.69 to 2.24, I² = 0%; RR 2.36, 95%CI 1.42 to 3.91, I² = 88%). Overall quality of the evidence was very low.

Conclusions

Use of beta blockers is associated with decreased mortality at acute care discharge as well as improved functional outcome at long-term follow-up. Lack of high-quality evidence limits definitive recommendations for use of beta blockers in TBI; therefore, high-quality randomized trials are needed to further elucidate the utility of beta blockers in TBI.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^114MyDDT]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted beta-blockade after severe traumatic brain injury may reduce secondary brain injury by attenuating the sympathoadrenal response. The potential role and optimal dosage for esmolol, a selective, short-acting, titratable beta-1 beta-blocker, as a safe, putative early therapy after major traumatic brain injury has not been assessed.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, open-label dose-finding study using an adaptive model-based design. Adults (18 years or older) with severe traumatic brain injury and intracranial pressure monitoring received esmolol within 24 h of injury to reduce their heart rate by 15% from baseline of the preceding 4 h while ensuring cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained above 60 mm Hg. In cohorts of three, the starting dosage and dosage increments were escalated according to a prespecified plan in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as failure to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure, triggering cessation of esmolol infusion. The primary outcome was the maximum tolerated dosage schedule of esmolol, defined as that associated with less than 10% probability of dose-limiting toxicity. Secondary outcomes include 6-month mortality and 6-month extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score.

Results

Sixteen patients (6 [37.5%] female patients; mean age 36 years [standard deviation 13 years]) with a median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6.5 (interquartile range 5–7) received esmolol. The optimal starting dosage of esmolol was 10 μg/kg/min, with increments every 30 min of 5 μg/kg/min, as it was the highest dosage with less than 10% estimated probability of dose-limiting toxicity (7%). All-cause mortality was 12.5% at 6 months (corresponding to a standardized mortality ratio of 0.63). One dose-limiting toxicity event and no serious adverse hemodynamic effects were seen.

Conclusions

Esmolol administration, titrated to a heart rate reduction of 15%, is feasible within 24 h of severe traumatic brain injury. The probability of dose-limiting toxicity requiring withdrawal of esmolol when using the optimized schedule is low.

### Effect of propranolol and clonidine after severe traumatic brain injury: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^116EzZEM]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Patients were administered either both propranolol and clonidine (treatment arm), or placebo. All patients and study personnel, except for the pharmacist and biostatistician, were blinded to treatment assignment. Treatment (or placebo) delivery started within 48 h of injury but after plasma and 24-h urine catecholamine measurements were obtained. Both drugs (or double placebos) were administered at staggered times for 7 days with drug holds for hemodynamic parameters. Propranolol was administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg every 6 h, and doses were held for heart rate less than 60 bpm, mean arterial pressure less than 60 mmHg, and/or cerebral perfusion pressure less than 60 mmHg. Placebo was intravenous administration of sterile 0.9% normal saline. Clonidine was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg per tube every 12 h and was held for mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg and/or cerebral perfusion pressure < 60 mmHg. Placebo was per tube administration of microcrystalline cellulose compounded by the investigational drug service. If hemodynamic parameters were met while a patient was on vasopressors, drug delivery still occurred. We documented compliance with treatment delivery and any reasons for missed administrations.

Clinicians were allowed to use β -blockers at any point if there was a myocardial infarction or need for heart rate control refractory to calcium channel blockers and anti-arrhythmic medications. Dexmedetomidine, a prototypical α 2 -agonist, was allowed if standard sedation regimens, such as propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, failed to achieve adequate sedation. In the case of vasopressors, phenylephrine and vasopressin were preferred agents, with additional support from inotropes dobutamine and milrinone. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine agents were avoided unless increased cardiac output was needed or further systemic vascular resistance was required beyond that produced by preferred vasopressors. We tracked the use of non-study β -blockers and α 2 -agonists. Ventilators were weaned utilizing clinical judgment by an interdisciplinary team of respiratory therapists, critical care fellows, and attending physicians, who conducted twice-daily simultaneous spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, a practice developed at our institution.

Safety monitoring

This phase II study focused on safety and efficacy. Safety parameters collected throughout the study included cardiac complications such as dysrhythmia (e.g. symptomatic bradycardia), myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and neuro-worsening. All serious, unexpected, and study-related adverse events were reported in a blinded fashion to the Data Safety Monitoring Board within 24 h.

### Compensatory functional reorganization may precede hypertension-related brain damage and cognitive decline: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study [^115QpgMU]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Furthermore, our patients were treated with at least one antihypertensive drug, and 80% of them received ACE inhibitor or AT1 blocker. Angiotensin-II (both systemic and centrally generated) was shown to act in the brain what might induce oxidative stress, impact endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, modulate inflammatory processes and transcription factors, and these actions can promote rise in BP. Therefore, drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system might alter brain function in many ways and could have impact our results. However, we would expect a mostly protective role of this group of drugs. Other classes of drugs could also influence our results, but their effect is less clear.

Also, the recruitment for the group of hypertensive patients was based on rigorous selection of patients with no other cardiovascular disease, diabetes, psychoneurological history (i.e. drug addiction, depression, traumatic brain injury etc.) or existing brain disorder. A good quality of fMRI images was also essential. However, we did not select patients according to the duration of hypertension. Furthermore, assessment of previous BP control is difficult in patients with long-term hypertension. Thus, both hypertension duration and level of BP control might have influenced our results. However, these factors (a few patients with a short history of hypertension – 'almost normotensive patients') should make the differences between HTN and CON less significant. It may also suggest that the functional brain reorganization is significant even at the beginning of the disease, which in fact supports our main hypothesis.

In conclusion, our study revealed that middle-aged patients with hypertension show a significant neural functional reorganization, when faced with a demanding cognitive task. We argue that this result is a marker of a neural plasticity in the group. Our findings unveil a number of further questions. Are the functional changes also detectable in the group of high-normotensive individuals or are they restricted to overt clinical hypertension? One of the previous studies already reported altered cognitive performance in the high-normotensive patients suggesting indirectly the existence of an early functional reorganization in the group. Similarly, are patients with family history of hypertension also at risk? This ought to be confirmed by future fMRI-based studies. Finally, do altered brain mechanisms of higher cognitive processing independently predispose to progression of hypertension or to acceleration in brain aging? Clearly, more studies are needed as better understanding of hypertension-related brain functional reorganization has important implications for the prevention of both cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment.

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145jsnS]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to synthesize the available clinical data to better understand the role of beta blockers in TBI. Namely, we aim to update the consensus on mortality benefit and summarize the documented effect on functional outcome. As there has been some evidence of a mortality benefit of propranolol. Specifically, we will complete subset analyses for propranolol compared with other beta blockers. Finally, we will analyze outcomes for patients who were on beta blockers prior to their injury compared with those that were initiated in the hospital.

### UROXATRAL (alfuzosin hydrochloride) tablet, extended… [^1114y2YY]. FDA (DailyMed) (2009). Low credibility.

UROXATRAL
- alfuzosin hydrochloride tablet, extended release Stat Rx USA ----------. There may be an increased risk of hypotension/postural hypotension and syncope when taking UROXATRAL concomitantly with anti-hypertensive medication and nitrates. Care should be taken when UROXATRAL is administered to patients with symptomatic hypotension or patients who have had a hypotensive response to other medications. Decreased diastolic blood pressure was observed in 3 of the placebo patients and in 4 of the UROXATRAL patients. A positive orthostatic test was seen in 52 of placebo patients and in 31 of the UROXATRAL patients. There may be an increased risk of hypotension/postural hypotension and syncope when taking UROXATRAL concomitantly with anti-hypertensive medication and nitrates.
7. 4 PDE5 Inhibitors Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Patients treated with alpha-blockers should be hemodynamically stable before treatment with PDE5 inhibitors initiation. Should overdose of UROXATRAL lead to hypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by keeping the patient in the supine position. If this measure is inadequate, then the administration of intravenous fluids should be considered. If necessary, vasopressors should then be used, and the renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. Alfuzosin is 82% to 90% protein bound; therefore, dialysis may not be of benefit. Alfuzosin increased the Cmax and AUC0–12 of diltiazem 1. 4-fold.

Although no changes in blood pressure were observed in this study, diltiazem is an antihypertensive medication and the combination of UROXATRAL and antihypertensive medications has the potential to cause hypotension in some patients.

### Beta blockers in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury: results from a multicenter, prospective, observational American Association for the Surgery of Trauma study [^111qQDMV]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta blockers, a class of medications that inhibit endogenous catecholamines interaction with beta adrenergic receptors, are often administered to patients hospitalized after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We tested the hypothesis that beta blocker use after TBI is associated with lower mortality, and secondarily compared propranolol to other beta blockers.

Methods

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Clinical Trial Group conducted a multi-institutional, prospective, observational trial in which adult TBI patients who required intensive care unit admission were compared based on beta blocker administration.

Results

From January 2015 to January 2017, 2,252 patients were analyzed from 15 trauma centers in the United States and Canada with 49.7% receiving beta blockers. Most patients (56.3%) received the first beta blocker dose by hospital day 1. Those patients who received beta blockers were older (56.7 years vs. 48.6 years, p < 0.001) and had higher head Abbreviated Injury Scale scores (3.6 vs. 3.4, p < 0.001). Similarities were noted when comparing sex, admission hypotension, mean Injury Severity Score, and mean Glasgow Coma Scale. Unadjusted mortality was lower for patients receiving beta blockers (13.8% vs. 17.7%, p = 0.013). Multivariable regression determined that beta blockers were associated with lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.35; p < 0.001), and propranolol was superior to other beta blockers (adjusted odds ratio, 0.51, p = 0.010). A Cox-regression model using a time-dependent variable demonstrated a survival benefit for patients receiving beta blockers (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42, p < 0.001) and propranolol was superior to other beta blockers (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50, p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Administration of beta blockers after TBI was associated with improved survival, before and after adjusting for the more severe injuries observed in the treatment cohort. This study provides a robust evaluation of the effects of beta blockers on TBI outcomes that supports the initiation of a multi-institutional randomized control trial.

### Life's essential 8: optimizing health in older adults [^116eiBQs]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for managing blood pressure in older adults

Lifestyle modification should be encouraged and emphasized to prevent development and aid in BP management at every visit. Several trials (SHEP [Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program], HYET [Hypertension in Very Elderly Trial], STEP [Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients], SPRINT [Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial]) have studied hypertension management in older adults with targets as low as systolic BP < 120. Overall, these trials demonstrated benefit for CV events, mortality, and dementia. Yet results remain inconclusive among those with advanced multimorbidity, frailty, cognitive decline, or institutionalization as these individuals were not included in the trials. Nevertheless, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/AHA hypertension guidelines recommend a target systolic BP of < 130/80 mm Hg for most adults aged 65 years and older. On the other hand, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension suggest a higher systolic BP goal of 130 to 139 mm Hg and diastolic BP of 70 to 79 mm Hg in adults between ages 65 and 80 years.

For patients with preserved functional status, BP targets in older adults should be similar to those in younger adults. For those who have significant cognitive and/or functional decline, frailty and limited life expectancy, a BP target of systolic BP 130 to 150 mm Hg may be reasonable if lower BP causes hypotension or other adverse reactions. The pharmacologic maxim of "start low, go slow, but get there" should be followed. Intensive BP lowering is most appropriate for older adults with high CV risk burden and life expectancy of 3 or more years as those with limited life expectancy may not live long enough to derive benefit, (Table 1).

There are multiple first-line agents for BP treatment: thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blocker. Thiazides have the highest risk of adverse events such as falls, acute renal injury, and should be used with caution. Calcium channel blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blockers may be beneficial in frail older patients, with the latter having a role in increasing lower limb muscle mass. Alpha blockers, such as those commonly used for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men, and diuretics can induce or worsen orthostatic hypotension, increase risk of falls, and hip fracture. Other drugs to be used with caution are clonidine, methyldopa, nifedipine, and reserpine.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (EBB-TBI): protocol for a phase 2a intervention design study [^116gRNB1]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In healthy volunteers, heart rate reduction of 15% induced by esmolol did not alter cerebral blood flow. After ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a 14% reduction in heart rate with esmolol did not increase the incidence of cardiogenic shock or atrioventricular block while limiting the peak cardiac troponin T release. A 20% reduction in heart rate in septic mechanically ventilated patients did not alter oxygen utilization or hepatic or leg blood flow. Evidence relating to the ideal target heart rate in severe TBI is conflicting.

We aim to administer esmolol as soon as practicable after injury to achieve early blockade of the hyperadrenergic surge accompanying the head trauma and interruption of self-perpetuating pathophysiological cascades before secondary injury is established. Observational data show catecholamine related pathophysiology at the time of hospital admission for TBI. The duration of the infusion is limited to 4 days from enrollment. This translates into an intervention period that spans the time of initial development of cerebral edema after injury. This regimen is therefore based on a combination of clinical judgment of the time of greatest sympathetic activation with knowledge of the typical course of intracranial hypertension. It allows the primary research question for this study to be answered at the time of greatest potential hemodynamic instability without unnecessarily prolonged exposure to a drug that may not ultimately provide benefit. After this period, the continued use of esmolol or any other selective or nonselective beta-blocker is at the discretion of the treating clinician. To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature examining the optimal timing of administration of beta-blockers after traumatic, ischemic, or septic insult.

### Effect of propranolol and clonidine after severe traumatic brain injury: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^114eswBj]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combined adrenergic blockade with propranolol and clonidine in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Background

Administration of adrenergic blockade after severe TBI is common. To date, no prospective trial has rigorously evaluated this common therapy for benefit.

Methods

This phase II, single-center, double-blinded, pilot randomized placebo-controlled trial included patients aged 16–64 years with severe TBI (intracranial hemorrhage and Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) within 24 h of ICU admission. Patients received propranolol and clonidine or double placebo for 7 days. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days. Secondary outcomes included catecholamine levels, hospital length of stay, mortality, and long-term functional status. A planned futility assessment was performed mid-study.

Results

Dose compliance was 99%, blinding was intact, and no open-label agents were used. No treatment patient experienced dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest. The study was stopped for futility after enrolling 47 patients (26 placebo, 21 treatment), per a priori stopping rules. There was no significant difference in VFDs between treatment and control groups [0.3 days, 95% CI (-5.4, 5.8), p = 1.0]. Other than improvement of features related to sympathetic hyperactivity (mean difference in Clinical Features Scale (CFS) 1.7 points, CI (0.4, 2.9), p = 0.012), there were no between-group differences in the secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

Despite the safety and feasibility of adrenergic blockade with propranolol and clonidine after severe TBI, the intervention did not alter the VFD outcome. Given the widespread use of these agents in TBI care, a multi-center investigation is warranted to determine whether adrenergic blockade is of therapeutic benefit in patients with severe TBI. Trial Registration Number NCT01322048.

### The Japan morning surge-1 (JMS-1) study: protocol description [^1135BptQ]. Hypertension Research (2006). Low credibility.

Morning blood pressure is reported to be more closely related to hypertensive organ damages such as left ventricular mass index, microalbuminuria and silent cerebral infarcts, than blood pressure at other times of the day. Morning blood pressure may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertensive target organ damage. Increased sympathetic nerve activity is reported to be one of the mechanisms of morning hypertension; however, there are no available data that show whether strict home blood pressure control, especially in the morning period, can reduce target organ damage. The Japan Morning Surge-1 (JMS-1) study includes hypertensive outpatients with elevated morning systolic blood pressure (≥ 135 mmHg) as assessed by self-measured blood pressure monitoring at home. All enrolled patients are under stable antihypertensive medication status. Exclusion criteria are arrhythmia, chronic inflammatory disease, and taking alpha-blockers or beta-blockers. The target number of patients to be enrolled in the JMS-1 study is 600, and the aim is to evaluate differences in the markers of hypertensive target organ damage, such as brain natriuretic peptide and the urinary albumin excretion/creatinine ratio. All of the patients are randomized to an experimental group or a control group, with randomization to be carried out by telephone interviews with the patients' physicians. In the experimental group, patients begin taking additional antihypertensive medication just before going to bed. This consists of doxazosin 1 mg/day, which then is increased to 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day, with a beta-blocker added after a 1-month interval until the morning systolic blood pressure is controlled to less than 135 mmHg. Patients in the control group continue the treatment they are receiving at the enrollment for 6 months. Blood pressure levels, adverse effects, and hypertensive target organ damage before and after the study are evaluated. In the JMS-1 study, we will evaluate whether strict morning blood pressure control by sympathetic nervous system blockade using an alpha-blocker, doxazosin, and with the addition of a beta-blocker if needed, can reduce hypertensive target organ damage.

### Effect of propranolol and clonidine after severe traumatic brain injury: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^113ragUu]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is feasible to conduct a rigorous double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of adrenergic blockade in young severe TBI patients without major adverse cardiovascular effects despite a complex ICU environment and drug administration schedule, while achieving long-term functional and neurocognitive follow-up. The practical execution of this single-center trial should support multi-center investigation powered for mortality and balanced for unmeasured confounders to determine whether the widespread practice of adrenergic blockade has any benefit after severe TBI.

### High-dose dexmedetomidine-induced hypertension in a child with traumatic brain injury [^114rTmq9]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist which is currently FDA-approved for the short-term (less than 24 h) sedation of adults during mechanical ventilation.

Discussion

Given its beneficial physiologic properties, there has been increasing use of this agent in the pediatric population. As with any agent used for sedation in the Pediatric ICU setting, dose escalations may be necessary. Unlike benzodiazepines and opioids, there are limited data regarding the administration of dexmedetomidine above the current package insert dosing recommendations of 0.7 microg/kg/h.

Results

We report a 2-year-old child with traumatic brain injury who developed hypertension following the administration of a dexmedetomidine infusion at 4 microg/kg/h for several hours. Investigation into the etiology of the hypertension was negative and the blood pressure returned to baseline with a decrease in the infusion rate.

Conclusion

Subsequent to this, no further issues with hypertension were noted.

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kENoJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed current available evidence for the utility of beta blockers in TBI to reduce mortality and improve functional outcome. Our meta-analyses showed that patients who received beta blockers during their hospital admission exhibited lower mortality rates and better functional outcome, though at the cost of an increased risk of cardiopulmonary and infectious complications. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the need for a larger scale, RCT to further clarify the benefit and safety of in-hospital initiation of beta blockers in TBI.

The proposed explanation for the benefit of beta blockers in TBI is based on the assumed reduction in secondary injury by limiting the catecholamine surge. The catecholamine surge is well documented to occur up to 10 days after the injury and increases cerebral edema, hypoxia, and neural apoptosis. Preventing the resultant secondary injury leads to decreased mortality and improved functional outcome, which are the main goals of TBI management. Propranolol administration in rodent TBI models increases cerebral perfusion, decreases hypoxia, and improves cerebral glucose metabolism in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, knockout mice lacking beta-adrenergic receptors demonstrate less motor deficiency after head trauma. Although not officially included in the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, and despite the lack of high-quality data, several societies conditionally recommend beta blocker use in patients with severe TBI with no existing contraindications, provided that beta-blocker-related complications (eg, hypotension or bradycardia) do not occur. According to our summation of the current human data, use of beta blocker in hospitals is associated with decreased all-cause in-hospital mortality in patients with TBI. This was a pooled analysis of anyone who received a beta blocker at all during their hospital stay. However, when we separated the available data for patients who had started a beta blocker for the first time post injury and those who had been maintained on a beta blocker before their injury, the mortality benefit was no longer seen in either group. Although it is an interesting question whether the total length of beta-blocker therapy has an impact on mortality and what effect preinjury beta blocker has on outcomes, our findings do not suggest any definitive conclusion regarding this. It is possible that the proposed blunting of the catecholamine surge occurs more effectively with longer-term beta-blocker therapy prior to the injury and that acute initiation has less of an impact. However, our data presented here are not without significant bias. Relative to the total amount of patients in the overall analysis, very few data points were available for the subgroups. Few studies included analysis specifically on beta blockers initiated post injury. Instead, the majority of studies broadly included any and all patients who received one or more doses of beta blocker at any point during their admission, which leads to considerable variability and limits what effect we can reasonably attribute to the beta blockers themselves, no matter when they were started. Additionally, all of the studies in this subgroup analysis had a high risk of bias and were overall low quality as per the GRADE assessment.

### Acute management of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury [^115wn8hf]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to be a major public health problem. Proposed treatments have not withstood testing in clinical trials because of failure to account for different types of TBI and other weaknesses in trial design. Management goals continue to be prevention and prompt treatment of secondary insults (hypotension, hypoxia, and other physiologic derangements). This goal is best accomplished by careful attention to airway, breathing, circulation, and basic principles of intensive care unit management. Attempts to intervene prophylactically to prevent intracranial hypertension or other complications have not been beneficial and may even have deleterious effects.

Management of posttraumatic confusion and agitation — moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) can present with posttraumatic confusion and agitation, and agitation is common, occurring in approximately 40% of patients; acute use of benzodiazepines and typical antipsychotic medications is not recommended because evidence suggests it can protract neurocognitive recovery, while atypical antipsychotics, as well as beta blockers such as propranolol, can be considered as an alternative in the acute phases of agitation to ensure safety for patients and staff, alongside multidisciplinary rehabilitation approaches that increase patient engagement in rehabilitation, minimize dependency, improve safety, and limit the need for pharmacologic interventions.

### Beta-adrenergic blockade for attenuation of catecholamine surge after traumatic brain injury: a randomized pilot trial [^114HugJF]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

As the evidence mounts for the protective effect of beta-blockade in TBI, controversy still exists about the best drug to achieve this affect. Zangbar et al performed a propensity matched cohort study with metoprolol compared with no beta-blockers in patients with TBI. One hundred and seventy-eight patients were in each cohort and no differences were found in injury severity, neurosurgical procedures, or HR between the groups. Mortality was decreased by 10% in the metoprolol cohort as compared with no beta-blocker. A randomized study using atenolol demonstrated decreased cardiac enzymes, decreased arrhythmias, and T-wave change potentially showing that the end organ effects of the catecholamine surge were blocked. Multiple additional studies have shown that PRO increases the protective effect as compared with other beta-blockers. Our group compared PRO with other beta-blockers in patients with TBI and found that the absolute mortality reduction compared with other beta-blockers was 12% and the odds of mortality was reduced by over 80% in adjusted analysis. Other authors have confirmed this findingand a recent prospective observational trial presented at the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma also verified this result showing that the risk of mortality in the PRO cohort was reduced by approximately 50% as compared with other beta-blockers (adjusted OR: 0.51).PRO is a lipophilic drug that easily crosses the blood–brain barrier making it an ideal choice in this population. Several studies in the murine model have shown a neurologic benefit in surviving animals in a TBI modeland elucidated a possible mechanism for this benefit. Ley et al also used a murine TBI model and showed that the brain perfusion of PRO-treated mice increased by 152% as compared with control with decreased hypoxic areas on immunohistochemistry staining. It is therefore plausible that the PRO may be decreasing central vasoreactivity potentially caused by the catecholamine surge related to the TBI. This suggested effect may lead to better perfusion of the penumbra around the injury and limit potential secondary injury due to decreased oxygen delivery and hypoxia.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112tSZpH]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Airway and ventilation in traumatic brain injury — early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are recommended for reduced consciousness (GCS < 9), severe agitation, loss of airway protective reflexes, or a GCS > 8 in the presence of thoracic and abdominal injuries; ventilator goals include arterial pH 7.35–7.45, PaCO2 35–45 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation at least 94% (with the text also listing PaCO2 35–40 mm Hg in the absence of intracranial hypertension and/or severe metabolic acidosis). Optimal targets include PaO2 80–100 mm Hg and, in patients who do not have elevated intracranial pressure, PaCO2 35–45 mm Hg. For intracranial hypertension, mild hyperventilation with PaCO2 of 32–35 mm Hg is suggested as a SIBICC Tier-Two treatment, while in refractory severe intracranial hypertension or threatened/actual herniation, reduction of PaCO2 to less than 30 mm Hg may be justified as a temporizing measure. In most instances, moderate PEEP of ≤ 10 cm H2O will not elevate intracranial pressure further in the presence of intracranial hypertension and can be safely applied to maintain oxygenation when accompanied by ICP monitoring. Rescue therapies such as prone positioning, neuromuscular blockers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have not been systematically studied in TBI; apply them cautiously and on an individual basis.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (EBB-TBI): protocol for a phase 2a intervention design study [^113Tg5A2]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health emergency. It is the leading cause of death in young adults, and it is a major cause of death and disability in all ages worldwide. The impact is felt by patients, families, and communities. In the United Kingdom, the annual cost is estimated at £15 billion, with more than 68,000 years of life lost.

Neuroprotection is the preservation, salvage, or recovery of central nervous system function after acute insult. Better neuroprotective strategies would reduce death and disability after TBI. The current management strategies are conservative, relying on provision of physiological stability and timely management of complications (e.g. seizures, intracranial hypertension). There is no proven therapy that provides additional benefit.

There are plausible reasons to consider beta-blockers as potential neuroprotective drugs after TBI. Plasma catecholamine levels correlate with inflammation, endothelial injury, and poor outcome after TBI. In animals, administering beta-blockers after TBI reduced cerebral edema and hypoxia (mice), increased perfusion (mice), and protected cerebral autoregulation (pigs) and it was associated with better recovery (mice).

In patients a number of meta-analyses show that there is potential benefit for beta-blockade in TBI to reduce mortality and improve functional outcomes. However, the studies are heterogenous and largely observational. A few small, randomized trials are supportive but have limited external validity and/or have not been subject to peer review. This means there is still uncertainty about the overall effectiveness of beta-blockade as well as the specifics of patient selection, drug, dose, route, and physiological goal.

Repurposing an established beta-blocker for neuroprotection could significantly improve individuals' health outcomes, reduce the impact on families and communities, and save resources for health systems and societies at a low cost, potentially representing excellent value for money. There is, however, a risk with the use of antihypertensive drugs early after severe TBI; compromising blood pressure maintenance in the group of patients with TBI, for whom hypotension has been called "the single most important secondary insult", could lead to worse outcomes.

### Effect of propranolol and clonidine after severe traumatic brain injury: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^11428VFL]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased intracranial pressure, activation of the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamine response, and major morbidity and mortality. This increased catecholamine response is predictive of length of stay, mechanical ventilation, neurologic outcome, and mortality. Prior retrospective studies, including two from our group, link adrenergic blockade to survival after severe TBI, possibly mediated by dampened sympathetic hyperactivity.

These findings have resulted in an increase in β -blocker use in our institution to greater than 40% in young, severe TBI patients. β -blockade is just one pharmacologic strategy to reduce sympathetic hyperactivity; centrally acting α 2 -agonists also serve as sympatholytic agents. The prototypical centrally acting α 2 -agonist, clonidine, decreases plasma catecholamines and improves outcomes in a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia. Clonidine decreases plasma catecholamines and cerebral vasoconstriction without altering cerebral blood flow in patients with severe TBI.

Despite available cohort and open-label data, rigorous blinded prospective trial evidence remains lacking on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of β -blockers and α 2 -agonists after severe TBI. A 2017 meta-analysis specifically highlighted the poor quality of the literature on this question and the need for high-quality prospective trials investigating beta blockade in TBI patients. We conducted a single-center, double-blind, pilot randomized placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that sympathetic blockade with propranolol and clonidine improves clinical outcomes in severe TBI patients by increasing ventilator-free days, defined as days alive and not on the ventilator, in addition to demonstrating the safety and feasibility of such a trial.

Table 1
Categorisation of the stages of hypertension

Patients with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) demonstrate a more labile haemodynamic profile than their non‐hypertensive counterparts 5. The induction of anaesthesia and airway instrumentation can lead to a pronounced increase in sympathetic activation, which may lead to a significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate. A reduction in systemic vascular resistance soon after the induction of anaesthesia commonly leads to varying degrees of hypotension. Reduction in vascular resistance is multifactorial and may be secondary to loss of the baroreceptor reflex control, central neuraxial blockade, and direct effects of anaesthetic agents. The effect on vascular tone will be exaggerated by 'deep' or excessive anaesthesia and in patients who are fluid‐depleted. This, and the often exaggerated haemodynamic response to surgery, pain and emergence from anaesthesia, have also been described as being more common in the hypertensive population 6. Some researchers have demonstrated an association between pre‐operative hypertension and relatively minor physiological derangements such as intra‐operative hypotension, hypertension and arrhythmia, but studies have not conclusively demonstrated that fluctuations in haemodynamic variables cause clinically significant harm 15. Larger studies to investigate differences between untreated hypertensive patients and those treated (successfully and unsuccessfully) have not demonstrated increased rates of peri‐operative cardiovascular events. However, these findings may not be applicable to current practice, as many of these studies were conducted in the late 1970s 16.

This appreciation of labile haemodynamics in hypertensive patients has led to a number of anaesthetic techniques designed to achieve a more stable haemodynamic profile during surgery. These techniques include co‐induction, invasive arterial monitoring with titrated or prophylactic vasopressor therapy, depth‐of‐anaesthesia monitoring, beta‐blockers and the optimisation of stroke volume with intravascular fluid therapy. The omission of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers, combined with the careful re‐introduction of these drugs after surgery, is common‐place and appears to be associated with fewer significant peri‐operative haemodynamic fluctuations 17. The introduction of peri‐operative beta‐blockade for high cardiac‐risk patients increases postoperative mortality, secondary to hypotension and stroke, albeit with less cardiac injury, as demonstrated in the POISE‐1 study 18. The anaesthetist should be aware that sudden withdrawal of certain antihypertensive agents such as clonidine, alpha‐methyldopa and beta‐blockers can be associated with adverse events. Withdrawal of beta‐blockers may also be associated with myocardial ischaemia that is often silent in the peri‐operative period and easily missed without continuous ECG monitoring and serial serum troponin measurements.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (EBB-TBI): protocol for a phase 2a intervention design study [^116SHAoj]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

With this risk–benefit balance in mind, we designed the Early Beta-Blockade in adults after severe Traumatic Brain Injury (EBB-TBI) program, of which this is the first of three planned studies. The overarching hypothesis of the EBB-TBI program of research is that beta-1 adrenoceptor blockade after severe TBI in adults reduces morbidity and mortality by reducing secondary brain injury driven by the hyperadrenergic state. Here, we describe the protocol for the first study. We use methodology common to early phase drug studies to test escalating starting doses for esmolol infusion in small cohorts of patients with an end point of heart rate control without compromise of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The aim is to optimize the intervention with esmolol so it can then be tested in subsequent trials of efficacy and effectiveness.

Rationale for Choice of Esmolol and Dosing Regimen

There are several characteristics of esmolol that are well suited to use for beta-blockade in the early phase of critical illness. First and foremost, the rapid onset (time to steady state of action of 5 min), facilitates titration to the desired clinical end points. This, coupled with the short elimination half-life of 9 min, means rapid offset of effect if reduced or stopped for adverse events. The drug has few interactions with other medications beyond the general class effects of beta-1 selective-blockers. It is metabolized to inactive compounds, and this is independent of organ function. The intravenous route of administration bypasses the gut and guarantees drug delivery in a population where gastric emptying is frequently delayed. Finally, it is inexpensive, in common use in intensive care units (ICUs), and straightforward in its preparation and administration (e.g. it is stable at room temperature for up to 24 h, protection from light is not required, and it can be administered via peripheral venous access).

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113c5yUk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with nearly one-half of all trauma-related deaths involving head injuries. Head injuries are associated with significant morbidity, long-term disability, and economic burden. The major focus of TBI management is on limiting secondary injury, which is the expansion of the injured territory by physiological responses. After primary injury, there is a disruption in cerebral blood flow leading to anoxia and edema, subsequent neuronal cell death, further deterioration, and eventual neurodegeneration. Secondary injury can develop for the days and weeks after the initial insult and is a major contributor to subsequent brain damage and overall outcome. Unfortunately, few strategies exist to mitigate this process. No therapeutic intervention has been approved to prevent progression of secondary neural injury, leaving a great need for optimization of treatment options to improve outcomes in patients with TBI.

Catecholamines are an integral part of the neuroendocrine-immune inflammatory network and are markers of TBI functional outcome and mortality. The catecholamine surge is a well-documented process after TBI where the circulating levels of these neurotransmitters increase in correlation with the severity of the injury. This can persist for more than 10 days, leading to inflammation and apoptosis of neural cells, thus contributing to secondary injury.

Although the exact mechanism is not yet known, beta blockers have shown promise in improving patient outcomes after TBI. The hypothesized mechanism is related to the catecholamine surge, such that beta blockade may reduce the actions of catecholamines after TBI and therefore reduce or slow the progression of secondary injury. In humans, a recent meta-analysis summarizing the available clinical data established lower mortality with beta blockade and conditionally recommends the use of in-hospital beta blockers after TBI in adult patients, with an emphasis on holding beta blockers to avoid bradycardia and hypotension. Propranolol, in particular, has shown a lower mortality rate even when compared with other beta blockers. However, the objective of trauma care is not limited to survival and acute management, but rather includes functional recovery and reintegration into work and community settings. Although a reduction in mortality rate may be beneficial on its own, there exists the possibility that improved patient survival comes at the cost of increased incidence of severe debilitation. Although the use of beta blockers in patients with TBI has been investigated for years, there is a lack of consensus on the effect of beta blockers on functional outcome. Although there are recent meta-analyses on this subject, there is a need for more rigorous analysis and quality assessment of available evidence.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^112TgsE6]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is devastating for patients and families and imposes a significant burden on society. The primary injury, suffered at impact, cannot be altered by medical intervention. Secondary injury, developing minutes, hours, and days after the event, can be improved by medical treatment. Mitigation of secondary injury should reduce death, disability, and economic cost after TBI. Current mitigation strategies are conservative, emphasizing physiological stability and prevention or early treatment of complications such as seizures or intracranial hypertension. Additional neuroprotective interventions remain as yet unproven.

The stress response to trauma includes activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal glands, producing a surge in circulating catecholamines to support blood pressure and cardiac output. However high and/or prolonged levels of circulating catecholamines can have adverse effects. The shock-induced endotheliopathy paradigm holds that these high levels of catecholamines damage vascular endothelium, resulting in increased vascular permeability, thrombosis, and inflammation. In the cerebral circulation, damage predisposes to the development of edema, neuroinflammation, and possibly impaired neurovascular regulation, all of which contribute to secondary brain injury.

In TBI, plasma catecholamine levels correlate with endothelial injury, inflammation, neurological deficit, and outcome. In animals, beta-blockers after TBI reduce cerebral edema, preserve autoregulation, and are associated with improved recovery. Prospective studies in humans are supportive but are relatively small, using heterogenous regimens of drugs, doses, durations, and combinations, and have limited external validity. Meta-analyses show a reduction in mortality and improvement in long-term functional outcomes at the cost of longer hospital stays and increased infectious and cardiopulmonary complications.

Having been in use since the 1960s, beta-blockers are familiar drugs in intensive care with well-described actions and side effects. They are low cost and have widespread availability. Esmolol specifically is titratable, combining rapid onset of action (and potential neuroprotection) with rapid offset (if side effects occur). This potentially enables early use within hours of trauma, balancing possible benefit against the risk of compromising physiological stability.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^1168BQs7]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the evidence and changes from prior edition: There are no content changes from the 3rd Edition to the recommendations (although wording revisions were made), and newly identified Class 3 studies have been added to the evidence but did not change the recommendations. The research on this topic has focused on three questions regarding prophylactic barbiturates, reduction of intracranial hypertension, and sedatives improving outcomes, yet the Class 2 evidence is limited to a single, comparatively small study for each question. While one Class 3 study in the 3rd Edition and four additional Class 3 studies were identified for this update, they all had serious flaws or null findings; therefore, the body of evidence on which the recommendations are based remains the Class 2 studies. The quality of the body of evidence is considered low, as a new larger study could change the conclusions, and this evidence underpinned the 3rd Edition recommendations, which were retained in this 4th Edition.

Results

Study characteristics

From 7922 relevant citations, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria (2 prospective, 2 RCTs, and 13 retrospective). A PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection is illustrated in figure 1. A total of 13 244 patients were included in this review. From the 17 studies, 4533 received beta blockers and 8711 did not receive beta blockers. Detailed study characteristics of included studies are reported in table 1. Average age was 51.1 ± 8.1 for those receiving beta blockers and 45.7 ± 11.0 for those who did not. Penetrating injuries were reported in 12 studies, with a total of 301 subjects suffering from penetrating injury (145 beta blockers and 156 controls). Neurosurgical intervention occurred in 947 patients in the beta-blocker group (18%) and 873 controls (11%), including external ventricular drain or intracranial pressure monitor insertion, craniotomy, or craniectomy. The majority of studies (11 of 17) broadly included all patients who received at least one dose of any beta blocker while in the hospital. Only three studies included information on specific dosing.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^115tydbR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

As increasing CPP can lower ICP if static pressure autoregulation (sPAR) is intact, the CWG recommended a simplified method of testing sPAR status based on that of Rosenthal et al. When CPP is above the lower breakpoint of sPAR and is then raised, the vasoconstriction attendant to active autoregulation decreases cerebral blood volume. This can be observed if the responses are trended, or by comparing the relevant parameters (i.e. ICP, MAP, and CPP) at the beginning and end of the test. As MAP elevation with disrupted sPAR may worsen intracranial hypertension, a practitioner capable of interpreting the results and halting the study should perform the test. If the trial is positive, judgment is required as to whether the benefit of the ICP decrease justifies the risks inherent to pharmacologically raising MAP. Cautious interpretation and application of the results of the MAP Challenge are recommended, as the test results may not be simple to interpret and the status of cerebral pressure autoregulation may not be stable.

The MAP Challenge is performed under stable conditions; to prevent confounding, no other active changes in care should be made during the challenge (including adjustments in sedation, analgesia, EVD drainage or other physiological parameters). To perform the challenge:
Record baseline monitor parameters at the beginning of the challenge (e.g. ICP, MAP and CPP).
Initiate or titrate a vasopressor to increase the MAP by 10 mmHg for up to 20 min.
Observe the interaction between the MAP, ICP, and CPP during the challenge.
Record monitor parameters at the end of the challenge.
Evaluate the observed responses and recorded values for evidence of sPAR status. Disrupted sPAR will present as a sustained increase in ICP with MAP elevation.
Adjust the target MAP back to baseline (disrupted sPAR) or to the chosen new, elevated target (intact sPAR).

Tier-three

Tier-three treatments have the greatest associated risks. The initiation of high-dose barbiturate therapy should be based on the response to a test dose. The CWG recommended EEG monitoring if barbiturates are continued and not titrating the dose upwards if burst suppression occurs, as further reduction in ICP is not anticipated and toxicity increases with dose. The endpoint of barbiturate treatment is ICP control not serum levels or EEG response. Hypotension must be avoided. The CWG supported use of mild hypothermia (35–36 °C) but not routine therapeutic hypothermia to below 35 °C due to systemic complications. The CWG recommended decompressive craniectomy with recognition of the indications and hazards demonstrated by recent RCTs.

### Metoprolol improves survival in severe traumatic brain injury independent of heart rate control [^116gLje7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple prior studies have suggested an association between survival and beta-blocker administration in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is unknown whether this benefit of beta-blockers is dependent on heart rate control. The aim of this study was to assess whether rate control affects survival in patients receiving metoprolol with severe TBI. Our hypothesis was that improved survival from beta-blockade would be associated with a reduction in heart rate.

Methods

We performed a 7-y retrospective analysis of all blunt TBI patients at a level-1 trauma center. Patients aged > 16 y with head abbreviated injury scale 4 or 5, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room or emergency room (ER), were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: metoprolol and no beta-blockers. Using propensity score matching, we matched the patients in two groups in a 1:1 ratio controlling for age, gender, race, admission vital signs, Glasgow coma scale, injury severity score, mean heart rate monitored during ICU admission, and standard deviation of heart rate during the ICU admission. Our primary outcome measure was mortality.

Results

A total of 914 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 189 received beta-blockers. A propensity-matched cohort of 356 patients (178: metoprolol and 178: no beta-blockers) was created. Patients receiving metoprolol had higher survival than those patients who did not receive beta-blockers (78% versus 68%; P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in the mean heart rate (89.9 ± 13.9 versus 89.9 ± 15; P = 0.99). Nor was there a difference in the mean of standard deviation of the heart rates (14.7 ± 6.3 versus 14.4 ± 6.5; P = 0.65) between the two groups. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients who received metoprolol had a survival advantage (P = 0.011) compared with patients who did not receive any beta-blockers.

Conclusions

Our study shows an association with improved survival in patients with severe TBI receiving metoprolol, and this effect appears to be independent of any reduction in heart rate. We suggest that beta-blockers should be administered to all severe TBI patients irregardless of any perceived beta-blockade effect on heart rate.

### Beta blockers in traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114prXJs]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations of this study are largely due to the number of available studies on this topic, as well as the quality of the literature. Limited number of studies were available for high-yield analysis of functional outcome, further complicated by the variability in reporting of good functional outcome. Studies were predominantly retrospective cohort analyses, limiting our ability to make definitive conclusions due to inherent lack of prospective data collection and blinding. Observational studies are by definition low quality, and in our case, this was further lowered by the serious risk of bias, inconsistency, an imprecision of the included studies. There were only two RCTs available, of which neither were blinded and both had small sample sizes, and therefore were weighted very low in our analysis. Additionally, most studies did not include subset analyses for suspected confounding factors such as premorbid patient conditions, time of beta-blocker initiation within hospital, beta-blocker therapy prior to their injury, or the need for surgical intervention. A small proportion of studies did identify an inherent difference between patients who received beta blockers compared with those who did not. For example, patients receiving beta blockers tended to be older and have more severe injuries. However, subgroup outcomes stratified by these confounders were not provided to allow for an adjusted analysis in our case; therefore, our analysis is based on unadjusted mortality. Some studies did not assess isolated TBI but rather included all multisystem trauma patients. Although beta blockers could be beneficial for all general trauma patients, this is a significant confounder when trying to assess the effect on TBI alone. For example, Khalili et al did not find a benefit of beta blockers in all multisystem trauma patients, but their subgroup analysis did reveal a survival benefit of propranolol in patients with isolated severe TBI. Few studies included specific information about the dosing, time of initiation, duration, and type of beta blocker used. For those that did, there was substantial variability between studies in all of these factors. For example, some studies included patients in their beta-blocker cohort who received only one dose of beta blocker during their entire hospital stay, and timing of initiation varied from 24 hours post injury to up to 30 days after admission. Overall, there was wide variability in the methods of patient selection and beta-blocker administration, resulting in significant heterogeneity between studies. Additionally, although we attempt here to consider complications and assess long-term outcomes between groups, this is challenging to accomplish. If beta blockers do in fact decrease mortality, then patients who survive most likely will require a longer hospital stay and thus are at increased risk of inherent complications of hospital admission. Therefore, the benefit of beta blockers may lead to additional complications due to patients surviving who would have otherwise died.

### Hypotension and adverse outcomes in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury… [^1171xaov]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

These findings highlight the importance of blood pressure management in TBI settings. Importance Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Hypotension in patients with TBI is associated with poorer outcomes. A comprehensive review examining adverse outcomes of hypotension in patients with TBI is needed. In comparison, SBP greater than 90 mm Hg was associated with lower odds of mortality. Adjustment for hypoxia as a comorbidity decreased the aOR from 2. 23 to 2.
11. Using subgroup analysis of the primary outcome, we identified important underlying variables contributing to mortality of patients with TBI and hypotension, supporting the multifactorial nature of hypotension in patient outcomes. Hypotension using a 90 mm Hg threshold showed significantly increased 2. 64-fold odds for mortality.

Meanwhile, a BP threshold set higher than 90 mm Hg showed mortality odds of 1. 58, a 60% reduction, once again emphasizing the need to avoid lower than 90 mm Hg for treatment of patients with TBI. To specifically assess the appropriateness of Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for BP management, an analysis of SBP threshold of 100 mm Hg and 110 mm Hg was performed and demonstrated ORs of 1. 65 and

1. 48, respectively, representing a significant improvement in odds compared with a threshold of 90 mm Hg. Hypoxia is a known secondary injury in TBI that contributes to worse outcomes. 2 Including adjusted effect estimates for hypoxia, other potential confounders, and publication bias still resulted in 1. 87 times higher odds of mortality in these patients with hypotension. By combining the outcomes of 51 studies with a total sample size of more than 380 000 patients, our study reinforces the observed association between hypotension in patients with TBI and mortality.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 380 000 patients with moderate to severe TBI, we found significant association of mortality following hypotension. Our findings suggest that management guidelines should reinforce the need to aggressively treat hypotension and maintain BP within reference range in patients with TBI to prevent mortality.

### Beta blockers for acute traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178ENES]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a systemic hyperadrenergic state. Through activation of beta adrenoreceptors, catecholamines may induce hypermetabolism and increase both cardiac and cerebral oxygen demands. We conducted a systematic review to appraise the available evidence examining the safety and efficacy of beta blockers in patients with acute TBI.

Methods

We systematically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the reference lists of relevant articles from database inception until March 19, 2013. The outcomes assessed were in-hospital mortality, functional outcome and quality of life. Common adverse effects of beta blockers were examined including clinically significant hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm and congestive heart failure. Data on study outcomes and quality were abstracted in duplicate. The results were summarized descriptively and quantitatively.

Results

One randomized controlled trial was found with a high risk of bias. Eight retrospective cohort studies were found with a moderate risk of bias; however, only four of these studies were identified as unique after excluding overlapping cases. The cohort studies reported mortality outcomes; however, none of these included studies assessed functional outcomes or quality of life. Meta-analysis on the cohort studies (n = 4,782 patients) demonstrated that exposure to beta blockers after TBI was associated with a reduction in the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality by 65% (pooled adjusted odds ratio 0.35; 95% CI 0.27–0.45).

Conclusions

The current body of evidence is suggestive of a benefit of beta blockers following TBI. However, methodologically sound randomized controlled trials are indicated to confirm the efficacy of beta blockers in patients with TBI.

### Beta-blocker therapy in severe traumatic brain injury: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^112YjtDH]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational studies have demonstrated improved outcomes in TBI patients receiving in-hospital beta-blockers. The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of beta-blockers on outcomes in TBI patients.

Methods

Adult patients with severe TBI (intracranial AIS ≥ 3) were included in the study. Hemodynamically stable patients at 24 h after injury were randomized to receive either 20 mg propranolol orally every 12 h up to 10 days or until discharge (BB+) or no propranolol (BB-). Outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) score on discharge and at 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analysis including only isolated severe TBI (intracranial AIS ≥ 3 with extracranial AIS ≤ 2) was carried out. Poisson regression models were used.

Results

Two hundred nineteen randomized patients of whom 45% received BB were analyzed. There were no significant demographic or clinical differences between BB + and BB - cohorts. No significant difference in in-hospital mortality (adj. IRR 0.6 [95% CI 0.3–1.4], p = 0.2) or long-term functional outcome was measured between the cohorts (p = 0.3). One hundred fifty-four patients suffered isolated severe TBI of whom 44% received BB. The BB + group had significantly lower mortality relative to the BB - group (18.6% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.012). On regression analysis, propranolol had a significant protective effect on in-hospital mortality (adj. IRR 0.32, p = 0.04) and functional outcome at 6-month follow-up (GOS-E ≥ 5 adj. IRR 1.2, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Propranolol decreases in-hospital mortality and improves long-term functional outcome in isolated severe TBI. This randomized trial speaks in favor of routine administration of beta-blocker therapy as part of a standardized neurointensive care protocol.

Level Of Evidence

Level II; therapeutic.

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries? [^116NTVVW]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The exposure to pre-admission β-blockers significantly reduces the risk of developing depression by a factor of three up to 1 year following severe traumatic extracranial injury. Further investigation is needed to explore whether β-blockade in these instances may have a prophylactic, or possibly therapeutic, role.

### Association of preinjury beta-blocker exposure with brain injury biomarkers following traumatic brain injury [^112EXUwr]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Beta-blockers have been studied for their impact on traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aimed to examine the association of preinjury beta-blocker exposure with early brain injury biomarker levels and outcomes following TBI.

Methods

We retrospectively studied adults (≥ 40 y) participating in the Transforming Clinical Research and Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study. The exposure was preinjury beta-blocker utilization. Primary outcome was blood-based brain injury biomarker levels on day 1 following injury. Secondary outcomes included biomarkers on days 3 and 5, hospital mortality, and the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. Inverse probability-weighted models assessed the association between preinjury beta-blocker exposure, biomarker levels, and outcomes, stratified by TBI severity.

Results

A total of 1185 patients were included, with 101 on preinjury beta-blockers (BB+): 21 in the moderate/severe group and 80 in the mild TBI group. BB+patients were older than BB- in both mild (67 vs. 57 y, P < 0.001) and moderate/severe TBI (64 vs. 56 y, P = 0.003). Hypertension was more common in BB+patients (78% mild, 67% moderate/severe, P < 0.001). Preinjury beta-blocker use was not associated with day 1 biomarker levels. The 6-month GOSE scores in the BB+ moderate/severe TBI were lower, but the effect was marginal (B = -1.20, 95% CI: -2.39 to -0.01, P = 0.049).

Conclusion

Our study did not find a clear association between preinjury beta-blocker exposure and day 1 blood-based brain injury biomarkers or clinical outcomes. These findings warrant confirmation in future studies with larger cohorts.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^117MepWu]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

ASSESSING AND TREATING HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive emergencies classically occur in patients with systolic BP (SBP) > 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 120 mm Hg. Nevertheless, lower thresholds can be associated with hypertensive emergencies in the setting of rapid elevations from low-to-normal baseline BP. Furthermore, BP elevations > 170/100 mm Hg can cause worsening target-organ injury in select patients. Elevated BP values in isolation, no matter how high they may be, do not by themselves define a hypertensive emergency unless the patient has concomitant acute organ injury for which immediate BP lowering will modify this injury. Thus, terms such as "hypertensive crisis", which have been historically assigned to all patients with markedly elevated BP have little utility in contemporary practice. New or worsening end-organ injury occurs in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, hematologic, and renovascular systems. The most common hypertensive emergencies are stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and acute heart failure leading to pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare and poorly understood condition that may reflect direct adverse acute effects of markedly elevated BP on the brain.

Most ED patients with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg have elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. These patients have no immediate indication for rapid BP lowering. Though a common concern among ED providers, hypertensive emergency is rare in patients with elevated BP in the ED. Thus, while all hypertensive emergencies should be managed with intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy to achieve immediate BP reduction, few patients require such intervention. Beyond hypertensive emergency, IV antihypertensive therapy is only indicated for select patients with strict oral medication restrictions and patients abruptly withdrawing from beta-blockade or sympatholytic therapy. These latter patients may benefit from IV labetalol. Given the aforementioned variability in clinical practice, it is not surprising that the majority of IV medications given to achieve immediate BP reduction in the ED are done so inappropriately to patients without new or worsening end-organ injury that can be modified by rapid treatment.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^111nZNcX]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury — systolic blood pressure (SBP) hypotension threshold reconsideration is supported by two new Class 3 studies, including a prospective single Level 1 trauma center study (N = 60) and a retrospective individual patient data analysis (N = 6,801) from three observational studies and eight RCTs (IMPACT database), and findings from both studies "suggested that the previously-defined SBP level for hypotension of below 90 mm Hg should be re-examined, and that maintenance of higher levels might result in better outcomes".

### Traumatic brain injury and β-blockers: not all drugs are created equal [^114YMmHF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dysautonomia in traumatic brain injury patients may contribute to secondary injury. We hypothesize that propranolol is the best β-blocker (BB) to block the excess catecholamines and improve mortality in this patient population.

Methods

Patients with traumatic brain injury admitted during a 48-month period who received BB were compared with those who did not after excluding patients who received preinjury BB, deaths within 48 hours, and head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of less than 3 or greater than 5. In addition, propranolol was also compared with all other BBs.

Results

A total of 1,755 patients with traumatic brain injury were identified during the study period after exclusions. Patients who received BB (427) were older (49 years vs. 40 years; p < 0.0001), were more severely injured (Injury Severity Score [ISS], 30 vs. 24; p < 0.001), and had a more severe head injury (head AIS score, 4.2 vs. 4.0; p < 0.001). By univariate analysis, BB patients had a higher mortality (13% vs. 6%; p < 0.001); after adjusted analysis, no difference was identified (adjusted odds ratio, 0.850; 95% confidence interval, 0.536–1.348). Seventy-eight patients (18%) received propranolol during the study period. Propranolol patients were younger (30 years vs. 53 years; p < 0.001) but more severely injured (ISS, 33 vs. 29; p = 0.01; head AIS, 4.5 vs. 4.2; p < 0.001), with longer stay (44 days vs. 26 days, p < 0.001). Mortality was less in the propranolol group (3% vs. 15%, p = 0.002). Adjusted analysis confirmed the protective effect of propranolol (adjusted odds ratio, 0.199; 95% confidence interval, 0.043–0.920).

Conclusion

Propranolol is the best BB to limit secondary injury and decrease mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic, study level III.

### Pathophysiology of acute lung injury in patients with acute brain injury: the triple-hit hypothesis [^111UXm8q]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of ALI in patients with ABI

The blast injury theory

One of the most proposed theories to explain the pathophysiology of ALI in brain-injured patients is the "blast injury" hypothesis, which proposes that the sympathetic surge following a sudden rise in intracranial pressure triggers a temporary increase in intravascular pressure, leading to the disruption of the alveolo-capillary membrane. The development of NPO can be attributed to either hydrostatic forces, as indicated by a low pulmonary/plasma protein ratio, or high permeability mechanisms, supported by an increased accumulation of protein in the extravascular space of the lungs. The connection between the significant sympathetic discharge and NPO is further substantiated by experimental research, which demonstrates that administering alpha-adrenergic antagonists to brain-injured rats before the onset of injury prevents the hypertensive response and mitigates subsequent lung damage (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Schematic representation of the "triple-hit" hypothesis. The initial brain injury sets off sympathetic hyperactivity and catecholamine storm, a well-established contributor to ALI. Furthermore, the direct consequences of ABI, characterized by inflammation and oxidative stress (termed the "first hit"), render the lungs susceptible to subsequent interventions like MV, infections, and surgery (referred to as the "second hit"). Notably, the pivotal role of the gut–lung axis in respiratory health reveals that dysbiosis and intestinal dysfunction in ABI patients initiate a sequence of events involving immune dysregulation and microbiome alterations, which subsequently impact the lung tissue. This activation of the gut–lung axis constitutes the "third hit", culminating in the onset or exacerbation of ALI. ABI: Acute brain injury; ALI: Acute lung injury; ARDS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome; CAP: Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; E/NE: Epinephrine/norepinephrine; HPA: Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal; MV: Mechanical ventilation

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^116ydc8s]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) blood pressure background — The level of systolic blood pressure (SBP) has long been felt to play a critical role in the secondary injury cascade after severe TBI, and as early as 1989, Klauber et al. reported a mortality of 35% in patients admitted with a SBP < 85 mm Hg, compared with only 6% in patients with a higher SBP. The traditional definition of hypotension has been a SBP < 90 mm Hg, although the literature now supports a higher level that may vary by age, and the interrelationship between SBP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) should be kept in mind when considering thresholds.

Outlook and Future Perspectives

When contemplating the future perspective of managing patients with TBI, it is increasingly recognized that conducting research is crucial for developing a nuanced understanding of the parameters to focus on over time, particularly within specific patient populations. To improve patient outcomes, embracing a "proactive" strategy is advocated to reduce the incidence of secondary brain injuries. The integrated utilization of neuromonitoring modalities alongside systemic variables, such as ABP/CPP, allows for a thorough and personalized approach over time. The prevailing trend in reviews and guidelines underscores the significance of tailored treatment options, endorsing personalized ABP/CPP targets that align with the individual patient's specific status and requirements. The ongoing discussion revolves around the uncertainty of whether these targets should be derived from continuous "single" parameters that are widely available and well-understood (such as ICP, CPP, and associated autoregulation or reactivity indices) or from a "multimodal" brain monitoring approach encompassing (changes in) cerebral volume, cerebral oxygenation, cerebral metabolism, and cortical activity. One prominent challenge is the lack of universally standardized protocols for interpreting and acting upon the physiological values obtained through (multimodal) neuromonitoring. This absence of structured guidelines can result in variability and uncertainty in clinical decision-making, potentially leading to suboptimal patient care. Moreover, interpreting neuromonitoring data can be complex and may require a high level of expertise, which is not always readily available in every clinical setting. For example, the Continuous Cerebral Autoregulation Monitoring in the Clinical Practice of Neurocritical Care and Anesthesia network was recently launched. The initiative calls for a strong effort by a group of clinical experts to transform the plausible benefits of autoregulation monitoring and guided treatments — already in use at some centers — into a more standardized and RCT-validated clinical reality. It is crucial to emphasize that the current implementation of "autoregulation-guided ABP/CPP management" does not directly augment the autoregulatory function itself. Instead, it suggests that patients are moved toward a potentially "safer" zone within the autoregulatory spectrum, commonly referred to as the "middle of the cerebral autoregulation plateau or Lassen plateau". The direct enhancement of autoregulatory function, particularly in terms of smooth muscle cell function, remains a subject largely confined to investigative efforts.

### Fentanyl citrate (Sublimaze) [^115XZanR]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Adequate facilities should be available for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of SUBLIMAZE. Where moderate or high doses are used (above 10 mcg/kg), there must be adequate facilities for postoperative observation, and ventilation if necessary, of patients who have received SUBLIMAZE. It is essential that these facilities be fully equipped to handle all degrees of respiratory depression.

SUBLIMAZE may also produce other signs and symptoms characteristic of narcotic analgesics including euphoria, miosis, bradycardia and bronchoconstriction.

Severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO inhibitors has been reported for other narcotic analgesics. Although this has not been reported for fentanyl, there are insufficient data to establish that this does not occur with fentanyl. Therefore, when fentanyl is administered to patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, appropriate monitoring and ready availability of vasodilators and beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension is indicated.

Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure

SUBLIMAZE should be used with caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible to respiratory depression, such as comatose patients who may have a head injury or brain tumor. In addition, SUBLIMAZE may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury.

### Early intravenous beta-blockade with esmolol in adults with severe traumatic brain injury: a phase 2a intervention design study [^115zZUgw]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a larger observational study from the United States, esmolol use was reported in 7% of the 1120 patients (from a cohort of 2337) receiving any beta-blocker for any usual indication rather than for neuroprotection during an ICU stay. Only 38% of patients had severe head injury (GCS score ≤ 8). No esmolol-specific outcomes were reported, although both beta-1 selective and all beta-blocker use were associated with reduced 30-day mortality. Our study adds data on longer-term mortality associated with esmolol in a more severely injured cohort.

Early administration of beta-blockade with titration to heart rate was tested in a randomized controlled trial of metoprolol, another beta-1 selective beta-blocker, in 60 patients in Egypt. In this study, reductions in mortality (seen in patients > 40 years old only) and ICU length of stay and improvement in Glasgow Outcome Scale scores at 1 month were shown in the intervention group. Outcomes were better in those achieving the fixed heart rate target of 60–70 beats per minute early, though this was not further defined. Dose titration was made on a 6-h cycle. Baseline heart rates, time taken to achieve target, and other hemodynamic data are not available in the study report. We have shown that use of an intravenous drug with titration every 30 min allows rapid target attainment. Whether this translates into greater benefit and whether a relative or an absolute heart rate target is preferable requires further research.

Conclusions

We have shown that early beta-blockade with esmolol in adults after severe TBI is feasible and may be associated with a mortality benefit. We have determined a treatment schedule that can be tested for patient benefit in future trials.

### Pharmacological management of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity: a scoping review [^114xkQ8G]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) occurs in ∼10% of patients following acute severe brain injury. While PSH is associated with worse outcomes, there are no clinical practice guidelines to inform treatment. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the pharmacological management of PSH. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to August 2020. Eligible studies met the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials (case control or controlled cohort), observational studies, case series, and case reports; 2) study population of adult and pediatric patients; 3) exposure to an acute neurological insult complicated by PSH (or historic synonym); 4) description of pharmacological treatment of PSH. Our search retrieved 2729 citations with 83 articles assessed for inclusion. After full text extraction, 56 manuscripts inclusive of 459 patients met eligibility criteria. We identified 31 case reports, 15 case series (152 patients), seven retrospective case control or cohort studies (212 patients), and three prospective observational studies (52 patients). Traumatic brain injury was the most common precipitating insult (407 patients), followed by hypoxic encephalopathy (72 patients) and intracranial hemorrhage (10 patients). There were 48 drugs from 22 classes prescribed for the management of PSH. The most frequently prescribed agents were benzodiazepines, β-blockers, opioids, α-2 agonists, and baclofen. However, route and dose of drug and subsequent outcome were inconsistently reported, such that no summary was possible. While a wide variety of drugs have been reported to treat PSH, there is a lack of even moderate-quality evidence to inform clinical decision making.
