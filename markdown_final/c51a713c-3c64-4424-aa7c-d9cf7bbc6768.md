## Question

How is left atrial dysfunction defined?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how left atrial dysfunction is defined. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the normal phasic physiology of the left atrium as the foundation. Then, I should distinguish structural remodeling from true functional impairment. Next, I will review validated measurement modalities and parameters, followed by outcome-anchored quantitative thresholds. After that, I need to verify prognostic independence and clinical relevance. Then, I will synthesize a practical definition with caveats on rhythm and modality. Finally, I should acknowledge current limitations and practice gaps to keep the conclusions balanced and evidence-linked.

> Let me first confirm the physiological scaffold, because if I get the phases wrong, all downstream interpretation will wobble. The left atrium contributes in three coordinated phases: reservoir during ventricular systole, conduit during early diastole, and booster pump with atrial contraction in late diastole, each affecting left ventricular filling mechanics and total stroke volume to varying degrees, and each potentially impaired differentially in disease states.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions and equate bigger with worse function; I need to separate structure from mechanics. Structural remodeling, often captured by indexed LA volume, reflects cumulative pressure-volume stress over time, but functional impairment can precede enlargement and may be present even when LA size is normal, aligning with the broader construct of atrial cardiomyopathy that explicitly includes mechanical dysfunction in addition to enlargement and fibrosis [^113viYXD] [^111xeA5D]. Wait, I should verify the thresholds I'm invoking for LA volume index, because I initially thought a single cutpoint applied across modalities; standard echocardiography often references normal LAVI ≤ 34 mL/m², whereas some cardiac CT cohorts have defined enlargement at ≥ 62 mL/m², underscoring modality- and cohort-specific criteria that I must keep distinct to avoid misclassification [^111LbutQ] [^112WJwEf].

> Next, I should review how we measure LA function in practice, and I need to ensure I'm not over-weighting any one tool. Echocardiography offers volumetric indices like LA emptying fractions and expansion index, alongside deformation measures via speckle-tracking strain that detect early myocardial dysfunction when volumes remain normal, with the composite left atrial function index (LAFI) integrating reservoir performance, stroke volume analog, and size into a rhythm-independent metric [^113goa2R] [^111LbutQ] [^116MDoG2]. Let me double-check LAFI's prognostic credentials before leaning on it; indeed, LAFI has repeatedly predicted stroke and heart failure outcomes independent of conventional markers, which supports its inclusion in a definition framework [^114LryXt] [^111fEB8a].

> I will now examine advanced imaging, because reproducibility and spatial detail matter when the echocardiographic window is limited. Cardiac MRI feature tracking provides high-resolution phasic strain with robust reproducibility and has demonstrated independent prognostic associations, while cardiac CT can quantify phasic volumes and total emptying fraction, extending functional assessment into cross-sectional imaging workflows where LA anatomy is already being interrogated [^1136KdED]. Wait, I should verify whether CT-derived functional metrics track with atrial fibrillation risk beyond size; yes, CT studies show LA total emptying fraction and reservoir metrics improve AF prediction beyond LA volume, highlighting functional impairment even with normal LAVI [^114TT5be] [^115PJG2L].

> Let me consider quantitative thresholds next, but I should confirm they are outcome-driven rather than arbitrary. Population-based analyses derive cutoffs that maximize discrimination for events, with LA reservoir strain less than about 23%, LA emptying fraction less than about 55%, and LAFI less than about 40.5 linked to incident atrial fibrillation and cardiac events, while cardiac CT studies support total emptying fraction below about 40% as abnormal and show graded risk with lower reservoir and passive emptying, and expansion index behaves as a continuous predictor of filling pressures and adverse outcomes in heart failure cohorts [^116wGAz9] [^112WJwEf] [^115k6e9a]. Hmm, wait a minute, did I conflate booster versus reservoir contributions to AF risk; let me verify and correct that here: booster pump measures have been less consistently predictive of incident AF than reservoir and conduit parameters in CT cohorts, so the thresholds emphasized should prioritize reservoir and global emptying indices when AF risk stratification is the goal [^112xtQmX] [^115PJG2L].

> I should confirm prognostic independence now, because a definition that simply mirrors LA size will not advance clinical utility. LAFI in stable coronary disease predicts stroke and TIA independent of atrial fibrillation and conventional echocardiography, and both LA reservoir strain and total emptying indices predict heart failure hospitalization and death in HFpEF and HFrEF, frequently retaining significance after adjustment for LA volume and LV strain, supporting that functional measures capture distinct pathophysiology beyond chamber size alone [^114LryXt] [^111gESWE] [^111z9XRh]. But wait, what if the independence disappears after adding comprehensive LV mechanics; in some HFpEF datasets the association attenuates when LV longitudinal strain and E/e′ are included, reminding me to interpret LA metrics within the broader cardiodynamic milieu rather than in isolation [^116nQYQT] [^113yFAR2].

> Next, I should review how these measures integrate with diastolic assessment workflows, because this determines bedside applicability. Contemporary reviews and state-of-the-art statements emphasize that LA function changes earlier than LA volume in the evolution of LV diastolic dysfunction, and adding LA reservoir strain can reduce indeterminate diastolic grades while preserving outcome stratification, with complementary diagnostic value when indexed to estimated LA pressure as a surrogate of LA compliance during invasive validation [^111LbutQ] [^115m5hkj]. Hold on, I should verify feasibility in routine practice; LA strain is measurable in the vast majority of studies and performs reproducibly in experienced hands, supporting broader clinical uptake with appropriate training and software standardization [^115m5hkj] [^1136KdED].

> Let me synthesize a working definition now, but I need to ensure it is both measurable and prognostically anchored. Left atrial dysfunction can be defined as impaired reservoir, conduit, or contractile mechanics quantified by reduced deformation or volumetric performance, operationalized as LA reservoir strain less than about 23% by speckle-tracking or CMR feature tracking, LA emptying fraction less than about 55% or total emptying fraction less than about 40%, or LAFI less than about 40.5, recognizing that these thresholds are outcome-derived and should be interpreted within clinical context and modality-specific norms [^116wGAz9] [^112xtQmX] [^1118uH1b]. I should double-check that I explicitly state size independence; yes, this impairment may occur with or without LA enlargement, and in many cohorts LA functional abnormalities mediate a substantial portion of AF risk otherwise attributed to LA size, reinforcing function as a distinct disease signal [^114TT5be] [^115PJG2L].

> I need to ensure rhythm and appendage considerations are not overlooked, because they can trip up interpretation. LAFI is rhythm-independent and thus useful across sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, while strain measurement during AF requires technique-specific adjustments and careful beat averaging, and although left atrial appendage dysfunction is a key thromboembolic substrate, the chamber-level functional indices discussed here address global atrial mechanics rather than appendage-specific flow or thrombus risk, which still necessitates targeted transesophageal echocardiography when clinically indicated [^116MDoG2] [^115G5jQK].

> Next, I should review limitations and practice gaps so the definition remains honest to the evidence. Despite converging data, no single universal guideline-endorsed numeric cutpoint integrates all modalities, and the Heart Failure Association's consensus frames atrial cardiomyopathy as a graded disorder spanning electrical, mechanical, structural, and fibrotic domains, advocating standardized acquisition and reporting but stopping short of prescriptive thresholds, while implementation barriers include vendor variability, training needs, and uncertainty about whether treating LA dysfunction per se improves outcomes beyond risk factor control and disease-directed therapies [^111xeA5D] [^113viYXD] [^115DZvVx]. Let me reconsider if reversibility matters here; emerging data suggest LA reverse remodeling is achievable with targeted therapies and rhythm control strategies, but definitive proof that modifying LA mechanics independently improves hard outcomes remains under active investigation [^112o5uVR] [^113ucvet].

> Finally, to ensure I have not missed a competing mechanistic framing, I should double-check disease-phenotype nuances. HFpEF and HFrEF display distinct LA pathophysiology, with HFpEF characterized by higher stiffness and pulsatility at similar mean pressure, yet in both phenotypes lower reservoir function tracks with pulmonary vascular load and right ventricular dysfunction, reinforcing that LA dysfunction is not merely an epiphenomenon of size but a central integrator of upstream and downstream hemodynamics with prognostic salience [^113yFAR2] [^111gESWE].

> In summary, left atrial dysfunction is best conceptualized and operationalized as an outcome-linked reduction in phasic mechanical performance detected by deformation or volumetric indices that can precede and inform beyond enlargement, with practical thresholds such as reservoir strain less than about 23%, LA emptying fraction less than about 55% or total emptying fraction less than about 40%, and LAFI less than about 40.5, interpreted within modality, rhythm, and clinical context and used to refine risk stratification for atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure independent of LA size [^116wGAz9] [^114LryXt] [^115PJG2L] [^111LbutQ].

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function** [^111LbutQ] of the left atrium, which may precede or occur without atrial enlargement [^113goa2R] [^114TT5be]. It is best detected by reductions in LA reservoir strain (< 23%) and LA emptying fraction (< 55%) [^116wGAz9] and is **linked to higher risks of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization** [^115PJG2L] [^114LryXt] [^111fEB8a]. Early identification with echocardiographic strain or CMR enables **risk stratification** and guides therapy to prevent progression and adverse events [^115GPfTy] [^1118uH1b] [^112cYWg7].

---

## Physiological role of the left atrium

The left atrium has **three phasic functions** — reservoir during ventricular systole, storing pulmonary venous return; conduit in early diastole, passively transferring blood to the left ventricle; and booster-pump in late diastole, actively augmenting LV filling [^113goa2R] [^111LbutQ]. These phases are essential for efficient LV filling and cardiac output, especially during exercise or stress [^111AveBV].

---

## Definition and characterization of left atrial dysfunction

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function**, often preceding or occurring without LA enlargement [^114TT5be] [^115PJG2L]. It reflects reduced compliance, increased stiffness, and impaired contractility, measured by echocardiographic strain and volumetric indices [^111LbutQ] [^113goa2R].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Left atrial dysfunction arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Increased left atrial pressure**: Chronic elevation from LV diastolic dysfunction or mitral valve disease causes LA remodeling and dysfunction [^111LbutQ].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: AF promotes electrical and structural remodeling, fibrosis, and impaired LA function [^114TT5be] [^116fmyL2].

- **Hypertension and LV hypertrophy**: Elevated afterload and LV hypertrophy increase LA stiffness and reduce compliance [^116rns7X].

- **Myocardial ischemia and cardiomyopathies**: Ischemia and infiltrative disease impair LA mechanics [^114zrK8o].

- **Aging and comorbidities**: Age, obesity, and diabetes contribute to LA remodeling and dysfunction [^111AveBV].

---

## Clinical implications and consequences

Left atrial dysfunction has **major clinical consequences**:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Increases AF risk and recurrence after ablation.

- **Stroke and thromboembolism**: Impaired LA function promotes stasis and thrombus formation, increasing stroke risk even without AF [^114LryXt] [^115G5jQK].

- **Heart failure**: Predicts HF hospitalization and progression, especially in HFpEF [^111fEB8a] [^113yFAR2] [^111z9XRh].

- **Exercise intolerance**: Reduced LA function limits cardiac output during exertion [^111KBfft] [^1174qQ6m].

---

## Diagnostic assessment

Accurate assessment relies on **multimodality imaging**. Key echocardiographic thresholds for LA dysfunction include **LA reservoir strain < 23%** and LA emptying fraction < 55% [^116wGAz9] [^112cYWg7]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Parameters assessed** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Echocardiography | - LA volume index <br/> - LA emptying fraction <br/> - LA strain (reservoir, conduit, booster) | - First-line <br/> - Widely available <br/> - Early detection [^111LbutQ] [^112cYWg7] [^113goa2R] |
| Cardiac MRI | - LA volumes <br/> - LA strain <br/> - Fibrosis (LGE) | High reproducibility and detailed tissue characterization [^1118uH1b] [^115GPfTy] |
| Cardiac CT | LA volumes and LA function | Useful when MRI is contraindicated [^114TT5be] [^115PJG2L] |

---

## Prognostic significance

Left atrial dysfunction **independently predicts adverse outcomes**, including higher risks of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation, increased ischemic stroke risk even without AF [^114LryXt], and higher rates of heart failure hospitalization and mortality, notably in HFpEF [^111fEB8a] [^113yFAR2] [^111gESWE] [^111z9XRh]. It is also associated with higher all-cause mortality in diverse populations [^1118uH1b].

---

## Therapeutic interventions

Management targets **underlying causes** and LA remodeling:

- **Risk factor control**: Treat hypertension, diabetes, and obesity to reduce LA load [^115DZvVx] [^111xeA5D].

- **Rhythm control**: AF ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy can improve LA function and reduce AF burden [^113ucvet].

- **Anticoagulation**: Prevents thromboembolism in patients with AF or high stroke risk [^113ucvet].

- **Novel therapies**: Agents such as omecamtiv mecarbil may improve LA function and reduce AF/stroke risk [^112o5uVR].

---

Left atrial dysfunction is **impaired reservoir, conduit, or booster-pump function** [^111LbutQ] that often precedes LA enlargement and is best detected by strain imaging [^115GPfTy]. It is a **strong, independent predictor of AF, stroke, and HF**, and early detection with echocardiography or CMR enables targeted therapy to improve outcomes [^115PJG2L] [^114LryXt] [^111fEB8a] [^1118uH1b] [^112cYWg7].

### Relation of left atrial dysfunction to ischemic stroke in patients with coronary heart disease (from the heart and soul study) [^114LryXt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether left atrial (LA) dysfunction independently predicts ischemic stroke. Atrial fibrillation (AF) impairs LA function and is associated with ischemic stroke; however, ischemic stroke frequently occurs in patients without known AF. The direct relation between LA function and the risk of ischemic stroke is unknown. We performed transthoracic echocardiography at rest in 983 subjects with stable coronary heart disease.

To quantify LA dysfunction, we used the left atrial function index (LAFI), a validated formula incorporating LA volumes at end-atrial systole and diastole. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between LAFI and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Over a mean follow-up of 7.1 years, 58 study participants (5.9%) experienced an ischemic stroke or TIA.

In patients without known baseline AF or warfarin therapy (n = 893), participants in the lowest quintile of LAFI had more than three times the risk of ischemic stroke or TIA (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.7, p = 0.03) compared with those in the highest quintile. For each standard deviation (18.8 U) decrease in LAFI, the hazard of ischemic stroke or TIA increased by 50% (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.1, p = 0.04). Among measured echocardiographic indexes of LA function, including LA volume, LAFI was the strongest predictor of ischemic stroke or TIA. In conclusion, LA dysfunction is an independent risk factor for stroke or TIA, even in patients without baseline AF.

### Left atrial phasic function: Physiology, clinical assessment and prognostic value [^113goa2R]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) phasic function provides significant insights into the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. It is described in three phases: reservoir (atrial filling during systole), conduit (passive emptying during early diastole), and contractile (active emptying during late diastole). LA phasic function can be evaluated by different imaging modalities and a variety of techniques, including volumetric analysis, deformation (strain), and Doppler methods.

Notably, LA phasic function, particularly LA reservoir strain, is more sensitive and provides earlier detection of LA dysfunction than alterations in LA volume. Parameters of LA function have demonstrated significant diagnostic and prognostic value, particularly in heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. However, there remain barriers to the implementation of phasic function parameters in clinical practice and guidelines. This review outlines the physiology of LA phasic function, methods of assessment, and its diagnostic and prognostic utility in varying pathologies.

### Left atrial phasic function by cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking is a strong predictor of incident cardiovascular events [^1118uH1b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The prognostic importance of left atrial (LA) dysfunction is increasingly recognized. Magnetic resonance imaging can provide excellent visualization of the LA wall. We aimed to study the association of LA dysfunction measured using feature-tracking magnetic resonance imaging with incident adverse cardiovascular events among subjects with or without heart failure (HF) at baseline.

- **Methods and results**: We prospectively studied 640 adults without HF (n = 419), HF with preserved ejection fraction (n = 101), or HF with reduced ejection fraction (n = 120). We measured phasic LA function by volumetric and feature-tracking methods to derive longitudinal strain. The composite outcome of incident HF hospitalization or death was adjudicated during a median follow-up of 37.1 months. Measures of LA phasic function were more prominently impaired in subjects with HF with reduced ejection fraction than among subjects with HF with preserved ejection fraction. In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards models, all measures of phasic LA function and volumes (maximum, minimum, and diastatic) were associated with the composite outcome. However, in analyses that adjusted for clinical risk factors, HF status, maximum LA volume, left ventricular mass, and left ventricular ejection fraction, measures of conduit and reservoir LA function, but not booster-pump function, were associated with the composite outcome. The strongest associations were observed for conduit longitudinal strain (standardized hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.88; P = 0.004), and conduit strain rate (standardized hazard ratio, 1.5).

### Prognostic utility and clinical significance of cardiac mechanics in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Importance of left atrial strain [^111gESWE]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is associated with adverse events in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the role of LA mechanics, specifically LA strain measures, in HFpEF has not been well studied. We hypothesized that in HFpEF, reduced (worse) LA strain is a key pathophysiological abnormality and is a stronger correlate of adverse events than left ventricular or right ventricular longitudinal strain.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated baseline LA function in 308 patients with HFpEF who were followed up longitudinally for adverse outcomes. All patients underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography for measurement of left ventricular longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain, and LA booster, conduit, and reservoir strains. The clinical and prognostic significance of left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures was assessed by regression analyses. The mean age was 65 ± 13 years, 64% were women, 26% had atrial fibrillation, and LA enlargement was present in the majority of patients (67%). Decreased LA reservoir strain was associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (P < 0.0001) and decreased peak oxygen consumption (P = 0.0001). Of the left ventricular, right ventricular, and LA strain measures, LA reservoir strain was the strongest correlate of adverse events and was independently associated with the composite outcome of cardiovascular hospitalization or death (adjusted hazard ratio per 1-SD decrease in LA strain, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15–2.07; P = 0.006).

- **Conclusions**: Abnormal indices of LA mechanics, particularly LA reservoir strain, serve as significant indicators of adverse outcomes in HFpEF patients.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^114TT5be]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Both left atrial (LA) remodeling and dysfunction contribute to the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). LA remodeling occurs in response to chronic pathological stimuli, such as hypertension and increased fat mass, and is associated with an increased risk of AF events. Clinically, LA enlargement is often used as a simple measure of LA structural remodeling. However, LA structural remodeling results from a complex pathophysiological process involving alterations in the cardiomyocyte, fibroblast, and non-collagen infiltrative compartments of the atrium and is accompanied by functional LA impairment.

The development of AF can contribute to adverse atrial remodeling and dilatation; however, this phenomenon has been demonstrated to predominantly occur in persistent AF. We observed a remarkable similarity in LA size and function between individuals with previous paroxysmal AF episodes and those at risk for future AF. These results suggest that in patients with a low AF burden, AF is a consequence of a dysfunctional LA rather than its cause. In these patients, LA enlargement is secondary to associated processes causing LA pressure and/or volume overload.

There is growing evidence that a large proportion of patients who develop AF, especially paroxysmal AF, do not have an enlarged LA, suggesting that LA dysfunction per se, without overt LA remodeling, increases the propensity to develop AF. We identified global LA dysfunction in approximately half of the subjects with normal LA volume index (LAVI). Furthermore, the increased LA volume explained only about 14% of the variability in left atrial total emptying fraction (LATEF), with the remainder determined by other risk factors, such as age.

### Subclinical left atrial dysfunction profiles for prediction of cardiac outcome in the general population [^116wGAz9]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic definitions of subclinical left atrial dysfunction based on epidemiological data remain scarce. In this population study, we derived outcome-driven thresholds for echocardiographic left atrial function parameters discriminating between normal and abnormal values.

In 1306 individuals (mean age, 50.7 years; 51.6% women), we echocardiographically assessed left atrial function and left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain. We derived cut-off values for left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), left atrial function index (LAFI), and left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) to define left atrial dysfunction using receiver-operating curve threshold analysis. The main outcome was the incidence of cardiac events and atrial fibrillation (AFib) on average 8.5 years later.

For the prediction of new-onset AFib, left atrial cut-offs yielding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity (highest Youden index) were LAEF less than 55%, LAFI less than 40.5, and LARS less than 23%. Applying these cut-offs, abnormal LAEF, LAFI, and LARS were present in 27%, 37.1%, and 18.1% of the cohort, respectively.

Abnormal LARS (< 23%) was independently associated with a higher risk for cardiac events and new-onset AFib (P ≤ 0.012). Participants with both abnormal LAEF and LARS presented a significantly higher risk to develop cardiac events (hazard ratio: 2.10; P = 0.014) and AFib (hazard ratio: 6.45; P = 0.0036) than normal counterparts. The concomitant presence of an impaired LARS and LV global longitudinal strain improved prognostic accuracy beyond a clinical risk model for cardiac events.

### Secondary prognosis after cardioembolic stroke of atrial origin: The role of left atrial and left atrial appendage dysfunction [^116rzJgJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Secondary prevention studies for cardioembolic strokes show a remarkable variability in stroke recurrence rates. Various reports have raised questions regarding differences in baseline clinical characteristics and in methodology to explain this wide variability.

- **Hypothesis**: The purpose of the present study is to examine the two-year outcome after first cardioembolic stroke of atrial origin and to correlate secondary prognosis with left atrial and left atrial appendage dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Baseline evaluation included computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance scanning, Doppler scanning, digital subtraction angiography, and transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography to establish the diagnosis of atrial source of emboli. Twenty-six patients in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and 13 in sinus rhythm were followed for recurrent stroke and vascular death as endpoints.

- **Results**: Patients in sinus rhythm had a total of 23% (standard deviation ± 12%) recurrence rate. All event-positive patients were on aspirin and died from this second cardioembolic stroke. Of patients in nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, 50% were event-positive at the end of the first year (death rate 46%). Patients on warfarin therapy had a 20% recurrence rate versus 70% on aspirin (relative risk 0.18, 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.48, p = 0.041). Inward peak velocity of left atrial appendage was the only echocardiographic variable significantly reduced in event-positive patients (21 ± 7 vs. 31 ± 17 cm/s, p = 0.048).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation and first atrial-source embolic stroke exhibit distinct outcomes based on therapy and echocardiographic findings.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^115h5fZt]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The study concludes that left atrial (LA) functional impairment occurs in a significant portion of patients with normal LA volume. Functional measures of the LA, including reservoir function, passive filling, and left atrial total emptying fraction (LATEF), provide additional information regarding the risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF), independent of clinical risk factors and LA volume. From a pathophysiological perspective, the study emphasizes the importance of LA mechanical dysfunction that accompanies LA remodeling in the pathogenesis of AF.

### Improving the assessment of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction by including left atrial strain in the algorithm [^112cYWg7]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). High credibility.

The latest guidelines on echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) leave a significant proportion of patients with LVDD status undetermined. We aimed to examine the implication of an alternative algorithm incorporating left atrial (LA) strain as a tiebreaker on the indeterminate LVDD category.

- **Methods and results**: We included 823 patients who underwent echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance within 7 days. LVDD was assessed by echocardiography following contemporary guidelines and an alternative algorithm including LA reservoir strain as a tiebreaker. LVDD was examined for its association with LV myocardial scar burden by cardiac magnetic resonance and a composite outcome. There were 275 patients (33%) who had LVDD, of whom 119 had advanced grades of LVDD (grades II-III), and 117 (14%) had an indeterminate LVDD grade. When LA strain was applied at cutpoints of 18%, 24%, and 35%, patients were reclassified as normal or LVDD-dependent accordingly. Reclassification allowed a similar outcome risk stratification as the guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: LA reservoir strain improved LVDD assessment by eliminating indeterminate status/grade while maintaining the same effective outcome stratification as the guidelines.

### Left atrial volume as a morphophysiologic expression of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and relation to cardiovascular risk burden [^113AxBMv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is prevalent in the community. Assessment of diastolic function can be complex, involving Doppler evaluation of an array of hemodynamic data. The relation between left atrial (LA) volume, diastolic function, cardiovascular risk, and disease burden is not well known. In the present prospective study of 140 adults, mean age 58 ± 19 years, referred for a clinically indicated echocardiogram and in sinus rhythm, with no history of atrial arrhythmias or valvular heart disease, we determined the LA volume, LV diastolic function status, cardiovascular risk score (based on age, gender, history of systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking), and cardiovascular disease burden (based on confirmed vascular disease, congestive heart failure, and transient ischemic attack or stroke).

LA volume was found to correlate positively with age, body surface area, cardiovascular risk score, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, LV mass, diastolic function grade, tissue Doppler E/E', tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and negatively with LV ejection fraction (all p < 0.006). In a multivariate clinical model, LA volume indexed to body surface area (indexed LA volume) was independently associated with cardiovascular risk score (p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (p = 0.014), vascular disease (p = 0.012), transient ischemic attack or stroke (p = 0.021), and history of smoking (p = 0.008). In a clinical and echocardiographic model, indexed LA volume was strongly associated with diastolic function grade.

### Left atrial cardiomyopathy: A puzzling disease process short of an easy answer [^113viYXD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the study underscores both the importance and the complexity of evaluating the left atrium (LA). Atrial cardiomyopathy was defined by an international European Heart Rhythm Association expert position article as any complex of structural, architectural, contractile, or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria with the potential to produce clinically relevant manifestations. It has been linked to atrial fibrillation (AF), ischemic stroke, heart failure, and death. Yet, in a cardiologist's everyday clinical practice, not much focus is directed to LA size and function. In part, this would be expected considering that the cause, disease stages, progression, and clinical implications are still incompletely understood, and actionable measures are yet to be defined.

There is also an ongoing struggle to find reliable measures to assess LA structure and function and understand disease processes. A complex interplay exists between LA enlargement, changes in mechanical stress, electrical remodeling, adipose tissue infiltration, and fibrosis. Besides size and volume, contractile assessment has gained traction over the past decade. Strain indicates myocardial deformation, a surrogate for mechanical properties. It can be used to assess LA phasic function, namely, reservoir, booster pump, and conduit function. Initially assessed with echocardiography using speckle tracking, recent advances have expanded strain assessment to magnetic resonance imaging by using feature tracking. Impaired strain measurements with both modalities have been demonstrated to be sensitive predictors of cardiac disease.

### The emerging role of atrial strain assessed by cardiac MRI in different cardiovascular settings: An up-to-date review [^115GPfTy]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

The left atrium (LA) has a crucial function in maintaining left ventricular filling, which is responsible for about one-third of all cardiac filling. A growing body of evidence shows that the LA is involved in several cardiovascular diseases from a clinical and prognostic standpoint. LA enlargement has been recognized as a predictor of outcomes in many diseases. However, LA enlargement itself does not explain the whole LA's function during the cardiac cycle.

The recently proposed assessment of atrial strain through advanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) helps overcome the usual limitations of the sole LA volumetric measurement. Moreover, left atrial strain impairment might allow several cardiovascular diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. While traditional CMR has a central role in assessing LA volume and, through cine sequences, a marginal role in evaluating LA function, feature tracking at advanced CMR (CMR-FT) has been increasingly confirmed as a feasible and reproducible technique for assessing LA function through strain. Compared to atrial function evaluations via speckle tracking echocardiography, CMR-FT has higher spatial resolution, a larger field of view, and better reproducibility.

In this literature review on atrial strain analysis, we describe the strengths, limitations, recent applications, and promising developments of studying atrial function using CMR-FT in clinical practice.

- **Key points**: The left atrium has a crucial function in maintaining left ventricular filling; left atrial size has been recognized as a predictor of cardiac outcomes.

### Impaired left atrial function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111R17NP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

The study focused on assessing the importance of left atrial (LA) function in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). It is known that LA enlargement is common in HFpEF patients and serves as a risk marker, yet the role of LA function is less clear.

The PARAMOUNT trial enrolled HFpEF patients meeting specific criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% and NT-proBNP > 400pg/mL. Researchers evaluated LA reservoir, conduit, and pump functions using two-dimensional volume indices and speckle tracking echocardiography on 135 HFpEF patients in sinus rhythm and 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Systolic LA strain was analyzed in relation to clinical characteristics, cardiac structure, and function measures. Compared to controls, HFpEF patients showed significantly impaired LA reservoir, conduit, and pump function. Notably, systolic LA strain was markedly lower in HFpEF patients (controls 39.2 ± 6.6% vs. HFpEF 24.6 ± 7.3%) and remained significant after adjustments, even among those with normal LA size or no history of atrial fibrillation (AF). Within the HFpEF cohort, reduced systolic LA strain correlated with higher incidences of prior heart failure hospitalization, AF history, worse left ventricular systolic function, and increased left ventricular mass and LA volume. Conversely, NT-proBNP and E/E' were consistent across varying levels of LA function.

The study concluded that all phases of LA function were impaired in HFpEF patients, with decreased systolic LA strain independent of LA size or AF history. These findings suggest that LA dysfunction may indicate disease severity and play a pathophysiological role in HFpEF.

Trial Registration: NCT00887588.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: a new target for prevention and treatment [^115DZvVx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

The left atrium is a dynamic chamber with peculiar characteristics. Stressors and disease mechanisms may deeply modify its structure and function, leading to left atrial remodelling and disease. Left atrial disease is a predictor of poor outcomes; it may be a consequence of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, as well as neurohormonal and inflammatory activation. It may also actively contribute to the progression and clinical course of heart failure through multiple mechanisms such as left ventricular filling and the development of atrial fibrillation and subsequent embolic events.

There is growing evidence that therapy may improve left atrial function and reverse left atrial remodelling. Whether this translates into changes in a patient's prognosis is still unknown. In this review, we report data about changes in left atrial size and function across different stages of heart failure development and progression. At each stage, drug therapies, lifestyle interventions, and procedures have been associated with improvements in left atrial structure and function, namely a reduction in left atrial volume and/or an improvement in left atrial strain function — a process that can be defined as left atrial reverse remodelling. In some cases, this has been associated with improvement in clinical outcomes.

Further evidence is still needed, mainly with respect to the possible role of left atrial reverse remodelling as an independent mechanism affecting the patient's clinical course, and regarding better standardization of clinically meaningful changes in left atrial measurements.

### Left atrial function in diastolic heart failure [^1174qQ6m]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) structure and function occur in patients with diastolic heart failure (DHF). The reasons for the transition from asymptomatic dysfunction to heart failure need better definition, including noninvasive measurements that can detect the transition.

Methods and results - In 64 patients undergoing right heart catheterization, simultaneous echocardiographic imaging was performed. A control group included 27 healthy subjects. Within the study group, there were 25 patients with ejection factor (EF) < 50%, 20 in DHF, and 19 with normal EF and LV hypertrophy but without heart failure (diastolic dysfunction). LV volumes, mass, left atrial (LA) volumes and EF, annular atrial velocity (a'), and LA strain during systole (LA(S)), and atrial contraction (LA(A)) were measured. The ratio of wedge pressure to LA(S) strain was used as an index of LA stiffness, as was the ratio of E/e' to LA(S) strain. All three patient groups had increased LA volumes and depressed LA EF, a', and LA(A) strain. There was no significant difference between patients with DHF and diastolic dysfunction in LA systolic function indices, LV mass, LA volumes, LV, and arterial elastance. LA(S) strain was lower in patients with DHF, and LA stiffness (both invasive and noninvasive) was higher (both P < 0.01). This was well-related to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.79, P < 0.001) and was most accurate in identifying DHF patients compared to those with diastolic dysfunction (invasive area under the curve: 0.93, noninvasive: 0.85).

Conclusions - Patients with DHF have increased LV mass and LA volume in comparison with normal.

### The left atrial appendage, a small, blind-ended structure: a review of its echocardiographic evaluation and its clinical role [^115G5jQK]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of stroke and atrial fibrillation is a stimulus for new therapeutic strategies and also warrants a review of imaging modalities of the most important source of cardiac systemic embolic events: the left atrial appendage (LAA). This blind-ended, complex structure is embryologically distinct from the body of the left atrium and is sometimes regarded as just a minor extension of the atrium. However, it should routinely be analyzed as part of a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) examination. A pulsed Doppler TEE analysis of LAA emptying flow should supplement a two-dimensional (2-D) analysis; these examinations have proven to be highly reproducible and to help assess thromboembolic risk. In 2-D imaging, potential thrombus and spontaneous echo contrast should be sought. In addition, LAA plays a hemodynamic role that participates in atrial function and is influenced by various hemodynamic conditions. In view of the embolic risks from a dysfunctional appendage, the LAA is often ligated during cardiac valve surgery. New devices are under evaluation for percutaneous closure of the LAA, and further studies should improve the definition, understanding, and treatment of LAA dysfunction.

### Endothelial dysfunction and lung capillary injury in cardiovascular diseases [^112rx5KF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac dysfunction of both systolic and diastolic origins leads to increased left atrial pressure, lung capillary injury, and increased resistance to gas transfer. Acutely, pressure-induced trauma disrupts the endothelial and alveolar anatomical configuration and definitively causes an impairment of cellular pathways involved in fluid-flux regulation and gas exchange efficiency, a process well identified as stress failure of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

In chronic heart failure (HF), additional stimuli other than pressure may trigger the true remodeling process of capillaries and small arteries characterized by endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of myofibroblasts, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix deposition. In parallel, there is a loss of alveolar gas diffusion properties due to the increased path from air to blood (thickening of extracellular matrix) and loss of fine molecular mechanisms involved in fluid reabsorption and clearance. Deleterious changes in gas transfer not only reflect the underlying lung tissue damage but also portend independent prognostic information and may play a role in the pathogenesis of exercise limitation and ventilatory abnormalities observed in these patients.

Few currently approved treatments for chronic HF have the potential to positively affect the structural remodeling of the lung capillary network. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are one of the few currently established options. Recently, more attention has been paid to novel therapies specifically targeting the nitric oxide pathway as a suitable target to improve endothelial function.

### Quantification of left atrial strain in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy using cardiovascular magnetic resonance feature tracking [^116UQ4Xg]. Clinical Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is involved in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). Multiparametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) strain imaging is a feasible and reproducible tool for examining global and regional LA functions, as well as left ventricular (LV) function in IIM patients.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of LA strain occurrence and strain rate for LA function assessment using CMR in IIM cases.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 36 IIM and 42 healthy control cases were included. Baseline ventricular function was comparatively assessed in both groups. LA strain occurrence and strain rate were examined by cine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing an in-house semiautomated technique. LA global function indexes were quantitated, including reservoir, conduit, and booster-pump functions.

- **Results**: A total of 78 participants were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference in left/right ventricular routine functions between IIM patients and control individuals (p > 0.05); the same results (p > 0.05) were also observed between patients with high hs-cTnI and normal. However, LV mass index showed significant difference (p1 = 0.003, p2 < 0.01). Compared with IIM patients and control individuals, only total strain (εs) (p4 = 0.046) and passive strain (εe) (p4 = 0.002) showed significant difference. In cases with high hs-cTnI and normal hs-cTnI, differences were found for εs (p3 = 0.012) and εe (p4 = 0.047). The strongest association was found between εe and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.5).

### Atrial cardiomyopathy: From healthy atria to atrial failure. A clinical consensus statement of the Heart Failure Association of the ESC [^111xeA5D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). High credibility.

The importance of atrial cardiomyopathy (AtCM) as a specific clinical entity is increasingly recognized. Past definitions have varied, and the lack of consistent cut-offs for imaging parameters and biomarkers has limited the clinical utility to diagnose and track AtCM progression. While research has mainly focused on AtCM in the context of atrial fibrillation, emerging evidence underscores its relevance in remodeling and the development of heart failure. The aim of this consensus document was to provide a contemporary framework for AtCM, evolve the definitions of AtCM and atrial failure for more widespread clinical use, and help to direct emerging research and future clinical trials.

Supporting the work of early career researchers, this consensus document evaluates diagnostic markers and summarizes the underpinning mechanisms, clinical characteristics, and prognostic impact of AtCM. Our objective was to bring together new translational scientific progress, catalyze future research, and enable clinical application to facilitate better management, for example, in patient groups where aggressive control of risk factors or comorbidities could prevent AtCM progression. We redefined AtCM as a graded disorder that includes electrical dysfunction of the atria along with evidence of either mechanical atrial dysfunction, atrial enlargement, and/or atrial fibrosis. Atrial failure is the end-stage manifestation of AtCM, characterized by progressive structural, electrophysiological, and functional changes.

Earlier identification, risk stratification, and ongoing research into therapeutic options have the potential to significantly advance clinical management.

### Echocardiographic evaluation of left atrial size and function: current understanding, pathophysiologic correlates, and prognostic implications [^112RJ8nV]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume has recently been identified as a potential biomarker for cardiac and cerebrovascular disease. However, evidence regarding the prognostic implications of LA volume still remains unclear. Evaluation of LA size and function using traditional and more recent echocardiographic parameters is potentially feasible in the routine clinical setting.

This review article discusses the conventional and newer echocardiographic parameters used to evaluate LA size and function.

- **Conventional parameters**: Include the assessment of phasic atrial activity using atrial volume measurements, transmitral Doppler peak A velocity, atrial fraction, and the atrial ejection force.
- **Newer parameters**: Include Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) such as segmental atrial function assessment using color DTI, strain, and strain rate.

In addition, an overview of the implications and clinical relevance of the findings of an enlarged left atrium, from currently available literature, is presented.

### Prognostic value of minimal left atrial volume in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115BSKem]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Maximal left atrial (LA) volume is reported by most echocardiography laboratories and is associated with clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). Recent studies suggest that minimal LA volume may better reflect left ventricular filling pressure and may be more prognostic than maximal LA volume. This study assessed the prognostic value of indexed minimal LA volume (LAVImin) in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed the relationship of LAVImin with a primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac death, or HF hospitalization in 347 patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction enrolled from the Americas region in TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial). We compared LAVImin with indexed maximal LA volume with respect to their prognostic values. In addition, we assessed if LA functional parameters provide additional prognostic information over LAVImin. During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 107 patients (31%) experienced a primary composite end point.

LAVImin was associated with increased risk of a primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12–1.61) and HF hospitalization alone (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17–1.71) after adjusting for clinical confounders and ejection fraction. In contrast, indexed maximal LA volume was not related to the primary composite outcome but was related to HF alone (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02–1.54). In comparison with indexed maximal LA volume, LAVImin was significantly more prognostic for primary outcomes.

### Left atrial expansion index predicts left ventricular filling pressure and adverse events in acute heart failure with severe left ventricular dysfunction [^115k6e9a]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The power of left atrial (LA) parameters for predicting left ventricular (LV) filling pressure and adverse events in acute heart failure (HF) with severe LV dysfunction, either sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation (AF), is not fully understood.

- **Methods and results**: Echocardiography was performed in 141 patients with acute decompensated congestive HF and LV ejection fraction < 35%, including 42 with permanent AF. The LA expansion index was calculated as (Volmax - Volmin) × 100%/Volmin, where Volmax was defined as maximal and Volmin as minimal LA volume. Of these patients, invasive LV filling pressures within 12 hours of LA expansion index measurement were available in 109. The end points were 3-year frequencies of HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 74 participants (52.5%) reached the end points (sinus vs AF group: 48.5% vs 61.9%, respectively; p = 0.047). Multivariate analysis revealed that adverse events in both groups were only independently associated with age and LA expansion index. Rates of adverse events were proportional to LA expansion index. There was a good logarithmic relationship between LA expansion index and LV filling pressure, regardless of presence or absence of AF.

- **Conclusions**: LV filling pressure can be estimated well by LA expansion index, with or without AF. The LA expansion index predicts adverse events in HF patients with severe systolic dysfunction. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01307722.)

### Atrial fibrillation burden: A new outcome predictor and therapeutic target [^113ucvet]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

At the same time, the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) also enhances the risk of heart failure events, stroke, and cardiovascular death.

- **Atrial fibrillation and left ventricular function**: Atrial fibrillation directly impairs ventricular function and can even result in arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy that will reverse after the restoration of normal sinus rhythm using AF ablation. In other patients, heart failure can predispose them to AF, and AF and heart failure share genetic and acquired pathomechanisms. A high AF burden was associated with more heart failure events in a large population of patients with paroxysmal AF. There is a strong bidirectional association between heart failure and AF burden, where heart failure can contribute to AF, and vice versa. Controlled clinical trials of rhythm control and AF ablation, interventions that lower AF burden, reduce heart failure events in patients with reduced left ventricular function and AF. Ongoing studies testing AF ablation will determine whether reducing AF burden can improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and AF.

- **Atrial fibrillation and stroke**: Reduced flow in the left atrium and especially in the left atrial appendage, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of local and systemic prothrombotic signaling combine to enhance thrombogenesis in the left atrium and cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF. This leads to cardioembolic strokes that are commonly found in patients with AF. The incidence of cardioembolic strokes can be significantly reduced by oral anticoagulants.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^115PJG2L]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

A strong association exists between left atrial (LA) structural remodeling and the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the role of LA function in AF prediction remains unclear. Our study investigated the relationship between LA function and incident AF using cardiac CT.

We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent multiphasic cardiac CT. LA volumes and parameters of LA global, reservoir, and booster function were calculated. The association between measures of LA function and incident AF was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for clinical variables, LA volume, and left ventricular function.

In total, 1025 patients (age 64 years ± 14) were evaluated. Over a median of 3.9 years, 90 patients developed AF. There was a significant association between LA total emptying fraction (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02–1.05 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001), LA reservoir function (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02–1.06 per 1 mL/m² decrease in LA expansion index, p < 0.001), and passive LA emptying (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 per 1% decrease in LA passive emptying fraction, p < 0.001) with incident AF, though no association was found with LA booster function. Incorporating LA function into predictive models improved risk stratification beyond clinical variables and LA volume. Mediation analysis demonstrated that 46% of the effect of LA volume on AF was mediated via LA dysfunction.

LA functional impairment is common even in patients with normal LA volume, providing additional prognostic information for AF risk. The findings underscore the significance of evaluating LA function in AF risk stratification.

### A real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic quantitative analysis of left atrial function in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [^112PFrKi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function provides important information about hemodynamics and has prognostic implications for various cardiac diseases. In particular, left atrial (LA) volume is an increasingly significant prognostic biomarker for diastolic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess left ventricular diastolic function by measuring changes in LA volume using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography.

The 106 subjects were divided into four groups: normal, impaired relaxation, pseudonormal, and restrictive, based on diastolic function as assessed by transmitral flow patterns. LA volume was measured during a heart cycle using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography. LA stroke volume (maximum LA volume - minimum LA volume) and the LA ejection fraction (LA stroke volume/maximum LA volume x 100) were calculated using Doppler imaging to assess their correlation with other parameters used to evaluate left ventricular diastolic function, including transmitral flow pattern and early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E').

LA volume indexed to body surface area was dilated in subjects with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, whereas the LA ejection fraction was lower. The maximum LA volume, minimum LA volume, and LA ejection fraction were significantly different between each group, and each was significantly correlated with the ratio of early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E) to E' (E/E'). The LA ejection fraction correlated best with E/E' (r = -0.68, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, cyclic changes in LA volume could be measured using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography for effective assessment of left ventricular diastolic function.

### Association of atrial fibrillation progression with left atrial functional reserve and its reversibility [^114zr4C2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in daily practice, affecting a growing number of people worldwide due to the aging of populations. AF carries a significant risk for heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, with a 7-fold elevated risk, and the incidence of HF increases with AF progression. Over the past three decades, catheter ablation of AF has evolved from an investigational procedure to an established therapy for restoring sinus rhythm, and recent studies have demonstrated its beneficial effect for HF prevention.

Left atrial (LA) functional alteration plays a key role in the incidence and maintenance of AF as well as the subsequent occurrence of HF. The LA reserves blood from the pulmonary vein and modifies left ventricular (LV) filling in response to variation in preload. Impaired LA reservoir strain (LARS), assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography, reflects reduced LA compliance, which precedes LA enlargement and serves as a sensitive and reliable marker of AF recurrence and adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AF.

More recently, particular attention has been given to LA functional reserve, which reflects LA distensibility corresponding to increased preload in patients with HF, and the LARS response to passive leg lifting (PLL). PLL is a simple and noninvasive maneuver that rapidly increases venous return to the central circulation, corresponding to LA functional reserve. However, the relationship between the progression of AF and LA functional remodeling is not well described.

### Asymptomatic versus symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation: Clinical and noninvasive characteristics [^116rBoyW]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This prospective study was designed to investigate the differences between asymptomatic versus symptomatic arrhythmia, as well as left ventricular dysfunction in a consecutive population of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.

A total of 282 consecutive outpatients referred with persistent atrial fibrillation formed the study population. A structured medical history was obtained, and a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was conducted to assess left ventricular function. Additionally, a 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) recording was performed. Heart rhythm irregularity was analyzed using heart rate variability (HRV) in the time domain, along with assessments of maximum and minimum heart rate, and the longest pause.

The study was conducted in three university hospitals. The mean age of the patients was 69 years, and the mean duration of atrial fibrillation was 7 months. The prevalence of symptomatic patients was 68%, whereas 32% had no symptoms from atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular dysfunction was observed in 20% of patients. Asymptomatic subjects more often had lone atrial fibrillation compared to those with symptoms.

Valvular heart disease was identified as an independent predictor of symptoms, while male gender, ischaemic heart disease, and a high heart rate were independent predictors of impaired left ventricular function.

In conclusion, valvular heart disease is associated with symptoms in persistent atrial fibrillation. Ischaemic heart disease, male gender, and a high heart rate are more prevalent in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Compromised left ventricular function also occurs in asymptomatic individuals.

### Left atrial dimension and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with and without atrial fibrillation: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176s74M]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of left atrial (LA) dimensions may differ between patients with and without atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies investigating the association between LA echocardiographic parameters measured by transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with or without AF. Data were independently abstracted by two reviewers and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. The primary outcome was incident stroke or thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes included heart failure, all-cause mortality, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).

- **Results**: The systematic review included 23 studies of patients with AF (14,939 patients) and 68 studies of patients without AF (50,720 patients). An increasing LA diameter was significantly associated with stroke and thromboembolic events in patients without AF (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.87; p = 0.03), but not in patients with AF (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; p = 0.27; p for difference = 0.05). An increasing LA diameter index was significantly associated with MACE in patients with AF (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.17; p < 0.001) and in patients without AF (RR 2.98, 95% CI 1.90 to 4.66; p < 0.001), with stronger effects in non-AF populations (p for difference < 0.001). A greater LA volume index was significantly associated with the risk of MACE in patients with AF (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02; p = 0.03) and in non-AF populations (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.10; p < 0.001), the association being stronger in individuals without AF (p for difference < 0.001).

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: Does functionality matter more than size [^116MDoG2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial size and function can be assessed with echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance. However, due to its safety, relatively low cost, and universal availability, echocardiography is the most widely applied first-line modality. Many of the earlier measures of atrial function were only measurable during sinus rhythm, making comparisons in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) challenging. These measures include the following:

1. Peak "A" wave velocity and velocity-time integral of transmitral flow in late diastole.
2. Estimation of the fractional contribution of atrial contraction to total mitral inflow.
3. The use of Doppler tissue imaging as a global measure of atrial function.

Recent advances in 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography, including tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking for strain analysis, have allowed evaluation of atrial function during AF. These varying parameters have distinct strengths and weaknesses and are complementary in differing clinical scenarios.

- **LA function index (LAFI)**: Uses volumetric measurement of the left atrium (LA) and is a composite rhythm-independent measure of LA function. It is a ratio that incorporates analogs of cardiac output, atrial reservoir function, and LA size. LAFI is calculated as follows:

	- LAFI = (LA emptying fraction × velocity time integral across the left ventricular outflow tract) / largest LA volume measure in ventricular systole indexed to body surface area.

Thus, LAFI increases proportionally to LA reservoir function and stroke volume, but it is inversely proportional to LA size.

### Left atrial strain and compliance in the diagnostic evaluation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^115m5hkj]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) function is impaired in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and predicts disease severity and risk of adverse outcomes. We sought to evaluate whether LA strain could enhance the diagnosis of HFpEF.

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive patients with unexplained exertional dyspnoea and image quality suitable for measuring LA strain underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing to ascertain the presence of HFpEF or non-cardiac causes of dyspnoea (NCD). LA reservoir strain was measured in all patients, while LA conduit and booster strain were measured in patients with sinus rhythm. LA strain was measurable in 363 of 378 examinations (96.5%; HFpEF: 238, NCD: 125). LA reservoir strain (29 ± 16% vs. 40 ± 13%, P < 0.001) was reduced in HFpEF relative to NCD, with associations found between LA reservoir strain and several parameters, including elevated PA systolic pressure > 2.8 m/s (+0.082, P = 0.0085), left ventricular hypertrophy (+0.0159, P < 0.0001), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (+0.0198, P < 0.0001). Indexing LA reservoir strain to estimated LA pressure (E/e') as a surrogate for LA compliance further improved diagnostic performance (AUC 0.772, P < 0.0001; +0.053 compared to LA reservoir strain alone, P = 0.003).

- **Conclusion**: Left atrial reservoir strain may provide enhanced diagnostic accuracy beyond conventional methods.

### Left atrial disease and left atrial reverse remodelling across different stages of heart failure development and progression: A new target for prevention and treatment [^112o5uVR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Low credibility.

While the effects of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on atrial function have not been assessed, new drugs acting directly on cardiac function may have an impact on the left atrium (LA). Compared with placebo, the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil improved LA function, as demonstrated by a reduced LA minimal volume and a larger emptying fraction in the Chronic Oral Study of Myosin Activation to Increase Contractility in HF (COSMIC‐HF) trial. It also reduced the risk of new‐onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke, likely through an improvement in LA function, as observed in the larger Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in HF (GALACTIC‐HF) trial.

- **Rhythm control and LA function**: Rhythm control for AF may improve LA function and patient outcomes. These effects, shown after pulmonary vein isolation, may be particularly effective in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), such as 79% of the patients analyzed in the Catheter Ablation Versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial. Improvement in LA function, as well as in outcomes, was also observed in the Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation (CASTLE‐AF) trial, which enrolled patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Our review shows that LA reverse remodelling may occur in clinical practice and be related to better outcomes. Changes in LA size and function may be associated with the progression of cardiac function and thus represent a target for treatment or serve as a surrogate measurement of the severity of cardiac conditions.

### Cardiovascular and systemic determinants of exercise capacity in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111KBfft]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) enlargement is increasingly recognized for its association with adverse cardiac outcomes, including atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure. The LA plays an important role in cardiovascular response to exercise, particularly if left ventricular (LV) diastology is impaired. In diastolic LV dysfunction, prolonged relaxation time results in a greater dependence on the atrial contribution at end-diastole for optimal filling. Diastolic filling time is inversely proportional to heart rate, and this association becomes more pronounced during exercise. Reduced LV relaxation time leads to a greater dependence on atrial contribution at end-diastole for optimal filling. Impaired atrial systolic function will compromise cardiac output during effort, highlighting the LA's role in maintaining exercise capacity.

- **Atrial geometry and alterations**: Atrial geometry, function, and electrophysiological alterations are well-defined in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and in atrial fibrillation, closely linked with reduced exercise capacity and heart failure-related outcomes. However, atrial myopathy in type 2 diabetes (T2D) appears distinct. In adults with T2D, abnormalities of LA geometry have been described, but results are contradictory. Some studies reported smaller LA volumes in subjects with T2D, while others have shown the opposite. Smaller atrial volumes are observed in T2D in the presence of HFpEF, a disease typically associated with increased LA volumes. We have recently compared patients with HFpEF with and without T2D, considering factors like higher BMI and higher filling pressures (E/e').

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^112WJwEf]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Maximum left atrial (LA) volume was defined as LA volume at end-systole just before mitral valve opening and was indexed to the body surface area to derive the LA volume index (LAVI). Global LA function indicators, LA reservoir function, early passive filling, and LA booster function are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

- **Global LA function**: Assessed by LA total emptying function (LATEF) and LA function index (LAFI), which normalizes function to stroke volume and is rhythm-independent.
- **Reservoir function**: Measures included the reservoir volume index (ResVi) and LA expansion index (LAEI), representing the relative LA volume changes during the reservoir phase.
- **Early passive LA function**: Characterized by passive LA emptying fraction.
- **LA booster function**: Characterized by LAEF Booster. Other surrogates of LA booster function included LA booster contribution to left ventricular (LV) stroke volume.

Based on previous studies, LA enlargement was defined as LAVI ≥ 62 mL/m², and normal global LA function was defined as LATEF ≥ 40%.

### Left atrial volume predicts abnormal exercise left ventricular filling pressure [^113PdomV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Latent heart failure at rest can be observed in a number of patients upon exercise. Considering left atrial (LA) remodelling as the reflection of the cumulative effects of the left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (FP) over time, the aim was to investigate whether the LA volume would predict abnormal exercise LVFP.

- **Methods and results**: Ninety patients (58.6 ± 10.8 years, 74 men) underwent exercise echocardiography. The LA maximal volume was measured by the Simpson method and indexed to body surface area. LVFP was assessed by the ratio between early peak diastolic velocities of mitral inflow and the septal annular mitral plane (E/e'). An exercise E/e' > 13 was used as a threshold to define abnormal LVFP. Indexed LA volume was correlated with E/e' at rest (r = 0.37, P = 0.003), but the correlation was better with exercise E/e' (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Patients with exercise E/e' > 13, compared with the rest of the population, were older and achieved a milder effort. An LA volume index > 33 mL/m(2) predicted abnormal exercise LVFP with a 91% sensitivity and a 78% specificity. None of the patients with an LA volume index < 29 mL/m(2) had an E/e' > 13.

Conclusion: Exercise LVFP is a determinant of LA size. The LA volume index seems to be helpful for predicting abnormal exercise LVFP. The potential use of LA remodelling to identify the patients benefitting most from exercise echocardiography should be investigated.

### Reproducibility of left atrial function using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^1136KdED]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) remodeling is associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. LA volume (LAV) and emptying fraction (LAEF) are recognized as predictors of adverse outcomes across a range of cardiovascular diseases associated with LV diastolic dysfunction, including aortic stenosis (AS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease, and heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction. In addition, LA remodeling post-intervention, such as aortic valve replacement, predicts long-term outcomes.

LA strain is an emerging imaging marker of LA function, which describes LA deformation. Typically, LA function is assessed by traditional measures such as LAV and LAEF. Assessing LA deformation may overcome the limitations of volumetric assessment, such as geometric assumptions using the biplane area length method, and may also provide very early detection of functional impairment. Strain abnormalities, even in the presence of normal LA size, have previously been shown in diabetic and hypertensive patients, as well as in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. LA strain has been reported to correlate with LV filling pressure and is a sensitive marker detecting early LV diastolic dysfunction. It is also recognized as a predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women in the general population and in diseases that are associated with ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Strain and strain rate measurement are now possible from routinely acquired cine images. This may be advantageous because of the unlimited imaging windows provided by CMR, which is recognized.

### Global left atrial failure in heart failure [^1161wYQL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The left atrium plays an important role in maintaining cardiovascular and neurohumoral homeostasis in heart failure. However, with progressive left ventricular dysfunction, left atrial (LA) dilation and mechanical failure develop, which frequently culminate in atrial fibrillation. Moreover, LA mechanical failure is accompanied by LA endocrine failure (deficient atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP] processing-synthesis/development of ANP resistance) and LA regulatory failure (dominance of sympathetic nervous system excitatory mechanisms, excessive vasopressin release) contributing to neurohumoral overactivity, vasoconstriction, and volume overload (global LA failure). The purpose of the present review is to describe the characteristics and emphasize the clinical significance of global LA failure in patients with heart failure.

### Left atrial remodeling and function in advanced heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction [^113yFAR2]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). High credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structure and function are altered in most heart failure (HF) patients, but there may be fundamental differences in LA properties between HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

- **Methods and results**: One hundred ninety-eight HF patients (51% HFpEF, New York Heart Association 3.1 ± 0.7) and 40 HF-free controls underwent catheterization, echocardiography, and follow-up. Compared with controls, HF patients had larger and more dysfunctional left atria. At identical mean LA pressure (20 versus 20 mmHg; P = 0.9), HFrEF patients had larger LA volumes (LA volume index 50 versus 41 mL/m(2); P < 0.001), whereas HFpEF patients had higher LA peak pressures, lower LA minimal pressures, higher LA stiffness (0.79 versus 0.48 mmHg/mL; P < 0.001), greater LA pulsatility (19 versus 13 mmHg; P < 0.001), and higher wall stress variations. Despite smaller LA volumes, better function, and less mitral regurgitation, HFpEF patients had more atrial fibrillation (42% versus 26%; P = 0.02). LA dysfunction was associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular dysfunction in both HF phenotypes. After a median follow-up of 350 days, 31 HFpEF and 28 HFrEF patients died. LA function (total LA EF) was associated with lower mortality in HFpEF (hazard ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.2–0.9; P < 0.05), but not in HFrEF.

- **Conclusions**: HFrEF is characterized by greater eccentric LA remodeling, whereas HFpEF is marked by increased LA stiffness, which might contribute to a greater atrial fibrillation burden. LA function is associated with pulmonary vascular resistance and has distinct implications for HF mortality based on phenotypic presentation.

### Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in the community: Impact of diagnostic criteria on the burden, correlates, and prognosis [^112mxaCJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death. Using standard criteria, age is the dominant predictor of DD; indeed, the prevalence of DD rises with advancing age, ranging from 27% to 43% in middle-aged adults to becoming almost ubiquitous (88%) in those older than 85 years. Whether DD represents a largely unavoidable consequence of cardiac senescence versus a result of accumulating cardiovascular risk factors remains unresolved. Determining the relative contributions of both nonmodifiable (age and sex) and modifiable risk factors to the development of DD is integral to disease prevention efforts.

Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function has several limitations. Reduced diastolic function is considered to be an intermediate phenotype in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction. However, HF with preserved ejection fraction trials have repeatedly demonstrated that traditional echocardiographic features of DD are not required to develop the condition and were absent in approximately one-third of patients. Furthermore, the evidence supporting DD as an independent predictor of future HF is restricted to a small number of studies. These observations contrast with data suggesting that DD is common in asymptomatic individuals in the community, with the majority having some degree of DD by advanced age.

### Left atrial reservoir function and outcome in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^111z9XRh]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume is a marker of cardiac remodeling and prognosis in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF), but LA function is rarely measured or characterized. We investigated determinants and prognostic impact of LA reservoir function in patients with HF with reduced EF.

- **Methods and results**: In 405 patients with stable HF with reduced EF (EF, ≤ 40%) in sinus rhythm, we assessed LA reservoir function by both LA total EF (by phasic volume changes) and peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS; by speckle tracking echocardiography). LA functional index was also calculated. During follow-up (median, 30 months; Q1-Q3, 13–52), 139 patients (34%) reached the composite endpoint (all-cause death/HF hospitalization). Median PALS was 15.5% (interquartile range, 11.2–20.6). By univariable analysis, all LA function parameters significantly predicted outcome (P < 0.01 for all), with PALS showing the highest predictive accuracy (area under the curve, 0.75; sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 70%).

Impaired PALS was associated with greater left ventricular and LA volumes, worse left ventricular EF, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular systolic function, and more severe diastolic dysfunction. After multivariable adjustment (including LA volume and left ventricular global longitudinal strain), PALS, but not LA total EF or LA functional index, remained significantly associated with outcome (hazard ratio per 1-SD decrease, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05–1.84; P = 0.030). Adding PALS to a base model, including age, sex, LA volume, EF, E/E' ratio, and global.

### Association of left atrial myocardial function with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in subjects with preserved systolic function: a strain rate imaging study [^116tjASs]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between left atrial (LA) myocardial function and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in subjects with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

- **Methods**: The study included a group of 118 hypertensive patients and normal subjects. LV diastolic dysfunction was classified into four groups: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Peak strain rates in systole (S-Sr), early diastole (E-Sr), and late diastole (A-Sr) were obtained from Doppler-derived strain rate imaging to evaluate LA myocardial deformation.

- **Results**: No significant difference in LA dimension was observed in subjects with different degrees of LV diastolic dysfunction, although LA myocardial strain rate parameters were all significantly different across the four groups (all with P < 0.001). Compared with patients of normal diastolic function, the mild diastolic dysfunction group had significantly lower E-Sr (0.62 ± 0.18 s⁻¹ vs 1.20 ± 0.38 s⁻¹, P < 0.001) and S-Sr (0.78 ± 0.16 s⁻¹ vs 0.94 ± 0.22 s⁻¹, P < 0.001) but increased A-Sr (1.14 ± 0.29 s⁻¹ vs 1.00 ± 0.23 s⁻¹, P = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: By using strain rate imaging, significant changes in LA deformation in response to different stages of LV diastolic dysfunction were detected in subjects with preserved LVEF. Quantification of LA myocardial function rather than LA size may have the potential to predict early LV diastolic dysfunction in subjects with preserved LVEF.

### Prognostic relevance of left atrial dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116nQYQT]. Circulation. Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) size is an established marker of risk for adverse outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the independent prognostic importance of LA function in HFpEF is not known.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed LA function measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography in 357 patients with HFpEF enrolled in the Treatment Of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial who were in sinus rhythm at the time of echocardiography. Lower peak LA strain, indicating LA dysfunction, was associated with older age, higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, worse LV and right ventricular systolic function, and worse LV diastolic function. At a mean follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range, 18–43 months), 91 patients (25.5%) experienced the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and aborted sudden death. Lower peak LA strain was associated with a higher risk of the composite endpoint (hazard ratio, 0.96 per unit of reduction in strain; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–0.99; P = 0.009) and of HF hospitalization alone (hazard ratio, 0.95 per unit of reduction in strain; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.98; P = 0.003). The association of LA strain with incident HF hospitalization remained significant after adjustment for clinical confounders, but not after further adjustment for LV global longitudinal strain and the E/E' ratio, parameters of LV systolic and diastolic function, respectively.

LA dysfunction in HFpEF is associated with significant clinical outcomes, although further adjustments may affect the strength of these associations.

### Structural and functional remodeling of the left atrium: Clinical and therapeutic implications for atrial fibrillation [^116fmyL2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Left atrial (LA) structural and functional remodeling reflects a spectrum of pathophysiological changes that have occurred in response to specific stressors. These changes include alterations at the levels of ionic channels, cellular energy balance, neurohormonal expression, inflammatory response, and physiologic adaptations. There is convincing evidence demonstrating an important pathophysiological association between LA remodeling and atrial fibrillation (AF). Measures that will prevent, attenuate, or halt these processes of LA remodeling may have a major public health impact with respect to the epidemic of AF.

In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in LA remodeling and highlight the existing and potential therapeutic options for its reversal, and implications for AF development.

### The predictive value of changes in left atrial volume index for rehospitalization in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114KZ8Sv]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide and affects at least 26 million people. According to the left ventricular ejection fraction, HF is classified into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Among these, HFpEF has grown to become the dominant form of HF and increases with age, reaching 70% in patients over 65 years of age. At the time of writing, no treatment has been shown to convincingly reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with HFpEF. Thus, it is urgent to search for a reliable marker that can effectively predict the prognosis of HFpEF.

HFpEF is characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV diastolic dysfunction, and left atrial (LA) enlargement. The left atrial volume index (LAVI), measured by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography, is an accurate descriptor of LA volume and is recommended in the latest guidelines for the diagnosis of HFpEF. The 2015 recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults, from the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) in association with the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI), indicated that LAVI can be categorized as normal (≤ 34 ml/m²), mild dysfunction (34–41 ml/m²), moderate dysfunction (42–48 ml/m²), and severe dysfunction (> 48 ml/m²). However, LAVI is a dynamic parameter; the expansion of LAVI occurs during cardiac injury, abnormal neurohormonal factors, and sustained cardiac pressure and/or volume overload.

### Atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation: pathophysiology, definition, diagnosis, and treatment [^114JZrpn]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation may occur even in the absence of atrial fibrillation (AF), especially when atrial myopathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)-related factors, such as aging, female sex, and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, are present. The concept of right atrial (RA) myopathy is increasingly recognized and may explain why a significant proportion of isolated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients (up to 38% in the European Society of Cardiology - Heart Failure Association, Heart Failure Long-Term Registry) do not have any history of AF. Recent data showed that RA mechanics, together with minimal RA size, may be more relevant than maximal RA volume for the atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation (A-STR) pathophysiology.

Right atrial function, in terms of reservoir strain and haemodynamics, is more altered in A-STR patients compared with other TR etiologies and in massive–torrential compared with severe TR. The minimal RA volume and tricuspid annulus (TA) area were reported to be the only predictors of secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) severity, while the maximal right ventricular (RV) volume and RA volume were not. Although maximal RA volume is similar in A-STR and ventricular secondary tricuspid regurgitation (V-STR) for the same TR severity, the larger TA area, coupled with insufficient tricuspid valve (TV) adaptative growth, leads to severe A-STR even in the absence of leaflet tethering. The concept of RA myopathy in relation to HFpEF and the role of rhythm control in AF to restore RA function and potentially improve A-STR need to be further clarified.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^111peoke]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The consensus document has excellent clinical utility potential with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic validity. As the writing committee plans to periodically refine the universal definition, this offers opportunities to further refine the definition of heart failure (HF) to best guide management strategies. Here, we highlight a few areas where we anticipate further guidance, particularly regarding a more detailed classification of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), appropriation of congestion values based on clinical characteristics, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in different populations, and evolving automated diagnostic capabilities.

- **Focus on etiology, but not cardiac abnormality for HFpEF**: The universal definition of HF requires the presence of structural and/or functional abnormalities. Typically, the echocardiographic abnormalities that underpin an HFpEF diagnosis, while potentially prognostic, include ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and mitral annular velocities. However, these parameters are neither sensitive nor specific in the context of HFpEF, as evidenced by large-scale trials. Nearly a third of patients enrolled in I-PRESERVE and TOPCAT had normal diastolic function (31% and 34%, respectively). Although atrial enlargement is viewed as the litmus test for diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF, only mild Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction (29% and 22%) and mild atrial enlargement (51% and 19%) were noted in both studies, respectively. The limitations of echocardiographic evaluations of diastole also add to the subjectivity in structural assessments.

### Left atrial myocardial mechanics: association with cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, and circulating biomarkers [^111jhx4B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Baseline transthoracic echocardiography was performed in accordance with American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. Measures included those of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) chamber size (LA volume index, LV mass index [LVMI], LV diastolic and systolic dimensions), as well as LV systolic (LV ejection fraction) and diastolic function (E/e', pulmonary artery systolic pressure). Phasic LA strain — reservoir (LASr), conduit (LAScd), and contractile (LASct) — corresponding to the LA reservoir, conduit, and contractile phases of the LA cycle, respectively, were determined with Automated Function Imaging software (EchoPAC v110.1.8, GE Healthcare) via speckle‐tracking echocardiography. LA strain analyses were performed by a single experienced echocardiologist (L.H.L.) using R‐R gating along a region of interest delineated by the endocardial border and averaged from 12 segments in biplane apical views acquired at 60 to 80 Hz.

- **Atrial strain measurement by speckle‐tracking echocardiography**:

- **Region of interest**: Delineated by the endocardial border of the LA during speckle‐tracking echocardiography.
- **LA strain curve**: Exhibits three phases — reservoir (LASr), conduit (LAScd), and contractile (LASct) strain. LASr is measured as the difference in strain values between mitral valve opening and LV end‐diastole, LAScd is measured as the difference in strain values at the onset of atrial contraction and mitral valve opening, and LASct is the difference in strain values at LV end‐diastole and the onset of atrial contraction.

### Left atrial functional impairment as a predictor of atrial fibrillation: Insights from cardiac CT [^112xtQmX]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

A strong association exists between left atrial (LA) structural remodeling and the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the role of LA function in AF prediction remains unclear. This study examined the relationship between LA function and incident AF using cardiac CT.

We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent multiphasic cardiac CT. LA volumes and parameters of LA global, reservoir, and booster function were calculated. The association between measures of LA function and incident AF was analyzed using multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for clinical variables, LA volume, and left ventricular function.

A total of 1,025 patients (age 64 years ± 14) were evaluated. Over a median of 3.9 years, 90 patients developed AF. There was a significant association between LA total emptying fraction (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02–1.05 per 1% decrease, p < 0.001), LA reservoir function (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02–1.06 per 1 mL/m² decrease in LA expansion index, p < 0.001), and passive LA emptying (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.13 per 1% decrease in LA passive emptying fraction, p < 0.001) with incident AF, but no association with LA booster function. Incorporating LA function into predictive models improved risk stratification beyond clinical variables and LA volume. Mediation analysis demonstrated that 46% of the effect of LA volume on AF was mediated via LA dysfunction.

LA functional impairment is common even in patients with normal LA volume and provides additional prognostic information for AF risk. The findings underscore the significance of this relationship.

### Phenotypes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: An illustrative review of MRI findings [^114zrK8o]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The left atrial size in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is often enlarged, which provides critical prognostic information. An enlarged left atrium (LA) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular patients and is considered a marker for the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and potentially lethal arrhythmic events among HCM patients. Volumetric MR quantification is the best approach to assess LA size but may be time-consuming. An area of ≥ 15 cm²/m² and a transverse diameter of ≥ 2.8 cm/m² in the four-chamber view are valuable alternatives for identifying LA enlargement.

The cause of LA enlargement is multifactorial, with common mechanisms including SAM-related mitral regurgitation and elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures. Mild or moderate LA dilatation is common and relates to LV diastolic dysfunction, whereas severe LA dilatation is frequently seen when mitral regurgitation is associated with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Atrial fibrillation, the most common arrhythmia in HCM (20%), is strongly predicted by LA remodeling, independent of age and functional class.

- **Microvascular ischemia**: The hallmarks of HCM include LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, and microvascular ischemia. Whether these features are causally linked has not been determined at the time of writing. Microvascular ischemia in HCM is attributed to increased oxygen requirements due to hypertrophy, impaired ventricular relaxation, microvascular dysfunction of intramyocardial arterioles, and LVOT obstruction. It is associated with chest pain, clinical deterioration, diastolic dysfunction, and adverse prognosis.

### Application of classic heart failure definitions of asymptomatic and symptomatic ventricular dysfunction and heart failure symptoms with preserved ejection fraction to patients with systemic right ventricles [^117FCPdK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure guidelines classify patients into subgroups with asymptomatic versus symptomatic ventricular dysfunction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In this study, this approach was applied to patients with complete transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch to assess how this classification fits patients with systemic right ventricles.

The study included stable adult patients post-atrial switch, stratified according to:

- **Preserved versus impaired systolic function**: Fractional area change ≥ 0.40 vs. < 0.40.
- **Absence versus presence of symptoms**
- **Absence versus presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR)**
- **Normal versus elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels**

Twenty-two out of 42 participants (52.4%; mean age 18.2 ± 2.8 years) had preserved systolic function, while 20 (47.6%) had impaired systolic function. Ten patients (23.8%) exhibited asymptomatic right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, which was associated more frequently with significant TR (p = 0.04) and elevated BNP levels (p = 0.008) compared to asymptomatic patients with preserved systolic function. Normal BNP levels independently predicted preserved RV function in all patients (odds ratio 6.4, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 39.1, p = 0.04) and in asymptomatic patients (odds ratio 14.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 176.2, p = 0.03). Heart failure symptoms with preserved systolic function were observed in 5 patients (11.9%), including 3 patients with significant TR.

### Left atrium and cardiovascular risk: Does functionality matter more than size [^111AveBV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The left atrium (LA) is often regarded as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk. It serves several important functions: it modulates left ventricular filling and cardiovascular performance by functioning as a reservoir for pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole; it is a conduit for pulmonary venous return during early ventricular diastole; and it functions as a booster pump that augments ventricular filling during late ventricular diastole. It is highly dynamic and demonstrates structural, functional, and electrical remodeling in a time-dependent manner in response to various pathophysiological insults. The hallmark of structural remodeling is atrial dilatation, which is frequently accompanied by increased interstitial fibrosis with cardiac structural alterations.

Functional impairment may occur with or without alteration in LA size. Remodeling that occurs in the initial phase is often reversible, in contrast to remodeling that occurs with ongoing "stressors" over longer duration. These maladaptive changes have a strong association with a wide array of conditions, including heart failure, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea. In tandem with structural change, electrophysiologic abnormalities develop, including global and regional conduction slowing and changes in refractoriness predisposing to onset of atrial arrhythmias and ultimately atrial fibrillation (AF).

### Left atrial structure and function, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111LbutQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Defining left atrial (LA) function has recently emerged as a powerful parameter, particularly in the evaluation of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Echocardiographic assessment of LVDD remains a challenging task; recent recommendations provide a simpler approach than previous methods. However, the shortcomings of the proposed approach, including transmitral flow, tissue velocity, maximum left atrial volume (LAV), and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, lead to the presence and severity of LVDD remaining undetermined in a significant proportion of patients.

Maximum LAV is a surrogate measure of the chronicity and severity of LVDD, but LAV alone is an insensitive biomarker of the early phases of LVDD, because the LA may take time to remodel. Because the primary function of the LA is to modulate LV filling, it is not surprising that functional LA changes become evident at the earliest stages of LVDD. Moreover, LA function may provide additive value, not only in diagnosing LVDD but also in grading its severity and in monitoring the effects of treatment. The review provides a critical appraisal of the existing evidence for the role of LA metrics in the evaluation of LVDD and consequent heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Left atrial function predicts heart failure hospitalization in subjects with preserved ejection fraction and coronary heart disease: longitudinal data from the Heart and Soul Study [^111fEB8a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine whether left atrial (LA) dysfunction predicts heart failure (HF) hospitalization in subjects with preserved baseline ejection fraction (EF). Among patients with preserved EF, factors leading to HF are not fully understood. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated LA dysfunction at the time of HF, but longitudinal data on antecedent atrial function are lacking.

We performed resting transthoracic echocardiography on 855 subjects with coronary heart disease and EF ≥ 50%. The left atrial functional index (LAFI) was calculated. We used Cox models to evaluate the association between LAFI and HF hospitalization.

Over a median follow-up of 7.9 years, 106 participants (12.4%) were hospitalized for HF. Rates of HF hospitalization were inversely proportional to quartile (Q) of LAFI: Q1, 47 per 1,000 person-years; Q2, 18.3; Q3, 9.6; and Q4, 5.3 (p < 0.001). Each standard deviation decrease in LAFI was associated with a 2.6-fold increased hazard of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (unadjusted hazard ratio: 2.6, 95% confidence interval: 2.1 to 3.3, p < 0.001), and the association persisted even after adjustment for clinical risk factors, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and a wide range of echocardiographic parameters (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.0).

### Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy have global left atrial dysfunction and impaired atrio-ventricular coupling [^116rns7X]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively investigate left atrial (LA) reservoir, conduit, and booster pump functions, as well as their predictors in patients with primary systemic arterial hypertension (HTN) and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy.

Thirty patients with HTN and LV hypertrophy, but no history of atrial arrhythmia or heart failure, were compared with 29 normotensive controls. Speckle-tracking echocardiography of the LA wall was used to measure systolic and diastolic strains and strain rates. Early diastolic velocity of transmitral flow/early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E/E')/peak systolic LA strain (S-LAs) was used as an index of LA stiffness.

- **Results**: HTN patients had higher LV mass index, impaired LV diastolic function, and higher LA volume index than controls. LA reservoir, conduit, and booster pump functions were significantly lower, and LA stiffness was greater. Multiple regression analysis indicated that increased LV mass and LV filling pressures, as well as reduced LV strain or E', were predictors for reduced atrial function.

- **Conclusion**: HTN patients showed a significant impairment of the three components of LA function. These changes were correlated with LV hypertrophy and dysfunction, and presumably related to LA fibrotic changes, underlining the importance of LA-LV coupling. The prognostic value of these new speckle-tracking echocardiography-based LA strain indices needs to be evaluated by future studies.
