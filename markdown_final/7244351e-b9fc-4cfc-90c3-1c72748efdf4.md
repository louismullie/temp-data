## Question

Women over 40 with breast lump what imaging to use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal imaging strategy for a woman aged 40 years or older who presents with a palpable breast lump. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why age 40 is a key inflection point. Then, I should verify the first-line imaging modality and whether tomosynthesis is preferred. Next, I will examine when to add targeted ultrasound and why it is complementary rather than a replacement. After that, I need to check the limited role of MRI and other advanced imaging. I will then review exceptions, including fatty breasts and pregnancy/lactation. Finally, I should confirm management pathways based on imaging outcomes, including when to proceed to image-guided biopsy and how to handle negative imaging when clinical suspicion remains high [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^111WuyUU].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why age 40 matters. In women 40 and older, the baseline risk of breast cancer rises and mammography becomes the cornerstone of both screening and diagnostic evaluation; symptomatic presentations, including palpable masses, warrant diagnostic mammography as the initial test because it detects calcifications and architectural distortion that ultrasound can miss, and it provides a global assessment of both breasts, which is essential for management planning [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^111WuyUU].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line modality and whether digital breast tomosynthesis is preferred. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria endorse diagnostic mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis as the initial imaging for women aged 40 years or older with a palpable mass; tomosynthesis improves sensitivity and specificity over 2D mammography in many settings, so if available, DBT is a reasonable first choice, though standard diagnostic mammography remains acceptable [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping after mammography. I need to ensure we add targeted ultrasound in most cases because ultrasound characterizes whether a palpable finding is cystic or solid, guides management toward aspiration versus biopsy, and detects lesions that may be occult on mammography; importantly, ultrasound complements mammography by improving detection of masses in dense breasts and by enabling image-guided biopsy if needed [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^111WuyUU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could ultrasound alone suffice in this age group. I should double-check that. Even though targeted ultrasound has high diagnostic performance in symptomatic women, it is not sufficient as a stand-alone modality in women 40 and older because it can miss calcifications and subtle architectural distortion; therefore, the standard remains diagnostic mammography followed by targeted ultrasound unless a clearly benign correlate is identified on mammography and clinical correlation is perfect [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^111WuyUU].

> I will now examine the limited role of MRI and other advanced imaging. MRI is not indicated as an initial test for a palpable mass in average-risk women because of false positives, cost, and limited availability; it may be considered selectively for problem-solving if conventional imaging is equivocal, for suspected multifocal or multicentric disease, or in special scenarios such as invasive lobular carcinoma or when assessing extent of disease for surgical planning, but it should not replace mammography and ultrasound in the initial workup [^111WuyUU] [^114st56g] [^111bYDCA].

> But wait, what if the breasts are almost entirely fatty. Let me consider exceptions. In women with predominantly fatty breast composition, diagnostic mammography alone can have very high sensitivity and negative predictive value for palpable symptoms; in such cases, if the mammogram shows a clearly benign correlate or no correlate and clinical suspicion is low, omitting ultrasound may be reasonable, though many practices still add ultrasound for comprehensive characterization and to enable biopsy guidance if needed [^116rMbQa].

> I need to check pregnancy and lactation scenarios because they alter the sequence. In pregnant or lactating patients, ultrasound is the initial modality of choice due to safety and physiologic changes; mammography can be performed with shielding if ultrasound is suspicious or indeterminate, and MRI is generally avoided in pregnancy due to gadolinium concerns, so the age-based algorithm is modified accordingly in these special populations [^113vXsc5] [^116FrVZs].

> Next, I should review management pathways after imaging. If mammography and ultrasound are concordant and benign, routine follow-up is appropriate; if probably benign, short-interval follow-up is reasonable; if suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy, image-guided core needle biopsy should be performed, with ultrasound guidance preferred when the lesion is sonographically visible; if imaging is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, I must not be reassured falsely and should pursue biopsy or close clinical follow-up because a small subset of cancers are imaging-occult [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^113NvAwL].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical sequencing and reporting workflow. Ideally, diagnostic mammography and targeted ultrasound are obtained in the same session and interpreted together by the radiologist to ensure concordance and streamline management; this co-interpretation reduces discordance and facilitates immediate decisions about aspiration, biopsy, or follow-up, which improves patient experience and timeliness of care [^117AhdTb].

> Let me reconsider the core principle to ensure nothing is missing. For a woman aged 40 years or older with a palpable breast lump, the evidence-based approach is diagnostic mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis first, followed by targeted ultrasound in most cases, with management determined by combined imaging and clinical findings; MRI and other advanced imaging are reserved for select problem-solving scenarios, and negative imaging should never override a highly suspicious clinical examination [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] [^111WuyUU].

For women over 40 with a breast lump, **diagnostic mammography is the first-line imaging** [^115JBhqQ] because it detects calcifications and architectural distortion typical of malignancy [^113vqr4K]. Ultrasound is added **immediately after mammography** [^114st56g] to characterize the lump, distinguish solid from cystic lesions, and guide biopsy if needed [^117XAzjz]. MRI is reserved for **equivocal cases** [^1165XkxT], suspected multifocal/multicentric disease, or high-risk patients [^117MjAZy]. This two-step approach balances sensitivity, specificity, and radiation exposure, and is endorsed by ACR and EUSOBI [^115JBhqQ] [^1165XkxT].

## Recommended imaging sequence

Key elements of the recommended imaging sequence:

| **Aspect** | **Diagnostic mammography** | **Targeted breast ultrasound** |
|-|-|-|
| Role in sequence | Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging test for women aged ≥ 40 years with a palpable breast lump [^115JBhqQ] [^114st56g] | Targeted ultrasound is performed immediately after mammography [^117AhdTb] to evaluate the palpable lump [^111WuyUU] |
| Rationale or purpose | Mammography detects calcifications, architectural distortion, and masses that may not be visible on ultrasound, particularly in older women [^113vqr4K] | Ultrasound differentiates solid from cystic lesions, characterizes masses, and guides biopsy if indicated [^117XAzjz] |
| Modality-specific notes | DBT (3D mammography) is preferred when available, as it improves detection and reduces false positives compared to 2D mammography [^11392Xik] | Ultrasound findings must be correlated with mammographic and clinical findings to ensure accurate diagnosis and management [^114st56g] |

---

## Role of MRI

MRI is **not routinely indicated** for initial evaluation of a palpable breast lump in women over 40 [^114st56g]. It is reserved for **specific scenarios**, including:

- **Equivocal findings**: When mammography and ultrasound are inconclusive or discordant [^117MjAZy].

- **High-risk patients**: Those with known genetic mutations (e.g. BRCA) or strong family history [^111bYDCA].

- **Multifocal/multicentric disease**: Suspected or confirmed [^117MjAZy].

- **Preoperative planning**: To assess extent of disease in selected cases [^111bYDCA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Indication** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|
| Diagnostic mammography | First-line for palpable lump in women ≥ 40 years | Initial imaging |
| Targeted ultrasound | Immediate adjunct to mammography | Immediately after mammography |
| MRI | - Equivocal findings <br/> - High-risk patients <br/> - Multifocal disease <br/> - Preoperative planning | Reserved for specific scenarios |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Efficiency**: The two-step approach (mammography followed by ultrasound) efficiently evaluates palpable lumps, minimizing unnecessary biopsies and radiation exposure [^114st56g].

- **Accuracy**: Combining mammography and ultrasound improves diagnostic accuracy, detecting both calcified and non-calcified lesions [^113vqr4K].

- **Patient-centered care**: This approach aligns with patient preferences for timely, accurate diagnosis and minimal radiation exposure [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

For women over 40 with a breast lump, **diagnostic mammography followed by targeted ultrasound** is the recommended imaging sequence. MRI is reserved for specific clinical scenarios. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis, appropriate management, and optimal patient outcomes [^114st56g].

### Imaging management of palpable breast abnormalities [^1139EuZJ]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Women commonly present to imaging departments with a palpable breast abnormality. However, widespread confusion remains regarding the most appropriate sequence and extent of imaging required. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evidence informing current management guidelines for the care of patients with palpable breast abnormalities.

Conclusion

Ultrasound is a highly effective imaging tool for guiding effective evaluation of women with palpable breast abnormalities and should be used for all women with suspicious findings at clinical breast examination. The exception is cases in which mammography shows a clearly benign correlate or a normal, fatty area of breast tissue in the location of the palpable finding. Breast ultrasound should be the primary imaging tool for women with palpable lumps who are pregnant, lactating, or younger than 30 years. For women 40 years old and older, mammography, followed in most cases by ultrasound, is recommended. For women 30–39 years old, ultrasound or mammography may be performed first at the discretion of the radiologist or referring provider. There is little to no role for breast MRI or other advanced imaging technologies in the routine diagnostic evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities.

### ACR appropriateness criteria palpable breast masses [^114st56g]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

A palpable breast mass is one of the most common presenting features of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical features are frequently nonspecific. Imaging performed before biopsy is helpful in characterizing the nature of the mass. For women with clinically detected breast masses, the vast majority will require evaluation with ultrasound. Diagnostic mammography is the initial imaging modality of choice for women aged ≥ 40 years; ultrasound is typically necessary unless a definitively benign mass is identified as the etiology of the clinical finding. For evaluating women aged < 30 years and women who are pregnant or lactating, ultrasound is used for initial evaluation. For women aged 30 to 39 years, either ultrasound or diagnostic mammography may be used for initial evaluation. MRI is rarely indicated to evaluate a clinically detected finding. Biopsy is indicated for masses with suspicious features. Short-term follow-up is a reasonable alternative to biopsy for solid masses with probably benign features suggesting fibroadenoma. Correlation between imaging and the clinical finding is essential. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria ® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of palpable breast abnormalities [^111WuyUU]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

A palpable breast abnormality is one of the most common presenting clinical breast complaints. Although the majority of palpable abnormalities are benign, they are among the most common presenting symptoms of breast cancer, and those breast cancers detected symptomatically tend to have poorer prognosis than their screen-detected counterparts. Clinical breast examination is a vital part of the workup of palpable abnormalities. However, as physical exam features of most masses are not reliable for categorization of malignancy, imaging evaluation is necessary. Choice of imaging modality, which includes diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasound, is dependent upon patient age. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality for evaluation of palpable masses in women younger than 30 years of age because of its high negative predictive value and sensitivity and lack of ionizing radiation. For women aged 30–39 years, ultrasound or mammography can be performed as the initial imaging evaluation, with ultrasound maintaining a high sensitivity in women younger than 40 years old. Mammography, often followed by ultrasound, is the recommended imaging evaluation sequence for women aged 40 and older. Utilization of advanced imaging modalities for evaluation of the palpable area of concern is not supported by evidence.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® palpable breast masses: 2022 update [^115JBhqQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Palpable masses in women are the most common symptom associated with breast cancer. This document reviews and evaluates the current evidence for imaging recommendations of palpable masses in women less than 30 to over 40 years of age. There is also a review of several different scenarios and recommendations after initial imaging. Ultrasound is usually the appropriate initial imaging for women under 30 years of age. If ultrasound findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy (BIRADS 4 or 5), it is usually appropriate to continue with diagnostic tomosynthesis or mammography with image-guided biopsy. No further imaging is recommended if the ultrasound is benign or negative. The patient under 30 years of age with a probably benign ultrasound may undergo further imaging; however, the clinical scenario plays a role in the decision to biopsy. For women between 30 to 39 years of age, ultrasound, diagnostic mammography, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound are usually appropriate. Diagnostic mammography and tomosynthesis are the appropriate initial imaging for women 40 years of age or older, as ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a negative mammogram within 6 months of presentation or immediately after mammography findings are suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy. If the diagnostic mammogram, tomosynthesis, and ultrasound findings are probably benign, no further imaging is necessary unless the clinical scenario indicates a biopsy.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaPalpable breast Masses [^115HQ2DZ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy and the second leading cause of female cancer death in the United States. Although the majority of palpable breast lumps are benign, a new palpable breast mass is a common presenting sign of breast cancer. Any woman presenting with a palpable lesion should have a thorough clinical breast examination, but because many breast masses may not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is necessary in almost all cases to characterize the palpable lesion. Recommended imaging options in the context of a palpable mass include diagnostic mammography and targeted-breast ultrasound and are dependent on patient age and degree of radiologic suspicion as detailed in the document Variants. There is little role for advanced technologies such as MRI, positron emission mammography, or molecular breast imaging in the evaluation of a palpable mass. When a suspicious finding is identified, biopsy is indicated. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^116ZHjXw]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a safe and widely available method for breast imaging. It is the method of choice when assessing young women (under age 40) with a palpable lump and a complementary method after mammography in older women with a palpable lump. Breast cancer screening with breast US alone is discouraged, while supplemental screening with US may be an option to be considered for women with dense breasts, even though associated with a high false positive rate. When a tissue diagnosis is needed for a suspicious lesion, US-guided biopsy should be preferred if the lesion is clearly identified with this method.

### ESR essentials: diagnostic work-up in patients with symptomatic breast disease-practice recommendations by the European society of breast imaging [^1165XkxT]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast complaints are frequent reasons for consultations in primary care or breast clinics. Breast pain, breast lumps, and nipple discharge are the most common complaints. Less common symptoms such as skin changes and axillary abnormalities also require specific diagnostic approaches. Imaging the symptomatic breast should be performed by appropriately trained breast radiologists following the best practice guidelines and quality standards. Full-field digital mammography (FFDM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and breast ultrasound (US) are the main modalities used in this primary setting. The choice depends on the patient's age and symptoms. Women younger than 30-years-old are first imaged by US, whereas women over 40-years-old usually require both FFDM or DBT and US. For women between 30-years-old and 40-years-old, the US is the modality of choice, whereas FFDM or DBT might also be performed if needed. Pregnant or lactating women with palpable lesions or nipple discharge are imaged with US as the first method; FFDM or DBT can also be performed depending on the degree of suspicion as the dose to the fetus is minimal, and shielding may even further reduce the dose. More advanced techniques such as breast magnetic resonance imaging or contrast-enhanced mammography are not indicated in this first diagnostic setting and are reserved for cases of established malignancy (local staging) or rare cases of equivocal findings not otherwise resolved or inflammatory breast cancer. Last, but not least, male breast symptoms should also be addressed with US and/or FFDM. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: It is equally important to correctly diagnose an underlying malignancy and to avoid false positives that would lead to unnecessary biopsies, increased costs, and anxiety for the patient. Proper use of imaging modalities ensures optimal diagnostic approach and minimizes false negatives. KEY POINTS: Ultrasound, full-field digital mammography, or digital breast tomosynthesis are the main imaging modalities in the diagnostic setting, while MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography should be reserved to selected cases. Initial imaging modality includes ultrasound combined with mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis depending on women's age and the presence (or not) of inconclusive findings. A negative imaging evaluation should not deter biopsy when a highly suspicious finding is found on physical examination.

### Women's perspectives on ultrasound as primary imaging modality for focal breast complaints: a qualitative study [^115PvPLR]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Every year, tens of thousands of women visit a hospital's radiology department with breast complaints, such as lumps, focal pain, or nipple and skin abnormalities. In the Netherlands, for women > 30-years-old mammography (mostly digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)) is the standard first-line imaging modality for breast evaluation, followed by targeted ultrasound (US). However, in the past decades, multiple studies have been done to investigate the potential of targeted US as a primary diagnostic test, showing high sensitivity and specificity with US as a stand-alone modality. However, these studies were mainly focused on the younger female population (under 40 years or 45 years).

The prospective breast ultrasound trial (BUST) was designed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of US in women of all ages. This study showed high diagnostic accuracy of US in symptomatic women (sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 90.7%), with only limited added value of additional DBT (0.2%) for the evaluation of the focal complaints. In 0.4% of the women malignant incidental findings in asymptomatic areas were detected. Therefore, we interpret these results as promising evidence for US as the first-line diagnostic test in terms of clinical performance. In fact, the European Society of Breast Imaging has recently recommended the initial US in women between 30-years-old and 40-years-old. However, little is known about women's perspectives on the implementation of this alternative clinical pathway.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging after breast surgery [^115k5UEg]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that 20% to 40% of women who have percutaneous breast biopsy subsequently undergo breast surgery, knowledge of imaging women with a history of benign (including high-risk) disease or breast cancer is important. For women who had surgery for nonmalignant pathology, the surveillance recommendations are determined by their overall risk. Higher-than-average risk women with a history of benign surgery may require screening mammography starting at an earlier age before 40 and may benefit from screening MRI. For women with breast cancer who have undergone initial excision and have positive margins, imaging with diagnostic mammography or MRI can sometimes guide additional surgical planning. Women who have completed breast conservation therapy for cancer should get annual mammography and may benefit from the addition of MRI or ultrasound to their surveillance regimen. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^113vqr4K]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic assessment

In patients with symptoms or signs suspicious for breast cancer, which typically comprise palpable lumps (but also, nipple inversion, localised skin retraction or other modifications, serous or bloody nipple discharge), US is an established tool complementing clinical examination and mammography at all ages. It is the method of choice for assessing breast lumps in young women. US can also reveal the origin of the symptoms in patients with painful cysts. When patients present with unilateral, localised, non-cyclic breast pain, the chance of malignancy is as low as 1%. In pregnant or lactating women with a palpable lump, focal breast pain, or nipple discharge, US is also the initial modality of choice for identifying most benign and malignant masses. However, when needed, using adequate shielding, mammography can be supplemented even during pregnancy and injury to the unborn baby is not expected beyond week 16.

Patients presenting with diffuse breast pain, usually in association with the premenstrual phase, are often evaluated and treated only on a clinical basis.

Assessment of lesions detected by mammography

Targeted US plays a complementary role when a mass or an asymmetry is seen on a mammogram. It may help in differentiating cystic from solid lesions and excluding or identifying a solid mass underlying an asymmetry. In the presence of clustered calcifications, particularly clusters larger than 10 mm, US can depict associated masses, ductal change, or intracystic lesions, cysts and microcysts that may be crucial for diagnosis.
Note E: Mammography is clearly superior to US in identifying and characterising calcifications. However, in the presence of calcifications on mammography, targeted US is recommended to reveal possible underlying masses.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast Pain [^112AQ6ws]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast pain (or tenderness) is a common symptom, experienced by up to 80% of women at some point in their lives. Fortunately, it is rarely associated with breast cancer. However, breast pain remains a common cause of referral for diagnostic breast imaging evaluation. Appropriate workup depends on the nature and focality of the pain, as well as the age of the patient. Imaging evaluation is usually not indicated if the pain is cyclic or nonfocal. For focal, noncyclic pain, imaging may be appropriate, mainly for reassurance and to identify treatable causes. Ultrasound can be the initial examination used to evaluate women under 30 with focal, noncyclic breast pain; for women 30 and older, diagnostic mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, and ultrasound may all serve as appropriate initial examinations. However, even in the setting of focal, noncyclic pain, cancer as an etiology is rare. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast pain [^115uK6hB]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast pain is a common complaint. However, in the absence any accompanying suspicious clinical finding (eg, lump or nipple discharge), the association with malignancy is very low (0%-3.0%). When malignancy-related, breast pain tends to be focal (less than one quadrant) and persistent. Pain that is clinically insignificant (nonfocal [greater than one quadrant], diffuse, or cyclical) requires no imaging beyond what is recommended for screening. In cases of pain that is clinically significant (focal and noncyclical), imaging with mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and ultrasound are appropriate, depending on the patient's age. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on palpable breast masses [^115CRwJr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Palpable breast masses may become evident during breast self-examination or clinical breast examination or retrospectively after screening mammography. Because most breast masses do not exhibit distinctive physical findings, imaging evaluation is almost always necessary to characterize the lesions and screen the reminder of both breasts. Depending on age, the primary imaging evaluation of a palpable breast mass is mammography or breast ultrasound. Negative imaging results should not deter the biopsy of a clinically suspicious breast mass.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^1156WNSp]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging techniques

Mammography

Diagnostic breast imaging is not necessary for physiological nipple discharge. However, when PND is suspected, an initial imaging evaluation with FFDM and ultrasound (US) is normally carried out.

According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for the evaluation of nipple discharge, the first-line imaging technique in women aged 40 years or older is either FFDM or DBT, usually complemented by US. For women aged 30 to 39 years, the ACR supports the use of either FFDM/DBT or US as the initial imaging modality, depending on institutional preference and individual patient factors. While the incidence of breast cancer before the age of 40 years is low — approximately 7% — some experts recommend US as the initial imaging assessment in this age group to minimise the cumulative risk of malignancy from ionising radiation. FFDM/DBT may be added only if risk factors for breast cancer are present or if malignancy is suspected based on US findings. Furthermore, in symptomatic women aged 30 to 39 years, US has higher sensitivity than FFDM (95.7% versus 60.9%).

### ACR appropriateness criteria stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^113opNUQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Women newly diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer have an early-stage disease that can be effectively treated. Evidence provides little justification for performing imaging to exclude metastasis in asymptomatic women with stage I breast cancer. No differences have been found in survival or quality of life in women regardless of whether they underwent initial workup for metastatic disease. These women generally prefer intensive follow-up to detect an early recurrence. However, survival rates do not differ between women who obtain intensive screening and surveillance, with imaging and laboratory studies, and women who undergo testing only as a result of development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. In addition, quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients. Additional imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review by the panel include extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. When evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaEvaluation of nipple discharge [^1137uwkK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate imaging evaluation of nipple discharge depends the nature of the discharge. Imaging is not indicated for women with physiologic nipple discharge. For evaluation of pathologic nipple discharge, multiple breast imaging modalities are rated for evidence-based appropriateness under various scenarios. For women age 40 or older, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) should be the initial examination. Ultrasound is usually added as a complementary examination, with some exceptions. For women age 30 to 39, either mammogram or ultrasound may be used as the initial examination on the basis of institutional preference. For women age 30 or younger, ultrasound should be the initial examination, with mammography/DBT added when ultrasound shows suspicious findings or if the patient is predisposed to developing breast cancer. For men age 25 or older, mammography/DBT should be performed initially, with ultrasound added as indicated, given the high incidence of breast cancer in men with pathologic nipple discharge. Although MRI and ductography are not usually appropriate as initial examinations, each may be useful when the initial standard imaging evaluation is negative. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^114CxG2b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes is considered. National and international guidelines discourage the use of staging imaging for asymptomatic patients newly diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, even if there is nodal involvement, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and affect outcomes. In asymptomatic patients with a history of stage I breast cancer that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrences. However, routine surveillance with an annual mammogram is the only imaging test that should be performed to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Charged with discharge: a case-based review of nipple discharge using the American college of radiology's appropriateness guidelines [^111AtwfA]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Nipple discharge, a relatively common presenting symptom for women of all ages, may be due to both benign and malignant conditions. Men can also present with nipple discharge, and when they do, they have a higher likelihood of malignancy than women. Radiologists vary in their evaluation of patients with nipple discharge, although the American College of Radiology practice guidelines for nipple discharge provides data-driven appropriate algorithms. In patients with physiologic discharge, imaging is not typically indicated. For those with pathologic nipple discharge, imaging typically starts with diagnostic mammography and retroareolar ultrasound for women over 40 years of age, diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound for women aged 30–39 years, and ultrasound for women younger than 30 years. Finally, contrast-enhanced breast MRI or galactography are usually reserved for identifying the cause of discharge when initial imaging with mammography and ultrasound is unrevealing.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^1158zPN7]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

This article summarises the information that should be provided to women and referring physicians about breast ultrasound (US). After explaining the physical principles, technical procedure and safety of US, information is given about its ability to make a correct diagnosis, depending on the setting in which it is applied. The following definite indications for breast US in female subjects are proposed: palpable lump; axillary adenopathy; first diagnostic approach for clinical abnormalities under 40 and in pregnant or lactating women; suspicious abnormalities at mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); suspicious nipple discharge; recent nipple inversion; skin retraction; breast inflammation; abnormalities in the area of the surgical scar after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy; abnormalities in the presence of breast implants; screening high-risk women, especially when MRI is not performed; loco-regional staging of a known breast cancer, when MRI is not performed; guidance for percutaneous interventions (needle biopsy, pre-surgical localisation, fluid collection drainage); monitoring patients with breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant therapy, when MRI is not performed. Possible indications such as supplemental screening after mammography for women aged 40–74 with dense breasts are also listed. Moreover, inappropriate indications include screening for breast cancer as a stand-alone alternative to mammography. The structure and organisation of the breast US report and of classification systems such as the BI-RADS and consequent management recommendations are illustrated. Information about additional or new US technologies (colour-Doppler, elastography, and automated whole breast US) is also provided. Finally, five frequently asked questions are answered.

Teaching Points

- US is an established tool for suspected cancers at all ages and also the method of choice under 40.
- For US-visible suspicious lesions, US-guided biopsy is preferred, even for palpable findings.
- High-risk women can be screened with US, especially when MRI cannot be performed.
- Supplemental US increases cancer detection but also false positives, biopsy rate and follow-up exams.
- Breast US is inappropriate as a stand-alone screening method.

### Breast cancer screening modalities, recommendations, and novel imaging techniques [^114bKLHp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Among women, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mammography remains the only validated screening tool to reduce breast cancer mortality. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that average-risk women undergo breast cancer screening every year starting at age 40. This article reviews the fundamentals of mammography screening, current age-based mammography screening recommendations, supplemental breast cancer screening recommendations in high-risk women, and novel imaging technologies. This review summarizes recommendations from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and published guidelines from major societies to reflect a range of evidence-based perspectives regarding mammographic screening.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

Is breast US a harmless investigation?

Yes. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported harms related to the delivery of US to the adult human body at the level of energy applied in diagnostic medical use.
2 Can breast US be performed instead of mammography for breast cancer screening in the general female population, as it spares radiation?

No. US has not been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer when used a stand-alone approach in the general female population, and it causes far more biopsies and short-term follow-up examinations than mammography.
3 After a breast US examination, does the woman also need mammography?

The answer depends on the setting. As mentioned above, US is not accurate enough to be considered a stand-alone screening method in the general female population. It can be considered as an adjunct to mammography in asymptomatic women for certain specific categories (e.g. women with dense breasts) and may be the first-choice, however often not the only method needed, to correctly assess a woman with palpable lump, regardless of age, breast density, or breast cancer risk. Ask your radiologist to find out if you need a mammogram after a US or a US after a mammogram. She/he will be able to answer the question and to explain the reasons for yes or no.
4 Can women consider breast US being free from any potential negative consequences?

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^117AhdTb]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Notably, breast US also detects a variety of non-palpable benign lesions, which are very common in the breast but may otherwise have gone unnoticed, sometimes requiring needle biopsy, showing their benignancy (false positives). This is one of the major drawbacks of the use of breast US as a screening tool. A systematic review of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts reported very low positive predictive value of both handheld and automated breast US (from 3.2 to 7.5%) and a biopsy rate as high as about 6%.

Invasive cancers not visible or not detected on US are in general either very small, behind the nipple or lesions which are difficult to distinguish from normal gland or fat tissue or from fibrocystic changes, such as invasive lobular cancers, accounting for up to 15% of all breast cancers. US may also miss microinvasive cancers and diffusely growing cancers. Accordingly, suspicious findings at clinical examination, mammography, or MRI should not be dismissed because of a normal US, even when US has been targeted to the region thought to harbour the finding. Moreover, US is less sensitive than mammography for non-invasive breast cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS) commonly detected at mammography due to the presence of calcifications.
Note D. When both mammography and breast US are requested, US should be performed after mammography. The best scenario is that both mammography and US are evaluated at the same time from the same radiologist providing a unique conclusion from the two examinations. Your radiologist may recommend an adjunct US if you have very dense breasts and a negative mammogram, also taking into account other risk factors. If you feel a palpable lump, US may be the first-line examination used, especially before 40 years of age.

Test performance

Performance refers to the general ability of a test, here breast US, to make a correct diagnosis, i.e. to see cancers when they are present (sensitivity) or to exclude them when they are not (specificity).

No test is perfect. This is also true for breast US. Its sensitivity and specificity also depend on the specific setting (i.e. the indication) in which it is applied, particularly in the major distinction between its application in symptomatic women (diagnostic performance) or in asymptomatic women (screening performance).

Considering the high operator-dependence, and the fact that most US studies are performed together with, and complementary to, other examinations (clinical examination and mammography), it is difficult to define precisely a sensitivity for US alone. It varies strongly depending on lesion size, type of breast tissue and (as for all methods) on patient selection.

When a woman has focal symptoms, typically a palpable lump, US is performed as a targeted examination and has a high sensitivity. In this clinical setting, US is useful for differentiating liquid benign lesions (cysts) from solid masses, characterising solid masses, and deciding whether a US-guided needle biopsy should be performed. Since the negative predictive value (NPV) of breast US, i.e. the probability that a negative examination is truly negative (no cancers are present) is usually not perfect (like that of mammography), exclusion of malignancy can require a combined evaluation of ultrasound with mammography and clinical findings. Based on US, it is possible to exclude malignancy in case of pathognomonic findings like simple cysts or when a low suspicion finding (like some mammographic asymmetry) correlates at US with homogeneously hyperechoic normal gland tissue or with a mobile and elastic well-circumscribed oval mass compatible with a fibroadenoma. The addition of mammography to US should be considered whenever the pre-test probability of malignancy is high enough, usually in women over 40 or in women with somewhat atypical US findings.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® female breast cancer screening: 2025 update [^112AewdP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Routine screening substantially reduces the risk of mortality and morbidity of breast cancer with early detection. Multiple different imaging modalities may be used to screen for breast cancer. Screening recommendations differ based on an individual's risk of developing breast cancer. Numerous factors contribute to breast cancer risk, which is frequently divided into three major categories: average, intermediate, and high risk. For patients assigned female at birth with native breast tissue, mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are recommended for breast cancer screening in all risk categories. In high-risk patients, screening with breast MRI is recommended starting as early as 25 to 30 years of age and mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis with a variable starting age between 25 and 40 years of age, depending on the type of risk. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Evaluation and outcomes of women with a breast lump and a normal mammogram result [^113NvAwL]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Many women experience a breast lump. Clinical guidelines suggest that a normal mammogram result alone is not adequate to exclude a diagnosis of cancer.

Objective

To examine the characteristics of women with a breast lump and a normal mammogram that were associated with receiving further evaluation, and to examine cancer outcomes.

Design

Observational cohort.

Participants

Women aged 35 to 70 years who participated in a population-based mammography registry and who did not have a history of breast cancer noted at the time of their mammogram that they had a breast lump, and had a "normal" (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 1 or 2) mammogram result (n = 771).

Measurements

Telephone survey performed 6 months after the mammogram to ascertain information about evaluation. Cancer outcomes within 12 months of the index mammogram were confirmed through linkage with a cancer registry.

Results

Only 56.9% of women reported receiving an adequate evaluation for their breast lump, including a subsequent clinical breast exam, a visit to a breast specialist, an ultrasound, a biopsy, or aspiration. Latinas were less likely than white women to have received adequate evaluation, as were obese women compared with normal-weight women, and uninsured women compared with women with insurance. Among women with at least 12 months of follow-up, 1.4% were diagnosed with cancer.

Conclusions

Many women do not receive adequate evaluation for a recent breast lump. Interventions should be designed to improve the follow-up of women with this common clinical problem.

### BI-RADS 3 on screening breast ultrasound: what is It and what is the appropriate management? [^1153BE8G]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

US is widely used in breast imaging for diagnostic purposes and is also used increasingly for supplemental screening in women with dense breasts. US frequently depicts masses that are occult on mammography, even after tomosynthesis, and the vast majority of such masses are benign. Many masses seen only on screening US are easily recognized as benign simple cysts. Probably benign, BI-RADS 3, or low suspicion, BI-RADS 4A masses are also common and often prompt short-interval follow-up or biopsy, respectively, yet the vast majority of these are benign. This review details appropriate characterization, classification, and new approaches to the management of probably benign masses seen on screening US that can reduce false positives and, thereby, reduce costs and patient anxiety.

### Performance of first mammography examination in women younger than 40 years [^116n7UGv]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Few data have been published on mammography performance in women who are younger than 40 years.

Methods

We pooled data from six mammography registries across the United States from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We included 117 738 women who were aged 18–39 years when they had their first screening or diagnostic mammogram during 1995–2005 and followed them for 1 year to determine accuracy of mammography assessment. We measured the recall rate for screening examinations and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and cancer detection rate for all mammograms.

Results

For screening mammograms, no cancers were detected in 637 mammograms for women aged 18–24 years. For women aged 35–39 years who had the largest number of screening mammograms (n = 73 335) in this study, the recall rate was 12.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.4% to 12.9%), sensitivity was 76.1% (95% CI = 69.2% to 82.6%), specificity was 87.5% (95% CI = 87.2% to 87.7%), positive predictive value was 1.3% (95% CI = 1.1% to 1.5%), and cancer detection rate was 1.6 cancers per 1000 mammograms (95% CI = 1.3 to 1.9 cancers per 1000 mammograms). Most (67 468 [77.7%]) of the 86 871 women screened reported no family history of breast cancer. For diagnostic mammograms, the age-adjusted rates across all age groups were: sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI = 82.7% to 88.7%), specificity of 88.8% (95% CI = 88.4% to 89.1%), positive predictive value of 14.6% (95% CI = 13.3% to 15.8%), and cancer detection rate of 14.3 cancers per 1000 mammograms (95% CI = 13.0 to 15.7 cancers per 1000 mammograms). Mammography performance, except for specificity, improved in the presence of a breast lump.

Conclusions

Younger women have very low breast cancer rates but after mammography experience high recall rates, high rates of additional imaging, and low cancer detection rates. We found no cancers in women younger than 25 years and poor performance for the large group of women aged 35–39 years. In a theoretical population of 10 000 women aged 35–39 years, 1266 women who are screened will receive further workup, with 16 cancers detected and 1250 women receiving a false-positive result.

### Utility of diagnostic mammography as the primary imaging modality for palpable lumps in women with almost entirely fatty breasts [^116rMbQa]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of diagnostic mammography alone for evaluation of palpable symptoms in women with almost entirely fatty breast composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS. All diagnostic mammograms performed for palpable symptoms in women who had been assigned a breast density of "almost entirely fatty" over an 8-year period (2009–2017) at an academic breast center were retrospectively identified. Each symptomatic breast was considered a separate case and analyses were performed at the case level. Clinical, imaging, and pathologic results were reviewed. Descriptive statistics and 2 × 2 contingency table analyses were performed. RESULTS. The study cohort included 323 cases evaluated with mammography. Of these, 294 (91%) had undergone targeted ultrasound. At mammography, 240 (74%) had no correlate to the palpable lump; 38 (12%), a benign correlate; and 45 (14%), a suspicious correlate. Three cases had incidental suspicious mammographic findings, for a total of 48 positive mammography cases. Twenty-seven (8%) cases were malignant. Mammography alone detected all but one cancer, which was detected by ultrasound. In retrospect, the woman from whom this single false-negative mammogram was obtained did not have almost entirely fatty breast density. Mammography alone yielded a negative predictive value of 99.6%, percentage of diagnostic examinations recommended for biopsy that resulted in a tissue diagnosis of malignancy within 1 year of 54%, sensitivity of 96%, and specificity of 93%. Adjunct ultrasound contributed to 11 false-positives but also identified benign correlates in eight cases with no mammographic finding. CONCLUSION. In patients with almost entirely fatty breast tissue presenting with palpable symptoms, mammography alone had a high sensitivity and specificity. Our results support that mammography alone may be sufficient for evaluation of palpable symptoms in these women as long as density criteria are strictly applied.

### A review of breast pain: causes, imaging recommendations, and treatment [^111LeTFy]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Over two-thirds of women will experience breast pain in their lifetime. As one of the leading breast symptoms for which women seek medical attention, breast pain is suspected to be underreported and under-studied. Cyclical breast pain is related to hormonal changes. Noncyclical breast pain is independent of the menstrual cycle and can be idiopathic and related to chronic pain syndromes, infections, ill-fitting bras, musculoskeletal abnormalities, pregnancy, perimenopause, and postsurgical causes. Breast pain can also present in transgender patients and may require additional considerations as to the underlying cause. Imaging of mastalgia depends upon the suspected etiology. Inappropriate imaging for breast pain is associated with significant utilization of health care resources. Cyclical breast pain does not require an imaging work-up. The work-up of focal, noncyclical breast pain includes ultrasound for women aged younger than 40 years, and mammography and ultrasound for women aged 40 years and older. Management of breast pain is often supportive, as most breast pain resolves spontaneously. If pain persists, imaging and management should follow a step-wise approach. If conservative measures fail, second-line therapy is topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If breast pain is severe and resistant to conservative methods, additional third-line therapies can be added by breast care specialists with specific knowledge of the potential deleterious side effects of these medications. While the causes of mastalgia are overwhelmingly benign, breast pain can significantly impact quality of life, and the breast radiologist should be familiar with causes, management, and treatment recommendations from a multidisciplinary approach.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of invasive breast cancer [^115x5CAE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes should be determined based on evidence-based guidelines. It is important to understand the indications for extent of disease evaluation and staging, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and even result in adverse outcomes. In asymptomatic patients that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrence. Routine surveillance with an annual 2-D mammogram and/or tomosynthesis is recommended to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of breast cancer, and MRI is increasingly used as an additional screening tool in this population, especially in women with dense breasts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBreast imaging of Pregnant and lactating women [^113vXsc5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation is challenging due to unique physiologic and structural breast changes that increase the difficulty of clinical and radiological evaluation. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is increasing as more women delay child bearing into the fourth decade of life, and imaging of clinical symptoms should not be delayed. PABC may present as a palpable lump, nipple discharge, diffuse breast enlargement, focal pain, or milk rejection. Breast imaging during lactation is very similar to breast imaging in women who are not breast feeding. However, breast imaging during pregnancy is modified to balance both maternal and fetal well-being; and there is a limited role for advanced breast imaging techniques in pregnant women. Mammography is safe during pregnancy and breast cancer screening should be tailored to patient age and breast cancer risk. Diagnostic breast imaging during pregnancy should be obtained to evaluate clinical symptoms and for loco-regional staging of newly diagnosed PABC. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACR 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain annual mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (with accompanying planar or synthesized 2D images) in average-risk females (< 15% lifetime risk of breast cancer) beginning at age 40. Consider obtaining breast ultrasound in females with dense breasts, taking into account the balance between increased cancer detection and the increased risk of a false-positive examination.

### State of the art of current modalities for the diagnosis of breast lesions [^114bEJCP]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

With the availability of numerous diagnostic techniques comes the possible risk of the unjustified use of such techniques and a lack of rational clinical application. Clearly, errors of this nature would affect the diagnostic accuracy and therefore reduce the possibilities for treatment. It is not uncommon for women and also for general practitioners to be misinformed about which is the most suitable technique or rather, which is the best combination of the various techniques. For this reason, inappropriate tests are often requested or, conversely, there is failure to request tests which would in fact make a useful contribution to safeguarding the patient's health. This work has the following aims: (a) to set out precisely the real diagnostic contribution of each method, both radiological and otherwise, and suggest methods of application and indications consistent with the state of the art, and (b) to suggest the most effective and rational combinations of the various techniques and organisation of diagnostic activities.

### Clinical value of mammography in the evaluation of palpable breast lumps in women 30 years old and older [^1177WCfT]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether mammography adds clinical value in the diagnostic imaging workup of women 30 years old and older who present with palpable breast lumps.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively identified the records of all women 30 years old and older who underwent imaging evaluation with mammography and ultrasound for a palpable lump between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010. Imaging reports were reviewed for findings related to the lump and for incidental nonpalpable findings. Benign versus malignant outcomes were determined by pathologic analysis or 24-month imaging or clinical follow-up. The contribution of mammography to final diagnosis was assessed on the basis of objective criteria to determine the clinical impact of mammographic findings.

Results

The study cohort included 861 patients presenting with 935 palpable lumps. Imaging correlates were reported for 568 of 935 (60.7%) lumps, and imaging findings were negative in 367 of 935 (39.3%). Of the 935 palpable lumps, 858 (91.8%) were benign and 77 (8.2%) were malignant. Mammography added clinical value in the evaluation of 27 of 77 (35.0%) malignant lumps by better delineating extent of disease and in the evaluation of 26 of 858 benign lumps (3.0%) by confirming benignity. Fifty-two of 861 (6.0%) patients had incidental findings that led to a recommendation for biopsy. Twenty-nine of the 52 findings were originally seen with mammography and 23 with ultrasound. Mammography also depicted seven incidental malignancies in nonpalpable areas, and ultrasound depicted one incidental malignancy.

Conclusion

Adjunct mammography is warranted for evaluation of palpable breast lumps in women 30 years old and older because of the value added to clinical management. In all age cohorts, mammography contributed to delineation of disease extent, detection of incidental malignancies, and confirmation of benign diagnoses.

### The effect of imaging on the clinical management of breast pain [^112ygCfy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breast pain is a common complaint to primary care and breast specialists. Literature recommends imaging to provide reassurance of benign etiology. The effect of imaging on reassurance and subsequent healthcare utilization has not been described.

Objective

To determine if initial imaging for breast pain reduces subsequent utilization.

Design

Retrospective cohort study at a hospital-based breast health practice.

Patients

Women referred for breast pain from 2006–2009.

Main Measures

Imaging ordered at initial provider visit; clinical utilization, defined as the number of follow-up visits, diagnostic imaging studies, and biopsies completed within 12 months following initial visit.

Key Results

Sixty-percent of women were age 40 or younger, 87% were from racial/ethnic minority groups. Twenty-five percent had imaging ordered at initial visit. Of those who received initial imaging, 75% had normal radiographic findings, yet 98% returned for additional evaluation. In adjusted analyses, women with initial imaging had increased clinical services utilization (OR 25.4, 95% CI: 16.7, 38.6). Women with normal clinical breast exams who received initial imaging exhibited increased odds for subsequent clinical services utilization (OR 23.8, 95% CI: 12.9, 44.0). Six cancers were diagnosed; imaging in the absence of clinical breast exam abnormalities did not result in any cancer identification.

Conclusions

Initial imaging for women with breast pain increased the odds of subsequent clinical utilization and did not increase reassurance in ruling out malignancy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® breast implant evaluation: 2023 update [^111kc7YY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

This document discusses the appropriate initial imaging in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with breast implants. For asymptomatic patients with saline implants, no imaging is recommended. If concern for rupture exists, ultrasound is usually appropriate though saline rupture is often clinically evident. The FDA recently recommended patients have an initial ultrasound or MRI examination 5 to 6 years after initial silicone implant surgery and then every 2 to 3 years thereafter. In a patient with unexplained axillary adenopathy with current or prior silicone breast implants, ultrasound and/or mammography are usually appropriate, depending on age. In a patient with concern for silicone implant rupture, ultrasound or MRI without contrast is usually appropriate. In the setting of a patient with breast implants and possible implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ultrasound is usually appropriate as the initial imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® evaluation of nipple discharge: 2022 update [^1155BXy7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The type of nipple discharge dictates the appropriate imaging study. Physiologic nipple discharge is common and does not require diagnostic imaging. Pathologic nipple discharge in women, men, and transgender patients necessitates breast imaging. Evidence-based guidelines were used to evaluate breast imaging modalities for appropriateness based on patient age and gender. For an adult female or male 40 years of age or greater, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is performed initially. Breast ultrasound is usually performed at the same time with rare exception. For males or females 30 to 39 years of age, mammography/DBT or breast ultrasound is performed based on institutional preference and individual patient considerations. For young women less than 30 years of age, ultrasound is performed first with mammography/DBT added if there are suspicious findings or if the patient is at elevated lifetime risk for developing breast cancer. There is a high incidence of breast cancer in males with pathologic discharge. Men 25 years and older should be evaluated using mammography/DBT and ultrasound added when indicted. In transfeminine (male-to-female) patients, mammography/DBT and ultrasound are useful due to the increased incidence of breast cancer.

### Comparing diagnostic evaluations for rectal bleeding and breast lumps in primary care: a retrospective cohort study [^115v7Fz5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inadequate diagnostic evaluations of breast lumps and rectal bleeding in primary care are an important source of medical errors. Delays appear particularly common in evaluation of rectal bleeding. Comparing pursuit and completion of diagnostic testing for these two conditions within the same practice settings could help highlight barriers and inform interventions.

Objectives

To examine processes undertaken for diagnostic evaluations of breast lumps and rectal bleeding within the same practices and to compare them with regard to (a) the likelihood that diagnostic tests are ordered according to guidelines and (b) the timeliness of order placement and completion.

Design

A retrospective cohort study using explicit chart abstraction methods.

Participants

Three hundred women aged 30–80 presenting with breast lumps and 300 men and women aged 40–80 years presenting with rectal bleeding to 15 academically affiliated primary care practices, 2012–2016.

Main Measures

Rates and timing of test ordering and completion and patterns of visits and communications.

Key Results

At initial presentation, physicians ordered recommended imaging or procedures at higher rates for patients with breast lumps compared to those with rectal bleeding (97% vs. 86% of patients recommended to receive imaging or endoscopy; p < 0.01). Most (90%) patients with breast lumps completed recommended diagnostic testing within 1 month, versus 31% of patients with rectal bleeding (p < 0.01). By 1 year, 7% of patients with breast lumps had not completed indicated imaging, versus 27% of those with rectal bleeding. Patients with breast lumps had fewer subsequent primary care visits related or unrelated to their symptom and had fewer related communications with specialists.

Limitations

The study relied on documented care, and findings may be most generalizable to academically affiliated institutions.

Conclusions

Diagnostic processes for rectal bleeding were less frequently guideline-concordant and timely than those for breast lumps. The largest discrepancies occurred in initial ordering of indicated tests and the timeliness of test completion.

### Management of radiographic lesions of the breast [^11654nVQ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Breast imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and management of breast disease. From screening asymptomatic patients to evaluating clinical abnormalities on diagnostic studies, breast imaging provides critical information to the breast surgeon. Available imaging studies include those that have been proved over many years, like mammography, and those that take advantage of increasingly sophisticated technology, like breast MRI. Image-guided biopsy provides a safe means of evaluating indeterminate findings on imaging. Understanding how these tools are best used can help breast surgeons provide the best care for their patients.

### Breast disease in the pregnant and lactating patient: radiological-pathological correlation [^112fVhfT]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Imaging protocols and challenges

Radiological evaluation varies depending upon the age of the woman, her pregnancy and lactational status. Subsequent to a clinical history and thorough physical examination, patients are frequently imaged to determine whether there is an underlying abnormality to account for the patient's symptoms. For pregnant and lactating women under the age of 30 years, ultrasound is the initial imaging test of choice given the lack of radiation exposure. Mammogram could be considered in these patients if ultrasound is negative or it reveals indeterminate, suspicious or no findings. Lactating women over 30 years of age are typically imaged using both mammography and ultrasound. In an effort to reduce the overall breast density, lactating patients are encouraged to express milk immediately prior to imaging. In a pregnant patient, mammography should be performed, if ultrasound reveals a suspicious finding or if biopsy of a solid lesion reveals malignancy. A complete evaluation of a pregnant patient with a lump should not be delayed until after delivery, because of fear of radiation. Without shielding the abdomen, the dose to the fetus from a four-view mammogram is 0.4 mrad, much less than background, and with shielding, the risk is not significant and safe to the fetus. Fetal malformations are known to occur at a dose exceeding 10 rads.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for clinical practice in pregnant patients with breast cancer or suspected to have breast cancer, states that "mammography of the breast with shielding can be safely done".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® breast imaging during pregnancy [^116FrVZs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There are physiologic and structural changes of the breast that occur during pregnancy that can make the clinical examination and imaging more challenging. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) is uncommon but increasing as more women postpone childbearing. PABC can present clinically as a palpable lump, focal pain, nipple discharge, or diffuse breast enlargement. Mammography is safe to perform during pregnancy. Both high- and normal-risk women should continue their routine screening mammography examinations during pregnancy. Diagnostic mammography and/or ultrasound is tailored to evaluate the clinical symptoms and for locoregional staging of newly diagnosed PABC. Breast MRI is not advocated for screening or diagnostic evaluation of the breast during pregnancy due to unknown safety of gadolinium exposure to the fetus.

### Mammography: an update of the EUSOBI recommendations on information for women [^111ZJnM4]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic performance of mammography

No diagnostic test is perfect. This rule also applies to mammography. When thinking about screening, women should be aware that about 28% of cancers can be missed, especially in pre-menopausal women and in those with dense breasts. This means that if we consider 1000 women getting a screening mammogram, if 8–10 cancers are present, 2 or 3 can be missed, mostly because they are difficult to distinguish from normal breast tissue. Still, mammography is the best proven method for screening average-risk women.

Note F. Do not underestimate the importance of breast symptoms (especially a new palpable lump, skin/nipple retraction or nipple discharge), regardless of the timing of your last negative mammogram. Go to your radiologist and ask for a visit. Tell her/him your symptoms and she/he will decide the best course of action for you. Conversely, not all suspicious findings visualised on a mammogram are cancers: depending on the level of suspicion, cancer is confirmed in a highly variable proportion of cases. When the suspicion is confirmed after further assessment, image-guided needle biopsy is mandatory before planning any treatment.

Note G. A suspicious mammographic finding is not a confirmed cancer. However, do not postpone further assessment and, if necessary, needle biopsy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® male breast cancer screening [^1151cgyS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer screening recommendations have been established historically for women, but, have been less clearly outlined for men. For average-risk men and younger men less than 25 year of age, imaging is not usually appropriate as a screening test for breast cancer. For men of higher-than-average risk, screening with mammography as annual surveillance imaging is usually appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel.

### Dense breasts: what Do our patients need to be told and why? [^116KerUm]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

More than 50% of states have state-mandated density notification for patients with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts. Increased breast density carries a risk of masking a cancer and delaying diagnosis. Supplemental imaging is optional and often recommended for certain patients. There are no evidence-based consensus guidelines for screening patients with density as their only risk factor. Breast cancer risk assessment and breast cancer prevention strategies should be discussed with women with dense breasts.

### Current state of evidence-based long-term monitoring protocols for breast plastic surgery patients [^115qtuxU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mammography is the most cost-effective screening tool for breast cancer. Concerning findings are often evaluated with diagnostic imaging and ultrasound, although the sensitivity of breast MRI is decreased in the postoperative period following breast reduction due to the postsurgical changes that may mask disease. Tang et al. found the rates of incidental breast cancer in bilateral mammoplasty were 0.16% in women under 40 years of age and 1.47% in women over 40 years of age, on retrospective review from 1990 to 2017, and the initial tumor burdens were all small in their cohort of 39 patients identified to have incidental cancer; the study included 4804 patients. The ASPS does not recommend additional imaging for women who are undergoing or who have undergone elective breast surgery beyond that which is indicated by age and risk factors, unless there is a specific concern.

Benign breast conditions guidelines scope and development — These guidelines are intended for use by general and subspecialist surgeons, radiologists, advanced practice practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists, primary care professionals (internal medicine/family practice), and trainees. The guideline scope is limited to management of the benign condition at time of diagnosis, not the diagnostic process preceding the diagnosis of the condition, and concordance is assumed when biopsy pathology explains imaging results; age-appropriate screening refers to consideration of age and other breast cancer risk factors. A modified Delphi consensus methodology was used, with a consensus panel including ASBrS (n = 12), the Society of Breast Imaging (n = 2), a breast pathology representative (n = 1), and a patient advocate (n = 1), and recommendations were developed by conducting 2 rounds of consensus panel ratings with a priori scoring methods; draft statements underwent public comment and were revised accordingly.

### Breast imaging: what women&healthcare professionals need to know [^11628ETk]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Women in Radiology should be aware of the importance of early detection of breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. This knowledge is essential to advocate for high quality breast imaging for women, including themselves and their patients. The imaging modalities used in breast imaging have dramatically changed the way in which breast cancer may be diagnosed, and their use affects the stage at which it is diagnosed. Breast cancer may be screen-detected, either with mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, breast ultrasound, breast MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography, and is typically diagnosed at stage 1. Incidental detection with Chest CT, abdominal CT or MRI or by PET CT may also lead to a diagnosis of breast cancer. When detected because of symptoms in women who have not undergone routine screening or as an interval cancer in women after a normal screen typically because of the masking effect of dense breast tissue, breast cancer is typically diagnosed at a more advanced stage, stage IIA or greater. A review of the imaging modalities currently used to diagnose breast cancer is provided and includes the advantages and limitations of each modality and the ways to optimize the imaging quality for detection of breast cancer. Up-to-date recommendations aimed to minimize the harms of delayed diagnosis of breast cancer are summarized to improve the health of women in Radiology and their patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® female breast cancer screening: 2023 update [^113rNBBy]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Early detection of breast cancer from regular screening substantially reduces breast cancer mortality and morbidity. Multiple different imaging modalities may be used to screen for breast cancer. Screening recommendations differ based on an individual's risk of developing breast cancer. Numerous factors contribute to breast cancer risk, which is frequently divided into three major categories: average, intermediate, and high risk. For patients assigned female at birth with native breast tissue, mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are the recommended method for breast cancer screening in all risk categories. In addition to the recommendation of mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis in high-risk patients, screening with breast MRI is recommended.

USPSTF breast cancer screening — implementation details — Screen women aged 40 to 74 years with a mammogram every 2 years. Both digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (or "3D mammography") are effective mammographic screening modalities. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for breast cancer in women 75 years or older, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against supplemental screening breast ultrasonography or MRI in women who have dense breasts. Clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for breast cancer in women 75 years or older and whether to use supplemental screening in women who have dense breasts and an otherwise normal mammogram.

### Women's perspectives on ultrasound as primary imaging modality for focal breast complaints: a qualitative study [^115TWNyF]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study explored women's perceptions of using US as a primary imaging modality in the clinical setting. The findings reveal considerable variation in acceptability, with women considering factors such as their personal health situation (e.g. health history and complaint type) and the organization of breast care, including eligibility for screening and exam costs. The effectiveness of imaging, including DBT's ability to detect incidental findings and the scientific evidence supporting standalone US, was considered crucial. Additionally, professionals' attitudes, particularly those of GPs and radiologists, and the image assessment process were important. Furthermore, women's information needs were emphasized, as knowledge about these factors influenced their preference for DBT in the diagnostic setting.

Women's personal health situation and the type of complaint they presented with appeared to influence their perceived need for either a whole-breast evaluation or a complaint-focused approach. This likely reflects the extent to which women feel at risk for breast cancer, with those perceiving a higher risk preferring more extensive examinations when presenting with complaints, compared to those who feel their risk is low.

A notable factor in women's perceptions of an US-only approach was eligibility for the national breast cancer screening program. While the Dutch program focuses on asymptomatic women aged 50–75, and diagnostic imaging is used for evaluating symptomatic complaints, some women linked the two types of exams. They viewed DBT in the diagnostic setting as largely redundant given biennial mammograms in the screening program, but were reluctant to omit diagnostic DBT before reaching screening eligibility. This suggests that women see diagnostic DBT as an opportunity for early breast control. Some also expressed dissatisfaction with the 50-year age cutoff for screening, citing the incidence of breast cancer in younger women. This aligns with other studies showing that women from the age of 40 tend to undergo early mammography before the recommended age of 50, due to a lack of confidence in the guidelines.

### Incorporating imaging into the locoregional management of breast cancer [^1113wXmX]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Although some breast cancers present as palpable masses or with other clinical findings, many are detected at screening. Most screening is currently done with digital mammography, but high-risk patients or those with dense breast tissue may undergo additional screening examinations with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. Additionally, digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast-enhanced mammography, and molecular breast imaging are newer technologies available at some sites. Optimal usage of breast imaging technologies remains controversial, both in screening and diagnostic settings following a new diagnosis of breast cancer. This article will review well established and newer, alternative breast imaging technologies as well as recent data regarding their role in optimizing patient care.

### Women's perspectives of molecular breast imaging: a qualitative study [^114AQmMQ]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Every year there are over 55,000 new incidences of breast cancer in the UK, and over 11,500 women die from breast cancer. Cancer screening programmes aim to detect life-threatening tumours early, reduce future treatment costs, and ultimately reduce mortality. The National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) comprises two population breast screening programmes: routine screening of women aged 50–70 every three years with mammography, and screening of women deemed at very high risk of breast cancer (with frequency and modality dependent on particular risk factors).

Breast cancer imaging is used in the UK in several interlinked pathways including the NHSBSP, such as symptomatic breast imaging, disease-response imaging and post-cancer surveillance imaging. Mammography is the primary imaging tool, with targeted ultrasound (USS) used to guide biopsy of suspicious lesions and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the more sensitive test, limited to specific subsets of women, where it can be most effective, mainly due to capacity issues in the National Health Service (NHS).

Mammography relies on a difference between the density of a tumour and the surrounding normal breast tissue, causing tumours to be masked in women with dense breast tissue. Recent evidence suggests that supplemental imaging should be offered to women with dense breast tissue due to the low sensitivity of mammography and independently increased risk of breast cancer in these women. This is supported by a recent change in EU guidelines recommending that women be informed of their breast density to enable shared decisions about supplemental screening based on risk, and that those with very dense tissue should be offered additional breast MRI.

Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) is a nuclear medicine breast imaging technique in use in the United States in women with dense breast tissue. Retrospective studies have shown MBI to have superior diagnostic accuracy compared to mammography in this population. Whilst this provides compelling evidence for incorporating MBI into UK breast imaging pathway(s), no research has yet examined whether this would be acceptable to stakeholders, including patients, and what considerations would be required for its optimal deployment.

This study aimed to address this evidence gap by assessing the potential demand for MBI and perceived benefits if incorporated into the UK as a breast-imaging tool. The potential target population could include the current breast screening population, a subset thereof, for example, women identified as having large amounts of dense breast tissue on initial screening, and/or younger women at increased risk of breast cancer due to family history.

### Screening guidelines update for average-risk and high-risk women [^117JWNTd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to describe screening updates for women with average and high risk for breast cancer, compare different screening strategies, and describe new approaches in risk prediction, including radiomics. CONCLUSION. All women are at substantial risk for breast cancer. For women with average risk, annual mammography beginning at 40 years old maximizes the life-extending benefits and provides improved treatment options. Women at higher risk need earlier and more intense screening. Delaying initiation or decreasing frequency of mammographic screening adversely affects breast cancer detection.

### Breast cancer screening recommendations inclusive of all women at average risk: update from the ACR and society of breast imaging [^111BpqKv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

Women presenting with a strong hereditary predisposition, or known BRCA1 or 2 mutation carriers, are, by definition, considered at very high risk for developing breast cancer. A family history that entails multiple affected relatives with early-onset breast or ovarian cancer over several generations would be an indication to refer to a genetic counselor to discuss the options of genetic testing. The lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer for a BRCA mutation carrier is estimated at 40–85%. Women with a BRCA mutation should be offered bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy as these are the only risk-reducing strategies shown to be effective in this population. Those not interested in BPM should have enhanced surveillance with annual mammogram and magnetic resonance imaging, and be offered preventive therapy. The evidence of efficacy of preventive therapy in this population is less compelling. Although there is no evidence to support BPM in women who have had thoracic radiation, there is preclinical evidence that tamoxifen decreases the incidence of radiation-induced breast cancer.

Several complementary risk assessment and calculation tools are available to assist physicians with making decisions regarding preventive therapy, and individualizing risks. These tools incorporate most of the breast cancer risk factors described above and are easily available to the physician at the point of care. When counseling women about preventive therapy, it is recommended that physicians use a shared decision-making approach with women at high or very high risk as they are most likely to benefit from risk-reduction options. Women with a history of prior chest-wall radiation age < 30 years, or women with a history of LCIS, are considered to be high enough risk to be considered for preventive therapy [National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines version 1.2014 Breast Cancer Risk Reduction]. Other women can be assessed for suitability by using a risk assessment tool.

Invasive breast cancer — clinical indications and applications for breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) state it may be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer or presence of multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast cancer at time of initial diagnosis (category 2B), with no high-level data that use of MRI to facilitate local therapy decision-making improves local recurrence or survival; breast MRI may be helpful before and after preoperative systemic therapy to define extent of disease, response to treatment, and potential for breast-conservation therapy; it may be useful for otherwise clinically occult disease in patients with axillary nodal metastases (cT0, cN+), with Paget disease, or with invasive lobular carcinoma poorly (or inadequately) defined on mammography, ultrasound, or physical examination; false-positive findings on breast MRI are common, surgical decisions should not be based solely on MRI findings, and additional tissue sampling of areas of concern identified by breast MRI is recommended; the utility of MRI in follow-up screening of most patients with prior breast cancer is undefined and annual MRI is recommended in patients with personal history of breast cancer who: 1) were diagnosed at age ≤ 50 or 2) have dense breasts; all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Breast cancer screening in high-risk women during pregnancy and lactation [^117XaYSE]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer warrant screening that is often initiated at younger ages than in average-risk women; this is usually with a combination of annual mammography and breast MRI. Compared to average-risk women, those at high risk are more frequently recommended to undergo screening during childbearing age and thus potentially during pregnancy and lactation. Understanding the appropriate use of screening breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation can be challenging due to limited data defining the evidence-based roles of the different imaging modalities, including mammography, US, and MRI. There have also been assumptions about the diagnostic accuracy of these modalities secondary to physiological changes. This scientific review discusses the current state of evidence- and expert-based guidelines and data for breast imaging screening of high-risk pregnant and/or lactating women, and the clinical and imaging presentations of breast cancer for these women.

### Breast cancer screening and diagnosis: a synopsis of the European breast guidelines [^111Udfik]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The European Commission Initiative for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis guidelines (European Breast Guidelines) are coordinated by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The target audience for the guidelines includes women, health professionals, and policymakers.

Methods

An international guideline panel of 28 multidisciplinary members, including patients, developed questions and corresponding recommendations that were informed by systematic reviews of the evidence conducted between March 2016 and December 2018. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Evidence to Decision frameworks were used to structure the process and minimize the influence of competing interests by enhancing transparency. Questions and recommendations, expressed as strong or conditional, focused on outcomes that matter to women and provided a rating of the certainty of evidence.

Recommendations

This synopsis of the European Breast Guidelines provides recommendations regarding organized screening programs for women aged 40 to 75 years who are at average risk. The recommendations address digital mammography screening and the addition of hand-held ultrasonography, automated breast ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging compared with mammography alone. The recommendations also discuss the frequency of screening and inform decision making for women at average risk who are recalled for suspicious lesions or who have high breast density.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to breast imaging, ESMO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain breast MRI in case of uncertainties following standard imaging and in special clinical situations (such as familial breast cancer associated with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and other high-risk pathogenic variants, lobular cancers, suspicion of multifocality and/or multicentricity, presence of breast implants).

### Hydatid cyst: unusual presentation as' breast lump' [^1113hnqb]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Hydatid cyst in the breast is rare. We report a case of hydatid cyst in the breast in a 30-year-old Indian rural woman who presented with a lump in her left breast. MRI findings showed a cystic lesion in the breast. Histopathological examination showed features consistent with hydatid cyst with surrounding adherent pericystic breast tissue showing fibrocollagenisation and inflammatory response. ELISA for echinococcal antigen was also found to be positive. This case emphasises that preoperative diagnosis of hydatid cyst in the breast is difficult and often missed as the breast is a rare site of echinococcal infection and clinical and imaging findings are wide and non-specific. Cytological diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration may not always be possible. Therefore, hydatid cyst in the breast should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a breast lump and histopathological confirmation is necessary for early and appropriate treatment.

Benign breast fibroepithelial lesions — follow-up and nonsurgical management guidance indicates limited role for medical therapy and no extra imaging when concordant: "The consensus panel reviewed follow-up care for patients with biopsy-proven fibroadenomas. There was strong consensus among the panel that biopsy-proven fibroadenomas with radiographic-pathologic concordance do not require additional routine imaging follow-up beyond standard screening". Regarding medical therapy, "Several studies, including randomized clinical trials, have evaluated medical management of fibroadenomas", but "therefore, the panel does not support their use".
