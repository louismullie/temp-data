## Question

Hepatitis c rna 186000

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an HCV RNA result of 186,000 IU/mL and what clinical actions follow from that finding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming active infection and excluding false positives. Then, I should verify whether this represents acute versus chronic infection and the timing of exposure. Next, I will assess the clinical significance of the viral load magnitude and whether it changes management. After that, I need to check for additional pretreatment evaluations that modify therapy. Finally, I will outline treatment, monitoring, and follow-up, including test-of-cure and reinfection risk counseling, while double-checking any assay-related caveats that could mislead interpretation.

> Let me first confirm what this number means: 186,000 IU/mL equals 1.86 × 10⁵ IU/mL, which is approximately 5.27 log₁₀ IU/mL, and it unequivocally indicates active HCV viremia if the assay is valid and the specimen was handled properly, so I should confirm that the RNA test was performed on a validated, FDA-cleared platform and that the pre-analytical handling was appropriate before anchoring on this result [^114ydQNe] [^1146p3dU].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic context because I need to ensure we are not missing an acute window or a false positive. Ideally, HCV antibody testing with automatic reflex to HCV RNA is used to diagnose current infection, and if the antibody is negative with a positive RNA, that pattern supports acute infection within the first 6 months, whereas a positive antibody with positive RNA is consistent with chronic infection, so I should check the antibody status and the exposure timeline before concluding chronicity [^113nJmWZ] [^112fLM8J] [^1125pYm8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity. I initially thought a higher viral load might imply more advanced liver disease, but I should correct that — HCV RNA level does not correlate with disease severity or fibrosis stage, so 186,000 IU/mL is not inherently "high risk" for progression, and I should not use this value to infer histologic stage without fibrosis assessment or noninvasive staging [^111mDWDt].

> Next, I should review whether this viral load magnitude changes treatment decisions. In the DAA era, baseline viral load rarely dictates regimen choice or duration except in limited scenarios, and 186,000 IU/mL would be considered a low-to-moderate baseline value that does not preclude standard 8–12 week pangenotypic therapy, so I should proceed with treatment planning rather than overinterpreting the number itself [^113pPSc8] [^114FAQGe].

> I need to ensure I complete pretreatment evaluations that still matter: confirm HCV RNA with a quantitative assay if not already done, determine HCV genotype if a non-pan-genotypic regimen is planned or if there was prior treatment failure, assess liver disease severity with noninvasive fibrosis testing or clinical scoring, screen for HBV because DAA therapy can reactivate HBV, and test for HIV given implications for linkage to care and public health, and I should double-check that these steps are documented before prescribing DAAs [^1137rkJk] [^113pPSc8] [^114FAQGe].

> Let me consider treatment options and duration. Universal treatment is recommended for adults with active HCV infection, and most treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis can receive 8–12 weeks of a pangenotypic DAA regimen such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, with the exact duration guided by genotype, cirrhosis status, and prior treatment history, so for 186,000 IU/mL I would not extend therapy solely based on this viral load unless other indications exist [^115iFRXo] [^114FAQGe].

> I should confirm monitoring plans. During treatment, routine on-treatment viral load checks are generally unnecessary with modern DAAs unless adherence is uncertain or there are special circumstances, and the key endpoint is SVR12, so I will plan a quantitative HCV RNA test at 12 weeks after completing therapy to document cure, ensuring I use a sensitive assay with a low limit of detection to avoid missing low-level viremia at SVR12 [^117WERaX] [^114ydQNe].

> But wait, what if the assay or lab process introduced variability? I should double-check that the same RNA platform is used for baseline and SVR12 when possible because inter-assay variability can approach 0.2–0.5 log, and if the clinical scenario is discordant or unexpected, repeating the RNA on the same platform or using an alternative validated method is reasonable to avoid misclassification [^111aosSJ] [^1129bDoD].

> Next, I should review post-SVR care. After SVR is confirmed, I will counsel on reinfection risk and arrange annual HCV RNA testing for persons with ongoing risk, and for those with cirrhosis I will implement HCC surveillance with ultrasound every 6 months and continue management of complications, while reminding patients that achieving SVR reduces but does not eliminate liver-related complications, so ongoing liver care remains important [^117Tx6ik] [^111keHht].

> Let me reconsider any special contexts. If the patient is pregnant, I should confirm HCV RNA and LFTs at prenatal care initiation to assess MTCT risk and liver disease, and if the patient is a child, I should align testing and treatment with pediatric guidance, including antibody-based screening after 18 months and RNA confirmation of chronic infection thereafter, and I should avoid overinterpreting low-level RNA fluctuations that can occur around the detection limits of various assays [^116b1mhd] [^115hiNvk] [^11223vPR].

> In summary, 186,000 IU/mL HCV RNA confirms active infection and warrants treatment with a pangenotypic DAA regimen for 8–12 weeks in most adults, with standard pretreatment staging and safety checks, followed by SVR12 confirmation. The viral load magnitude itself does not dictate disease severity or most modern treatment decisions, so I should focus on linkage to care, adherence support, and cure verification rather than overanalyzing the baseline number [^1146p3dU] [^115iFRXo] [^114FAQGe] [^117WERaX] [^111mDWDt].

An HCV RNA level of 186,000 IU/mL indicates **active HCV infection** and requires **confirmatory testing** with a quantitative HCV RNA assay [^113nJmWZ] [^114ydQNe]. This viral load is **moderate** and does not, by itself, indicate disease severity or fibrosis stage; therefore, assess liver disease stage and genotype to guide therapy [^113pPSc8]. Current guidelines recommend **treating all patients with active HCV infection** [^115iFRXo], and modern direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) achieve high cure rates (> 95%) across genotypes [^114FAQGe]. Baseline viral load is no longer a major determinant of treatment response or duration with DAAs, but it remains useful for monitoring and confirming cure at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) [^117RXg9p] [^117WERaX].

---

## Clinical significance of HCV RNA 186,000 IU/mL

- **Active infection**: A detectable HCV RNA level confirms active infection and distinguishes it from past or resolved infection, which may show only antibody positivity [^113nJmWZ] [^112fLM8J].

- **Moderate viral load**: 186,000 IU/mL falls within the typical range of chronic HCV infection (commonly 10⁵–10⁷ IU/mL) and does not indicate disease severity or fibrosis stage on its own [^111mDWDt].

- **Baseline assessment**: Quantitative HCV RNA is recommended before starting antiviral therapy to document baseline viremia and for monitoring treatment response [^113pPSc8] [^117Tx6ik].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Confirmatory testing and staging

Confirm active infection with a **quantitative HCV RNA assay** [^114RZ33h] [^1146p3dU], and **stage liver disease** using non-invasive fibrosis assessment (e.g. transient elastography) or clinical scoring systems to guide therapy and follow-up [^114Q45zf].

---

### Treatment considerations

- **Universal treatment**: All patients with active HCV infection should be treated with DAAs, regardless of baseline viral load [^115iFRXo] [^114FAQGe].

- **Genotype testing**: Genotype and subtype should be determined before treatment to guide regimen selection and duration, especially in treatment-experienced patients or those with cirrhosis [^113pPSc8] [^1137rkJk].

- **Treatment duration**: Most patients require 8–12 weeks of DAA therapy, with high cure rates (> 95%) across genotypes [^114FAQGe].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

During treatment, **on-treatment viral load monitoring** is generally unnecessary with DAAs unless adherence concerns or special circumstances arise [^116mKB5P] [^114Cc75r]. After treatment, confirm cure with **SVR12 testing** (undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion) [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg].

---

## Factors influencing HCV RNA levels

Several factors can influence HCV RNA levels, including:

| **Factor** | **Influence on HCV RNA levels** |
|-|-|
| Genotype | Genotypes 1 and 4 tend to have higher viral loads than genotypes 2 and 3 [^11158pLa] |
| Immune status | Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV coinfection) often have higher viral loads [^11158pLa] |
| Age and sex | Younger age and female sex are associated with higher odds of low-level viremia [^notfound] |
| Assay variability | Different assays may yield varying results due to sensitivity and specificity differences [^1129bDoD] |

---

## Prognostic significance of HCV RNA 186,000 IU/mL

With modern DAAs, baseline viral load has **limited prognostic value** for treatment response; SVR rates exceed 95% across a wide range of baseline viral loads [^112nYpXo]. A viral load of 186,000 IU/mL does not independently predict disease progression; liver disease stage and other host factors are more predictive [^111mDWDt].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Confirm active infection**: Repeat quantitative HCV RNA testing to confirm active infection and establish baseline viral load [^113nJmWZ] [^112fLM8J].

- **Assess liver disease**: Evaluate liver disease stage using non-invasive fibrosis assessment or clinical scoring systems [^notfound].

- **Determine genotype**: Perform HCV genotype testing to guide therapy selection and duration [^1137rkJk].

- **Initiate treatment**: Start appropriate DAA therapy based on genotype, liver disease stage, and patient-specific factors [^113pPSc8].

- **Monitor response**: Confirm cure with SVR12 testing 12 weeks after completing therapy [^117WERaX] [^111FkYXg].

---

An HCV RNA level of 186,000 IU/mL indicates **active infection** and warrants confirmatory testing, staging, and treatment with DAAs. Modern therapies achieve high cure rates irrespective of baseline viral load, making early diagnosis and treatment essential to prevent disease progression and transmission [^114FAQGe].

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^116yedHG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

An alternative to directly measuring HCV RNA is quantification of the amount of HCV proteins in the blood. Production of HCV proteins requires viral replication and thus serves as a reliable marker of active infection. HCV core antigen testing has been the most extensively validated and the only commercially available approach for detecting HCV proteins in serum or plasma, although this test is available in the United States for research use only. Studies performed with different HCV core antigen tests have shown that, while assays using core antigen levels are not as sensitive or precise as measurement of HCV RNA levels, those levels are significantly related to the HCV RNA level. Because HCV core antigen analysis is faster and usually less expensive than NAT approaches, there is increasing interest in using this test as a reflex test for HCV-seropositive samples to identify individuals who are actively infected with HCV, particularly in resource-limited regions. Due to the lower sensitivity of HCV core antigen tests compared to HCV RNA tests, in order to achieve 100% detection of active viremia, confirmation of HCV RNA negativity should be considered in HCV-seropositive samples with negative HCV Ag results (Fig. 1). As the number of cAg false-negative results would be expected to be very low in the general population, the number of RNA tests required to confirm cAg negative results could be reduced while maintaining the 100% detection goal by pooling samples prior to HCV RNA testing. These numbers could be further reduced by triaging/stratifying samples for confirmation on the basis of those with an elevated aminotransferase level.

### Comparison of three commercially available assays for HCV RNA using the international unit standard: implications for management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection in clinical practice [^1129bDoD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The present study was performed to evaluate the impact of the international unit standard for measuring HCV RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Methods

The three assays used were Amplicor Monitor PCR, the National Genetics Institute PCR assay, and branched chain DNA. HCV RNA was measured at four time points (baseline, 3 months after the start of therapy, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after discontinuation of therapy) in 106 consecutive patients who received interferon and ribavirin for chronic HCV.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 44 yr. Of the patients, 62% were male, 24% were African American, 38% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and 75% were HCV genotype 1. Of the 424 samples analyzed, 82–89% of values were within 1 log unit and 85–92% were within 2 log units by the various assays. This variability was not dependent upon HCV genotype. HCV RNA was undetectable in 1.4–6.8% of samples when virus was detected by another assay. The mean HCV RNA in these discordant samples was 1.47–6.33 log IU/ml (30–2,100,000 IU/ml).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that approximately 90% of serum values for HCV RNA were within 1 log unit by the international unit standard regardless of which virological assay was used. However, false positive and false negative results as well as variations in the HCV RNA level of more than 1 to 2 log units can occur with any of the assays, and these results may have an impact upon the management of patients receiving interferon therapy. It is therefore unwise in clinical practice to base important treatment decisions upon a single HCV RNA determination.

An immunoassay detecting hepatitis C virus core antigen was evaluated for its ability to predict clinical outcome in a series of patients with acute hepatitis C. In subjects who cleared the virus, core antigen was no longer detectable within 16 weeks of onset, whereas considerable fluctuations were noted among patients progressing to chronic hepatitis, one of whom showed consistently negative values despite the intermittent presence of viral RNA.

Determination and monitoring of viral load

The decision on whether to continue or stop therapy should primarily be based on the level of HCV RNA during treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to measure viral load accurately. Important aspects to consider in this respect are the natural fluctuations in viral load during infection, as well as intra-assay (within an individual test) and inter-assay (between different tests) variability. Currently available commercial assays vary considerably in their dynamic ranges of quantification (Table 1). Despite the introduction of international units per mL (IU/mL) for reporting viral load, discrepancies may occur when patients are monitored using different types of assay. For example, rules for early discontinuation at week 12 and 24, as well as rules for determination of treatment duration [baseline viral load, RVR, complete early viral response (cEVR)], were established mainly with standard RT-PCR based assays, which have since been replaced by real-time PCR-based assays with higher sensitivity and broader dynamic range of linear HCV RNA quantification. The differences between commercial HCV RNA assays have been well documented in several studies, with the majority of studies showing an intra-assay variability of approx. 0.2 log. Generally, comparisons between Amplicor Monitor and CAP/CTM yielded comparable results (± 0.2 log), whereas comparisons between bDNA and Abbott real-time HCV on the one hand and CAP/CTM on the other showed a difference of 0.5–0.7 log. Additionally, HCV RNA viral load decline assessed during antiviral therapy can give different results, regardless of the use of IUs. False-positive and false-negative results, as well as variations in the HCV RNA level of up to 2 log 10 IU, have been observed, which may well have an impact on the management of patients, particularly if treatment decisions are made using a single HCV RNA assessment. Practitioners should be careful not to attach undue clinical significance to small changes (< 0.5 log 10) in serum HCV RNA level. The clinical relevance of serial HCV viral level measurements in a patient is dependent on continuous use of the specific quantitative assay employed in the initial determination of the viral level. This may imply repeated testing in some cases; but these extra costs may be justified if they affect treatment management decisions.

These various genotyping methods offer certain benefits, but they also have their limitations. To date, there have been no perfect genotyping tests. While sequencing can offer excellent resolution of HCV genotype, it can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, it requires skilled technologists and is costly, and results are not standardized. Real-time PCR methods offer workflow advantages, with a high degree of automation associated with reduced hands-on time, reduced technical expertise requirements, and reduced costs, and commercial methods which are approved for use in the United States (FDA) and Europe (CE) are now available. However, studies have shown that certain rare viral subtypes may not be resolved or accurately discriminated by this technology. Finally, strip-based reverse-hybridization methods are cheap but are manually performed and labor-intensive and result interpretation is subjective.

Interferon-based therapies have substantial side-effect profiles and only moderate efficacy (50% in HCV genotype 1 versus 75% in HCV genotypes 2 and 3) as measured by SVR 24 weeks post-treatment cessation. For these therapies, certain baseline predictors, such as a viral load of < 800,000 IU/ml, infection with HCV genotype 2 or 3, and favorable patient genotype for certain genes associated with immune response such as the IL-28B gene, are considered valuable predictors of long-term treatment success. In areas of the world where interferon-based therapies continue to be prescribed, physicians need to weigh these predictors against patient clinical presentation in their decision of whether or not to initiate a course of interferon-based therapy. Once a patient has been started on an interferon-based regimen, monitoring of viral load and kinetics (for the approach known as response-guided therapy, or RGT) has proven to be very effective in guiding decisions regarding the duration of therapy to optimize rates of SVR.

### Rate and predictors of serum HCV-RNA > 6 million IU / mL in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^11158pLa]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Baseline serum HCV-RNA predicts sustained virological response in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with antiviral therapy. A threshold at 6 million IU/mL has been proposed to best discriminate treatment outcomes on sofosbuvir-based regimens. In comparison with the general population, immunosuppressed individuals exhibit greater viral load values.

Objectives

To estimate the rate and predictors of serum HCV-RNA above 6 millionIU/mL in chronic hepatitis C patients on care outside clinical trials.

Study Design

Serum HCV-RNA values recorded from all chronic hepatitis C patients consecutively attended at our clinic during the last decade were analyzed. Testing had been performed using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test v2.0.

Results

A total of 816 individuals with detectable serum HCV-RNA were identified. The main characteristics of this population were as follows: mean age 48.6 years-old; 73.4% males; mean ALT 82.6IU/L; mean HCV-RNA 6.02logIU/mL; 80.6% HCV genotypes 1 or 4; 34.9% advanced liver fibrosis; 35.4% IL28B-CC alleles. HIV coinfection in 78.7%, of whom 91% were on antiretroviral therapy. Overall, 127 (15.6%) had serum HCV-RNA values > 6 millionIU/mL. This high viremia was found in 18.2% of HIV-positive versus 5.7% of HIV-negative subjects (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, serum HCV-RNA > 6 millionIU/mL was only significantly associated with HIV coinfection (OR: 4.03; 95% CI: 1.98–8.19, p < 0.01) and HCV genotypes 1 or 4 (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.05–3.37, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Serum HCV-RNA > 6 millionIU/mL is roughly seen in 6% of chronic hepatitis C monoinfected patients, and increases up to 18% in HIV coinfection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in HIV care — screening and confirmatory testing states that on entry into HIV care, all HIV-infected patients should undergo routine HCV screening, and initial testing should use the most sensitive immunoassays licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood; for at risk HCV-seronegative individuals, HCV antibody testing is recommended annually or as indicated by risk exposure; false-negative anti-HCV antibody results are uncommon (< 1%) in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression, and following acute HCV infection the window period prior to seroconversion ranges from 2 weeks to 12 weeks; elevated ALT early in acute infection should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in at-risk individuals; individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo confirmatory testing using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level; plasma HCV RNA viral load does not correlate with HCV disease severity and should not be monitored serially in patients not taking HCV treatment, but plasma HCV RNA levels provide important prognostic information about the likelihood of response to HCV treatment.

### Dynamic range of hepatitis C virus RNA quantification with the cobas ampliprep-cobas amplicor HCV monitor v2.0 assay [^116etRVW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Accurate quantification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is needed in clinical practice to decide whether to continue or stop pegylated interferon-alpha-ribavirin combination therapy at week 12 of treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C. Currently the HCV RNA quantification assay most widely used worldwide is the Amplicor HCV Monitor v2.0 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, Calif.). The HCV RNA extraction step can be automated in the Cobas Ampliprep device. In this work, we show that the dynamic range of HCV RNA quantification of the Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor v2.0 procedure is 600 to 200,000 HCV RNA IU/ml (2.8 to 5.3 log IU/ml), which does not cover the full range of HCV RNA levels in infected patients. Any sample containing more than 200,000 IU/ml (5.3 log IU/ml) must thus be retested after dilution for accurate quantification. These results emphasize the need for commercial HCV RNA quantification assays with a broader range of linear quantification, such as real-time PCR-based assays.

The Diagnostic Challenge

Despite the huge burden of hepatitis B worldwide, with an estimated 350 million people chronically infected, very few patients in low- and middle-income countries are currently receiving antiviral treatment. This is largely to blame on lack of access to viral load quantification, because this is considered a mandatory component of the diagnostic work-up in all international liver society guidelines. Without a viral load measurement, it is virtually impossible to establish whether a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive individual has chronic hepatitis B, characterized by a level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA > 2000–20 000 IU/mL and continued necro-inflammation in the liver. These patients are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of antiviral treatment, whereas inactive carriers, characterized by HBV DNA levels < 2000 IU/mL, have an excellent prognosis in the absence of treatment.

The situation for hepatitis C is somewhat different because the main obstacle to treatment has been expensive and toxic treatment regimens. With the release of new direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C, opportunities are opening up in less developed countries where the disease burden is often high. An estimated 130–150 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) globally, and the prevalence is higher in certain areas such as North Africa and Central and East Asia. However, prior to starting treatment of hepatitis C, HCV RNA measurements are required to establish the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection, which is a major obstacle in many places in the world.

Lack of access to viral load testing and antiviral treatment of HBV and HCV in resource-limited settings is a silent epidemic with major consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 1 million people die from chronic HBV and HCV infection each year, which places viral hepatitis on the top 10 leading causes of mortality globally.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^113pp6de]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Statistical analyses

We evaluated the distribution of HCV viral load at 12 weeks post‐treatment assessment among all patients in the combined data set using both standard IU/mL measures and normalized using a log 10 transformation, to allow for better visualization of the viral load distribution. From these measures, we identified the lower 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles of the HCV RNA distribution. To estimate the 95% confidence interval for each viral load threshold, we use the method described by Hahn and Meeker, 1991, which corrects for a non‐normal distribution of values.

We next identified the subgroup of individuals who had HCV RNA that is detectable, but < 1000 IU/mL at the time of SVR assessment. Such individuals were defined as having 'low‐level viremia' (LLV) at the time of treatment failure. We chose the threshold of < 1000 IU/mL because that is the LLoD for HCV core antigen assay and a reasonable proxy for newer platforms being developed that have potential to be near point‐of‐care in use and so promote access to diagnosis and treatment. We described the characteristics of this subgroup and employed logistic regression to assess factors associated with having LLV compared to no LLV among those with detectable viral load at SVR12. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute; Cary, NC). The Boston University Institutional Review Board ruled this study not human subjects research.

2.5 Sensitivity analyses

We conducted two additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses. First, we examined whether results differed between clinical trial and observational cohorts to determine whether conclusions potentially differ in investigational and real‐world settings. Second, we examined the HCV RNA viral load at SVR24 after treatment completion to assess whether checking for cure at 24 weeks rather than 12 weeks would provide similar conclusions. This was undertaken in the cohort from Georgia, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and one of the clinical trial cohorts that reported patient HCV RNA test results at both 12‐ and 24 weeks post‐treatment.

3.2 HCV viral load distribution and limit of detection analysis

The median detectable HCV RNA at SVR12 was 287,986 IU/mL (approximately 5.5 log 10) (IQR = 1,323,500 IU/mL with 25th percentile = 26,500 and 75% percentile = 1,350,000) (Figure 1). 90% of those with detectable viraemia at SV12 had a viral load greater than 1133 (95% CI 940–1390), 95% greater than 227 IU/mL (95% CI 170–276), 97% greater than 70 IU/mL (95% CI 48–86) and 99% greater than 19 IU/mL (95% CI 16–23). Five hundred seventy‐four individuals (10%) were defined as having LLV, meaning that a hypothetical assay with LLoD of 1000 IU/mL would miss approximately 10% of treatment failures in this setting.

Treatment response definitions in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — virological milestones are defined as follows: Rapid virological response (RVR) requires undetectable serum HCV RNA (< 50 IU/mL) after 4 wk of treatment; early virological response requires undetectable or at least a 2 log decrease in serum HCV RNA from baseline level after 12 wk of treatment; end-of-treatment response requires undetectable serum HCV RNA (< 50 IU/mL) at the conclusion of treatment; sustained virological response (SVR) requires undetectable serum HCV RNA (< 50 IU/mL) 24 wk after the end of treatment; partial response is a decrease in serum HCV RNA level but still detectable HCV RNA level at 24 wk of treatment; nonresponse is detectable serum HCV RNA at 24 wk of treatment without any significant decrease in serum HCV RNA level; relapse is detection of serum HCV RNA after an end-of-treatment response had been achieved.

### Short-duration therapy for hepatitis C: suitable for all? [^116XbdmJ]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Peginterferon alpha (PegIFN alpha) plus ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (SVR) in more than 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although in the trials which led to the registration of this combination therapy, only a 48-week period of treatment had been evaluated, current international guidelines state that 48 or 24 weeks of treatment should be recommended in accordance with genotype; i.e. 48 weeks for genotypes 1 and 4, and 24 weeks for 2 and 3. However, side effects and the high cost of antiviral therapy forced investigators to evaluate further reductions in the treatment duration. Based on the new evidence that fast and persistent viral clearance is highly predictive of SVR, a week 4 negative HCV RNA by a sensitive molecular assay was recently utilized as a criterion for halving the duration of treatment to 12–16 weeks for genotypes 2 and 3, and 24 weeks for genotype 1 patients. However, some issues on this topic, are still open. In this review, existing evidence is discussed, and both the relevance and limitations of published studies are considered.

### Clinical utility of viral load measurements in individuals with chronic hepatitis C infection on antiviral therapy [^114mNTRy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2005). Low credibility.

Summary

Both absolute viral load and log decline in viral load from baseline were found clinically useful in predicting sustained virological response and lack of sustained virological response (non-sustained virological response, NSVR) to treatment. We assessed the clinical utility of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA quantitation and changes in viral load using the VERSANT HCV RNA 3.0 Assay (bDNA) in 351 HCV-infected individuals treated with interferon plus ribavirin. We show that viral load decision thresholds provided negative predictive values (NPVs) of > 95% at week 4 using a 100 000 IU/mL cut-off and at weeks 8 and 12 using 10 000 IU/mL cut-offs. A 2-log decline from baseline provided NPVs > 95% at weeks 8 and 12. Combinations of absolute viral loads and changes in viral load from baseline did not enhance the performance of the decision rules for predicting NSVR. The positive predictive values (PPVs) at weeks 8 and 12 were 59.1 and 67.3%. This study highlights the critical importance of viral quantitation in gauging therapeutic response in patients with chronic HCV infection on antiviral therapy. Early changes in viral load, measured as absolute viral loads or change in viral load from baseline, are highly predictive of NSVR at 8 and 12 weeks. PPVs are modest but these data may provide encouragement to patients who are in the early phases of treatment when side effects are frequent. Additionally, we demonstrated the need for cautious interpretation of stopping rules when the values are at or near the decision thresholds.

### Quantification of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in a multicenter study: implications for management of HCV genotype 1-infected patients [^115ovF7Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Assessment of the viral load in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected patients is critical before, during, and after antiviral therapy. In patients achieving a rapid virological response at week 4 of treatment, the viral load at the baseline is considered a predictive criterion of a sustained virological response 24 weeks after the discontinuation of treatment. A ≥ 2-log(10) drop in the viral load at week 12 of treatment (early virological response) triggers the continuation of therapy. We organized a multicenter study (MS) for diagnostic laboratories involved in the quantification of HCV RNA. Commercial assays, including two based on real-time reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan system), and in-house methods, were used by the 61 participants. The overall reproducibility of the commercial quantitative nucleic acid amplification techniques (qNAT) was acceptable. As the intermethod variability among commercial qNAT for HCV RNA was still present, the manufacturers of these test kits should join efforts to harmonize the means of quantification of HCV RNA. This study also shows that caution should be exercised when the baseline viral load is evaluated and when the 2-log(10) reduction after 12 weeks of therapy is interpreted. Finally, this MS confirms the higher sensitivity of the commercial qNAT based on the TaqMan system, making them the elective assays for the monitoring of therapy.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^113GwoDB]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Genotype 1

Week 12 stopping rule for patients with HCV genotype 1

The current week 12 stopping rule recommends that patients without a ≥ 2 log 10 drop in viral load compared to baseline (between 19% and 29% of patients with genotype 1 infection) discontinue therapy since the likelihood of achieving SVR with continued treatment is small; the negative predictive value is almost 100%. Over-treatment of patients who have an extremely low chance of achieving SVR is thus avoided and valuable resources can be reserved for patients with a higher chance of treatment success. Week 12 monitoring should be carried out as close as possible to the week 12 time point, ideally ± 5 days, using a test with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Whether the 2 log 10 drop represents the most accurate cut-off level for the decision on treatment termination or proceeding remains to be determined in prospective clinical studies. It is likely that with greater use of more sensitive assays with a broader range of linear quantification (e.g. real-time PCR assays), this parameter may be refined/adjusted in the near future. It may also be the case that new drugs currently in development will require different threshold levels and/or stopping rules based on their different modes of action, although this remains to be seen.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of progressive liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality globally. In 2021, there were an estimated 58 million persons with a chronic infection, with a disproportionately high burden in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Short‐course curative direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) regimens have transformed opportunities for treatment scale‐up and elimination. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat, with ambitious targets for elimination of HCV including a 90% reduction in new infections and a 65% reduction in HCV‐related mortality by 2030.

In order to meet the 2030 global targets for HCV elimination, there is a need to substantially scale‐up access to testing and treatment, with simplified service delivery models and diagnostic innovations to expand access. A key step in the care cascade is the use of HCV viral load assays to confirm presence of viraemic infection, and then a test of cure following treatment. The 2017 WHO viral hepatitis testing guidelines recommended a laboratory‐based PCR Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT), or a core HCV antigen assay with comparable clinical sensitivity, as preferred strategies for diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection, and laboratory‐based PCR assays as a test of cure at SVR12. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are now available as an alternative to laboratory‐based NAAT assays to promote access, especially in hard to reach or marginalized populations. A previous multi‐cohort analysis examined the distribution of HCV viral load at diagnosis in 66,640 individuals from 12 countries and established that 97% had a viral load greater than 1318 IU/mL and 95% had a viral load greater than 3,311 IU/mL. The key laboratory‐based assays (Abbott Real time HCV PCR, Alinity m HCV RT‐PCR, Abbott Real time HCV PCR) have an analytical sensitivity or LloD of between 5–15 IU/mL, and key PoC assays: HCV RNA PoC GeneXpert assays are 10 IU/mL for venous blood, or 100 IU/mL using fingerstick capillary blood. All these assays are therefore acceptable for diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

### Is HCV core antigen a reliable marker of viral load? An evaluation of HCV core antigen automated immunoassay [^115rfqZF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Additionally, our quantitative results yielded an HCV RNA/HCV Ag ratio that varied from one patient to another from 1.5 to 3.25. This finding is considered to be due to the presence of HCV-Ag not only in complete but also in incomplete viral particles and protein structures as has been previously pointed out.

The use of sensitive assays for HCV viral load determination is widely recognized. The assay for HCV-Ag detection by Architect demonstrates high correlation with HCV RNA and improved sensitivity in relation to previous versions of the test. Despite the improvement in sensitivity, there are still obvious limitations of HCV Ag compared to modern molecular methods that can detect as little as 10–15 IU/ mL. However, the high specificity and the simplicity of the test, the rapid turnaround time of the results and its lower price suggest that it could be cost effectively applied in clinical practice. It was demonstrated, in consequence of the high specificity, that HCV Ag positivity is clear proof of viremia and active HCV infection. Therefore, in screening scenarios, only patients with HCV Ag negative results would have to be evaluated for HCV viral load with more sensitive and expensive molecular methods, like RT-PCR, which are definitely essential for the monitoring of treatment. In positive HCV Ag cases, absolute HCV Ag levels need to be carefully interpreted on an individual basis and at this point they cannot replace molecular methods for HCV RNA quantification. More studies, with concomitant consideration of the financial cost of HCV viral load testing, need to be conducted in order to pinpoint the proper applications of HCV Ag testing.

3.3 Factors associated with low‐level viraemia (< 1000 IU/mL) at SVR12

We examined baseline demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics associated with LLV (< 1000 IU/mL) compared to non‐LLV and present these results in Table 3. In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for demographic (age, sex, data source, HIV/HBV co‐infection) and disease (fibrosis stage, genotype, regimen duration, DAA treatment era) characteristics, females had higher odds of experiencing LLV (odds ratio [OR] = 1.60, 95% CI 1.30–1.97). Compared to cirrhosis (F4), no or minimal fibrosis (F0‐F1) was associated with higher odds of having a low detectable viral load (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.15–1.93), as was genotype 3 (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.18–2.41). Finally, we found that compared to early era DAA regimens, mid‐era DAA regimens were associated with a lower likelihood of low‐viraemia detection (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.40–0.75).

Chronic hepatitis B — HBV DNA quantification and prognostic thresholds are characterized as follows: assays with lower detection limit 5–10 IU/mL and dynamic range up to 8–9 log10 IU/mL have become available, and quantification of serum HBV DNA is described as a crucial component for evaluation and treatment assessment; an arbitrary value of 20,000 IU/mL (> 10⁵ copies/mL) was chosen as a diagnostic criterion, but HBV DNA can fluctuate from undetectable to > 2,000,000 IU/mL and lower levels (3–5 log10 IU/mL) may be associated with progressive liver disease, so serial monitoring is more important than any single cutoff value.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Key points
- Hepatitis C can be cured in more than 95% of cases with just 8–12 weeks of well-tolerated oral-only treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents.
- Curative DAA treatment is recommended for essentially everyone with hepatitis C.
- Clinicians can mitigate risk for advanced liver disease progressing with lifestyle counseling, co-infection monitoring, and recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
- Protease inhibitors
- Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors
- Nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors Many agents have antiviral activity against all genotypes. Available therapies can cure more than 95% of people infected with HCV within 8–12 weeks of therapy. Learn more about oral therapy options from the University of Washington Infectious Disease Education & Assessment program.

Treatment recommendations Except for pregnant patients and children under 3, clinicians should treat people with detectable HCV RNA in their blood with oral DAA therapy. There is no need to wait for potential spontaneous viral resolution. Clinicians should also:

- Conduct a full medical evaluation for chronic liver disease.
- Conduct a risk assessment and testing for HBV and HIV.
- Vaccinate against hepatitis A and hepatitis B as recommended. Treatment precautions DAA therapies are not approved for pregnant patients and children under 3. There are efforts underway to develop prenatal treatment options and/or infant antiviral postexposure prophylaxis to prevent perinatal transmission. Hepatitis B virus reactivation risk Some co-infected patients receiving DAA therapy for HCV infection have reported reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection. Therefore, clinicians should test all patients starting HCV DAA therapy for HBV infection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following tests:

- hepatitis B surface antigen
- antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
- total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen Clinicians should monitor people who test positive for HBsAg or for an isolated positive anti-HBc for reactivation of HBV infection while they are receiving treatment. Learn more about treating HBV/HCV co-infected patients from the AASLD and IDSA. For more information on HBV reactivation, visit the American Gastroenterological Association. You should remind patients of proper practices to avoid HCV transmission while on treatment and to avoid reinfection after successfully completing treatment, like.

### Minimum target prices for production of direct-acting antivirals and associated diagnostics to combat hepatitis C virus [^1121yJTY]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The current analysis further suggests that the current diagnostic and monitoring package could be substantially simplified as a result of the improved side-effect profile and efficacy of DAA combinations observed in clinical trials. Monitoring with a full blood count plus clinical chemistry test (pretreatment and during treatment) could be sufficient to monitor for side effects and could cost in the region of US$22 per person. If treatment is not pangenotypic, HCV genotyping could be added to pretreatment monitoring. Although qualitative viral load monitoring is desirable and informative, current approaches are expensive and technically complex; this limitation, together with the high SVR rates in current DAA trials, brings into question the necessity of repeated viral load monitoring during treatment. Given that the majority of HCV infections are associated with very high viral loads, including in patients relapsing after treatment, a qualitative HCV antigen test could be sufficient to confirm viral replication or suppression both pre- and post-treatment. The HCV antigen assay is less expensive and requires less technical expertise than PCR assays; further evaluations regarding the LLOD are required. New studies need to assess how often the RNA levels are above the LLOD of 2,000 IU/mL before treatment or at relapse/reinfection and to confirm that the HCV-RNA and HCV antigen tests provide comparable results.

This analysis has several limitations. The results of clinical trials on the new DAAs are not representative of all patient subpopulations in need of treatment. Relatively few patients with genotypes 4–6 have been included in clinical studies, despite these genotypes predominating in certain regions of the world. The high SVR rates for these new DAAs still need to be confirmed in real-world situations outside clinical trials. Most of these DAAs are only at phase III of development or have only recently been approved. Clinical trial populations are selective, and safety in program settings may be different. All regimen cost estimates in this analysis are based on a 12-week treatment course. Shorter treatment durations would further reduce estimated costs if efficacy is shown. Conversely, for some of the currently approved DAA regimens, some genotypes require 24 weeks of treatment. In the future, when clinical trial results are available, the costs of sequences of treatment will be required, including new or existing DAA treatments for patients who relapse on their initial combinations — these costings will need to be included in subsequent analyses. Finally, the estimated costs do not include the importation, transport, and distribution of the drugs.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^111Espcf]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

We also included clinical trials databases from two pharmaceutical companies who were responsible for originator DAAs (Gilead and AbbVie). We pooled data from relevant DAA trials into a single repository. Patient eligibility criteria varied by study trial, and the majority required a pre‐treatment viral load over 1000 IU/mL for enrolment and censored individuals who experienced on‐treatment virological failure. Both clinical trial databases were used individually to determine LLoD and the distribution of HCV RNA at treatment failure based on summary data at SVR12 assessment. However, only one database was able to provide patient‐level data to contribute to the multivariable regression analyses of factors associated with low‐level viraemia (LLV).

2.2 Characteristics of study cohorts

Most of the included cohorts have been well described in the literature. Table 1 summarizes key characteristics of these cohorts, including number of HCV‐treated patients, gender, age, and genotype distribution, DAA regimens and the proportion who achieved SVR following treatment. There was a high degree of heterogeneity in patient characteristics across cohorts, reflecting varying HCV epidemic profiles in different countries.

### HCV RNA viral load assessments in the era of direct-acting antivirals [^115nswyn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent regulatory approvals of the NS3/4A protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir launched a new therapeutic era for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. Decisions to shorten, extend, or stop treatment with these direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens require accurate quantification of serum HCV RNA levels. To effectively use DAA therapies, clinicians must understand performance characteristics of HCV RNA real-time PCR assays and the clinical significance of HCV RNA that is detectable below the lower limit of quantification. This review summarizes terms used to report HCV RNA viral load results, explains the analytical performance of the PCR assay used in the clinical trials of boceprevir and telaprevir, and compares currently available commercial assays.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis and screening — The diagnosis of HCV infection usually begins with an immunoassay for detection of HCV IgG or total antibodies in serum or plasma, but antibody may not be detectable until 6–10 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Individuals with negative HCV antibody screening test results do not need further testing except in immunocompromised individuals, in whom development of HCV IgG antibody may be delayed for up to 6 months after exposure, or those suspected to have acute HCV infection. Those with positive initial HCV IgG or total antibody test results should undergo confirmatory or supplemental testing for HCV RNA with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); supplemental HCV IgG antibody assays can confirm antibodies but are not FDA-approved currently for clinical use in the United States. Per current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, the following individuals should be screened for HCV infection: all adults aged > 18 years at least once, previously untested persons with risk factors, and pregnant women during each pregnancy except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. HCV RNA can be detected soon after infection and NAAT can be qualitative or quantitative; highly sensitive molecular assays with a limit of detection of ≤ 25 IU/mL are necessary to monitor virologic response and to determine cure, and determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1 to 6 and 1a vs 1b) is used to guide antiviral therapy choice and duration and to predict response.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The curing of HCV infection is associated with reduced liver-related morbidity and mortality and an improved quality of life. Following the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), HCV infection can now be cured in the majority of patients.

Treatment efficacy is determined by measuring HCV RNA at specific time points before, during, and after antiviral therapy. According to current guidelines, real-time PCR-based HCV RNA assays must be highly sensitive and accurate, with a broad linear range of quantification across all HCV genotypes.

Baseline viral load is known to be an important predictor of treatment efficacy in patients treated with interferon (IFN)-based regimens. A low baseline HCV RNA, along with other factors, has also been used to identify patients eligible for a shortened course of IFN-based therapy. Moreover, on-treatment HCV RNA measurements were used to guide treatment duration and decisions on futility, particularly in patients treated with the protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. Even with today's widely used IFN-free ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimen, baseline HCV RNA is used for determining treatment duration, whereas subsequent HCV RNA measurements are mainly used for assessing the patient's adherence and for demonstrating viral eradication after treatment completion. In addition, on-treatment HCV RNA measurements may still be used for predicting the efficacy of IFN-free DAA regimens in some patient subgroups, including in patients with cirrhosis and those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infections. For this purpose, current guidelines recommend measuring HCV RNA at different time points, ideally with the same assay to maintain consistency of results.

Hepatitis C virus care during COVID-19 — pandemic impact and monitoring emphasizes that HCV screening, diagnosis, and treatment were significantly adversely affected, with HCV RNA–positive test results decreased 62% in March 2020 and remaining 39% below baseline in July 2020, and testing volume decreased precipitously beginning in mid-March 2020; comparable decreases occurred in Ontario during each of the first 3 waves; a US national retrospective study found only 23% of people on Medicaid with a positive HCV RNA test between 30 January 2019 and 31 October 2020 initiated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment within 360 days of diagnosis; and a survey of European Association for the Study of the Liver members representing 48 clinical centers showed decreased HCV testing, diagnosis, and treatment in 2020 compared with 2019 (prepandemic). These findings underscore the critical importance of ongoing, rigorous, universal HCV screening for case identification and linkage to care, and monitoring the proportion of persons who meet steps in the HCV cascade of care will be critical to assessing the quality of HCV care.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1129JxPg]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

This study assessed the distribution of detectable viral loads 12 weeks following the end of treatment for HCV infection in an international cohort to inform the lower limit of detection of viral load assays for test of cure to identify treatment failure as well as for diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. Based on a combined data set of clinical trials and observational data, a LLoD of 227 IU/mL (4030 IU/mL in the clinical trials subsample) would identify 95% of patients with a detectable viral load 12 weeks after treatment. While more than 10 times higher than the analytical sensitivity of laboratory‐based NAATs, it is more than 10 times lower than the LLoD for HCV diagnosis. These findings demonstrate it might be prudent and necessary to consider different LLoD standards for HCV diagnosis and for test of cure. Development of a point‐of‐care HCV test for cure with a low enough limit of detection to identify 95% of patients and is affordable, is an important aspect of expanding access to HCV treatment and a vital component of the WHO's HCV elimination targets.

Proportion of HCV genotype 2 and 3-infected patients who could be considered for shortened or extended therapy duration

In general, patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 should not be routinely treated for less than the currently recommended 24 weeks to avoid an increased risk of virologic relapse. However, patients with a low pre-treatment viral load (≤ 400 000 IU/mL) and an RVR (as determined by a highly sensitive assay) have the highest probability of achieving an SVR with 16 weeks of therapy (Fig. 4). Such a regimen may be a reasonable option for these patients, especially if tolerability of longer treatment may be a concern. The cut-off for low-viral load in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 based on the ACCELERATE data is ≤ 400 000 IU/mL. As with genotype 1, baseline viral load should be determined in two samples, taken at least 4 weeks apart.

Fig. 4
Overview of the ACCELERATE data: 16 vs 24 weeks. SVR: sustained viral response.

Shortening of treatment duration should not be considered for patients with cirrhosis, persistently normal ALT values or co-infection with HBV or immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection or those who have undergone liver transplantation.

There may be patient subgroups with genotype 2 or 3 infection that might benefit from extended treatment duration to reduce relapse rates. Results from the trial by Hadziyannis et al. found evidence for reduced relapse rates in genotype 2 and 3 pts with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis as well as high baseline viral load when treated for 48 weeks in comparison with 24 weeks.

However, due to insufficient data from prospective clinical trials, there is currently not enough evidence for such recommendations. It is possible that a higher, weight-based dose of RBV may balance the increased risk of relapse associated with a shorter treatment duration, but this remains to be proven. An overview of the proposed treatment strategy for patients with genotypes 2 and 3 is given in Fig. 5.

### Clinical utility of total HCV core antigen quantification: a new indirect marker of HCV replication [^115LX5LL]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA detection, viral load quantification, and HCV genotyping are widely used in clinical practice. Recently, the availability of an anticore antigen (Ag) monoclonal antibody allowed development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting and quantifying total HCV core Ag in peripheral blood of HCV-infected patients. The aims of the present study were to investigate the biologic significance of this new marker in HCV infection, to establish the intrinsic performance of the current assay, and to determine its potential utility in the management of HCV-infected patients. A panel of infected sera calibrated to the World Health Organization International Standard and 657 serum samples from infected patients receiving antiviral treatment were studied. We showed that total HCV core Ag quantification is an accurate, precise, and specific indirect marker of HCV replication. We estimated that 1 pg/mL of total HCV core Ag is equivalent to approximately 8,000 HCV RNA international units (IU)/mL, although minor between-patient differences may exist. In conclusion, total HCV core Ag quantification can be used in the various indications of viral load monitoring, including the evaluation of baseline viral load before therapy, the assessment of the virologic response to antiviral treatment, and the study of early viral kinetics during therapy. Nevertheless, the total HCV core Ag assay cannot be used as a marker of viral replication for HCV RNA values below 20,000 IU/mL, limiting its use in the monitoring of late events during and after antiviral treatment.

### What are the benefits of a sustained virologic response to direct-acting antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection? [^111keHht]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are safe and effective at eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unfortunately, DAAs remain expensive, so treatment of all HCV-infected patients would substantially affect health care costs. It is therefore important to continue to assess the hepatic and extrahepatic benefits of a DAA-induced sustained virologic response (SVR). A DAA-induced SVR reduces a patient's risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection; there are also data to indicate that an SVR can reduce mortality. SVR is a relevant clinical end point, but further analyses are required to confirm its importance among diverse HCV-infected populations and to document the public health benefits of HCV elimination at the population level. We review the evidence for the benefits associated with SVRs in different clinical settings and challenges to data collection.

### Rate of sustained virologic response in relation to baseline hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA level and rapid virologic clearance in persons with acute HCV infection [^112SFZim]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to a sustained virologic response (SVR) in the vast majority of patients, although the clinical predictors of these favorable responses are not well understood. In chronic infection, the most potent predictor of a SVR is complete viral suppression after 4 weeks of treatment, also known as a rapid virologic response (RVR). However, few patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and high-level viremia ever achieve this benchmark. In 2 separate cohorts of patients with acute HCV infection, we demonstrate that rapid virologic clearance and low-level viremia (HCV RNA level, < 400,000 IU/mL) are highly prevalent, regardless of HCV genotype.

### Frequency of very low HCV viremia detected by a highly sensitive HCV-RNA assay [^11223vPR]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Only limited data is available on the frequency and clinical significance of very low hepatitis C viremia (< 600 IU/ml) determined by novel sensitive methods for HCV quantification.

Study Design

We evaluated the new Abbott m2000 RealTime PCR assay in 3213 consecutive anti-HCV-positive sera as well as in 50 HCV-recovered patients with sustained virological response to standard antiviral therapy.

Results

The assay showed a linear range between 10(1) IU/ml and 10(7) IU/ml for HCV genotypes 1–6. An HCV viremia below 600 IU/ml was detected more often with the m2000 RealTime PCR assay than with the Cobas Amplicor assay in viremic sera (7.1% versus 1.8%). Seventy-seven cases with HCV levels below 100 IU/ml not related to ongoing antiviral therapy were identified. An HCV-RNA of less than 12 IU/ml was found in nine of the 50 SVR patients. Two patients had a viral load of 34 IU/ml and 84 IU/ml, respectively, one of those showed persistently elevated ALT levels over a period of 5 years after the end of antiviral treatment.

Conclusion

An HCV viremia below 600 IU/ml can be detected in almost every 40th anti-HCV-positive sera using real-time PCR based assays. Low persisting HCV-RNA in patients after antiviral therapy may be associated with mild liver inflammation in single cases.

### Virological tools to diagnose and monitor hepatitis C virus infection [^112WnyJP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 200 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Infection with HCV is curable by therapy, with the current standard treatment based on the combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. Viral eradication is achieved in approximately half of treated patients. In 2011 a new antiviral treatment based on a triple combination with a protease inhibitor will become available. Virological tools are essential to diagnose HCV infection but they have found their principal application in guiding treatment decisions and assessing the virological responses to therapy. These include the anti-HCV antibody assay, measurements of HCV core antigen and HCV viral load and HCV genotyping. The HCV RNA can be ideally assayed by a real-time assay with a limit of detection of 10–15 IU/mL. Monitoring of viral kinetics during the early phases of antiviral treatment is crucial in making treatment decisions such as early stopping rules and also in optimizing the treatment duration. The HCV genotype should be assessed before the start of treatment because it determines the treatment length and ribavirin dose and also offers prognostic information on treatment outcomes as certain genotypes respond more favourably to treatment.

### SHEA guideline for management of healthcare workers who are infected with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and / or human immunodeficiency virus [^1115Z6ey]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Management of healthcare personnel (HCP) living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) states that HCP living with HCV should seek an initial evaluation from an expert physician and should seek optimal medical management, and HCP who do not perform category III/exposure-prone procedures should not be prohibited from participating in patient-care activities solely on the basis of their HCV infection; consonant with CDC guidance there is no justification for, nor benefit gained from, routine notification of patients of HCP living with HCV who are being managed by an oversight panel. For category III/exposure-prone procedures, HCP living with HCV who, despite appropriate antiviral treatment, have detectable circulating HCV RNA > 2,000 IU/mL should not perform such procedures, whereas those who received treatment resulting in 'undetectable' circulating HCV-RNA levels can perform them as long as the individual has not been previously identified as having transmitted infection to patients following definitive therapy resulting in attaining an SVR and provides the oversight panel with records confirming a definitive course of therapy and at least one test documenting undetectable HCV-RNA within 12 weeks following the completion of therapy.

### Significant improvement in diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection by a one-step strategy in a central laboratory: an optimal tool for hepatitis C elimination? [^114MFmBH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The results from this study show how the application of a viral load reflex testing (or one-step) protocol for the diagnosis of HCV infections in a central laboratory allows an outstanding increase in diagnostic rates, particularly in the primary care setting, which in our discipline entails the main entry point for new cases of HCV infection, and drug treatment centers, where hepatitis C has the highest prevalence in our area (21%).

To implement this screening protocol, it was essential to first ensure the suitability of the sample in which the viral load was to be determined. The fact that the flow cytometry analyzer keeps samples capped while processing them — thus preventing contact with aerosols and environmental RNAses — strongly reduced the likelihood of contamination and deterioration of viral RNA. Furthermore, the probability of a sample free of HCV RNA matching a sample with a detectable viral load in the same analytical sequence was in fact much lower than the probability of both samples coexisting in the same anti-HCV antibody determination sequence in the serology analyzer (even taking into account the low probability in the Cobas 8000 analyzer due to the use of disposable tips). Despite the a priori favorable conditions to implement the reflex testing protocol, an occasional error in the washing system of the blood count analyzer could cause minimal contamination, like that observed in two of the nine analyzed samples in which HCV RNA was detected, although in amounts below the quantification limit of 15 IU/ml. In this regard, it is important to mention that, in naive patients, viral loads have been previously reported to be > 3 logs in a very high proportion (EASL guidelines) or even > 2 logs based on our own experience. In fact, in the cases analyzed in this study, after application of the HCV RNA reflex testing, only nine cases (one in the primary care setting and eight in the CAS setting) showed HCV RNA levels of < 2 logs. Among them, only five cases with levels of < 15 IU/ml (four in CAS and one in primary care) were observed, which, after further investigation, were all related to antiviral treatment. Hence, a value of < 15 IU/ml should be considered irrelevant in the context of a new diagnosis. Still, faced with this potential risk, the need to evaluate the viral load in a new sample in cases with an HCV RNA level of ≤ 2 logs was included in the protocol (Fig. 2). Given the sampling path in our area, the sample collected for blood count analysis seems to be optimal for viral load reflex testing; however, other type of samples processed before could be used, provided that their adequacy (i.e. stability and lack of contamination) has been assessed. This possibility is also indicated in our recommended algorithm, which in fact is currently being implemented in all Catalonia.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

Determining Pre-Treatment Viral Loads and Defining Low vs High-Viral Loads

The definition and differentiation between low and high viral loads is still under discussion. Historically, pre-treatment viral load was classified as 'high' or 'low' using a cut-off of 2 × 10⁶ copies/mL, based on data generated using conventional interferon-based regimens or pegylated interferon monotherapy. When HCV RNA assays were standardized, conversion of copies/mL to IU/mL according to the WHO standard gave varying results depending on the assay used; 800 000 IU/mL has been recommended as the decision threshold for high versus low viraemia. However, recent data suggest that a baseline level of 400 000 IU/mL is the most effective cut-off for a high or low probability to achieve SVR in genotype 1-infected patients. This level was confirmed in a large 'real-life' experience study and in a further study by Martinot-Peignoux and colleagues, with the caveat that it should be applied to treatment-naïve patients only. In a recent study, pre-treatment HCV-RNA levels of 250 000 IU/mL best discriminated between genotype 1-infected patients with or without SVR after 24 weeks of therapy in patients with low pre-treatment viral load. Whether a single cut-off level for pre-treatment viraemia is sufficient or whether several ranges of pre-treatment HCV RNA levels might allow for individualized treatment duration remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, cut-offs for low or high baseline HCV RNA concentration were established mainly on the basis of standard RT-PCR and bDNA assays and re-definition by the currently used real-time PCR-based assays is required. According to current data, treatment duration of 24 weeks in genotype-1 infected patients should be strongly considered for patients who achieve RVR and have a baseline viral load below 800 000 IU/mL.

### Strategy for the maximization of clinically relevant information from hepatitis C virus, RT-PCR quantification [^111SFsNK]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing clinical application of viral load assays for monitoring viral infections has been an incentive for the development of standardized tests for the hepatitis C virus.

Objective

To develop a simple model for the prediction of baseline viral load in individuals infected with the hepatitis C virus.

Methodology

Viral load quantification of each patient's first sample was assessed by RT-PCR-ELISA using the Roche MONITOR assay in triplicate. Genotype of the infecting virus was identified by reverse line probe hybridization, using amplicons resulting from the qualitative HCV Roche AMPLICOR assay.

Results

Retrospective evaluation of first quantitative values suggested that 82.4% (n = 168/204) of individuals had a viral load between 4.3 and 6.7 log(10) viral copies per ml. A few patients (3.4%; n = 7/204) have a serum viremia less than the lower limit of the linear range of the RT-PCR assay. Subsequent, prospective evaluation of hepatitis C viral load of all new patients using a model based on the dynamic range of viral load in the retrospective group correctly predicted the dynamic range in 75.9% (n = 33/54).

Conclusion

The dynamic range of hepatitis C viremia extends beyond the linear range of the Roche MONITOR assay. Accurate determination of serum viremia is substantially improved by dilution of specimens prior to quantification.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1155icSB]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

The primary strength of this study is that the analysis was based on the largest global data set to date of nearly 6000 of HCV treatment failures. The high cure rate associated with pan‐genotypic DAAs, routinely exceeding 90%, has previously made it difficult to assemble a large enough cohort, representing different geographic regions with different genotypes, range of stage of disease and use of different DAA regimens with adequate rates of follow‐up SVR measurement — to reflect real‐life distribution of viral loads at treatment failure. We had data from both clinical trials with high level of follow‐up, as well as from observational cohorts reflecting real‐world treatment experience.

There are several limitations to the data and analysis. First, we are not able to measure all potential factors contributing to HCV RNA level at treatment failure, such as risk characteristics (injection drug behaviours, sex work, etc.), but the initial analysis did not show that drug regimen, genotype or stage of disease were important determinants of low‐level treatment failure. It is important to study and understand those unmeasured confounders, because if the underlying causal relationship is between a measurable or identifiable trait and the likelihood of having LLV at the time of treatment failure, then it may be possible to tailor guidance to identify venues or subgroups of people in whom it is still appropriate to employ available, close to patient assays to test for HCV cure. Second, our data set only included those who initiated treatment and returned for follow‐up HCV RNA testing 12 weeks post‐treatment. It is likely that those who fail to return for SVR may be at higher risk of treatment failure, and it is unclear whether they will be at lower or higher risk for LLV. However, this primarily affects the observational cohort and not clinical trial registry data. Third, more than 70% of our global data set cohort of treatment failures came from either Egypt (predominantly genotype 4) or the United States (predominantly genotype 1). We were not able to assemble a cohort of individuals with HCV treatment failure that represented all HCV genotypes, and all stages of disease. Finally, our global data set included data from both national and health system‐wide observational databases reflecting real‐world treatment experience, as well as from clinical trials with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in healthcare personnel (HCP) with suppressed but detectable viral load — thresholds, transmission evidence, and monitoring: For HCP living with HIV whose viral loads are suppressed but not to undetectable levels, each case must be assessed individually by an oversight panel; in the 2010 SHEA guideline the threshold was arbitrarily set at 5 × 10² GE/mL, whereas Australian and UK guidelines set it at 200 copies/ mL. Transmission has not been documented from a source HCP with viral load < 1,000 copies/mL, with one instance at 1,500 copies/mL where the sample was obtained > 7 months after the event; elite controllers can have infrequent fluctuations generally < 50 copies/mL, and for higher viral loads > 500 copies/mL, repeat viral load testing in 1–2 weeks is recommended to assure that they are not losing virologic control, and results should always be validated by a second viral-load test.

### Implications of HCV RNA level at week 4 of direct antiviral treatments for hepatitis C [^115Mw4QG]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine whether the HCV viral load after four weeks of treatment (W4VL) with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) predicts sustained virologic response (SVR) in a real-world clinical setting. We identified 21 095 patients who initiated DAA-based antiviral treatment in the national Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system from 01/01/2014 to 06/30/2015. Week 4 viral load was categorized as undetectable, detectable below quantification (DBQ), detectable above quantification (DAQ) with viral load ≤ 42 IU/mL and DAQ with viral load > 42 IU/mL. Week 4 viral load was undetectable in 36.1%, detectable below quantification in 45.6%, DAQ ≤ 42 in 9.3%, DAQ > 42 in 9.1%. Detectable above quantification was much more common and undetectable week 4 viral load much less common when tested with the Abbott RealTime HCV assay vs the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan Version 2 assay. Compared to patients with undetectable week 4 viral load (SVR = 93.5%), those with detectable below quantification (SVR = 91.8%, adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.79, P-value = .001), DAQ ≤ 42 (SVR = 90.0%, AOR 0.63, P-value < .001) and DAQ > 42 (SVR = 86.2%, AOR 0.52, P-value < .001) had progressively lower likelihood of achieving SVR after adjusting for baseline characteristics and treatment duration. Among genotype 1-infected patients who were potentially eligible for 8-week sofosbuvir/ledipasvir monotherapy, we did not find evidence that treatment for 12 weeks instead of 8 weeks was associated with higher SVR, even among those with detectable above quantification. In summary, DBQ and DAQ W4VL are very common in real-world practice, contrary to what was reported in clinical trials, and strongly predict reduced SVR across genotypes and clinically relevant patient subgroups. Whether and how week 4 viral load results should influence treatment decisions requires further study.

### New markers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^111ScxSR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

HCV core antigen quantification has been proposed as a surrogate marker of HCV RNA levels in patients with chronic HCV infection. In this issue, Hadziyannis etal report an interesting evaluation of the new Abbott automated assay for HCV core antigen in a large number of chronically HCV infected patients. The study showed a significant positive correlation between HCV RNA and core levels. The LLOD was 1,200 IU/mL of HCV RNA. These assays represent a credible alternative to those measuring HCV RNA levels, because they are less expensive (one-third the cost of an HCV RNA level measurement) and easier to use than current HCV RNA tests for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C and the monitoring of antiviral therapy. The only test approved in Europe, but not by the US Food and Drug Administration, however has a lower limit of detection corresponding to HCV RNA levels of the order of 500 to 3,000 IU/mL, depending on the HCV genotype. Thus, HCV core antigen quantification is not suitable to response-guided therapy, according to current guidelines, which use "undetectable" at 10–20 IU/mL as decision criterion.

In the last 20 years, the availability and use of point-ofcare (POC) tests have greatly increased and expanded to all fields of medicine. In the setting of infectious diseases, most existing POC tests consist of immunoassays. Some non-immunological POC tests, based on nucleic acid detection and quantification, are currently in development for HCV. POC tests are alternative methods to whole blood samples collected by venous puncture because they can use original specimen matrices such as oral fluid or finger-stick capillary whole blood. Several rapid diagnostic tests are already European Conformity (CE)-marked and are currently in evaluation in clinical settings. Blood can be collected on filter paper, known as the dried blood spot method, allowing the storage of desiccated blood for transport at room temperature via regular mail or courier services. Theoretically, DBS can be used for detection and eventually quantification of all virological parameters used to diagnose and monitor HCV infection. However, standardization and automation are urgently needed to improve the accuracy of these methods.

ROLE OF HCV DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS FOR ON-TREATMENT MONITORING AND POSTTREATMENT AND AS ADHERENCE MEASURES WITH DAA REGIMENS

Apart from some interferon-containing regimens, which rely on HCV load monitoring for assessment of treatment futility rules, decisions with regard to treatment duration with second- and third-generation DAAs are not guided by monitoring for treatment viral kinetics, although diagnostic tests remain critical for the management of patients with HCV. Virologic responses to the newest therapies depend not only on prior treatment experience, including response to previous anti-HCV treatment and other pretreatment clinical indicators, but also on viral genotype and subtype as well as baseline viral load in order to determine the optimal treatment regimen and its duration. The combination of the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir plus the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir has been formulated into a single tablet, which has received approval in Europe and the United States for the treatment of HCV infections. Approval was granted based upon trials that reported SVR rates of > 90% (and up to 99%) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with an all-oral, one pill/day regimen. The approved label for this combination indicates that treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with a baseline viral load of < 6 million IU/ml are eligible for as few as 8 weeks of therapy whereas all others should receive a full 12 weeks of therapy. As seen previously with the establishment of RGT rules, no attention was paid during the establishment of this treatment truncation rule to the different performance characteristics of commercially available viral load tests and how they compare to those of the single, manual method used in clinical trials but not widely used in clinical practice. Independent studies designed to evaluate the clinical impact of assay variability and the time of sampling as determinants of treatment truncation for this regimen found that a substantial proportion of patients had fluctuating viral loads above and below 6 million IU/ml at different screening time points that could potentially impact treatment decisions. Based on the known bias between quantitative values given by HPS and ART assays and preliminary data from this and other studies, a viral load of 2 million IU/ml with ART could be considered equivalent to 6 million IU/ml with HPS.

### New markers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^114EceVW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Virology tools developed over the past 20 years are routinely used to diagnose and monitor chronic HCV infection. Classical assays include molecular tools used to detect and quantify HCV RNA, and techniques that determine the HCV sequence in order to determine the genotype and the subtype and eventually identify clinically relevant amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to direct acting antivirals (DAA). New assays capable of detecting and quantifying HCV core antigen are now approved in Europe and are available for research use only in the United States. Moreover, recent advances include alternatives approaches that require whole blood or oral fluid samples and will be used to extend HCV screening and improve access to care in regions without molecular biology laboratories.

A variety of biological makers are useful for the virological diagnosis and monitoring of chronic HCV infection, as well as screening of hepatitis C infection. Virological markers [total anti-HCV antibodies (Ab), core antigen titer, HCV RNA level and viral genotype], biochemical markers (ALT activity) and histological markers (hepatic fibrosis stage and necroinflamatory activity grade) are currently used in clinical practice to diagnose and monitor chronic hepatitis C. Among them, HCV RNA quantification before treatment is important for decision making. All treatment-naïve patients with compensated liver disease and detectable HCV RNA are candidates for therapy. New molecular methods for quantifying HCV RNA in blood are based on real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or TMA (transcription-mediated amplification) assays. These assays are fully or partly automated. With a broader range of linear quantification, a lower limit of detection (LLOD) in the order of 10–15 IU/mL, and an identical LLOD and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the most recent assays, theses techniques are well suited to the clinical needs. They are recommended to quantify HCV RNA in international liver society guidelines. The HCV genotype should be determined before treatment is started. Indeed, the HCV genotype drives the treatment indication. Patients infected with HCV genotypes other than 1 should be treated with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) α-2a or-2b and ribavirin only. Patients infected with HCV genotype 1 should receive the triple combination of pegIFN, weight-based ribavirin and an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (either telaprevir or boceprevir). Direct sequence analysis (population sequencing) is the gold standard for HCV genotype determination. The viral region sequenced should be carefully chosen, because not all the regions provide accurate typing and subtyping. Alternative methods to sequencing techniques have been developed for routine clinical use. The most widely used assay is based on reverse hybridization (line probe assay). New technologies, so-called next generation sequencing (NGS), are now available for analyzing viral genome sequences, particularly amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to DAAs. NGS methods offer the capacity to generate a large amount of data, but the results are often difficult to interpret due to the lack of bioinformatic tools to analyze them. In addition, resistance testing based on HCV sequence analysis of the NS3/4A region has no utilities in clinical practice with the currently available drug regimens.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^117RXg9p]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

OPTIONS FOR ONE-STEP DIAGNOSIS OF HCV INFECTION

Diagnosis of an active HCV infection requires confirmation of viremia. Although HCV RNA testing is the most commonly used strategy to assess for viremia, any assay that detects a portion of the virus in the blood could also be used. Unlike many other viral infections, the HCV viral load is not an important determinant of disease progression or response to treatment. Accordingly, tests for viremia can be qualitative rather than quantitative, provided that they have adequate sensitivity to detect low levels of circulating virus.

HCV RNA

HCV RNA testing is available and could in theory already be used as a single-step tool for HCV diagnosis. The limitations of HCV RNA testing are cost and turnaround time. Except in populations with extremely high HCV prevalence (eg, people who inject drugs), the vast majority of HCV testing in any population screening effort will be negative. The rationale to start with HCV antibody is that it is an inexpensive test that can be done in large numbers of people to reduce the amount of HCV RNA testing that is required. It is unlikely that HCV RNA testing using current technologies could be made cheap enough to be a cost-effective strategy for population screening.

HCV RNA is most commonly done in a central laboratory using high-throughput real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). High-volume testing facilities will run tests frequently but in lower-volume settings, samples will be collected until adequate numbers for a batch have been received. This approach is cost-efficient for the laboratory, but can significantly delay result reporting, particularly when added to transport times if samples are traveling long distances to a central laboratory. These delays and the potential resultant loss to follow-up should be factored into the apparent economic benefits of batch testing.

### Low viraemia at enrollment in children with chronic hepatitis C favours spontaneous viral clearance [^112sec7K]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

The significance of hepatitis C viral (HCV)-RNA levels in long-term clinical outcomes of children with chronic HCV infection is not well understood. We conducted a long-term follow-up study of 42 children with chronic HCV infection that included clinical evaluation, biochemical tests, HCV genotyping and repeated quantitative HCV-RNA detection. Patients were divided into low and high viraemia groups according to RNA levels at enrollment (below/above 4.5 x 10⁴ IU/mL), and clinical, biochemical and virological factors were evaluated. Overall, 14.3% (6/42) of patients developed spontaneous viral clearance during a median 10.1 years of follow-up. HCV-RNA levels at enrollment and mean RNA levels during follow-up for each patient were significantly correlated (R = 0.9018, 95% CI: 0.6637–0.9038, P ≤ 0.001). HCV-RNA level fluctuation was within two log units in 76% of patients. Cumulative viraemia probability during follow-up could be predicted by viraemia levels at enrollment (P = 0.0092). Chronic HCV-infected children, with an RNA level below 4.5 x 10(4) IU/mL at enrollment, have a higher spontaneous viral clearance rate.

The sensitivity of the Roche COBAS Monitor v.2.0 test was slightly better than that of the Bayer bDNA 3.0 test, but the Monitor test underquantified specimens by 2.5- to 10.6-fold even at relatively low hepatitis C virus RNA concentrations. Dilution prior to assay minimally decreased the reproducibility of the Monitor assay, leading to the recommendation for all specimens to be diluted 1:100 prior to testing by this assay.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^114ujBKS]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Achieving global elimination of hepatitis C virus requires a substantial scale‐up of testing. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are available as an alternative to laboratory‐based assays to promote access in hard to reach or marginalized populations. The diagnostic performance and lower limit of detection are important attributes of these new assays for both diagnosis and test of cure. Therefore, our objective was to determine an acceptable LLoD for detectable HCV viraemia as a test for cure, 12 weeks post‐treatment (SVR12). We assembled a global data set of patients with detectable viraemia at SVR12 from observational databases from 9 countries (Egypt, the United States, United Kingdom, Georgia, Ukraine, Myanmar, Cambodia, Pakistan, Mozambique) and two pharmaceutical‐sponsored clinical trial registries. We examined the distribution of HCV viral load at SVR12 and presented the 90th, 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles. We used logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with low‐level virological treatment failure (defined as < 1000 IU/mL). There were 5973 cases of detectable viraemia at SVR12 from the combined data set. Median detectable HCV RNA at SVR12 was 287,986 IU/mL. The level of detection for the 95th percentile was 227 IU/mL (95% CI 170–276). Females and those with minimal fibrosis were more likely to experience low‐level viraemia at SVR12 compared to men (adjusted odds ratio AOR = 1.60 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.97 and those with cirrhosis (AOR = 1.49 95% CI 1.15–1.93). In conclusion, an assay with a level of detection of 1000 IU/mL or greater may miss a proportion of those with low‐level treatment failure.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112fLM8J]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^112nYpXo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The combination ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir received approval in Europe and in the United States, with trials describing SVR rates of > 95% in the majority of patient populations treated with this regimen for 12 weeks. However, while this regimen is not impacted by baseline viral load, treatment duration and the potential need to utilize ribavirin depend on the HCV genotype 1 subtype and the degree of cirrhosis. Noncirrhotic patients infected with HCV genotype 1b are eligible for 12 weeks of therapy without ribavirin, while HCV genotype 1a infection requires the use of ribavirin and up to 24 weeks of therapy for cirrhotic patients.

On the basis of the approved label for these new combination therapies, HCV geno(sub)type and baseline viral load assessments will continue to be important pretreatment markers that will guide treatment selection and duration. In addition, on-treatment changes in HCV RNA levels continue to be used as a marker of treatment adherence/response and are the measure of treatment success or failure. Recent data illustrated that very early viral kinetics, described as undetectable viral load at early on-treatment time points, was a positive predictor of treatment success and that the more sensitive the test used to measure viral load, the higher the positive predictive value of an undetectable viral load result. In contrast, the detection of residual viremia with a very sensitive method even as late as end of treatment (EOT) was not always associated with treatment failure. This would imply that measurement of very early viral kinetics with a very sensitive method may be useful to identify those patients who might benefit from very short treatment durations with highly potent antiviral therapies. In this situation, low levels of residual viremia should not be considered an indication of failure or an indication for treatment extension.

Results

In HCV RNA positive sera, viral load ranged between 3.06 and 6.9 log10 IU/mL (median 5.48). HCV Ag was undetectable in 2/89 samples (2.25%) with HCV RNA values of 1159 and 1947 IU/mL (3.06 and 3.29 log10 IU/mL). Four samples (4.49%) were found in the HCV Ag grey zone, with values between 7 and 10.6 fmol/L (median 8.72) or in logs0.84 log10 and 1.02 log10 fmol/L (median 0.94). Their respective HCV RNA levels were between 3.07 and 4.9 log10 IU/mL (median 3.39). HCV-Ag was clearly positive and quantifiable in 83 of the 89 HCV RNA positive sera (93.26%) with HCV RNA levels between 3.12 and 6.87 log10 IU/mL (median 5.55). In those samples, positive for both parameters, HCV Ag was found between 1.10 and 4.27 log10 fmol/L (median 3.15) (Table 1). The correlation coefficient (r) of the logarithmic values of HCV RNA and HCV-Ag, in these cases, was 0.89 (y = 0.8465x-1.5343) and it was statistically significant (P < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The HCV RNA/HCV Ag ratio ranged from 1.5 to 3.25 (median 1.72). The genotype of HCV did not affect HCV Ag detection and did not correlate with HCV RNA/HCV Ag ratios.

### Clinical screening and diagnosis for hepatitis C… [^114jXRQq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

One-time testing CDC recommends one-time hepatitis C testing for people with recognized risk factors or exposures, including: Recommended tests Clinicians should use an FDA-approved HCV antibody test followed by a NAT for HCV RNA test when antibody is positive/reactive. Tests include:

- HCV antibody test.
- Nucleic acid test to detect presence and levels of HCV RNA. Nonreactive/negative HCV antibody results If an HCV antibody test is not reactive, the patient has likely not been exposed and you can rule out infection. However, RNA testing is recommended for the diagnosis of current HCV infection among people who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months, regardless of HCV antibody result. Suspected exposure may be inferred from the patient's history or the context and setting of the patient encounter. Negative HCV RNA results A non-detectable HCV RNA test result indicates no current HCV infection and no further action required in most cases. Positive HCV RNA results It usually takes 1–2 weeks after exposure to the virus for detectable HCV RNA levels to appear. A detectable HCV RNA test result indicates current infection, and you should counsel the patient, evaluate for treatment, and initiate an appropriate direct-acting antiviral regimen. * If HCV RNA testing is not feasible and person tested is not immunocompromised, do follow-up testing for HCV antibody to demonstrate seroconversion. If the patient tested is immunocompromised, consider testing for HCV RNA. † It is recommended before initiating antiviral therapy to retest for HCV RNA in a subsequent blood sample to confirm HCV RNA positivity.

§ If the patient is suspected of having HCV exposure within the past 6 months, or has clinical evidence of HCV disease, or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen, the clinician should follow up with the patient. How to diagnose hepatitis C A repeatedly reactive HCV antibody result could be consistent with current HCV infection, but detected presence of HCV RNA is needed to diagnose a patient with a hepatitis C infection.

Shorter treatment for patients with a rapid virological response

The current 48-week treatment duration, recommended for HCV genotype 1-infected patients, may potentially result in the over-treatment of some genotype 1-infected patients who are more likely to achieve SVR, i.e. patients with low viral load before treatment and rapid virological response (RVR) at week 4. Clearly it is desirable to expose patients to the shortest possible treatment duration – without compromising efficacy – in order to minimize the likelihood of adverse events and reduce costs. Hadziyannis et al. found that more than one third of individuals with HCV genotype 1 who were randomized to 24 weeks of therapy with pegylated IFNα-2a plus RBV achieved SVR. Moreover, patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who became HCV RNA-negative by week 4, i.e. patients with RVR, were more likely to achieve SVR than those who did not become HCV RNA negative until week 12. A recent prospective trial demonstrated that patients with low baseline HCV RNA levels (≤ 600 000 IU/mL) and an RVR achieve an SVR rate of up to 90% (Fig. 2). Jensen et al. observed that almost a quarter (22.6%) of HCV genotype 1 patients treated with peginterferon plus RBV achieved RVR. Of these patients, 89% showed SVR after treatment duration of only 24 weeks. Both pegylated interferons have recently been approved in the EU for shortened treatment duration of 24 weeks for HCV genotype 1 patients with low-viral load (LVL) (defined as < 800 000 IU/mL for peginterferon alfa-2a and < 600 000 IU/mL for peginterferon alfa-2b) and RVR. To assure accurate determination of baseline viral load in cases with HCV RNA concentrations between 400 000 and 1 million IU/mL, physicians should consider performing two measurements using the same technique, from samples taken at least 4 weeks apart. Whether 10 or 50 IU is the most appropriate cut-off for determining RVR remains unclear, however, and is under investigation. Recently, Sarrazin et al. compared clinical outcomes for large cohorts of patients whose serum samples were analysed using both the COBAS TaqMan™ (detection limit approximately 10 IU/mL) and COBAS Amplicor™ (detection limit < 50 IU/mL) assays. In this study, RVR rates and subsequent SVR rates were similar when RVR was defined as undetectable of below 15 IU/mL by the COBAS TaqMan assay in comparison with undetectable (< 50 IU/mL) by the COBAS Amplicor assay, implying that HCV RNA levels rapidly decline not only to below 50 IU/mL but also below 15 IU/mL in patients achieving an RVR. Interestingly, relapse rates were consistently lower in patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 by COBAS TaqMan™ compared with COBAS Amplicor™, although the full significance of this remains to be established.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — definition, epidemiology, and interim management are outlined as follows: Acute HCV infection is arbitrarily defined as the first 6 months of infection, with jaundice in a minority of patients (< 25%). In the United States, the CDC estimates that 44,300 acute HCV infections occurred in 2017 with the upper limit of the confidence interval being 151,000 cases, and an estimated 75% of persons acutely infected with HCV progress to chronic infection. Treatment as prevention has been observed in cohorts of HIV-positive men who have sex with men when unrestricted access to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in acute HCV infections. In the interim, current guidance is to treat with regimens and durations as recommended for chronic HCV infection until additional data on abbreviated treatment regimens become available.

The clinical significance of antiviral resistant variants that emerge during PI therapy is uncertain. In longitudinal follow-up of patients enrolled in phase 2 trials, BOC-resistant variants were detected in 43% of subjects after 2 years of follow-up. Similarly, among patients with documented TVR-resistant variants who were enrolled in the TVR phase 3 trials, 40% still had detectable resistant variants after a median follow-up period of 45 weeks. In general, the decline or loss of variants appears to be related to their level of fitness.

Further data are needed to determine whether selection of these variants during and after PI therapy affects subsequent treatment choices. In phase 3 studies, the emergence of resistant variants and virological breakthrough was more common in patients infected with HCV subtype 1a than 1b, a result of a higher genetic barrier required for selection of resistant variants in HCV subtype 1b compared to 1a. Thus, HCV subtyping may play a role in helping to select future treatment regimens and predict the development of resistance. Finally, minimizing development of compensatory mutations would involve early discontinuation of PI therapy when antiviral therapy is unlikely to succeed. Although viral stop rules varied widely in the phase 2 and 3 trials, week 4 and 12 time points on triple therapy are still key decision points for stopping therapy based on HCV RNA levels. Current data suggest that for patients receiving BOC, therapy should be stopped at week 12 if the viral level is > 100 IU/mL or > 10–15 IU/mL at treatment week 24 and, for TVR, therapy should be stopped at either week 4 or 12 if the viral level is > 1,000 IU/mL or if week 24 HCV RNA is detectable.

Recommendations:
Patients who develop anemia on protease inhibitor-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C should be managed by reducing the ribavirin dose (Class 2a, Level A).
Patients on protease inhibitor-based therapy should undergo close monitoring of HCV RNA levels and the protease inhibitors should be discontinued if virological breakthrough (> 1 log increase in serum HCV RNA above nadir) is observed (Class 1, Level A).
Patients who fail to have a virological response, who experience virological breakthrough, or who relapse on one protease inhibitor should not be re-treated with the other protease inhibitor (Class 2a, Level C).

Extending Treatment Duration for Slow Virological Responders

Evidence from three randomized clinical trials support the case for extending treatment duration beyond 48 weeks in HCV genotype 1 patients with a slow virological response, i.e. HCV RNA > 50 IU/mL at week 12 but undetectable (< 50 IU/mL) at week 24. Berg et al. randomized patients to 48 or 72 weeks of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (180 μg, qw) plus RBV (800 mg, qd) and analysed the resulting SVR and relapse rates. Extended treatment of 72 weeks did not increase the SVR rate in the intent-to-treat population; which suggests that it is inappropriate to extend treatment for all genotype 1-infected patients. However, the study demonstrated that identifying patients with and without virological response at week 12 using a sensitive molecular test (50 IU/mL) could facilitate the decision on therapy duration for each patient on an individual basis. Patients who remained HCV RNA positive at week 12 had significantly higher SVR rates when treated for 72 rather than 48 weeks (29% vs 17%; P = 0.04). The greatest benefit from extended treatment duration (72 weeks) was observed in patients with detectable HCV RNA, but with levels below 6000 IU/mL, at week 12. The frequency and intensity of adverse events was similar in the 48- and 72-week treatment groups, suggesting that extended treatment can be manageable in terms of tolerability. Sanchez-Tapias et al. randomized patients without RVR (i.e. HCV RNA > 50 IU/mL at week 4) to treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 μg, qw) and RBV (800 mg, qd) for 48 or 72 weeks. Extending treatment to 72 weeks significantly increased the SVR rate compared with the standard 48 weeks of therapy (45% vs 32%, respectively; P = 0.01). In genotype 1-infected patients, this effect was particularly evident, with 44% of patients who received 72 weeks of treatment achieving SVR compared with 28% of patients who were treated for 48 weeks (P = 0.003). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the two groups, although treatment discontinuation was significantly more frequent in the 72-week group (36% vs 18%; P = 0.0004). A retrospective analysis of patients from the European-based trials, including that of Berg et al. demonstrated that patients without RVR but achieving subsequent early viral response (EVR) (> 2 log 10 HCV RNA decrease), benefited from extending treatment duration and achieved a higher SVR rate (77% after 72 weeks vs 31% after 48 weeks.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^117BfuDX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the European Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases, IDSA‐AASLD HCV guidance panel, all recommend a minimum LLoD of 1000 IU/mL for HCV diagnosis, but none yet specify minimal test characteristics for test of cure. While some small studies have examined the distribution of viral load at end of treatment — including a cohort of eight patients from the United States, a cohort of 14 patients in Germanyand 330 treatment failures in an analysis of 34 phase 2/3 clinical trials. The latter study in clinical trials identify that 97% had a viral load > 10,000 IU/mL 12 weeks post‐treatment, and just 0.9% of patients had a viral load less than 1000 IU/mL (77, 405 and 680 IU/mL). To date, there have been no real world, global analyses of distribution of viral load in those with detectable viraemia at SVR12.

Our primary objective was to determine the LLoD for an HCV RNA assay to detect 90%, 95%, 97% and 99% of treatment failures at 12 weeks post‐treatment in a large multi‐cohort data set, and to assess the characteristics associated with low‐level viraemia (< 1000 IU/mL) at SVR12. These findings will help inform global policy as well as guide manufacturers as to whether existing platforms and assays meet requirements for their use both in diagnosis and as a test of cure, and for future development of testing technologies.

### Interpretation of real-time PCR results for hepatitis C virus RNA when viral load is below quantification limits [^116gkJEW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus RNA quantification results obtained in 18 laboratories using real-time PCR methods with 10 negative samples and 22 sample dilutions (viral loads of 0.5 to 500 IU/ml) showed a score of correct results of up to 93.5%. However, 55.6% of the laboratories did not follow the recommendations for the interpretation of their results, leading to ambiguous conclusions.
