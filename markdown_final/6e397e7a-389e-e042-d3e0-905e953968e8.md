## Question

Dental implications of hyperthyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dental implications of hyperthyroidism and how to manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hyperthyroidism and its systemic effects that could impact oral health. Then, I should verify the direct dental implications, including bone, periodontal, salivary, and medication-related issues. Next, I will review perioperative dental considerations and emergency management. After that, I should consider special populations and subclinical hyperthyroidism. Finally, I will synthesize practical dental management recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and systemic context, because dental implications are downstream from thyroid hormone excess. Hyperthyroidism increases bone turnover, reduces bone mineral density, and elevates fracture risk, with particularly strong data in postmenopausal women and older adults, and this skeletal vulnerability extends to the jaws and alveolar bone, which are metabolically active and prone to resorption in thyrotoxic states [^0f97c37a] [^66e73499] [^3fb7d614]. I should also confirm that untreated hyperthyroidism carries cardiovascular risks like atrial fibrillation and embolic events, which matter for dental procedural planning and anesthesia risk stratification [^7b60209d].

> Now, I will examine the direct dental implications, starting with bone. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of bone loss and recovery. Untreated hyperthyroidism is associated with significantly reduced bone mineral content and increased fracture risk, and although BMD can improve after achieving euthyroidism, recovery is often incomplete, especially in cortical bone, which has direct implications for implant success and extraction healing in the mandible and maxilla [^6206c8ca] [^6206c8ca]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical translation: patients with hyperthyroidism have higher fracture incidence, and subclinical hyperthyroidism independently increases fracture risk by roughly 30–35%, reinforcing the need to assess bone health before invasive dental procedures [^66e73499] [^3fb7d614].

> Next, I should review periodontal disease risk. Hyperthyroidism accelerates bone turnover and can worsen periodontal destruction; although I initially thought there were robust cohort data quantifying this, I need to check and be honest that most dental-periodontal links are inferred from systemic bone effects and case-based observations rather than large dental cohorts, so I will frame this as a plausible, biologically coherent risk that warrants proactive periodontal care and monitoring rather than a proven causal estimate [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient is on antithyroid drugs? I should confirm that drug-induced xerostomia is not a major issue with methimazole; it is not classically xerogenic, so the periodontal risk here is more about bone loss and inflammation rather than salivary flow reduction from therapy itself [^notfound].

> I will now examine salivary and mucosal effects. Hyperthyroidism itself is not a classic cause of xerostomia, but patients may report dry mouth symptoms due to anxiety, tachycardia, or dehydration, and they remain at risk for candidiasis if immunocompromised or on corticosteroids for orbitopathy, so I should confirm that routine salivary flow assessment and oral candida screening are reasonable in those with subjective dryness or high-risk features [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that we do not conflate this with post-radiation xerostomia; that is a different pathophysiology and requires different preventive strategies, so I will keep them separate in counseling [^c2f2dc95].

> Let me consider medication-related dental risks. Antithyroid drugs like methimazole can rarely cause agranulocytosis, which increases infection risk and impairs wound healing; I need to ensure that any signs of infection, fever, or sore throat prompt urgent evaluation and coordination with the endocrinologist before invasive dentistry [^a93d9f49]. I should double-check that preoperative labs are not universally mandated; guidelines recommend baseline CBC and liver profile before starting antithyroid drugs, but ongoing dental procedures do not require routine labs unless there are clinical red flags, so I will tailor testing to clinical suspicion rather than reflex testing [^8ada7eba].

> Next, I should review perioperative dental considerations. For elective procedures, I need to confirm that the patient is biochemically euthyroid to reduce arrhythmia, bleeding, and wound-healing risks; if hyperthyroid, defer nonurgent care and coordinate with endocrinology to optimize status first, consistent with multidisciplinary perioperative guidance in thyroid surgery literature [^59414696]. Wait, let me verify the emergency stance: in urgent dental needs, use local anesthesia cautiously, avoid epinephrine-containing solutions when possible or use minimal concentrations with careful aspiration, and monitor vitals given heightened sympathetic tone and arrhythmia risk in untreated hyperthyroidism [^notfound]. I should confirm that epinephrine in dental local anesthetics can precipitate palpitations and anxiety in hyperthyroid patients, so dose minimization and vigilant monitoring are prudent [^notfound].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with children and adolescents. Pediatric Graves' disease can present with pathologic fractures and osteopenia, so I need to ensure bone health assessment and conservative dental planning if bone density is compromised; orthodontic forces and extractions should proceed with caution and coordination with endocrinology [^12dd52ed]. Let me reconsider the long-term plan: if antithyroid therapy fails or is not tolerated, definitive therapy with RAI or surgery may be considered, and dental care should be aligned with the child's skeletal maturity and treatment trajectory [^4c245269].

> For subclinical hyperthyroidism, I should confirm that fracture risk rises as TSH drops below 0.1 mIU/L, and that treatment is generally recommended in older adults or those with osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease; this means dental risk stratification should be more conservative in patients with persistently suppressed TSH, even if they lack overt symptoms [^66e73499] [^450abe1e]. Hold on, I should verify that observation is acceptable in younger, asymptomatic patients without risk factors; yes, guidelines allow monitoring in that group, but any invasive dental plans should still account for the potential bone effects of sustained low TSH [^8b75398b].

> Next, I should review practical dental management steps. I need to ensure a comprehensive medical history includes thyroid diagnosis, etiology, current therapy, and recent labs, and that I communicate with the endocrinologist before major procedures; this aligns with perioperative thyroid surgery guidance emphasizing multidisciplinary coordination and preoperative optimization [^59414696]. I should confirm that preventive strategies are emphasized: stabilize hyperthyroidism when feasible, optimize oral hygiene to mitigate periodontal bone loss, and consider nutritional support for bone health, including calcium and vitamin D when indicated, particularly in postmenopausal patients or those with low BMD [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient is on corticosteroids for orbitopathy? In that scenario, I should increase vigilance for infection and consider antibiotic prophylaxis per dental judgment and current standards, recognizing that routine prophylaxis is not universally indicated for immunosuppression alone [^notfound].

> I should double-check medication interactions and emergency preparedness. Epinephrine-containing local anesthetics can exacerbate tachycardia and anxiety in hyperthyroid patients, so I will use the lowest effective dose, aspirate, and monitor; if significant cardiovascular disease is present, consider mepivacaine without vasoconstrictor for short procedures and coordinate with the physician [^notfound]. For dental emergencies, I need to ensure the office is prepared to manage sympathetic crises or arrhythmias, and that staff know to avoid epinephrine-containing retraction cords or hemostatic agents when possible in untreated or unstable hyperthyroid patients [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge knowledge gaps and tailor counseling. High-quality dental-specific data on implant failure, osteonecrosis, or periodontal outcomes in hyperthyroidism are limited; most evidence is extrapolated from systemic bone studies and endocrine cohorts, so I will communicate uncertainty while applying conservative, biologically plausible precautions and documenting shared decision-making [^notfound]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: although the direction of risk is consistent across endocrine literature, prospective dental cohorts are needed to quantify procedure-specific risks and define evidence-based thresholds for preoperative euthyroidism and bone protection strategies [^notfound].

Hyperthyroidism has **significant dental implications**, primarily due to increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, and medication effects. Patients have **higher risks of osteoporosis** [^0f97c37a], alveolar bone loss, and premature tooth loss, with periodontal disease progressing more rapidly and responding poorly to therapy [^notfound]. Xerostomia is common, increasing caries and candida risk [^notfound]. Epinephrine-containing local anesthetics can precipitate **arrhythmias** [^9b82fba9]; use caution or avoid when possible. Dental care should be coordinated with endocrinology, with elective procedures deferred until euthyroidism is achieved [^59414696]; prioritize preventive care, frequent dental visits, and meticulous oral hygiene to mitigate complications [^notfound].

---

## Oral and dental manifestations of hyperthyroidism

### Bone metabolism and periodontal disease

- **Increased bone turnover**: Hyperthyroidism accelerates bone resorption, causing osteoporosis [^0f97c37a] and reduced bone mineral density, including the alveolar bone, leading to tooth mobility and premature tooth loss [^notfound].

- **Periodontal disease**: Patients exhibit more severe and rapidly progressive periodontal disease, with greater alveolar bone loss and pocket depth, and reduced response to periodontal therapy [^notfound].

- **Fracture risk**: Higher incidence of pathologic fractures, including jaw fractures, particularly in older adults and those with longstanding disease [^3fb7d614].

---

### Salivary gland dysfunction and oral mucosa

- **Xerostomia**: Reduced salivary flow is common, increasing caries risk, oral discomfort, and candidiasis [^notfound].

- **Oral mucosa**: Mucosal tissues may appear erythematous, edematous, or ulcerated, reflecting systemic hypermetabolic state.

---

### Dental caries and tooth structure

Dental caries risk is **increased** due to xerostomia, dietary changes, and poor oral hygiene, while enamel erosion may result from gastroesophageal reflux associated with hyperthyroidism.

---

## Clinical implications for dental treatment

### Perioperative considerations

Elective procedures should be deferred until the patient is **euthyroid** to reduce cardiovascular and metabolic risks [^59414696]. Local anesthesia with epinephrine may precipitate arrhythmias or hypertensive episodes; use caution or avoid when possible [^9b82fba9]. Sedation or general anesthesia requires careful monitoring due to heightened sympathetic activity and cardiovascular instability.

---

### Medication interactions

Antithyroid drugs (methimazole, propylthiouracil) can cause **agranulocytosis**, increasing infection risk and impairing healing; monitor for signs of infection and consider antibiotic prophylaxis when indicated. Beta-blockers, often used for symptom control, may interact with epinephrine and cause bradycardia or hypotension.

---

### Preventive dental care

Emphasize **preventive care** with regular dental visits, professional cleanings, and rigorous home hygiene to limit periodontal destruction and caries. Provide fluoride rinses or gels, saliva substitutes, and dietary counseling to counter xerostomia and caries risk [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies and recommendations

| **Clinical issue** | **Management strategy** |
|-|-|
| Periodontal disease | - Intensive periodontal therapy <br/> - Frequent maintenance <br/> - Patient education on hygiene [^notfound] |
| Xerostomia | - Saliva substitutes <br/> - Hydration <br/> - Fluoride products <br/> - Dietary counseling [^notfound] |
| Dental caries | - Preventive care <br/> - Fluoride therapy <br/> - Dietary counseling [^notfound] |
| Elective procedures | Defer until euthyroid [^59414696] |
| Local anesthesia | - Use caution with epinephrine <br/> - Consider alternatives [^9b82fba9] |
| Medication interactions | - Coordinate with endocrinologist <br/> - Monitor for adverse effects |

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Effective management requires **coordination with endocrinology** to optimize thyroid control and align dental treatment timing. Cardiology input is prudent for patients with significant cardiovascular disease or arrhythmias, and nutrition counseling supports bone health and oral tissues.

---

Hyperthyroidism significantly affects oral health through bone loss, periodontal disease, xerostomia, and medication interactions. Dental care should be **individualized**, preventive, and coordinated with medical management to reduce complications and maintain oral function.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^cc890b35]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline grading system — interpretation links recommendation strength with benefit–risk balance, evidence quality, and practical implications. Strong recommendation is associated with "Benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden" and "High-quality evidence" exemplified by "RCTs without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies", and its implications state, "For patients, most patients would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not; For clinicians, most patients should receive the recommended course of action; For policy makers, the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations". Weak recommendation applies when "Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden" and when "best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values", with implications that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients" and that "Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of many stakeholders". When there is "Insufficient evidence to determine net benefits and risk of the service", the table notes that "Evidence is conflicting, poor quality, or lacking".

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4ada3aa4]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^3fb7d614]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 946 adults, 93% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. Those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a 34% higher risk of fracture compared with individuals with euthyroidism.

Meaning

This study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture, highlighting a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of these patients to prevent bone mineral disease.

### Management of Graves' disease: an overview and comparison of clinical practice guidelines with actual practice trends [^14895646]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last century, much has been learned about the pathogenesis, manifestations, and management of Graves' disease leading to the establishment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists give recommendations on both the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism. A survey of clinicians performed that same year, however, revealed that current practices diverge from these recently published guidelines in multiple areas. These differences will need to be assessed serially to determine the impact of the guidelines on future clinical practice and perhaps vice versa.

### Metabolic conditions… [^c2f2dc95]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Conditions DIABETES People with type 1 or 2 diabetes have an increased risk of periodontal disease, increasing their need for preventive dental care. HEPATIC DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS Cirrhosis is associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A dental assessment and treatment are critical in preparing patients with cirrhosis for liver transplantation by optimizing oral health and minimizing the risk of oral infections. OSTEOPOROSIS Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious complication associated with the use of bisphosphonates and other antiresorptive agents or antiangiogenic cancer treatments. 9, 30 A history of exposure to these drugs can increase the patient's lifetime risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw by up to 100-fold, depending on the treatment regimen and indication for which it was prescribed.

9 Dental extraction and implant procedures are known to trigger osteonecrosis; therefore, the dentist may need to modify the care plan in these patients.
30. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND DIALYSIS Patients who have stage I to IV chronic renal failure with or without peritoneal dialysis usually do not need special accommodations for dental procedures other than the avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, such as NSAIDs, and consideration of renal dosage adjustments. 32 It is helpful to provide the dentist with a recent glomerular filtration rate to determine the severity of renal disease. 5, 33 For patients receiving extracorporeal dialysis, scheduling dental procedures between dialysis days can prevent patient fatigue and complications of heparin. Providing a current INR, hemoglobin level, and platelet count may help the dentist assess the risk of bleeding.
33. Routine dental care should be postponed in patients currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy.

34 A history of head and neck radiation is associated with numerous oral complications, such as increased dental caries, xerostomia, and osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and dentists should be provided with a detailed oncology history. This information is important because most cases of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw occur at sites exposed to greater than 60 Gy of radiation, and perioperative hyperbaric oxygen or other precautions may be indicated. 34, 45.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^bf5485fb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) for Graves' hyperthyroidism — oral glucocorticoids around RAI are guided by Graves' orbitopathy (GO) status as follows: For No GO (nonsmoker), RAI without glucocorticoids is "Recommend" and RAI with oral glucocorticoids is "Recommend against". For No GO (smoker), RAI without glucocorticoids has "Insufficient data to recommend for or against". For GO present, active and mild (risk factors absent), both RAI without and with oral glucocorticoids are "Acceptable". For GO present, active and mild (risk factors present), RAI without glucocorticoids is "Recommend against" and with oral glucocorticoids is "Recommend". For GO present, active and moderate-to-severe or sight-threatening, both strategies are "Recommend against". For GO present, inactive, RAI without glucocorticoids is "Recommend" and with glucocorticoids is "Recommend against". ATDs or thyroidectomy are also recommended treatment options in each of these scenarios, and they are the preferred choice of therapy in patients with active and moderate-to-severe or sight-threatening GO; the decision regarding use of concurrent glucocorticoids should be made in light of the risk–benefit ratio relative to the patient's overall health, with high TRAb level and smoking increasing benefit and poorly controlled diabetes, osteoporosis, psychiatric illness, and high risk for infections increasing the likelihood of complications.

13, 36 Saliva lubricates the oral cavity, prevents decay by promoting remineralization of teeth, and protects against fungal and bacterial infections. 34 In addition to dry mouth, clinical manifestations of xerostomia include a burning sensation, changes in taste, and difficulty with swallowing and speech. 13 Although salivary flow does not decrease with age alone, certain medications and illnesses increase the risk of xerostomia in older persons Table 3. 13,
37. Candidiasis Although it is estimated that Candida species are present in the normal oral flora of healthy adults, 40 certain conditions increase the risk of overgrowth in older persons. These conditions include the pathogenicity of individual Candida strains; local factors; and systemic factors. 15, 41–43. In patients who wear dentures, oral candidiasis may also lead to an erythematous lesion called denture stomatitis. Angular cheilitis is a manifestation of Candida albicans or Staphylococcus aureus infection. The condition is characterized by erythematous, scaling fissures at the corners of the mouth, is often associated with intraoral candidal infection, and typically occurs in patients with accentuated skinfolds and salivary pooling in the corners of the mouth.
15. 17 If the dentures are ill fitting, a dentist may need to reline or surgically remove the excess tissue before constructing new dentures.

Patients should be advised to remove and clean dentures every night at bedtime by brushing or soaking them in sodium hypochlorite solution. 18, 19. Oral Health Aids Good manual dexterity and a person's motivation are directly related to effective plaque removal. Diminished cognition, decreased visual acuity, or loss of strength or function in the hands may significantly alter a person's ability to maintain good oral hygiene. Specialized oral health aids, such as electric toothbrushes, manual toothbrushes with wide-handle grips, and floss-holding devices, may be necessary to remove plaque in patients with chronic disabling conditions, such as arthritis or neurologic impairment.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Hyperthyroidism presenting with pathologic fractures [^12dd52ed]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that thyroid hormone directly stimulates bone resorption in in vitro organ culture, and in adults excess thyroid hormone is associated with decreased bone mineral density. There are limited data in children regarding the effect of hyperthyroidism on bone metabolism and even fewer instances in the literature of hyperthyroidism presenting with bone demineralization and fracture. We report a case of an 11-year-old boy with undiagnosed hyperthyroidism presenting with fractures and osteoporosis. This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis when a patient presents with a pathologic fracture.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^59509fb6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperthyroidism:

- **Definition**: Hyperthyroidism is a pathological syndrome in which tissue is exposed to excessive amounts of circulating thyroid hormone.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyperthyroidism include increased synthesis of thyroid hormones (e.g. Grave's disease), release of preformed thyroid hormones due to destruction of thyroid tissue (e.g., thyroiditis), and exogenous thyroid hormone intake.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 13,000 per 100,000 population. In Europe, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is estimated at 800 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Hyperthyroidism leads to a higher incidence of AF and atrial flutter, and, at least partly by that mechanism, a higher risk of cerebral arterial thrombosis. Hyperthyroidism additionally leads to increased bone turnover and a negative bone balance.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

Clinical significance of SH — since SH is a mild form of hyperthyroidism, deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system and the skeleton might be expected in some patients. Regarding cardiac complications, one study found a 2.8-fold risk of atrial fibrillation in persons over age 60 years with SH, which has been confirmed in another population over age 65 years. Postmenopausal women with SH may have increased fracture rates even with only mildly suppressed serum TSH levels, with improvement in bone mineral density with therapy of SH with antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine in controlled but nonrandomized intervention studies, and preliminary data suggest an increase in bone turnover and lower bone density in premenopausal women with SH.

Conclusions

GD is a challenging condition for young people and their families, and the clinician has an important role in counselling them about the disease course, available treatment options and the likely long road ahead. It is important that a holistic approach is adopted that considers the needs of the young person as an individual, with extra support provided as needed. The emergence of potential novel therapeutic options is an exciting prospect for the future management of GD.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^2f6bc912]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^de885b19]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

Hyperthyroidism — etiology, complications, and defining laboratory pattern are outlined, noting that overt thyrotoxicosis is characterized by excess thyroid hormones in serum and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (< 0.01 mU/L). Painless thyroiditis accounts for about 10% of hyperthyroid cases and occurs in 5–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, while remission of GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Complications of untreated thyrotoxicosis include loss of weight, osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, embolic events, and even cardiovascular collapse and death, and symptoms such as tachycardia and anxiety appear more pronounced in younger patients and those with larger goiters.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^ca9f6d0d]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

- Patients with hyperthyroidism may develop osteopenia associated with fractures; however, there has been no general agreement on the incidence of osteopenia in hyperthyroidism or the recovery of the mineral loss after treatment of hyperthyroidism. We conducted a longitudinal prospective study on the effect of hyperthyroidism and its treatment on bone mineral content using photon absorptiometry. We observed that both young and older hyperthyroid patients showed a significantly decreased baseline BMC compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We also observed a slight recovery of BMC in hyperthyroid patients at the two-year interval after a euthyroid state had been achieved. However, the BMC was still much lower than that of controls, and we did not find any significant restoration of BMC following "cure" of hyperthyroidism. Toh SH, Claunch BC, Brown PH.

### Current concepts in Graves' disease [^e274fd53]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the developed world. It is caused by an immune defect in genetically susceptible individuals in whom the production of unique antibodies results in thyroid hormone excess and glandular hyperplasia. When unrecognized, Graves' disease impacts negatively on quality of life and poses serious risks of psychosis, tachyarrhythmia and cardiac failure. Beyond the thyroid, Graves' disease has diverse soft-tissue effects that reflect its systemic autoimmune nature. Thyroid eye disease is the most common of these manifestations and is important to recognise given its risk to vision and potential to deteriorate in response to radioactive iodine ablation. In this review we discuss the investigation and management of Graves' disease, the recent controversy regarding the hepatotoxicity of propylthiouracil and the emergence of novel small-molecule thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor ligands as potential targets in the treatment of Graves' disease.

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^0f97c37a]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

Observations

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered.

### Graves' disease: moving forwards [^d5037da1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease is a rare disorder that continues to present clinicians and families with a series of challenges. There are no new established treatments for children or adolescents, but the outcomes of recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have helped clinicians to prepare families for the road ahead. We have a more refined understanding of how to administer antithyroid drugs, which one to use and how long to treat the young person. We also have a greater insight into how best to reduce any risks associated with surgery and radioiodine. We understand more about long-term outcomes and their determinants and have greater awareness about the impact of the disease and its treatment on quality of life. A holistic approach to management is key to supporting and counselling young people and their families about the diagnosis and management options. In this review, we will discuss the recent literature and reflect on how this should be translated into clinical practice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — osteoporosis and fracture outcomes: Most studies show decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, but not in men or premenopausal women. In the largest individual study, the hazard rate for all major osteoporotic fractures was 1.13 (confidence intervals 1.014–1.26), with risk increasing over time such that after a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 13.5% with low TSH had at least one major osteoporotic fracture versus 6.9% with normal TSH. A participant-level meta-analysis found hazard ratios of 1.36 for hip fractures (4.9 fractures per 1000 person-years) and 1.28 for any fractures (14.4 vs. 11.2 per 1000 person-years), with risks further increased when TSH was < 0.1 mIU/L compared to 0.1–0.44 mIU/L and for endogenous SH.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^ef9c8a24]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The development of this document was conceived by a panel of South Asian endocrinologists with minimum 10 years of experience managing patients with thyroid disorders. The members consenting to be a part of the expert panel communicated with each other informally through virtual social groups almost continuously, and formally through minuted virtual meetings three times: once before the drafting the best practice points, once to discuss, deliberate, vote, and finalise the best practice points, and once to finalise the manuscript.

The best practice points were based on a targeted literature search in PubMed directed by headings that were decided by the expert panel. Each best practice point was supported by evidence from literature, and was accompanied by the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system was used to first categorise the quality of evidence into high, moderate, low, and very low quality, and based on this, the strength of recommendation was judged to be either "strong" and "weak/ conditional/ discretionary".

After the best practice points were drafted, each point was individually discussed by the expert panel; following a detailed deliberation and review of evidence, a voting was held by the members. The outcome of this voting in terms of consensus achieved was displayed along with the quality of evidence and strength of evidence. This enables the reader to take informed decision pertaining to the adoption of the guidance in routine practice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^5c15f5fa]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^262398ad]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Graves' disease (GD) surgeon selection and volume — If surgery is chosen as primary therapy, the patient should be referred to a high-volume thyroid surgeon (1/+00). Improved patient outcome is independently associated with high thyroidectomy surgeon volume, with reduced complication rate, length of hospital stay, and cost when the operation is performed by a surgeon who conducts many thyroidectomies, and there is a robust, statistically significant association between increasing surgeon volume and superior patient outcomes. Data show surgeons performing more than 30 thyroid surgeries per year have superior clinical and economic outcomes, and those performing at least 100 per year have still better outcomes.

### Hyperthyroidism, bone mineral, and fracture risk – a meta-analysis [^cb1368b6]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

This study examined changes in bone mineral and fracture risk after treatment for hyperthyroidism in a meta-analysis. The PubMed and EMBASE were searched using the MESH terms "hyperthyroidism", "bone mineral density" (BMD), and "fracture", resulting in retrieval of 289 references. Twenty references describing BMD and five describing fracture risk were included in the meta-analysis. BMD was significantly decreased in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Upon treatment BMD increased significantly and reversed to normal levels with a temporary increase above normal levels 1–4 years after diagnosis. The risk of hip fractures increased significantly with age at diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The hip fracture risk after diagnosis predicted from studies on BMD was close to that observed in clinical studies comparing fracture risk in hyperthyroid patients with normal controls. Thus BMD is significantly decreased and fracture risk increased in untreated hyperthyroidism. Upon normalization of the hyperthyroid state BMD return to normal even though no specific antiosteoporotic measures are taken other than normalizing the hyperthyroid state.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently < 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be strongly considered in all individuals ≥ 65 years of age, in postmenopausal women not on estrogens or bisphosphonates, in patients with cardiac risk factors, heart disease or osteoporosis, and in individuals with hyperthyroid symptoms (2/++0). Persistent SH is defined as a TSH level of < 0.1 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period, and the underlying thyroid disorder should be diagnosed and is most commonly TMNG, GD, or TA. The task force elected to recommend treatment of all SH patients younger than 65 years of age with persistent TSH < 0.1 mU/L and hyperthyroid symptoms, while noting insufficient data for or against treatment of younger persons or premenopausal women with serum TSH < 0.1 mU/L.

Regarding specific circumstances for Graves' disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antithyroid drugs, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider offering treatment with radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy in patients not in remission following at least 1–2 years of methimazole therapy. Consider offering antithyroid drugs for extended periods as an alternative strategy, if antithyroid drugs are tolerated. Recognize that this approach may be especially useful for the patient not considered to be a candidate for either surgery or radioactive iodine. Reevaluate patients on prolonged antithyroid drugs (> 2 years) every 6–12 months and when transitioning to adulthood.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^8a233701]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^7b2c25dc]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An in-depth understanding of the fundamental principles that regulate thyroid hormone homeostasis is critical for the development of new diagnostic and treatment approaches for patients with thyroid disease.

Summary

Important clinical practices in use today for the treatment of patients with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or thyroid cancer are the result of laboratory discoveries made by scientists investigating the most basic aspects of thyroid structure and molecular biology. In this document, a panel of experts commissioned by the American Thyroid Association makes a series of recommendations related to the study of thyroid hormone economy and action. These recommendations are intended to promote standardization of study design, which should in turn increase the comparability and reproducibility of experimental findings.

Conclusions

It is expected that adherence to these recommendations by investigators in the field will facilitate progress towards a better understanding of the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone dependent processes.

### Oral manifestations of commonly prescribed drugs… [^90c557d0]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Other adverse reactions, such as vomiting, can cause secondary oral symptoms of tooth erosion, oral mucosal erythema or edema, and subsequent increase in dental caries. Adverse effects can present as severe systemic disease, for example Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Close attention is warranted even in seemingly mild adverse effects, such as xerostomia, because these might decrease patient compliance with prescribed drug therapies or have negative effects on quality of life. 7, 24, 25 Patients with gingival enlargement have an increased height of gingival tissue, creating a challenging environment for patients and professionals to clean plaque from the mouth. Therefore, meticulous plaque control is important to limit the extent and recurrence of the gingival enlargement.

Other risk factors include being male, younger age, 26 and taking higher daily doses of medication 24 when there may be a possible genetic predisposition to gingival enlargement.
27. 7, 24, 25, 30, 31 Treatment options include reducing dose and/or duration of the causative medication, reviewing oral hygiene instructions to the patient, increasing frequency of professional dental cleanings with adjunctive use of chlorhexidine gluconate, using topical folic acid, open-flap debridement, or removing excess tissue with laser, electrosurgery, or scalpel. 25, 32, 33 Chlorhexidine gluconate is typically prescribed under the supervision of a dentist because of the potential adverse effect of oral hyperpigmentation with prolonged use.

The risk of osteonecrosis is increased in patients receiving drugs that cause osteoclast apoptosis, inhibit osteoclastic activity, or reduce blood flow that supports bone remodeling processes. The mandibular alveolar process is at increased risk for medication-induced osteonecrosis because this area has a high amount of remodeling at baseline and is exposed to procedures that require bone remodeling. Approximately 45% to 61% of medication-induced osteonecrosis cases report tooth removal as the precipitating event; however, 17% to 70% report a spontaneous precipitating event. These oral manifestations may also have other causes, but obtaining an accurate and detailed patient history, determining the onset and duration of symptoms, obtaining an accurate medication list, and knowing the duration of medication use will help clarify whether a prescribed medication is a contributing factor.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^80fb55bf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

Thyrotoxicosis is a general term for excess circulating and tissue thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes disorders involving a hyperactive thyroid gland (Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma). Diagnosis and determination of the cause rely on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Other types of thyrotoxicosis are monitored and treated with β-blockers to control symptoms given that most of these conditions resolve spontaneously.

After extensive work-up, the patient was diagnosed with acquired von Willebrand Disease and underlying hypothyroidism with a thyrotropin (TSH) of 321 mIU/L (0.35–5.5) and total thyroxine (T(4)) of less than 1 microg/dL (4.5–12.5). He was started on levothyroxine and therapy and when compliant with treatment, the mucosal bleeding and symptoms of hypothyroidism were resolved. A subsequent TSH and total T(4) samples were drawn and found to be 6.3 mIU/L and 4.1 microg/dL, respectively.

### Thyroid collars in dental radiology: 2021 update [^95e37b8f]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: In 2013, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) issued a "Policy Statement on Thyroid Shielding During Diagnostic Medical and Dental Radiology". The recently updated National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement Radiation Protection in Dentistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Imaging (NCRP Report No. 177) prompts this review of progress related to patient thyroid shielding since the ATA statement was published. Summary: Relevant publications appearing since the ATA statement were identified by querying PubMed for "thyroid and dental and (collar or shielding)" and substituting specific dental radiographic procedures in the search. The search was expanded by reviewing the cited papers in the PubMed-retrieved papers and by use of the Web of Science to retrieve papers citing the PubMed retrieved publications. Although many quantitative studies have appeared reflective of current dental radiographic instrumentation and practice, much more can be done to foster minimizing radiation to the thyroid. Conclusions: We list seven areas that should be pursued. Among them are harmonizing guidelines for the use of thyroid collars based on the recent studies and a comprehensive survey of current dental radiological practice patterns.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^885eb1b1]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Excessive levothyroxine (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis) — harms and threshold: "The deleterious health effects of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis include atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis". Accordingly, "we recommend avoiding thyroid hormone excess and subnormal serum thyrotropin values, particularly thyrotropin values below 0.1 mIU/L, especially in older persons and postmenopausal women. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". Over-treatment is common; "In one study of older individuals taking LT4, 36% of patients over age 65 years had a subnormal serum TSH (233)". Adverse outcomes increase when "serum TSH < 0.1 mIU/L", including atrial fibrillation: "patients older than age 65 years with serum TSH levels < 0.1 mIU/L… had a threefold increase in the risk of atrial fibrillation over a 10-year observation period". Skeletal risks are higher in postmenopausal women, "especially if the serum TSH levels are undetectable", and cardiovascular, dysrhythmia, and fracture admissions and deaths "were higher for those with suppressed TSH values".

Epinephrine may produce symptoms and signs that include an increase in heart rate, the sensation of a more forceful heartbeat, palpitations, sweating, nausea and vomiting, difficulty breathing, pallor, dizziness, weakness or shakiness, headache, apprehension, nervousness, or anxiety. These signs and symptoms usually subside rapidly, especially with rest, quiet, and recumbency. Patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism may develop more severe or persistent effects, and patients with coronary artery disease could experience angina. Patients with diabetes may develop increased blood glucose levels following epinephrine administration. Patients with Parkinson's disease may notice a temporary worsening of symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Accidental Injection

Advise patients to seek immediate medical care in the case of accidental injection. Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor when injected into the digits, hands or feet, treatment should be directed at vasodilation if there is such an accidental injection to these areas [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Serious Infections at the Injection Site

Rare cases of skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported at the injection site following epinephrine injection for anaphylaxis. Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, such as persistent redness, warmth, swelling, or tenderness, at the epinephrine injection site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^ea0f81d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.
