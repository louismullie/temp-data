## Question

You say lack of smoking history is a lifestyle Factor associated with Parkinson disease. Yet you also say exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk. Are these not contradictory statements?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the statements "lack of smoking history is associated with lower Parkinson's disease risk" and "air pollution exposure increases Parkinson's disease risk" are contradictory, and how to reconcile them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact wording and whether "lack of smoking history" was intended to mean "never smoking" versus "smoking cessation". Then, I should verify the strength and direction of evidence for smoking and PD risk. Next, I will review the evidence for air pollution and PD risk. After that, I need to consider mechanistic differences that could make both associations plausible without contradiction. Finally, I will synthesize a coherent, clinically grounded conclusion and clarify the correct interpretation of "lack of smoking history" in this context.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. "Lack of smoking history" is ambiguous; it could mean never smoking or it could be misread as smoking cessation, which would imply the opposite direction of association with PD risk. Wait, let me verify the intended meaning in the literature context: the consistent epidemiologic signal is that never smokers have higher PD risk than current smokers, whereas smoking cessation does not confer the same protective association and may even carry residual benefit that wanes with time since quitting, so the intended phrase should be "never smoking", not "smoking cessation" [^0e140704] [^6760b53b] [^ebd653a1].

> Next, I should review the smoking evidence carefully. Multiple large prospective cohorts and pooled analyses show a robust inverse association between smoking and incident PD, with current smokers having roughly a 30–60% lower risk than never smokers, a dose–response with pack-years, and attenuation of benefit with years since quitting. Importantly, long-term follow-up and lagged analyses reduce reverse causation concerns, supporting a biologically plausible association rather than mere bias [^0e140704] [^6760b53b] [^40dfbe4a] [^cdd44d56].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check mechanistic plausibility and whether nicotine is the key mediator. Nicotine has been a leading candidate, but randomized trials of transdermal nicotine in manifest PD have not shown benefit and even suggested possible harm, so the protective signal in smokers may involve other smoke constituents or systems-level effects such as cytochrome P450 induction, monoamine oxidase inhibition, or low-dose carbon monoxide signaling via heme oxygenase-1. Preclinical data support low-dose CO as neuroprotective in PD models, which helps reconcile the epidemiology with failed nicotine trials [^29121a3b] [^8d7e3c7a] [^65529513] [^59259d4e].

> Now, I will examine the air pollution evidence. Several high-quality, population-based studies link higher long-term exposure to PM2.5 and traffic-related pollutants such as NO2 with increased PD risk, with associations appearing stronger in metropolitan cores and in some analyses showing modification by genetic susceptibility. Effect sizes are modest but consistent across sensitivity analyses and multipollutant models, and biological plausibility includes neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and direct neurotoxicity of fine particles that can reach the brain via olfactory or systemic routes [^cb1297bf] [^ef70b232] [^a6f66481] [^13a15717] [^4edb6324].

> But wait, what if these findings are contradictory because both smoking and air pollution involve combustion products? Let me consider the mechanistic distinctions. Smoking delivers a complex mixture that includes nicotine, CO, and MAO inhibitors, with intermittent low-dose CO potentially triggering adaptive cytoprotective responses, whereas ambient air pollution lacks these pharmacologic constituents and instead delivers persistent, low-level neurotoxic and proinflammatory insults that can impair mitochondrial and lysosomal function and promote α-synuclein aggregation. Thus, different components and exposure patterns could plausibly yield opposing associations with PD risk without logical inconsistency [^31046d13] [^bb3ac0f8] [^65529513].

> I should double-check the clinical implications so I don't overstate anything. The smoking signal is not a recommendation to smoke; the net health harm of tobacco is overwhelming, and any therapeutic translation should isolate protective constituents or pathways rather than endorse smoking. Conversely, the air pollution data strengthen the case for clean-air policies and personal exposure reduction as part of PD prevention strategies, especially in genetically susceptible individuals and in urban settings with high traffic-related pollution [^cdd44d56] [^0d364354] [^4edb6324].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise. The statements are not contradictory: never smoking is associated with higher PD risk compared with current smoking, likely reflecting complex pharmacologic and adaptive effects of tobacco smoke constituents, whereas long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, particularly PM2.5 and traffic-related pollutants, is associated with increased PD risk via neurotoxic and inflammatory mechanisms. These associations operate through distinct pathways and exposure contexts, so they can coexist without inconsistency [^0e140704] [^cb1297bf] [^31046d13].

---

The apparent contradiction arises because **smoking and air pollution affect Parkinson's disease risk through different mechanisms**. Smoking shows a consistent inverse association with PD risk [^0e140704], likely due to nicotine's dopaminergic effects [^e2de41cc] and other smoke constituents [^8d7e3c7a], but this does not imply a health benefit given smoking's harms [^cdd44d56]. In contrast, air pollution — especially PM2.5 and NO2 [^cb1297bf] — increases PD risk via neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and α-synuclein pathology [^31046d13] [^eef6aff9]. These are distinct pathways, so both observations can be true without contradiction [^notfound].

---

## Evidence for smoking and Parkinson's disease

Multiple large epidemiological studies show a **consistent inverse association** between smoking and PD risk:

- **Meta-analysis**: Current smokers have a 30–60% lower PD risk than never smokers [^0e140704] [^d612ffab].
- **Dose-response**: Risk declines with more pack-years and recency of smoking [^0e140704] [^7d240447].
- **Mechanisms**: Nicotine may activate nicotinic receptors and modulate dopamine, while other smoke constituents (e.g. MAO-B inhibitors, carbon monoxide) may confer neuroprotection [^e2de41cc] [^8d7e3c7a] [^65529513].

However, this does not imply smoking is beneficial; smoking causes substantial harm, and **clinical trials of nicotine have not shown benefit in manifest PD** [^29121a3b] [^cf3a0fc8].

---

## Evidence for air pollution and Parkinson's disease

Growing evidence links air pollution — particularly PM2.5 and NO2 — to **increased PD risk**:

- **Population-based studies**: Higher PM2.5 and NO2 exposure associate with increased PD risk and akinetic-rigid phenotypes [^cb1297bf] [^ef70b232].
- **Mechanisms**: PM2.5 can cross the blood-brain barrier, triggering neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and α-synuclein aggregation [^eef6aff9] [^31046d13].
- **Gene-environment interactions**: Genetic susceptibility amplifies pollution-related PD risk [^4edb6324] [^36ad1d10].

---

## Reconciling the apparent contradiction

The inverse smoking association and the positive pollution association reflect **distinct mechanisms**:

| **Factor** | **Direction of association** | **Proposed mechanisms** |
|-|-|-|
| Smoking | Inverse (protective) | - Nicotine-mediated dopaminergic modulation <br/> - MAO-B inhibition <br/> - Carbon monoxide signaling <br/> - Gut microbiome effects [^e2de41cc] [^8d7e3c7a] [^65529513] [^4fced061] |
| Air pollution | Positive (harmful) | - Neuroinflammation <br/> - Oxidative stress <br/> - α-synuclein aggregation <br/> - Mitochondrial dysfunction [^31046d13] [^eef6aff9] [^bb3ac0f8] |

---

Thus, both observations can coexist because smoking's protective signals operate through **pharmacologic and adaptive pathways**, whereas pollution's harm reflects **direct neurotoxicity and systemic inflammation**.

---

## Clinical and public health implications

- **Smoking**: Despite the inverse association, smoking is harmful; nicotine trials have not shown benefit in manifest PD, so smoking should not be recommended [^29121a3b] [^cf3a0fc8].
- **Air pollution**: Reducing exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 is a modifiable strategy to lower PD risk, especially in genetically susceptible individuals [^4edb6324] [^36ad1d10].
- **Prevention**: Public health efforts should prioritize clean air initiatives and further research into smoke constituents that may inform safe, targeted therapies [^0d364354] [^7f35a3a6].

---

In sum, smoking and air pollution influence PD risk via **different biological pathways**, so both findings can be valid without contradiction. The key takeaway is that smoking is not a viable prevention strategy, while reducing air pollution is a sensible, evidence-aligned approach to lowering PD risk.

Introduction

With a global impact on over 6 million individuals, Parkinson's disease (PD) stands as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Unfortunately, its incidence has significantly increased over the last three decades, with a 2.5-fold rise. PD has prominent clinical manifestations, including resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Such indicators have a significant effect on the quality of life of PD patients. Given the progressive and irreversible nature of this disease, the prevention of PD is of paramount importance. However, despite extensive research, PD's underlying risk factors remain poorly understood. It highlights the urgent need for further investigation and intervention to improve our understanding and develop effective strategies for prevention.

Various environmental factors have been considered potential triggers for PD development for many years. According to the Braak hypothesis, alpha-synuclein's pathological aggregation commences in the gastrointestinal tract and olfactory bulb prior to extending toward the central nervous system. Consequently, exposure to environmental contaminants, including pesticides, metals, and microorganisms, has been suggested to potentially contribute to the early pathology of PD and ultimately increase the risk of developing the disease. Despite air pollution still being the most prevailing environment-related risk to the health of human beings, the findings of epidemiological research looking into the association between the said pollution type and PD are varied –. While recent studies have suggested a potential association between long-term exposure to air pollution and the onset of PD, the significance of this relationship remains inconclusive due to limitations such as small sample sizes, a low number of cases, short exposure or follow-up durations, and a lack of adjustments for other exposure factors, such as smoking. Therefore, there is a need for more extensive population-based cohort research to investigate this possible link thoroughly.

Fourth, declining smoking rates in some countries, although a global health boon, might contribute to higher incidence of Parkinson's disease. The risk of Parkinson's disease is decreased by approximately 40% among smokers. Whether this association is truly causal or explained by reverse causation or other biases is still debated. If the association between smoking and Parkinson's disease were causal, decreasing smoking rates would lead to an increase in the incidence of Parkinson's disease in the future. Assuming a causal inverse association and a 10-year lag to account for the temporal effect of smoking on the incidence of Parkinson's disease, one study in the USAestimated that declining smoking rates in the country might increase the projected burden of Parkinson's disease in 2040 by 10%. However, because the lag time between exposure and the actual effect on disease risk is unknown and might actually be longer than 10 years, the timing of the potential effect of declining smoking rates on Parkinson's disease incidence is uncertain, and additional studies are needed to examine the effects of changing smoking habits in different parts of the world with different smoking rates and time trends. Regardless of the results of such studies, the adverse health consequences of smoking far outweigh any potential benefit on Parkinson's disease. Finally, changes in the prevalence of other known (eg, head trauma) or unknown risk or protective factors that were not included in GBD 2016 might contribute to changing incidence rates of Parkinson's disease.

### The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^1a3097b3]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease shows marked variations in time, geography, ethnicity, age, and sex. Internationally, prevalence has increased over and above demographic changes. There are several potential reasons for this increase, including the decline in other competing causes of death. Whether incidence is increasing, especially in women or in many low-income and middle-income countries where there is a shortage of high-quality data, is less certain. Parkinson's disease is more common in older people and men, and a variety of environmental factors have been suggested to explain why, including exposure to neurotoxic agents. Within countries, there appear to be ethnic differences in disease risk, although these differences might reflect differential access to health care. The cause of Parkinson's disease is multifactorial, and involves genetic and environmental factors. Both risk factors (eg, pesticides) and protective factors (eg, physical activity and tendency to smoke) have been postulated to have a role in Parkinson's disease, although elucidating causality is complicated by the long prodromal period. Following the establishment of public health strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and dementia are gaining a deserved higher priority. Multipronged prevention strategies are required that tackle population-based primary prevention, high-risk targeted secondary prevention, and Parkinson's disease-modifying therapies for tertiary prevention. Future international collaborations will be required to triangulate evidence from basic, applied, and epidemiological research, thereby enhancing the understanding and prevention of Parkinson's disease at a global level.

Potential Effects of Smoking on Disease Prevention and/or Progression

It is possible that the determinants underlying the epidemiological observation of a reduced risk of PD among smokers, once understood, could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Such determinants would have a clear value to prevent PD, and some results suggest that they might also have activity on disease progression. Although smoking is strongly associated with increased mortality, mortality in PD does not appear to be influenced by smoking status. Although PD smokers are more likely to die from smoking-related cancers than PD nonsmokers, they tend to have fewer deaths from neurologic causes. Although mixed results have been observed in the few studies of smoking and disease progression, compared to never smokers, current smokers at last follow-up have been observed to have a lower levodopa (L-dopa) equivalent dose, a proxy for disease severity.

The inference that components of smoke may help prevent or treat PD is strengthened by preclinical studies demonstrating biological plausibility, where exposure to cigarette smoke was shown to confer protection in rodent models of the disease (with apparent toxicity or loss of effect at greater exposures to smoke). – However, these studies employed toxin models of PD, and the effects of smoke on α-synuclein or other PD gene-based models of neurodegeneration remain unknown.

Discussion

In the present manuscript, we analyzed the relationship between air pollution and incident PD risk in an Italian population, identifying a notable influence of PM10 levels on an increased risk of PD. This influence was independent on diverse other factors representing known risk/protective factors for PD, including lifestyles like smoking, and on professional factors like exposure to toxic compounds. While a link between PM10 and neurodegenerative risk has been long hypothesized and an involvement of PM10 in PD mechanisms has been reported in animal models, only few studies supported a clear association with PD, while recent meta-analyses revealed contrasting results and a yet unclear relationship, reflecting inconsistent findings. A geospatial analysis of PD cases and controls reported a significant difference in the mean annual NO2 and PM10 levels between areas where PD cases were concentrated (hotspots) and those where they were not (coldspots). These findings are in line with a large nested case-control study from a Chinese health insurance cohort, where PM10 was the only pollutant reported to influence an increase in PD risk, among many others. However, other cohort studies found no evidence of association with PM10, as well as case-control studies, and even meta-analyses. Other works identified associations between PM2.5, incident PD risk (although limited to women living in a specific US region), and clinical events related to PD, like an increased mortality in PD patients. Conversely, the Rome Longitudinal Study showed no association of PM2.5 and PM10 levels with Parkinson's disease, in spite of the evidence reported for vascular dementia. Other studies found associations between exposure to air pollutants – particularly PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 - and neuropathological hallmarks of PD, but also with neuroimaging endophenotypes of neurodegeneration like a reduced prefrontal cortex, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness. Interestingly, a recent umbrella review and meta-analysis revealed a significant association of PM10 levels with vascular dementia but not with Alzheimer's Disease risk. This, along with the inconsistent findings from epidemiological studies on PD and with the scarcity of studies on animal PD models, suggests caution in the interpretation of our findings.

### Clearing the smoke: what protects smokers from Parkinson's disease? [^71e29b88]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The link between smoking and a lower risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the strongest environmental or lifestyle associations in neuroepidemiology. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that the association is based on a neuroprotective effect of smoking on PD, despite the plausible alternative that smoking serves as a marker for a proximal protective influence without itself conferring benefit. But how smoking could protect against neurodegeneration in PD is not well understood. Of several candidate molecules and mechanisms that have been nominated, nicotine has received the most attention. However, randomized controlled clinical trials of nicotine in PD have failed to demonstrate benefit on motor endpoints, including the NIC-PD study in which recently diagnosed participants were randomly assigned to placebo or nicotine treatment for 1year. Given these results, the time is right to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of other molecules and biochemical cascades triggered by smoking. Here, we review the evidence supporting smoking's possible protective effect on PD, compounds in tobacco and smoke that might mediate such benefit, and non-causal classes of explanation, including reverse causation and the prospect of shared genetic determinants of smoking and PD resistance. The therapeutic potential of non-nicotine components of smoke is suggested by studies supporting multiple alternative mechanisms ranging from monoamine oxidase inhibitors to gut microbiome disruption to antioxidant response induction by chronic exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide. Rigorous investigation is warranted to evaluate this molecule and others for disease-preventing and disease-modifying activity in PD models and, if warranted, in clinical trials. © 2024 The Authors.

Examining the Risk of Parkinson's disease Among Smokers

Despite a panoply of symptomatic therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, no treatments are known to slow down, arrest, or reverse its course. One potentially promising strategy to identify neuroprotective therapies for PD is to exploit its environmental and genetic risk factors. To this end, inverse risk factors that predict reduced PD risk are of particular interest. Of these, the most reproducible environmental association identified to date is smoking.

In multiple studies, smokers have been found to have a substantially lower relative risk for PD than nonsmokers (pooled adjusted odds ratio of smokers vs. never-smokers, 0.2–0.5). – This risk reduction, which extends to reduced risk of Lewy-related neuropathologic changes, is not explained by selective mortality and increases with increased smoking dose, duration, and recency. A causal relationship of smoking on PD risk is consistent with the inverse correlation between the male/female ratios of PD and smoking across countries, the lower PD risk among individuals whose parents were smokers, and the persistence of a putative protective effect of smoking in genetic studies — including family-based case control studiesas well as twin studies, which control for the impact of genotype on disease. Reduced rates of smoking have also been cited as a potential explanation for increasing PD rates.

### Epidemiologic studies of environmental exposures in Parkinson's disease [^4441139b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of the parkinsonian syndromes and the most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Because of the ageing of Western populations, an increasing number of persons will be affected with PD in the future and neither curative treatments nor preventive measures have been identified. PD is considered as a multifactorial disease, resulting from the effect of environmental factors and genetic susceptibility. Increasing age and male sex appear to be associated with an increased risk of PD. In addition, recent epidemiological studies have identified environmental exposures that influence the risk of PD. This review provides an overview of the epidemiologic evidence for environmental etiologies in PD; we will focus on two environmental exposures that have been quite consistently associated with PD — cigarette smoking and pesticide exposure — and will summarize briefly the findings for other exposures. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these epidemiological associations is an essential step for the understanding of the etiology of this neurodegenerative condition and, ideally, to develop neuroprotective drugs.

### Air pollution and the risk of Parkinson's disease: a review [^31046d13]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, are primarily characterized by pathological accumulation of proteins, inflammation, and neuron loss. Although there are some known genetic risk factors, most cases cannot be explained by genetics alone. Therefore, it is important to determine the environmental factors that confer risk and the mechanisms by which they act. Recent epidemiological studies have found that exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk for development of Parkinson's disease, although not all results are uniform. The variability between these studies is likely due to differences in what components of air pollution are measured, timing and methods used to determine exposures, and correction for other variables. There are several potential mechanisms by which air pollution could act to increase the risk for development of Parkinson's disease, including direct neuronal toxicity, induction of systemic inflammation leading to central nervous system inflammation, and alterations in gut physiology and the microbiome. Taken together, air pollution is an emerging risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. A number of potential mechanisms have been implicated by which it promotes neuropathology providing biological plausibility, and these mechanisms are likely relevant to the development of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This field is in its early stages, but a better understanding of how environmental exposures influence the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is essential for reducing the incidence of disease and finding disease-modifying therapies. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease: a critical review and policy implications [^5f0ea270]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The age‐standardized prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has increased substantially over the years and is expected to increase further. This emphasizes the need to identify modifiable risk factors of PD, which could form a logical entry point for the prevention of PD. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended reducing exposure to specific environmental factors that have been reported to be associated with PD, in particular pesticides, trichloroethylene (TCE), and air pollution. In this review we critically evaluate the epidemiological and biological evidence on the associations of these factors with PD and review evidence on whether these putative associations are causal. We conclude that when considered in isolation, it is difficult to determine whether these associations are causal, in large part because of the decades‐long lag between relevant exposures and the incidence of manifest PD. However, when considered in tandem with evidence from complementary research lines (such as animal models), it is increasingly likely that these associations reflect harmful causal effects. Fundamentally, whilst we highlight some evidence gaps that require further attention, we believe the current evidence base is sufficiently strong enough to support our call for stronger policy action. © 2024 The Author(s).

### Environmental tobacco smoke and Parkinson's disease [^151f3f91]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Parkinson's disease is inversely associated with cigarette smoking, but its relation with passive smoking or environmental tobacco smoke exposure is rarely examined.

Methods

Within a case-control study, we assessed the association between Parkinson's disease and living or working with active smokers. Cases were newly diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 154) from western Washington State in 2002–2008. Age- and sex-matched controls (n = 173) were neurologically normal and unrelated to cases.

Results

Compared with never active or passive tobacco smokers, we observed reduced Parkinson's disease risks for ever passive only smokers (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16–0.73), similar to those for ever active smokers (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.73). Among persons whose only tobacco smoke exposure was passive smoking at home, risk was inversely associated with years exposed.

Conclusions

These observations parallel those well established for active smoking. However, it remains unresolved whether a true protective effect of tobacco smoke, generally detrimental to health, underlies these associations.

### Clearing the smoke: what protects smokers from Parkinson's disease? [^7f35a3a6]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although smoking is overall exceedingly unhealthful, its remarkably robust association with reduced PD risk remains a major yet underexplored clue to protection against the disease. In addition to the potential value for PD prevention, the basis for smoking's effects on PD risk may have therapeutic potential in manifest PD. With nicotine now effectively struck from the list of potential neuroprotective treatments for manifest PD given the decisively null results of the NIC-PD trial, renewed efforts to identify and evaluate the disease-modifying potential of other constituents of smoke and associated molecular mechanisms are warranted. Only a small number of smoking-associated explanatory candidates have been identified to date. Several features of CO at the low doses self-administered by smokers support its therapeutic potential, including (1) engagement of several PD-linked molecular cascades, (2) evidence of neuroprotection in model systems relevant to PD, and (3) safety in 23 clinical trials to date at the target dose range (see, for example, –). Research focused on CO and other smoking-associated molecules and mechanisms may light up clinical development to evaluate the safety and efficacy of leading candidates. Pursuing the potential protective effects of smoking on PD has the potential to ignite a new generation of PD prevention strategies and therapeutics.

### The epidemiology of Parkinson's disease: risk factors and prevention [^cc1cb959]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Since 2006, several longitudinal studies have assessed environmental or behavioural factors that seem to modify the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Increased risk of Parkinson's disease has been associated with exposure to pesticides, consumption of dairy products, history of melanoma, and traumatic brain injury, whereas a reduced risk has been reported in association with smoking, caffeine consumption, higher serum urate concentrations, physical activity, and use of ibuprofen and other common medications. Randomised trials are investigating the possibility that some of the negative risk factors might be neuroprotective and thus beneficial in individuals with early Parkinson's disease, particularly with respect to smoking (nicotine), caffeine, and urate. In the future, it might be possible to identify Parkinson's disease in its prodromal phase and to promote neuroprotective interventions before the onset of motor symptoms. At this time, however, the only intervention that seems justifiable for the primary prevention of Parkinson's disease is the promotion of physical activity, which is likely to be beneficial for the prevention of several chronic diseases.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^f05e6829]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and PD

Information on vital status and cause of death for those who died was collected between November 1, 1951, and October 31, 2016, from national records, supplemented by personal inquiries. Cases were defined as doctors for whom death certificates indicated that PD was the underlying cause of death, International Classification of Diseases, Seventh Revision (ICD-7) code 350, ICD-9 code 332.0, or ICD-10 code G20 (hereafter referred to as "PD"). Doctors who withdrew before the end of the study or were lost to follow-up were included in analyses until withdrawal or attrition, after which they were censored. Complete follow-up of mortality was available for approximately 99% of participants in the study.

Strategies to minimize reverse causality bias

The impact of reverse causality bias in observational studies can be minimized by ensuring that information about exposures is collected before the onset of the disease; excluding participants with previous disease at enrollment; and excluding a relevant period of early follow-up to minimize distortion of results by cases of disease that were undetected at enrollment. Hence, the first 10 years of follow-up were excluded from all analyses to minimize the effects of reverse causality bias.

### Exposure to ambient air pollution and onset of Parkinson's disease in a large cohort study [^bf881599]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study reported that 8.5 million people globally had Parkinson's disease (PD) in 2019, with cases growing due to aging populations, showing a 145% increase between 1990 and 2016. In the United Kingdom (UK), PD prevalence for people over 20 in 2018 was 145,519, with a lifetime diagnosis risk of 2.7%. Incidence is expected to rise above 21,000 annually by 2025, alongside an 18% rise in prevalence. In the United States (US) incidence rates for individuals aged 65+ range from 108 to 212 per 100,000, and from 47 to 77 per 100,000 for those aged 45+. Understanding modifiable determinants of PD could help to mitigate this growing problem.

The etiology of PD remains unclear, with interactions between environmental and genetic factors implicated. Some emerging evidence links ambient air pollution, including particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM 2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) to PD. Ambient air pollution may contribute directly through neuro-inflammation and oxidative stressor indirectly through cardiovascular health – or cerebrovascular disease. Other risk factors include dairy products, pesticides, high body mass index, diabetes, cancer, and brain injury.

### Variations in gender ratios support the connection between smoking and Parkinson's disease [^26a86cd3]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Smokers have a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but this association could simply be the result of a common factor causing both PD and aversion to smoking. Smoking behavior in industrialized nations has changed dramatically over the second half of the 20th century, with diverging patterns in male and female smoking rates. We therefore examined whether PD incidence changed concomitantly, as would be expected if smoking truly reduced PD risk. We performed a PUBMED search to identify relevant studies reporting male and female age-specific prevalence or incidence of PD in different countries. For each country and birth cohort we then estimated the male to female ratio in PD incidence, and correlated these ratios with the corresponding male to female ratios in smoking behavior obtained from national statistics. We show that the relative frequency of PD among women declines when the proportion of women smoking increases. The strength of this correlation (r = 0.28; P = 0.0002) is comparable to the opposite trend observed for lung cancer, and supports an overall 74% reduction in risk of PD among smokers. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking reduces the risk of PD.

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^cb1297bf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This population-based case-control study provides evidence in support of an association of PM 2.5 and NO 2 exposure with the risk of developing PD. Higher levels of PM 2.5 exposure were associated with increased risk of developing akinetic rigid disease and dyskinesias compared with lower levels of exposure. These findings suggest that a reduction in PM 2.5 may help reduce the risk of PD and affect the clinical profile of PD and disease complications (modifying the PD phenotype and the risk of dyskinesia in patients with PD).

### Longitudinal assessment of the association between pesticide exposure and lifestyle with Parkinson's disease motor severity [^e2de41cc]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The neuroprotective effect of smoking is most likely mediated by nicotine and its stimulating effects on dopaminergic neurons via neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the time window for the beneficial neuroprotective effects of nicotine is very small and likely ineffective after the majority of dopaminergic neurons are lost. Similarly, a double-blinded phase-II trial evaluating the therapeutic effect of nicotine on motor signs and symptoms in PD patients showed no benefits of nicotine. There was even a trend for a more substantial progression in the nicotine-treated group compared to the placebo group. There is a substantial reduction of nAChRs that even precedes the dopaminergic neuron loss in PD patients. Thus, it is plausible that due to the narrow therapeutic window of nicotine, patients who already show motor symptoms do not benefit from the neuroprotective effect anymore.

### Smoking and Parkinson's disease: systematic review of prospective studies [^4887491e]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

We estimated the pooled risk of tobacco smoking for Parkinson's disease (PD). Inclusion criteria included systematic searches of MedLine, PsycLIT, Embase, Current Contents, previously published reviews, examination of cited reference sources, and personal contact and discussion with several investigators expert in the field. Published prospective studies on PD and cigarette smoking. When two or more studies were based on an identical study, the study that principally investigated the relationship or the study that was published last was used. Seven prospective studies were carried out between 1959 and 1997, of which six reported risk estimates. Four cohorts were based on standardised mortality rates, which were exclusively of male. Only one study included risk estimates for both males and females separately. The risk of ever smoker was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.61). There was an obvious protective effect of current smoking in the pooled estimate (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.26–0.47). Former smokers had lower risk compared with never smokers (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49–0.88). Although our pooled estimates show that smoking is inversely associated with the risk of PD, the four prospective studies that were based on follow-up of mortality of smokers had many limitations. Further studies evaluating the association between smoking and PD in women are strongly needed.

### Long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants and risk of Parkinson's disease: a population-based multipollutant model study [^13a15717]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our multipollutant models reveal significant associations between long-term exposure to PM 2.5, PM 10, NO 2, SO 2 and O 3 and increased PD risk. These findings highlight the complex relationship between air pollution and PD, stressing the need for health policies to reduce pollution's impact. Our results emphasise the importance of monitoring air quality in high-risk populations and incorporating air pollution exposure into PD risk assessments. Additionally, they support community-based strategies and patient counselling to minimise exposure, potentially reducing PD incidence and progression.

### Exposure to ambient air pollution and onset of Parkinson's disease in a large cohort study [^472fa961]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Another explanation for the age contrast suggested here is the possibility that our prescriptions-based measure disproportionately overestimates PD onsets among under-50s, as these drugs may be used for other health conditions with overlapping symptoms, e.g. RLS and Dystonia. These conditions share some aspects of etiology with PD, involving dopaminergic dysfunction, and thus their treatment can include enhancing dopamine activity in the brain, like the treatment of PD. Indeed, comparing our own estimate of PD incidence with the figures implied by statistics from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)suggests that we may overcount PD cases in our dataset, and by a factor of around 1.5 (NICE suggested an incidence rate of 144 per 100,000 person-years in 2016). Based on that rate, we should expect approximately 2160 incidences of PD across our sample over 5 years, which is lower than the 3089 incidences we identified.) Additionally, considering a recent meta-analysis of gender-specific PD incidence, the overcounting of PD onsets may be more pronounced in our younger age group. Therefore, a more cautious interpretation of our research is that it suggests a tentative association between exposure to air pollution and the onset of conditions — including, but not limited to, Parkinson's disease (PD) — for which these drugs are prescribed in younger age groups. In support of this more cautious interpretation, sensitivity analysis using a stricter two-consecutive-period-prescription measure of PD onset returned non-significant estimated hazard ratios for both age groups. Given the limitations of our dataset, a more detailed investigation is beyond the scope of this paper. However, this is an important avenue for further research.

In addition to the potential measurement errors stemming from our prescriptions-based proxy for PD onset, this study has other limitations, including the inability to assess indoor pollution effects, despite growing evidence of the importance of indoor air pollution in health outcomes –, and reliance on modelled annual outdoor pollution averages. Furthermore, we could not examine short-term pollution events or exposures longer than 2 years, leaving the most appropriate exposure duration for modelling PD onset unclear. Finally, characterising the nature of the pollutants involved would add value to the study, since some components of particulate matter may have different effects on health than others. Unfortunately, suitable speciation data do not exist for Northern Ireland. Despite these limitations, our findings contribute to the growing PD-pollution literature, highlighting potential but tentative associations at younger ages even in low-pollution contexts like Northern Ireland.

### Pooled analysis of tobacco use and risk of parkinson disease… [^0e140704]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measure Incident PD. Results We confirmed inverse associations between PD and smoking and found these to be generally stronger in current compared with former smokers; the associations were stronger in cohort than in case-control studies. We observed inverse trends with pack-years smoked at every age at onset except the very elderly, and the reduction of risk lessened with years since quitting smoking. The risk reductions we observed for white and Asian patients were not seen in Hispanic and African American patients. We also found an inverse association both for smoking cigars and/or pipes and for chewing tobacco in male subjects. Early case-control studies suggesting that patients with Parkinson disease are less likely to be smokers were criticized as biased. The observation is counterintuitive; cigarette smoke has long been recognized as a cause of adverse health effects.

Thus, selective survival of PD cases and reporting bias were suggested as possible explanations. Our pooled-risk estimates for current and former vs never smoking suggest a similar sized risk reduction for PD among men and women but a stronger reduction in current than former smokers and in cohort studies compared with case-control studies. When combining information on quantity and duration of cigarette smoking, we observed inverse trends for PD with increasing pack-years of cigarettes smoked: ie, an average 5% to 8% reduction in relative risk per 10 pack-years. In our case-control studies, an inverse association with regular lifetime cigar/pipe smoking was seen only among persons who did not smoke cigarettes.

Although we found that current smokers and those who had continued to smoke to within 5 years of PD diagnosis exhibited the lowest risk, a decrease in risk was also observed in those who had quit smoking up to 25 years prior to PD diagnosis. This later observation suggests that the risk reduction is unlikely to be attributable to recent changes in smoking habits resulting from behavior modifications related to incipient disease onset. Inverse associations with smoking were stronger in our pooled analyses of cohort data. In cohort studies, smoking is assessed repeatedly and prior to disease onset. Thus, smoking information in these studies is likely more accurate and not influenced by recall bias. Better exposure assessment reduces misclassification bias; thus, smoking might be more strongly negatively related to PD than estimates from case-control studies suggest.

Air Pollution

Ambient air pollution is a mixture of gaseous and particulate matter that has been associated with various adverse health effects (cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological) and excess mortality. Particulate matter (PM) air pollution consists of different sized particles (eg, PM10 with a diameter of < 10 μm, PM2.5 < 2.5 μm, and ultrafine particles < 0.1 μm). The composition of particles differs as they are aggregated from several components (eg, black and organic carbon molecules, mineral dust, and secondary organic aerosols). Some of these components are characteristic of specific sources, such as black carbon for combustion processes and ammonium for agriculture. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) is a gaseous marker for traffic‐related pollution, whereas secondary organic aerosols are related to long‐range transport. Organic carbons in the air pollution mixture may consist of known harmful or carcinogenic molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAs), iron, and other metals that are constituents of particles. Additionally, transition metals and lipopolysaccharides may be adsorbed onto particles. As the concentrations of pollutants and particle components differ across space and time, the mixture differs between studies, and even study participants. The effects of air pollution on the central nervous system have been investigated, focusing on cerebrovascular disease, AD, and PD., Oxidative stress and inflammation have been identified as key pathophysiological mechanisms linking neurological diseases to air pollution.,

Some studies have provided evidence for associations between air pollution exposure and PD. For example, indications of a possible association have been found for PM2.5 and ozone (O 3), but the available evidence for an association between specific air pollutants and PD remains unclear, with several meta‐analyses reaching null conclusions (Table 2). Only one meta‐analysis published in 2019 reported a clear association between PM2.5 exposure and increased PD risk (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.04–1.73). However, the reliability was questionable due to erroneously high‐risk estimates (ie, higher than reported in the original publication) included in this meta‐analysis for at least two individual studies. An updated systematic literature review and meta‐analysis is underway and will include an assessment of the exposure–response function, increasing the available evidence.

### Clearing the smoke: what protects smokers from Parkinson's disease? [^8d7e3c7a]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Smoking-Associated Molecules and Effects Proposed to Confer Benefit

Although the inverse risk of PD among smokers is well established and multiple lines of evidence support a neuroprotective effect of smoking as its basis, it remains unclear what molecular exposure(s) among the myriad constituents within tobacco or the products of its combustion in smoke might account for such protection. We review some candidates here.

Nicotine

Nicotine has been the dominant candidate proposed to underlie the reduced risk of PD among smokers for nearly 50 years. Its consistent presence in tobacco smoke, its high central nervous system (CNS) penetration, and its well-known psychoactive properties provided early, albeit indirect, support. Consistent with this possibility, the use of chewing tobacco has been reported to reduce PD risk, with hazard ratios of 0.4–0.5. Moreover, findings of reduced PD risk in women (and less consistently men) who consume more dietary nicotine further implicate this tobacco component. In laboratory studies, treatment with nicotine was shown to be protective in models of PD. On the basis of these results and epidemiological context, clinical studies have been undertaken to assess nicotine's potential as a PD therapeutic. A randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind end point 28-week phase II trial of high-dose transdermal nicotine in participants with L-dopa-treated PD showed no evidence for benefit of nicotine on motor function measured using the clinician-rated, objective motor subscale (part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, the rather short duration of that trial limited interpretation with respect to disease course.

### Nicotine in Parkinson's disease-a therapeutic track gone up in smoke? [^cf3a0fc8]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, numerous studies have found that smoking or the intake of any form of nicotine, such as smokeless tobacco, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or even dietary sources such as peppers, reduces the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. 1 Such observations suggest a potential disease-modifying effect of nicotine in Parkinson's disease. Many experimental studies, some of them supported by grants from the tobacco industry, have lent support for such a hypothesis.

### Parkinson's disease: evidence for environmental risk factors [^5a4f9bcc]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) has no known cause. Although recent research has focused particularly on genetic causes of PD, environmental causes also play a role in developing the disease. This article reviews environmental factors that may increase the risk of PD, as well as the evidence behind those factors. Enough evidence exists to suggest that age has a causal relationship to PD. Significant evidence exists that gender, tobacco use, and caffeine consumption are also associated with the development of PD. Other environmental factors (pesticide exposure, occupation, blood urate levels, NSAID use, brain injury, and exercise) have limited or conflicting evidence of a relationship to PD. Future research must not neglect the impact of these environmental factors on the development of PD, especially with respect to potential gene-environment interactions.

TABLE 2
Available meta‐analysis of the association between specific air pollutants and Parkinson's disease

One Korean cohort study of > 313,000 participants observed an association between PM2.5 exposure and PD, which was limited to those aged > 65 years, male, or living in Metropolitan cities. A second Korean cohort study of > 1 million participants (partly overlapping with the previous study) reported no association between PM2.5 and PD. The only observed association was between NO 2 exposure and PD comparing the lowest and highest quartiles. Other studies have reported an association between PM2.5 exposure and PD, but some did not observe an association. In a recent study in California applying 10‐year average exposure and a 5‐year lag time, significant associations with carbon monoxide (CO) and PM2.5 were observed. A cohort study of ~300,000 participants identified from the UK Biobank (UKB) applied four different statistical methods and reported consistent results for an association between PM2.5 and PD for all four methods.

The association with other pollutants has been studied less, with an association reported for NO 2, conflicting results for PM10, and no association with sulfur dioxide (SO 2). A recent Mendelian randomization (MR) study of 456,380 participants in the UKB reported a possible association between genetically estimated NO 2 exposure and PD.

Ultrafine particles and PM2.5 can trigger inflammatory responses both in the periphery and the central nervous system. After inhalation, PMs can directly interact with alveolar macrophages and airway epithelial cells, leading to local pro‐inflammatory cytokine release and pulmonary inflammation. This leads to systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Fine particles in air pollution can directly enter the bloodstream via the alveolar–blood barrier. Chronic systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, together with a potential increase in the permeability of the BBB, may lead to neuroinflammation. In addition to the proposed lung–brain axis route, another entry route might be the direct translocation through olfactory nerve terminals.

### Exposure to ambient air pollution and onset of Parkinson's disease in a large cohort study [^3bafd88c]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

This population-based longitudinal cohort study examines the association between ambient air pollution (PM 2.5 and NO 2) and Parkinson's disease (PD) using a 28% representative sample of Northern Ireland's population (2009–2016). We matched complete address records to annual average PM 2.5 and NO 2 concentrations at a 1km grid level and tracked PD onset via first receipt of PD medication. After controlling for confounding factors at individual, household, and neighbourhood levels, we found no association between medium-term PM 2.5 or NO 2 exposure and PD onset in the overall cohort, over-50s, or sex-stratified samples. However, a positive association was observed between PM 2.5 exposure and PD onset in those under 50 in 2011, with weaker evidence for NO 2. We discuss potential etiological and non-etiological explanations for this age-related difference.

### Cigarette smoking in Parkinson's disease: influence on disease progression [^ae7c89bb]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown an inverse association between smoking and the prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that smoking may induce a biological protection against nigral neuronal damage. In 1993, we examined the frequency of cigarette smokers among 239 patients with PD and two control groups. In addition, the progression of parkinsonism and other clinical features were followed prospectively in smoking and nonsmoking PD patients over an 8-year period. Mortality in the two PD groups was also examined. We found a 50% higher prevalence of smokers in the control groups than in patients with PD. In contrast, during the follow-up period, there were no significant differences in progression of parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, and mood in smoking and nonsmoking patients with PD. Mortality was also similar in the two groups. The lack of influence on disease progression may indicate that cigarette smoking does not have a major neuroprotective effect in patients with already diagnosed PD.

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^24164c4d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importantly, in 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency reduced the annual PM 2.5 standard from 12 μg/m 3 to 9 μg/m 3 due to growing evidence of negative health effects at levels below the previously set standard. Our study not only supports the findings that led to this change, but suggests that the upper limit should be lowered to 8 μg/m 3 — a level previously advocated for by the American Lung Association and other health organizations. Notably, the World Health Organization recommends a more stringent limit than this, setting their standard to 5 μg/m 3.

Individuals with PD who were exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 were more likely to develop the akinetic rigid subtype of PD. Bradykinesia and rigidity are the predominant findings in these individuals, and this subtype has been linked to faster disease progression. Studies suggest that akinesia and resting tremor may result from different neurobiological processes, with the former resulting from both tonic (sustained) and phasic (intermittent) dopamine levels, and the latter from tonic release of dopamine and dopamine receptor responsiveness. We speculate that these differences may result from differences in PM 2.5 subcomponents and subfractions. Interestingly, similar findings have been reported when using the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a model for PD. Indeed, MPTP has been shown to produce both phasic and tonic dopamine dysregulation in the basal ganglia. In humans, MPTP can produce all major Parkinsonian symptoms, including akinesia and rest tremor; however, in many primate models, MPTP produces akinesia and rigidity without low-frequency tremor. Although MPTP is not found naturally in the environment, it is often referenced when exploring the role of environmental toxins that might cause neurodegeneration by a mechanism similar to MPTP. Thus our finding that PM 2.5 exposure was associated with greater risk of the akinetic rigid PD subtype aligns with the possible evidence of a different clinical manifestations of the disease secondary to an external neurotoxin exposures (MPTP). This work provides insight into the role of PM 2.5 exposure in the development of the different PD phenotypes. Furthermore, our study may offer a new explanation for the onset of dyskinesias that is not solely based on patient demographics, genetics, clinical characteristics, or drug response. In fact, it possible that environmental factors may lead to an increased risk of developing dyskinesia.

### Environment, lifestyle, and Parkinson's disease: implications for prevention in the next decade [^7570ebd5]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

There is evidence from observational studies for a role of a number of environmental exposures and lifestyle habits in modulating the risk for Parkinson's disease. Environmental and lifestyle associations, if causal, represent opportunities for Parkinson's disease prevention or disease modification at individual and population levels. In the past decade, additional evidence has been published that improves causal inference and/or enhances our understanding of the complexity of these associations. A number of gene-environment interactions have been elucidated, and our understanding of the roles of physical activity, pesticide and other chemical exposures, dietary habits, emotional stress, head injury, and smoking has been refined. In the next decade, better techniques will help us to close the gaps in our knowledge, including taking into account Parkinson's disease heterogeneity and gene and risk factor interactions in observational studies. To do this, larger datasets, global consortia, genomewide environment interaction studies, prospective studies throughout the lifespan, and improvements in the methodology of clinical trials of physical activity will be key. Despite the caveats of observational studies, a number of low-risk and potentially high-yield recommendations for lifestyle modification could be made to minimize the individual and societal burdens of Parkinson's disease, including dietary modifications, increasing physical activity, and head injury avoidance. Furthermore, a reduction in pesticide use could have a major impact on global health related to and beyond Parkinson's disease. Given the increasing prevalence of this disorder, formulating and promoting these recommendations should be a high priority. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Smoking and Parkinson's disease… [^30d99be7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We tested the hypothesis that the inverse association of smoking and Parkinson's disease results from a direct pharmacologic benefit of smoking on PD. We mailed questionnaires to the 32 000 members of the United Parkinson Foundation and searched for evidence of a doseresponse effect between increasing intensity of smoking and decreasing intensity of PD. Of the 6006 respondents, 3693 met our diagnostic criteria. Despite confining the analysis to subgroups where confounding effects would be minimized, we found no significant correlation between any measure of smoking and any measure of PD severity and conclude that smoking is probably not of benefit in preventing, delaying, or ameliorating PD.

### Genetic susceptibility modifies the association of long-term air pollution exposure on Parkinson's disease [^4edb6324]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Within this research endeavor, we scrutinized the correlation between air pollutants and the risk of developing PD while factoring in genetic susceptibility. Our investigation unveiled a noteworthy connection between overall air pollution levels and an escalated risk of PD onset. Notably, persistent exposure to NO 2 and PM 10 emerged as autonomous risk factors for the subsequent manifestation of PD. Upon evaluating the compounded effects of genetic predisposition and air pollutant exposure, we detected a considerable amplification in the risk of PD among participants possessing heightened genetic susceptibility and concurrently exposed to elevated air pollutant concentrations. Furthermore, we identified a substantial association between genetic-based sensitivity and exposure to air pollution. The consequences of protracted air pollution on PD may be exacerbated by genetic susceptibility.

Little is known about the relationship between exposure to air pollution and PD development. The link between long-term air pollutant exposure and PD incidence was extensively examined. According to previous research, we calculated long-term exposures using data on air pollution from 2010. The levels of air pollution in the United Kingdom are still quite stabilized, and the majority of temporal air pollution tendencies are commonly stable throughout the duration covered by the research. Hence, mean air pollution may serve as a surrogate for long-term exposure. Using average levels of air pollution as an analysis estimate further demonstrates the validity of this method. In prospective research involving 78,830 Korean participants, scholars discovered a 42% increased PD risk among subjects exposed to the highest NO 2 quartile versus the lowest quartile. Our findings are consistent with these findings. Notably, that study did not find a correlation between PM 2.5 exposure and PD incidence. Similarly, Canadian prospective cohort research detected a correlation between NO 2 exposure and the incidence of PD. Our findings, however, contradict those of various other investigations. Zhu et al. determined that exposure to ambient PM 2.5, but not NO 2 or PM 10, for the long term, was related to PD development. These inconsistencies may be attributed to differences in study design and other factors, such as the number of PD outcomes, including or excluding other gaseous pollutants, and variations in the constituent factors in PM across different regions. Our study contributes new evidence to the epidemiological study of PD-associated atmospheric pollution. Our findings have consequences for policies and clinical tests, as variations in policies and personal behavior may aid in mitigating air pollution, which may lead to a decrease in PD.

### Clearing the smoke: what protects smokers from Parkinson's disease? [^29121a3b]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

More recently, the NIC-PD phase II trial has also been completed. In this double-blind study conducted across 24 clinical sites in the USA and Germany, 163 participants not yet taking or needing L-dopa or dopamine agonist therapy were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with either transdermal nicotine (maximum tolerated dose, up to 28 mg/day) or a transdermal placebo patch. The primary end point was change in aggregate UPDRS parts I-III score between baseline and 60 weeks (52 weeks treatment and 8 weeks washout). The study showed no benefit of nicotine, and in fact a trend was observed toward an accelerated decline in function in the nicotine group, with UPDRS parts I–III score increased 3.5 points in the placebo arm (N = 54) versus 6.0 points in the nicotine arm (N = 47, P = 0.056) over the 60 weeks. Secondary analysis of the same measure over the full treatment period but prior to washout (ie, over 52 weeks) on a larger portion of the cohort (N = 138) also showed greater worsening on nicotine compared to placebo (P = 0.010).

The failure of transdermal nicotine to show benefits in the NIC-PD trial warrants some reflection. One possible explanation is that smoking, for example on the basis of nicotine, reduces the risk of developing manifest PD but does not slow down its clinical course. Although this possibility is difficult to refute in its most general form, the trend toward more rapid clinical decline in the nicotine treatment arm suggests that nicotine exposure is, if anything, detrimental in PD. An alternative explanation of NIC-PD's outcome is that other molecular constituent(s) of cigarette smoke underlie the reduced risk of PD among smokers. To date, only a few smoke-associated components beyond nicotine have been nominated for this purpose.

Other Potential Mediators of Smoking's Inverse Risk of PD

A number of molecular mechanisms have also been proposed to underlie smoking's protective effects on PD risk. Prominent among these is the upregulation of several cytochrome p450 enzymes (CYPs) both peripherally and in the human brain, which, in principle, might enable more efficient detoxification of environmental exposures. While plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to test and will require more research.

Smoking's effects on the gut microbiome have also been hypothesized to alter the course of PD. This interesting hypothesis builds on a growing body of evidence supporting the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and the enteric nervous system in the development of α-synuclein pathology and PD. However, the specific changes in the gut microbiome that smoking causes are only beginning to be understood. Whether smoking-induced alterations in gut microflora composition can influence the spread of α-synuclein pathology, urate levels, or otherwise alter PD progression is intriguing but speculative and remains to be determined.

Non-causal Classes of Explanation Linking Smoking to PD Risk

Non-causal associations have the potential to contribute to the link between smoking and the risk of PD via reverse causation. For one, PD patients have been shown to have reduced addictive tendencies, including increased ease of quitting smoking, suggesting the possibility of a shared pathobiology between addiction and PD that could contribute to reduced smoking behavior. In addition to reverse causation, one can envision shared genetic determinants of smoking and PD resistance as one example of confounding. However, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies and related efforts to exclude reverse causality bias and address these issues have indicated a persistent protective effect of smoking, and smoking continuation, on PD risk, – that in some studies has been associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 – though these analyses are complex and have some caveats. In addition, the protective association of smoking with reduced PD risk appears to extend to passive smoking as well, – where addictive tendencies and genetic background would appear to be less relevant, but this has been somewhat controversial.

Mechanisms unrelated to components of tobacco smoke, such as reverse causation and the plausible alternative of sharing genetic determinants between smoking and resistance to PD, warrant further study and may prove informative. For example, studies of the genetic background of PD based on the inverse association with smoking might discover key mechanisms that can be exploited to develop novel therapies.

Synthesis of Evidence Quality

We have summarized studies evaluating associations between PD and pesticides, TCE, and air pollutants. Aspects of design may contribute to heterogeneous results in observational studies, including case ascertainment, duration and timing of exposure periods, and exposure assessment methods, as well as assumptions made in the analysis (Box 2). A relatively small proportion of observational studies have looked at specific exposures (ie, specific pesticides and/or co‐exposure) making it difficult to decipher the specific effect of a given exposure on PD risk. For example, the composition of the air pollution mixture, varying levels of different pollutants, and sources of pollution may lead to differences in the toxicity. In environmental epidemiology, the magnitude of exposure misclassification depends heavily on the exposure assessment methods. Other factors contributing to contradictory results are the variations in study design (eg, cohort, case–control, cross‐sectional), case definitions (PD vs. parkinsonism), and case ascertainment (medical record review vs. neurologist assessment vs. self‐report vs. cause of death) are potential sources of bias.

Box 2
Gaps in evidence for pesticides, trichloroethylene, and air pollution as risk factors for Parkinson's disease

Epidemiological Studies
Study design: Studies need to include lag times and detailed exposure assessment (route, type and measurement, long‐term averaging, cumulative dose, etc.), larger sample sizes, and prospective (cohort) designs. There is a need for accurate Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis and a sufficient lag‐time between exposure and outcome in the analysis of risk for PD development considering the duration of the prodromal stage of PD which can occur 20 years before motor symptoms. Additionally, most studies to date have been too reliant on self‐reported exposure data rather than quantitative exposure data collection using wearables.
Susceptible populations: Studies need to be designed to identify susceptible populations (eg, age, sex, occupation) as the exposure might have a different impact in different populations. Similarly, studies of gene–environment interactions (GxE) and co‐exposure need to be done in susceptible populations.
Diversity: More studies from low‐ and middle‐income countries are needed as exposure patterns differ across regions (ie, air pollution mixture differs, and exposure levels are higher, differences in types of pesticides and exposure levels, illegal use of pesticides).
Lack of studies: Few epidemiological studies exist for trichloroethylene (TCE) and air pollution in general.

### Prominent role of PM10 in the link between air pollution and incident Parkinson's disease [^1bcf3674]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the last decades, pollution – prominently air pollution – has represented a hotspot of investigation and received increasing interest from policy makers, in view of the notable burden that it implies for public health and welfare systems. Air pollution is defined as a combination of various compounds originating from different anthropogenic and biogenic emission sources, ranging from particulate matter (PM, with different components based on their aerodynamic diameter) to gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc.), and organic chemical compounds (e.g. hydrocarbons). Not only chronic exposure to air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular and respiratory diseases risk, but recent findings have supported a link between air pollution and neurological disorders, including dementia of different origins and Parkinson's disease (hereafter called PD). PD represents the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates accumulation in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which leads to progressive, irreversible loss of these neurons.

### Genetic susceptibility modifies the association of long-term air pollution exposure on Parkinson's disease [^4ad0caff]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study leveraged prospective data to confirm the detrimental, chronic impact of PM 10 and NO 2 on PD development. Significantly, we discovered that individuals with elevated genetic susceptibility and heightened exposure to air pollutants faced a markedly heightened risk of PD. Therefore, applying effective techniques for mitigating air pollution as soon as possible is crucial in order to protect individuals, particularly those having a high genetic sensitivity, from a higher risk of PD development.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^cdd44d56]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The present analyses addressed concerns that the inverse associations observed between tobacco smoking and PD risk were an artifact of chance or bias. Even if the pathogenesis of PD begins 2 decades before the first motor manifestation of illness, smoking habits at baseline in 1951 would have been largely unaffected by premanifest disease, as they were recorded on average 42 years before death from PD and approximately 35 years before death from other causes. Hence, the protective effects of current smoking for PD are unlikely to be due to reverse causality bias. Because smoking is positively associated with many other causes of death, analyses that take account of competing risks would reduce the estimated death rate of PD to a greater extent in smokers than in nonsmokers. This, in turn, would tend to strengthen the inverse association of smoking with the risk of PD rather than dilute it.

The mechanisms underlying the inverse association between tobacco smoking and PD are not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that nicotine may have neuroprotective properties and stimulate the release of dopamine, but effects of other components of tobacco cannot be excluded. Recent studies have identified pathologic proteins in the nasal cavity and gut, and other studies have linked PD with derangements in lysosomal storage function. Given the effect of tobacco smoking on nasal and gut mucosa, it is possible that the inverse association of smoking with PD may be mediated by such mechanisms. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with PD risk, and with particular smoking habitsand provided some support for a causal relation between smoking habits and PD, albeit such studies have not yet elucidated the underlying mechanism.

In all populations, the adverse effects of smoking on risks of vascular and respiratory diseases, neoplasms, and other noncommunicable diseases for which tobacco is the chief risk factor greatly exceed any protective effect of current tobacco smoking on the risk of PD. A trial of transdermal nicotine treatment to slow the progression of PD is currently underway (NCT01560754), but trials of primary prevention of PD are unlikely to be feasible. Nonetheless, the results of the present study suggest that efforts to characterize the biological mechanisms underlying the inverse association between tobacco and PD may be worthwhile and may contribute to a better etiologic understanding of PD.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^d612ffab]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of observational studies reported that current smoking was associated with a 60% lower risk of PD (relative risk [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38–0.47). However, there is substantial uncertainty about the causal relevance of this inverse association. A recent large case-control study, involving 1,808 PD cases and 1,876 controls in Denmark, suggested that the lower risk of PD in current smokers was an artifact of reverse causality bias, whereby early nonmotor signs of PD may include a reduced response to nicotine stimulation, prompting current smokers to quit smoking before the diagnosis of PD can be made. Most previous studies of smoking and the risk of PD have used a retrospective case-control study design (in which information on smoking habits was collected after the onset of disease), and such studies are particularly susceptible to the effects of reverse causality bias. Several prospective studies, have also reported inverse associations of smoking with PD, but few such studies have included a sufficient number of PD cases or involved an adequate duration of follow-up to exclude effects of reverse causality bias. The aims of the present report, involving analyses of the 65-year follow-up of 30,000 male British doctors, were to assess the risks of PD associated with tobacco smoking habits, amount of tobacco smoked, and effects of duration since quitting smoking among ex-smokers.

### Genetic susceptibility modifies the association of long-term air pollution exposure on Parkinson's disease [^6b761165]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Covariates

Covariates in this study included age (in years, continuous), sex (i.e. female, male), ethnicity (i.e. White or other), average total household income before tax (i.e. < £18,000, £18,000–£29,999, £30,000–£51,999, £52,000–£100,000, > £100,000), educational level (i.e. college or university degree, others), employment status (i.e. employed or retired, others), smoking status (i.e. current, previous, never), alcohol status (i.e. current, previous, never), and body mass index (BMI, in kg/m 2). The Townsend deprivation index was computed using the previous national census output regions where the participant's postcode was determined, with a greater score indicating a greater degree of deprivation socioeconomically. Participants' demographic attributes (such as birth date, sex, and ethnicity) were acquired from respective NHS Primary Care Trust registries prior to their entry at the assessment center. Touch-screen questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic data (mean overall household income before taxes, level of education, and occupational status) and behavioral information (alcohol and smoking status) at the baseline assessment center visit. Height and weight were assessed by nurses with sufficient training, and BMI was calculated by the quotient of weight (in kg) and height (in m 2). We considered the number of long-term morbidities, as this index is associated with lifespan. Detailed definitions can be found in Supplementary Table 8. We included PD-PRS, a genotyping array, and the first ten ancestry principal components as covariates. The missing data proportions for covariates were as follows: 14.4% for household income, less than 1% for employment status, alcohol status, smoking status, and the Townsend Deprivation Index. To address this, we conducted multiple imputations using the fully conditional specification (FCS) method to impute the missing covariate data –.

### Prominent role of PM10 in the link between air pollution and incident Parkinson's disease [^c5d706f4]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

While recent reviews and meta-analyses have reported growing evidence suggesting that chronic exposure to air pollution – especially to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) – is associated with an increased risk of both incident and prevalent neurodegenerative disorders –, these associations are often not replicated, especially for PD, and only partly concordant across the different studies, for several reasons. Among them, the heterogeneity of study settings probably represents one of the main hindrances to results concordance, with very scarce longitudinal studies carried out in large population cohorts (e.g. refs. –). Indeed, studies reported so far were mostly carried out within administrative cohorts (e.g. ref.), in case-control (e.g. refs. –) and geostatistical studies (e.g. ref.). Most of these analyses tested a handful of pollutants simultaneously, but only few analyzed them together with other potential factors influencing PD risk. Therefore, most of these studies often suffer from residual confounding bias due to scarce adjustment for other potential confounders of the association between air pollution and PD risk, like lifestyles and professional covariates. Other studies are mostly based on a case-control approach – due to the relatively low prevalence of PD (about 1% in the general population over 60 years of age)– and hence may suffer from reverse causality bias. Overall, studies on the environmental epidemiology of PD are quite scarce – and only few of them are based on deeply characterized longitudinal cohorts (e.g. refs. –). These may allow to disentangle the cluster of risk/protective factors for neurodegenerative disorders, including sociodemographic, lifestyles and professional factors.

The main aim of this study was to test the influence of air pollution on the incident risk of PD independent on other potential risk/protective factors. We did this in a general Italian population cohort, with a deep phenotypic assessment, by simultaneously analyzing several air pollutants, along with sociodemographic, lifestyle, and professional exposures, over a 12 years follow-up. We also tested potential mediation of pathways including circulating inflammation, cardiovascular, kidney function, lipid- and platelet-related biomarkers in the link identified, to provide hints on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD.

### Cigarette smoking and the incidence of Parkinson's disease in two prospective studies [^6760b53b]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

An inverse association between cigarette smoking and idiopathic Parkinson's disease has been reported in several retrospective studies, but prospective evidence is available only for men. We assessed the association between the incidence of Parkinson's disease and smoking in two large prospective cohort studies comprising men and women. New cases of Parkinson's disease were identified in the Nurses' Health Study for 1976–1996, and in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study for 1986–1996. Smoking history was assessed at baseline and updated on subsequent biennial questionnaires. In women, the age-adjusted rate ratios (95% confidence intervals) for Parkinson's disease relative to never-smokers were 0.7 (0.5, 1.0) for past smokers, and 0.4 (0.2, 0.7) for current smokers. In men, the age-adjusted rate ratios for Parkinson's disease relative to never-smokers were 0.5 (0.4, 0.7) for past smokers, and 0.3 (0.1, 0.8) for current smokers. In both cohorts, the strength of the association decreased with time since quitting (among past smokers), increased with number of cigarettes per day (among current smokers), and increased with pack-years of smoking. These prospective findings confirm that an inverse association between smoking and the incidence of Parkinson's disease exists in both men and women.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^25c20e1c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

We forecasted that the disparity in the age standardised prevalence of Parkinson's disease between men and women would widen, despite the global population having a tendency towards a balanced sex ratio. Sex differences in lifestyles, exposure rates to environmental risk factors, hormones, and the prevalence of metabolic diseases may contribute to the higher susceptibility of men to Parkinson's disease than women. We estimated that high-middle and middle Socio-demographic Index regions would experience a greater increase in the male-to-female ratio of age standardised prevalence between 2021 and 2050, suggesting that men may bear a disproportionate occupational exposure to risk factors. Moreover, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease among women declines when the proportion of female smokers increases, with the strength of this correlation being comparable to the trend observed for lung cancer. The upward trend in smoking rates among women since the early 20th century may have an important impact on the sex ratio of Parkinson's disease prevalence in the future. Sex imbalance in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease requires sex specific preventive strategy and interventions.

### Effect modification between genes and environment and Parkinson's disease risk [^ed24f7be]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non‐Genetic Modifiers of Idiopathic PD

For idiopathic PD, a combination of genetic and non‐genetic (or environmental) risk factors are believed to modify risk of disease. An important qualifying observation is that many so‐called environmental factors are, in part, genetically determined (eg, smoking behavior). Furthermore, because PD is a borderline "rare" outcome, studies of environmental factors in PD are often retrospective case–control studies, rather than prospective cohort studies. Observational studies, in particular case–control studies, are prone to various forms of bias, which makes causal inference challenging. Observed associations could be a consequence of reverse causation or confounding factors, and numerous life‐style factors are associated with PD. With these caveats, we will review non‐genetic factors associated with PD and evidence for gene–environment interactions.

Age and Sex

The main risk factor for PD is increasing age, such that incidence increases substantially after the age of 60 years. Male sex is a recognized risk factor and, on average, men are at 50% higher risk than women. The difference is likely not explained by common genetic variation on the autosomes because no sex‐specific genetic risk factors have been identified. However, two genome‐wide significant loci on the X‐chromosome have been identified, indicating that the X‐chromosome may contribute to PD risk in both sexes.

Lifestyle Factors

Smoking is well‐documented as showing an inverse association with subsequent PD. Inverse associations with future PD have also been observed for coffee and alcohol consumption, and the use of NSAIDs. Intake of dairy products and higher education have, on the other hand, been associated with an increased risk of PD. An inverse association between PD and moderate to high levels of physical exercise has been reported. Exercise also seems to have a positive impact on several symptoms occurring in PD.

### Interaction between traffic-related air pollution and parkinson disease polygenic risk score [^77b3b252]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this case-control study of gene-environment interactions, we found that long-term TRAP exposure was particularly harmful to individuals genetically susceptible to PD, although TRAP negatively impacts the brains of older adults in general. While genetic susceptibility was a relevant PD risk factor for a subset of the population, the widespread exposure to air pollution makes TRAP an important modifiable risk factor affecting large populations globally. Future research is needed to replicate these results and investigate the biological mechanisms explaining these statistical interactions.

### Environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease: a critical review and policy implications [^0d364354]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported to be the fastest growing neurological disorder worldwide in prevalence and deaths. The age‐standardized increase in prevalence was 60% between 1990 and 2021, leading to ~11.8 million PD cases globally and highlighting the importance of identifying modifiable risk factors of PD. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a technical brief outlining the global burden, treatment gaps, and crucial areas for action for PD. This report provided considerations for policy implementation and research, and included key actions for prevention and risk reduction to lessen the anticipated increase in the global burden of PD. The WHO technical brief, which was used in this review to narrow the focus on modifiable factors linked to PD, recommended reducing exposure to environmental factors associated with PD risk, including the need to "ban pesticides (eg, paraquat and chlorpyrifos) and chemicals (eg, trichloroethylene)" and to "accelerate action to reduce levels of and exposure to air pollution…"

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^eef6aff9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson disease (PD) is a degenerative disease that affects 2% of the population aged 70 years and older. The number of individuals with PD within the population is estimated to triple in the next 20 years. Several theories have been formulated to explain the progressive increase in the incidence of PD. Complex interactions among environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and known risk factors have been reported through the years as possible causes. Among environmental exposures, studies have suggested air pollution, in the form of aerosolized particulate matter with a diameter 2.5 µm or less (PM 2.5), is associated with increased risk of PD. The ultrafine particles (≤ 0.1 µm) contained within PM 2.5 may cross the blood brain barrier in humans, leading to inflammation, oxidative stress, and microglia activation, which are potential pathogenic mechanisms for the development of PD. At this time, there are no available national datasets on ultrafine particles contained in traffic pollution; however, ultrafine particles are traffic-related pollutants, along with nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), for which nationwide data exist. Additionally, previous studies have implicated NO 2 exposure as a PD risk factor. Thus, assessing the association of PM 2.5 and NO 2 with PD may help provide insight into the roles of different sources of air pollution in PD risk. In addition to potentially increasing the risk of developing PD, we hypothesize that air pollution exposure may also be associated with phenotypical manifestations and treatment outcomes. To our knowledge, no studies have explored the association between PM 2.5 exposure and clinical phenotypes of PD. For this reason, we conducted a population-based study using data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system to explore the association between PD and air pollution exposure. We also studied the association of air pollution exposure with patient mortality, different clinical characteristics, and presence of dyskinesia.

### Temporal relationship between cigarette smoking and risk of parkinson disease [^7d240447]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize further the relationship between smoking history and Parkinson disease (PD) risk by considering temporal and qualitative features of smoking exposure, including duration, average intensity, and recentness, as well as the relative importance of smoking during different periods of life.

Methods

We prospectively assessed incident PD from 1992 to 2001 among 79,977 women and 63,348 men participating in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, according to their cigarette smoking status and lifetime smoking histories.

Results

During follow-up, 413 participants had definite or probable PD confirmed by their treating neurologists or medical record review. Compared with never smokers, former smokers had a relative risk (RR) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.95) and current smokers had an RR of 0.27 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.56). On average, participants with more years smoked, more cigarettes per day, older age at quitting smoking, and fewer years since quitting smoking had lower PD risk. The relative risks and trends did not vary significantly by sex. The cumulative incidence of PD was lowest among participants who quit smoking at later ages. A 30% to 60% decreased risk of PD was apparent for smoking as early as 15 to 24 years before symptom onset, but not for smoking 25 or more years before onset.

Conclusions

The lower risk of Parkinson disease among current and former smokers varied with smoking duration, intensity, and recentness. The dependence of this association on the timing of smoking during life is consistent with a biologic effect.

### Prediagnostic blood metal levels and the risk of Parkinson's disease: a large European prospective cohort [^fa6d8566]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Around 90% of PD cases are related to a variety of lifestyle and environmental factors. Metals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD for many years. For the general population, metal exposures usually result from contaminated food or drinking water, cigarette smoking, air pollution, dental amalgam fillings, medication, and dietary supplements.

We recently evaluated the epidemiological evidence of associations between metal exposure and PD risk in a systematic review. We did not observe consistent associations with PD risk for most metals in meta‐analyses. Notably, the research quality was greatly limited because of retrospective exposure assessment. Metal levels in human biofluids were mostly measured after disease diagnosis, and results were therefore possibly affected by reverse causality because patients with PD tend to change smoking and diet habits when experiencing clinical manifestations.

To elucidate whether metal exposures represent genuine risk factors for PD, we assessed the association between PD risk and metal levels in blood samples collected several years before PD diagnosis, in a case‐control study nested in the EPIC4PD cohort, a large prospective European study. Meanwhile, possible confounding of smoking was also explored for the effect of metals on PD, because smoking was reported to be inversely associated with PD risk, and cigarette smoke contains various metal species.

### Association between lifetime cigarette smoking and lewy body accumulation [^92e4f5d5]. Brain Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Cigarette smoking has been associated repeatedly in observational studies with decreased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its relationship to the risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) is inconsistent. All of these studies have used clinical diagnoses of disease. We tested the hypothesis that lifetime cigarette use might be associated with reduced risk of neuropathologic changes of Lewy-related pathology (LRP) in multiple brain regions or with reduced risk of consensus neuropathologic changes of AD in a prospective community-based study of brain aging and dementia, the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. We observed that heavy lifetime cigarette smoking (> 50 pack years) was associated with significantly reduced relative risk (RR) for LRP, but not AD-type pathologic changes, after correcting for selection bias, and with significantly reduced frequency of LRP in the substantia nigra. These findings are the first of which we are aware to associate reduced LRP in human brain with any exposure, and substantiate observational studies that have associated cigarette smoking with reduced risk of PD. Although cigarette smoking is too toxic to suggest as a treatment, if confirmed, these findings may guide future therapeutic strategies that attempt to suppress LRP in human brain by other means.

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^a900fd75]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Sensitivity Analysis

Our analysis restricted to metropolitan core populations provided larger estimates compared with our primary analysis that included both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan populations (Table 1). In metropolitan populations, there was a positive association between PM 2.5 exposure and PD risk. Compared with the lowest quintile of PM 2.5 exposure, metropolitan populations had 10% to 23% increased odds of PD (second quintile: OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00–1.21; fifth quintile: OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11–1.35) (Table 2). However, our metropolitan-restricted analysis of dyskinesia (274 patients with PD; 37 dyskinesia events) found a lower risk compared with the analysis that included both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan populations. Specifically, we found that each 1-μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 was associated with 35% greater risk for dyskinesia (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06–1.72; P = 0.01) after accounting for patient demographics.

Smoking status

All individuals in the NHSP were required to complete self-report questionnaires consisting of questions including lifestyle factors. Smoking status was categorized, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, into the following three groups: current smoker (had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoking), ex-smoker (had smoked ≥ 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, did not currently smoke), and never smoker. In addition, pack years, duration, and intensity of smoking were also assessed to elucidate the association with all-cause mortality in PD. The pack-years smoked was measured by multiplying the number of packs smoked per day by the duration of smoking. Duration and intensity of smoking were measured based on responses to the following question: "How many years have you been smoking?" or "How many cigarettes have you been smoking per day?"

### Air pollution neurotoxicity in the adult brain: emerging concepts from experimental findings [^f6901362]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Epidemiological studies are associating elevated exposure to air pollution with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. In effect, air pollution accelerates many aging conditions that promote cognitive declines of aging. The underlying mechanisms and scale of effects remain largely unknown due to its chemical and physical complexity. Moreover, individual responses to air pollution are shaped by an intricate interface of pollutant mixture with the biological features of the exposed individual such as age, sex, genetic background, underlying diseases, and nutrition, but also other environmental factors including exposure to cigarette smoke. Resolving this complex manifold requires more detailed environmental and lifestyle data on diverse populations, and a systematic experimental approach. Our review aims to summarize the modest existing literature on experimental studies on air pollution neurotoxicity for adult rodents and identify key gaps and emerging challenges as we go forward. It is timely for experimental biologists to critically understand prior findings and develop innovative approaches to this urgent global problem. We hope to increase recognition of the importance of air pollution on brain aging by our colleagues in the neurosciences and in biomedical gerontology, and to support the immediate translation of the findings into public health guidelines for the regulation of remedial environmental factors that accelerate aging processes.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^40dfbe4a]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study of 30,000 male British doctors, which minimized the risk of reverse causality by having very prolonged follow-up, demonstrated an inverse association of current tobacco smoking with the risk of PD. Compared with never smoking, current tobacco smoking was associated with a 30% lower risk of PD using smoking habits at baseline and with a 40% lower risk using smoking habits that were updated at sequential surveys. The risk of PD was inversely related to the amount smoked, and the protective effect of smoking on the risk of PD was attenuated with increasing duration of time since quitting smoking.

The chief strengths of this study include the prolonged duration of follow-up, serial resurveys of smoking habits in each decade over 5 decades, and the consistently high response rates to each survey. Furthermore, the present study compared the effects of smoking on PD using 2 statistical models that took account of changes in smoking habits, reverse causality, and age at risk of PD, each of which yielded consistent results.

A limitation of this report was that the analyses were based on only 283 PD cases. Participants included only male British doctors, and the brief survey questionnaires that yielded high response rates did not collect data on the family history of PD, caffeine intake, or other covariates. However, results of the present study are consistent with those from previous Western population–based cohorts involving both men and women that also included extensive multivariate adjustment. Nonetheless, studies correcting for reverse causality bias in non–Western populations, with adjustment for other major risk factors for PD, could confirm the generalizability of these findings. In addition, cases with PD as the associated (secondary) cause of death were not considered. It is possible that the association of tobacco smoking with PD as the associated cause of death might differ from that of smoking with PD as the underlying cause of death, particularly if concomitant disease in the former was related to smoking. However, the concordant results of the present report with those of previous prospective studies that included incident nonfatal PD cases suggest that any bias from relying on fatal cases where PD was the underlying cause of death is likely to be small. Furthermore, cases were defined using ICD codes for PD, which may not always account for distinction between primary PD and parkinsonism secondary to an unknown cause or between different clinical subtypes of PD. However, cases with PD as the underlying cause of death on death certificates were more likely to have more severe disease and more definite diagnoses of PD.

When the analysis was stratified by smoking status, the estimated pollution effect on both cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality was strongest for never smokers vs former or current smokers. This analysis also controlled for education, marital status, BMI, and alcohol consumption. This analysis used improved variables to control for occupational exposures and incorporated. mortality risk associated with cigarette smoking has been well documented using the CPS-II cohort. 16 The risk imposed by exposure to fine particulate air pollution is obviously much smaller than the risk of cigarette smoking. Another risk factor that has been well documented using the CPS-II cohort data is body mass as measured by BMI. 30.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^d20185f9]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical methods

Two statistical models were used to investigate the associations of tobacco smoking with the risk of PD. First, a Cox proportional hazards model assessed the effect of smoking habits at baseline in 1951 (hereafter, the "baseline model"). Second, a Cox proportional hazards model assessed the effect of smoking habits updated periodically after each resurvey questionnaire (hereafter, the "updated model"). However, updates in smoking habits took effect in the model only 10 years after they were reported to ensure that changes in habits were not caused by underlying disease.

RRs of PD (RR, approximated by hazard ratios) were estimated for (1) current and ex-smokers relative to never smokers; (2) current smokers of 1–14 and 15 or more cigarette equivalents/day compared with never smokers; and (3) doctors not having smoked for 0–9 and 10 or more years compared with never smokers, after controlling for age at risk. RRs were adjusted for age at risk (i.e. current age during follow-up) rather than age at baseline to account for the increasing risk of PD associated with increasing age during the follow-up period. Group-specific CIs were calculated for RRs. Tests for trends in PD risk across categories of daily amount of tobacco smoked and time elapsed since cessation were conducted using likelihood ratio tests. Analyses were conducted using STATA 14.2 (StataCorp, USA), and figures were plotted using R 3.4.1 (R Foundation, Austria).

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^ef70b232]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The role of air pollution in risk and progression of Parkinson disease (PD) is unclear.

Objective

To assess whether air pollution is associated with increased risk of PD and clinical characteristics of PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based case-control study included patients with PD and matched controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project from 1998 to 2015. Data were analyzed from January to June 2024.

Exposures

Mean annual exposure to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less (PM2.5) from 1998 to 2015 and mean annual exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from 2000 to 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes of interest were PD risk, all-cause mortality, presence of tremor-predominant vs akinetic rigid PD, and development of dyskinesia. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, year of index, and urban vs rural residence.

Results

A total of 346 patients with PD (median [IQR] age 72 [65–80] years; 216 [62.4%] male) were identified and matched on age and sex with 4813 controls (median [IQR] age, 72 [65–79] years, 2946 [61.2%] male). Greater PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased PD risk, and this risk was greatest after restricting to populations within metropolitan cores (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11–1.35) for the top quintile of PM2.5 exposure compared with the bottom quintile. Greater NO2 exposure was also associated with increased PD risk when comparing the top quintile with the bottom quintile (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07–1.19). Air pollution was associated with a 36% increased risk of akinetic rigid presentation (OR per each 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02–1.80). In analyses among patients with PD only, higher PM2.5 exposure was associated with greater risk for developing dyskinesia (HR per 1-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17–1.73), as was increased NO2 exposure (HR per 1 μg/m3 increase in NO2, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06–1.19). There was no association between PM2.5 and all-cause mortality among patients with PD.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this case-control study of air pollution and PD, higher levels of PM2.5 and NO2 exposure were associated with increased risk of PD; also, higher levels of PM2.5 exposure were associated with increased risk of developing akinetic rigid PD and dyskinesia compared with patients with PD exposed to lower levels. These findings suggest that reducing air pollution may reduce risk of PD, modify the PD phenotype, and reduce risk of dyskinesia.

### Long-term exposure to multiple air pollutants and risk of Parkinson's disease: a population-based multipollutant model study [^5e8abc83]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2
The adjusted HR of PD for each IQR increment in air pollutant levels

In sensitivity analyses, we found that traffic-related pollutants NO2 and CO had a greater impact on younger individuals, males and those without pre-existing medical comorbidities. The associations between PM 2.5, PM 10 and PD risk were stronger in participants without chronic disorders. Specifically, PM 2.5 was more strongly associated with PD risk in individuals under 50 compared with those over 50 (online supplemental table 3).

### The effect of air pollution on hospitalizations with Parkinson's disease among Medicare beneficiaries nationwide [^4f6278fd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Findings from several systemic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that higher exposure to air pollution may be associated with a modest increase in PD risk –. The pooled estimates are similar across meta-analyses (consisting of mostly the same studies); for example, Kasdagli et al. found the pooled relative risk of PD to be 1.06 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.14) for particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM 2.5) (per 10 µg/m 3), 1.01 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.03) for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) (per 10 µg/m 3), and 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02) for ground ozone (O 3) (per 5 ppb). A more recent study among 293,888 UK Biobank participants on PD incidence found that a 1 µg/m 3 or ppb increase in 3-year moving average PM 2.5 and O 3 was associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.30) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.05), respectively; these estimates were similar across different causal inference analytic approaches. Given previous evidence that air pollution may play a role in developing PD, there has also been work leveraging data from the Medicare program, which offers near universal coverage for the elderly in the US, studying whether particulate air pollution may be associated with hospitalizations among those with PD and finding a statistically positive association.

### Environmental toxicants and Parkinson's disease: recent evidence, risks, and prevention opportunities [^bb3ac0f8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The global burden of Parkinson's disease is rising. Large-scale genetic studies have confirmed that extrinsic or environmental factors, rather than genetic predisposition, play a dominant role in its cause. Increasing evidence implicates three classes of toxicants-certain pesticides, the dry-cleaning chemicals trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, and air pollution-in the development of Parkinson's disease. These toxicants are widely prevalent, impair mitochondrial or lysosomal function, or both, and contribute to, if not cause, the disease. Parkinson's disease could be thus largely preventable. Uncertainties remain regarding the relevant doses, timing, and routes of exposure, the nature of genetic and environmental interactions, the effects of combined exposures, the role of the microbiome, and the identity of other environmental risks. Methodological limitations and structural challenges hinder our understanding. However, improved measurement of toxicant exposure in individuals and the environment, long-term prospective studies, increased funding for prevention, and policy changes can precipitate the fall of the burden of Parkinson's disease.

### How reducing oxygen-transport may lower the risk of developing Parkinson's disease [^9f20e995]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Smoking and Parkinson's disease

Tobacco smoking is a lifestyle factor that substantially increases morbidity and mortality. Yet, it enigmatically appears to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), reducing the pooled adjusted odds ratio of smokers vs. never-smokers to develop PD to 0.2–0.5. Smoking has been shown to significantly reduce the age of onset in a large cohort of American patients with idiopathic PDand seems to have a similar effect in some monogenic forms of PD.

The exceptionally detrimental consequences of smoking on health would indicate that selective mortality in smokers could explain this association since idiopathic PD usually occurs late in life. However, it turned out that potential delaying effects of smoking, selective mortality or other forms of reverse causation do not fully explain this association. The same is true for the hypotheses that (a) differences in dopaminergic circuits may account for a preference for smoking, while at the same time protecting from PD, (b) alterations in the dopaminergic system during disease progression may result in reduced smoking habits or (c) low-risk-taking personality traits may be a confounding factor explaining the effects of smoking on PD. Nevertheless, reverse causation can still not be completely excluded and neuroprotective effects of smoking remain to be conclusively demonstrated. PD symptoms such as hyposmia and/or changes in the reward circuits may influence smoking behavior (see hypothesis b), potentially facilitating cessation of smoking prior to the diagnosis of PD due to decreased enjoyment. Accordingly, it is possible that early-stage PD patients stop smoking more frequently than the general population, as recently discussed.

The potential causal relationship between smoking and PD has recently been extensively summarized. Nicotine has been considered the primary candidate mediating neuroprotection in smokers. However, this assumption has been refuted at least for continuous (as opposed to intermittent, like in smoking) nicotine uptake regarding disease progression in manifest PD in the NIC-PD phase II trial (NCT01560754). Several other compounds taken up during tobacco smoking like carbon monoxide (CO), monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors or cytochrome p450 enzymes have been proposed to reduce the risk to develop PD but their roles in PD require substantially more research.

### Prominent role of PM10 in the link between air pollution and incident Parkinson's disease [^323ebaee]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Air pollution has been associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD) risk, although this relationship remains unclear. We estimated yearly levels of exposure to ten air pollutants (period 2006–2018) in an Italian population cohort, the Moli-sani study (N = 24,325; ≥ 35 years; 51.9% women), and derived three principal components, testing their associations with incident PD risk over 23,841 participants (213 cases, median(IQR) follow-up 11.2(2.0) years). This revealed a statistically significant association of PC1 (explaining 38.2% of common variance, tagging PM10 levels), independent on sociodemographic, professional and lifestyles covariates (Hazard Ratio [95%CI] = 1.04[1.02–1.07]). The association was confirmed testing average PM10 levels during follow-up (18[13–24]% increase of PD risk per 1μg/m 3 increase of PM10). Among different circulating markers, lipoprotein a explained a significant proportion of this association (2.8[0.9; 8.4]%). These findings suggest PM10 as a target to lower PD risk at the population level and a potential implication of lipoprotein a in PD etiology.

### Interaction between traffic-related air pollution and parkinson disease polygenic risk score [^36ad1d10]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How are gene-environment interactions between the polygenic risk score (PRS) for Parkinson disease (PD) and long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) associated with PD risk?

Findings

In this case-control study with meta-analysis of 1600 cases and 1778 controls, higher PD-PRS and increased TRAP exposure were associated with increased PD risk, with those at high PRS and high TRAP exposure facing the greatest risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the combination of genetic susceptibility to PD and long-term exposure to TRAP contributes to the risk of developing PD, underscoring the need for further research to explore the underlying biological mechanisms.

### Risk and protective factors for Parkinson's disease: a study in Swedish twins [^d59fa8d3]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Many studies have shown a protective effect of cigarette smoking on Parkinson's disease. However, criticism has been raised concerning confounding by genetic factors. We investigated the associations between Parkinson's disease and smoking, alcohol, coffee, area of living, and education in a co-twin control study. Because twins are matched for genetic and familial environmental factors, this design controls for confounding by these factors. We also examined control subjects unrelated to cases. Exposure information was taken from questionnaires answered in the 1960s and 1970s. Parkinson's disease cases were identified through the Swedish Inpatient Discharge Register (IDR) and the Cause of Death Register. In the unrelated control subject comparison, 476 Parkinson's disease cases and 2,380 control subjects were included. In the co-twin control comparison, 415 same-sex twin pairs were included. There was an inverse association between smoking and Parkinson's disease using unrelated control subjects and co-twin control cases. There was no association between Parkinson's disease and alcohol, coffee, or area of living. High educational level was associated with Parkinson's disease in the unrelated control subject comparison but not in the co-twin control comparison. We confirm the protective effect of smoking on Parkinson's disease and establish that the association is only partially explained by genetic and familial environmental factors.

### Update in the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease [^41c4021f]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the past 18 months, several important studies on the epidemiology of Parkinson's disease have been published. In particular, large cohorts have identified sufficient incident patients with Parkinson's disease to study risk or protective factors of Parkinson's disease; one of the important recent events in the field is the publication of some of their findings.

Recent Findings

We will first review findings of descriptive studies on the frequency of the disease and its geographic or temporal distribution. We will then summarize the findings of analytical studies dealing with risk or protective factors in the fields of dietary and lifestyle factors (cigarette smoking, coffee and tea drinking, uric acid, dairy products), environmental exposures (pesticides, lead, manganese, welding), hormonal factors (oophorectomy), vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol level), pharmacoepidemiology (NSAIDs, statins), and familial aggregation.

Summary

Epidemiologic studies have consistently found that some exposures are inversely (e.g., cigarette smoking) or positively associated with Parkinson's disease (e.g., pesticides), while their findings are, at the present time, less consistent for other exposures (e.g. NSAIDs, vascular risk factors). Finally, recent studies have investigated new research fields (e.g., hormonal factors, uric acid, pharmacoepidemiology) and additional data need to be collected.

### Atypical cancer pattern in patients with Parkinson's disease [^3ce9469b]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this population-based study of more than 14 000 patients with a primary diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, we observed a statistically significant overall 42% decrease in the risk for cancer at sites related to tobacco smoking. The decrease was most pronounced for men and for the smoking-related sites of lung, larynx and urinary bladder, suggesting that the risk reduction was probably due to a low prevalence of smoking. Large prospective studies have uniformly shown that the incidence of Parkinson's disease is about 60% lower among current smokers and 40% lower among past smokers than among those who have never smoked, and that the magnitude of the risk reduction diminishes with time since quitting smoking. Similarly reduced risk estimates for Parkinson's disease linked with cigarette smoking were observed in large, well-conducted case–control studies. These findings led to the hypothesis that constituents of tobacco smoke can reduce or abolish the brain damage that triggers Parkinson's disease. This hypothesis of a true protective effect of tobacco smoke is further supported by the recent observation that the risk for the disease in both dizygotic and monozygotic twins is inversely associated with the life-long dose of cigarette smoke, measured in pack-years.

### Association between smoking and all-cause mortality in Parkinson's disease [^3b1f62fd]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Various lifestyle factors have been suggested to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Although some lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption or dietary habits, showed controversial results with PD development, smoking has shown a relatively consistent association with PD –. Many previous studies have shown that smoking is negatively associated with PD risk, and some studies have suggested an inverse dose-response association. Therefore, it has been suggested that cigarettes have neuroprotective effects in PD development, and several trials for the treatment of PD using ingredients of cigarettes such as nicotine have been performed.

On the other hand, there have been only a few studies on the association between smoking status and mortality in PD –. In a recent study in 2019, current smoking was not associated with mortality of PD, whereas former smoking was associated with increased mortality of PD. In this study, the authors evaluated the association between various lifestyle factors and PD progression and mortality; thus, detailed information on smoking status in PD was not described. Previous studies were mostly conducted in Western countries with a relatively small number of participants, and detailed information on PD participants according to smoking status was not sufficiently presented –.

The etiology of PD is multifactorial, including genetic and environmental factors. Although the main treatment of PD is pharmacotherapy, lifestyle factors could affect disease progression, and self-management by adopting a positive lifestyle would be beneficial for disease management –. The neuroprotective effect of smoking in PD development has been suggested in many previous studies; however, whether quitting or maintaining cigarette smoking is helpful for disease management in PD is still unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the association between smoking status and all-cause mortality in PD using a nationwide population-based cohort in Korea. The Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides a biannual National Health Screening Program (NHSP) to all beneficiaries, and smoking status was obtained from the NHSP questionnaire. Additionally, we performed a systematic review of relevant data to clarify the current evidence regarding the association between smoking and mortality in PD.

### Cigarette smoking and Parkinson's disease: a case-control study in a population characterized by a high prevalence of pesticide exposure [^43bccd92]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have been consistent in showing that cigarette smoking is inversely associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas pesticide use is positively associated with PD. However, the relationship between PD and cigarette smoking remains poorly understood. Our objective was to study the relationship between cigarette smoking and PD in a population characterized by a high prevalence of pesticide exposure. This case-control study was carried out among subjects enrolled in the Mutualite Sociale Agricole, the French health insurance organization for workers connected to the agricultural world. We included 247 cases and 676 controls matched on age, sex, and region of residency. Information on smoking was obtained through in-person interviews. Pesticide exposure was assessed using a case-by-case expert evaluation procedure. We found an inverse relationship between ever cigarette smoking and PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4–0.9). The strength of this association increased with the number of pack-years. This relationship was present even when smoking was considered as long as 40 years before PD onset. An inverse association was also present among subjects professionally exposed to pesticides (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3–0.8) and was independent of the duration of exposure among men. We confirm the inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD in a population characterized by a high prevalence of professional pesticide exposure. The relationship between PD and cigarette smoking was not significantly modified or confounded by exposure to pesticides.

### Projections for prevalence of Parkinson's disease and its driving factors in 195 countries and territories to 2050: modelling study of global burden of disease study 2021 [^233b93a0]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Changes in prevalence unrelated to demographics are the second most important contributor to the increase in the number of Parkinson's disease cases in countries with high, high-middle, and middle Socio-demographic Index after 2021. The prevalence of risk factors for Parkinson's disease, including but not limited to ageing, environmental agents, climate change, unhealthy lifestyle, metabolic diseases, and dietary factors, is on the rise in the course of industrialisation and urbanisation. Many epidemiological investigations in recent decades have suggested that environmental factors contribute to the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Associations between pesticide and onset of Parkinson's disease have been found, and some evidence indicates a dose-response relation. Biological studies suggested that pesticides and solvents contaminating food and water further damage dopaminergic neurons. Reducing the intake of harmful chemicals in food may significantly decrease the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Exposure to air pollution (PM 2.5, O 3, and NO 2) is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease; moreover, almost all of the global population (99%) is exposed to air pollution. The chain reaction of environmental pollution and global warming may affect the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. If we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we have done in the past decades, the world will warm even further and the prevalence of Parkinson's disease will be driven to a higher level, as it is positively correlated with climate warming. For these environmental risk factors, particularly exposure to pesticides, a convergence of basic science and epidemiological evidence provides evidence for a causal role in Parkinson's disease; furthermore, these risk factors are mainly preventable. Therefore, interventions that decrease the prevalence of environmental risk factors should have significant potential for mitigating the increased trend of prevalence and burden of Parkinson's disease.

### Neuropathology of cigarette smoking [^c4efc9a1]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

It is well established that cigarette smoking is hazardous to health and is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. However, its impact on the brain, whether it be from prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease, is still not very clear. Neuroimaging and neuropathological investigations suggest that there are heterogeneous effects of cigarette smoking on the brain. On the one hand, it is quite clear that cigarette smoking causes damage to endothelial cells, resulting in increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. On the other hand, it seems to be associated with different Alzheimer's pathologies in post-mortem brains and experimental models, despite the fact that epidemiological studies clearly indicate a positive correlation between cigarette smoking and increased risk for AD. Interestingly, cigarette smoking appears to be associated with reduced Parkinson's pathology in post-mortem brains. However, although nicotine in cigarettes may have some neuroprotective actions, the effects of all the other toxic compounds in cigarettes cannot be ignored. It is, therefore, our aim to summarize what is known about the neuropathology of cigarette smoking and, in particular, its implications for neurodegenerative diseases.

### Inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease: results from the framingham heart study [^cbfd4735]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

We found that survivors of smoking related cancer had a substantially lower risk of Alzheimer's disease than survivors of non-smoking related cancer — a pattern similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. In a recent meta-analysis of 107 598 patients with Parkinson's disease, the aggregate relative risk was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.83) for any cancer, 0.61 (0.58 to 0.65) for smoking related cancers, and 0.80 (0.77 to 0.84) for non-smoking related cancers. A lower rate of smoking related cancers might be expected in patients with Parkinson's disease owing to its well established negative association with smoking, but, in the case of Alzheimer's disease, the association with smoking was strongly positive. In our analysis, higher mortality among those with smoking related cancer did not explain the lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Perhaps characteristics that allow someone to survive a smoking related cancer are particularly protective against neurodegeneration. That Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are associated with the same unusual pattern for cancer suggests the presence of as yet uncovered biological connections between neurodegeneration and carcinogenesis.

### Genetic susceptibility modifies the association of long-term air pollution exposure on Parkinson's disease [^64ff47d8]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

For this research, we investigated the link between air pollutants and the incidence of PD in the UK Biobank using PRS. Our results signify that increased air pollution and PD-PRS are related to an increased PD risk, with a substantial interaction between air pollution and PRS categories observed in both joint and stratified analyses. It implies a gene-environment interaction in the occurrence of PD. In addition, individuals with lower levels of air pollution had a significantly lower risk of PD occurrence across all PRS tertiles. Therefore, our findings imply that reducing air pollution levels would provide a potential benefit for individuals who are genetically predisposed to PD.

Our study has multiple strengths. To the best of our knowledge, our investigation represents the initial exploration of the impact of genetic susceptibility on the correlation between exposure to air pollution and the likelihood of developing PD. Our outcomes are more credible due to the magnitude of our sample and the length of our follow-up. In addition, the data provided by the UK Biobank enabled us to consider many confounding factors, mainly genetic susceptibility to PD. Nevertheless, our study has some limitations. As one limitation, certain risk factors for PD, including exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and other neurotoxins that may result in motor and non-motor PD symptoms, could be excluded in the statistical modeling due to insufficient pertinent data from the UK Biobank. Another limitation is that the spectrum of air pollutants was insufficient to detect exposure to carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Moving forward, other air contaminants may need to be incorporated. Thirdly, exposure evaluation according to a specific address did not rule out exposure misclassification when considering outdoor tasks. Additional research with more precise evaluations is vital to corroborate our outcomes. Fourthly, we must recognize that covariate influence cannot be ruled out, singular contaminant associations may not exhibit independence, and our findings must be cautiously interpreted. Fifth, future global genomic studies may identify additional variants associated with PD, and incorporating more SNPs into future research may enhance genetic risk evaluation. Even though we controlled for many possible confounders in the analyses, unmeasured or unknown variables can still be residual confounders. Additionally, this study differentiated individuals into low, medium, and high-risk groups based on PRS calculated from multiple SNP loci associated with Parkinson's disease. While this method is commonly employed in previous literature –, it has limitations as it does not distinguish populations based on specific risk loci. Future research could consider stratifying populations using information from specific loci to validate the findings more comprehensively. Furthermore, since the majority of the subjects in our study were of European descent, our results concerning the association between exposure to air pollution, genetic sensitivity to cataracts, and other populations should be interpreted with caution.

Environmental risk factors

There is a large body of evidence demonstrating a small but significantly elevated risk of PD associated with a number of environmental risk factors (see figure 2). Some of the strongest environmental evidence exists for exposure to pesticide and proxies for this, including farming occupation, rural living and drinking well water. Specific implicated pesticides include rotenone and paraquat (structurally related to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which has also been linked to parkinsonism in users of illicit drugs), and both these chemicals are used to create animal models of PD. Other potential toxins include heavy metals such as manganese, with exposure arising through occupations such as welding and in recreational ephedrone users. It seems unlikely that environmental toxins play more than a minor role in PD risk overall, with meta-analysis suggesting ORs in the region of 1.2–2.0.

Pooled observational study data also implicates head injury as a minor but significant risk factor for PD. There is increasing evidence that individuals who suffer recurrent head injury, particularly sportspersons such as boxers, jockeys, American football and rugby players, are at risk of developing a range of degenerative neurological conditions including parkinsonism, dementia and motor neuron disease, although pathological examination of these subjects tends to reveal alternative pathology than that typically associated with PD.

By stark contrast with other common chronic diseases, there exist a number of intriguing but consistent negative associations with PD and lifestyle factors such as smoking, caffeine and alcohol. Additionally, there are a number of medications for which negative associations with PD have been reported in observational studies, including calcium channel blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and statins. Some of these are currently the focus of clinical trials examining their potential use in PD.

### Air pollution and parkinson disease in a population-based study [^61e9c09e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

It is possible that PM 2.5 may have varied effects on the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease based on its composition. A multicountry study in Europe confirmed the importance of considering the subcomponents of PM 2.5. In our study, we were unable to explore broader ranges of PM 2.5, since the range of PM 2.5 in our study area (parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa) was relatively small compared with the range of PM 2.5 observed nationwide. However, a 2022 studyidentified notable geographical variation of PM 2.5 subcomponents in the Midwest, finding a north-south gradient in PM 2.5, nitrite, and organic carbon composition, as well as an inverse gradient of sulfate composition. Additionally, the detected association with NO 2 and the larger effect size observed in metropolitan core populations suggest the possibility that the PM 2.5 association may be driven by traffic-related particulates. Unfortunately, without complete information of prior toxic exposures, we are limited in our ability to draw causal conclusions.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^ebd653a1]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mean daily amount smoked and the risk of PD

Analysis of the smoking habits of current smokers suggested that there was an inverse dose-response relationship between the daily amount of tobacco smoked and the risk of PD. Adjusting for age at risk, the association between daily amount smoked and PD risk was statistically significant in both the baseline (p = 0.0006) and updated (p = 0.002) models (figure 3).

Figure 3
Association between daily amount of tobacco smoked and the risk of PD

CI, group-specific confidence interval. The smoking status at resurveys was updated at each resurvey, with a 10-year time lag to minimize reverse causality bias. Cigarettes per day or equivalent in pipe and cigar tobacco: 1 cigar = 5 cigarettes, 1 small cigar = 3 cigarettes, 1 very small cigar = 1 cigarette, and 1 oz of tobacco per week = 4 cigarettes per day. Tests for trend in PD risk across categories of daily amount of tobacco smoked. Values are plotted at the daily amount smoked in each category, with an offset of 0.5 cigarette per day (updated consumption) or 1 cigarette/ per day (1951 consumption) to avoid overlap. The red and blue lines were the best fits across the data points. PD = Parkinson disease.

Duration since quitting smoking and the risk of PD

The risks of PD were estimated for ex- vs never smokers, and in the updated model, by the duration of time elapsed since quitting smoking (10 or more vs 0–9 years ago). Controlling for age at risk, duration since quitting was also associated with the risk of PD (figure 2). Compared with never smokers, those who quit smoking 10 or more years ago had a 14% lower risk of PD (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70–1.06), whereas those who quit 0–9 years ago had a 29% lower risk (RR 0.71; CI 0.54–0.93).

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^16034560]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Smoking status and the risk of PD

From 1951 to 2016, participants were followed on average for 35 years (range: 11–65 years). Excluding the first 10 years of follow-up, 25,379 deaths were reported during 743,920 person-years. Among these, 283 (1.1%) had PD listed as their underlying cause of death. After classification of smoking habits at baseline, the crude death rate from PD was lower in current vs nonsmokers (30 vs 46 per 100,000 person-years; unadjusted RR reduction of 34.7%). Doctors who died of PD were followed on average for 42 years and had a mean age at death of 82 years, whereas those who died of causes other than PD were followed on average for 35 years and had a mean age of death of 77 years.

Current tobacco smoking was inversely associated with the risk of PD in both the baseline (p = 0.006) and updated (p = 0.003) models (figure 2). In the baseline model, doctors who reported current tobacco smoking in 1951 had about a 30% lower risk of PD compared with those who had never smoked on recruitment into the study (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.84). In the updated model, current smokers had a 40% lower risk of PD compared with never smokers (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.46–0.77).

Numerous studies suggest that environmental exposures play a critical role in Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, and large, population-based studies have the potential to advance substantially the identification of novel PD risk factors. We sought to study the nationwide geographic relationship between PD and air pollution, specifically PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 micrometers), using population-based US Medicare data.

Methods

We conducted a population-based geographic study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66–90 years geocoded to US counties and zip+4. We used integrated nested Laplace approximation to create age, sex, race, smoking, and health care utilization–adjusted relative risk (RR) at the county level for geographic analyses with PM 2.5 as the primary exposure of interest. We also performed an individual-level analysis using logistic regression with cases and controls with zip+4 centroid PM 2.5. We adjusted a priori for the same covariates and verified no confounding by indicators of socioeconomic status or neurologist density.

Results

Among 21,639,190 Medicare beneficiaries, 89,390 had incident PD in 2009. There was a nationwide association between average annual PM 2.5 and PD risk whereby the RR of PD was 56% (95% CI 47%–66%) greater for those exposed to the median level of PM 2.5 compared with those with the lowest level of PM 2.5. This association was linear up to 13 μg/m 3 corresponding to a 4.2% (95% CI 3.7%–4.8%) greater risk of PD for each additional μg/m 3 of PM 2.5 (p trend < 0.0001). We identified a region with high PD risk in the Mississippi-Ohio River Valley, where the risk of PD was 19% greater compared with the rest of the nation. The strongest association between PM 2.5 and PD was found in a region with low PD risk in the Rocky Mountains. PM 2.5 was also associated with PD in the Mississippi-Ohio River Valley where the association was relatively weaker, due to a possible ceiling effect at average annual PM 2.5 levels of ∼13 μg/m 3.

Discussion

State-of-the-art geographic analytic techniques revealed an association between PM 2.5 and PD that varied in strength by region. A deeper investigation into the specific subfractions of PM 2.5 may provide additional insight into regional variability in the PM 2.5 -PD association.

### The role of traffic-related air pollution on neurodegenerative diseases in older people: an epidemiological perspective [^e0cdfe24]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Traffic-related air pollution is ubiquitous and almost impossible to avoid. It is important to understand the role that traffic-related air pollution may play in neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, particularly among older populations and at-risk groups. There is a growing interest in this area among the environmental epidemiology literature and the body of evidence identifying this role is emerging and strengthening. This review focuses on the principal components of traffic-related air pollutants (particulate matter and nitrogen oxides) and the epidemiological evidence of their contribution to common neurodegenerative diseases. All studies reported are currently observational in nature and there are mixed findings depending on the study design, assessment of traffic-related air pollutant levels, assessment of the neurodegenerative disease outcome, time period of assessment, and the role of confounding environmental factors and at-risk genetic characteristics. All current studies have been conducted in income-rich countries where traffic-related air pollution levels are relatively low. Additional longer-term studies are needed to confirm the levels of risk, consider other contributing environmental factors and to be conducted in settings where air pollution exposures are higher and at-risk populations reside and work. Better understanding of these relationships will help inform the development of preventive measures and reduce chronic cognitive and physical health burdens (cost, quality of life) at personal and societal levels.

### Are men at greater risk for Parkinson's disease than women? [^5dd36fe8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease seems to occur more commonly in men than women based primarily on studies of death rates and prevalence. In recent years, several population based incidence studies of Parkinson's disease that included sex data have been conducted in a variety of populations around the world. To investigate whether these incidence studies suggest an increased risk of Parkinson's disease in men, a meta-analysis was performed of the differences in incidence of Parkinson's disease between men and women reported in seven studies that met the inclusion criteria. A significantly higher incidence rate of Parkinson's disease was found among men with the relative risk being 1.5 times greater in men than women. Possible reasons for this increased risk of Parkinson's disease in men are toxicant exposure, head trauma, neuroprotection by oestrogen, mitochondrial dysfunction, or X linkage of genetic risk factors.

### Tobacco smoking and the risk of parkinson disease: a 65-year follow-up of 30, 000 male British doctors [^91fbdfab]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents

No relevant research ethics committees existed in 1951, when the British Doctors Study was designed and baseline questionnaires were sent. Doctors who chose to answer the first questionnaire were informed by investigators of the implications and methods of the study. Participants could choose to withdraw at any stage during follow-up, and all data were kept confidential.

Population

In 1951, all doctors who were registered with the British Medical Association and who were living in the United Kingdom were sent a postal questionnaire. Among 59,600 doctors contacted, two-thirds replied, and 34,439 (58.8%) male doctors provided complete data on their smoking habits. Surviving participants were resurveyed about changes in their smoking habits on 6 successive occasions between 1958 and 1998. Cause-specific mortality was monitored until November 30, 2016.

Smoking habits

Information on smoking habits for each participant was collected using 7 self-completed postal questionnaires. Doctors classified themselves as current tobacco smokers, ex-smokers, or never smokers. Current smokers were further questioned about the age at which they started smoking, the amount of tobacco they smoked daily, and the type of tobacco smoked (cigarette or pipe). Ex-smokers were asked the same questions about the time at which they last smoked and were asked about quitting smoking. Never smokers were those doctors having never consumed as much as 1 cigarette per day, or the equivalent in pipe or cigar tobacco, for as long as 1 year. Resurvey questionnaires presented participants with their answers to the previous questionnaire and asked whether their habits had changed. Questionnaires were not sent to participants who had previously refused to answer questions, those who asked not to be contacted again, or those who had been struck off the medical register. After reminders, response rates to the 6 resurveys varied between 94% and 98%.

Cigarette, pipe, and cigar smokers were combined as tobacco smokers for all analyses. No exclusions were made on the basis of missing data. Nonresponders to a resurvey had their smoking habits carried forward from the most recent available survey. Tobacco smoking habits included classification of smoking status (current, ex-, and never smoker), average number of cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in pipe or cigar tobacco (hereafter referred to as "cigarette equivalents/day"), and time since last smoked defined prospectively from recruitment (smoke-free years before 1951 were not counted).

### Mendelian randomization-the key to understanding aspects of Parkinson's disease causation? [^91dcbeae]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Parkinson's disease has multiple determinants and is associated with a wide range of exposures that appear to modify risk in traditional observational studies, including numerous lifestyle and environmental factors. Across other fields of medicine, Mendelian randomization has emerged as a powerful method to examine whether associations between exposures and disease outcomes are causal. Here we discuss the concept of Mendelian randomization, its potential relevance to Parkinson's disease, and suggest avenues through which the method could be employed to further understanding of the causal basis of Parkinson's disease. © 2015 The Authors.

### Interaction between traffic-related air pollution and parkinson disease polygenic risk score [^27c6be7d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorders worldwide, extending beyond population aging. While monogenic forms of PD, caused by mutations in a single gene, are rare (3%-5% of patients), genetic risk variants at multiple loci contribute to 16% to 36% of heritable risk. The increasing prevalence and incidence of PD underscores the importance of exploring environmental risk factors in genetically susceptible individuals, and gene-environment interactions may provide insights into PD mechanisms.

Long-term exposure to a mixture of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), typically represented by carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and nitrogen oxide (NO x) levels, has been associated with an increased PD risk. Proposed mechanisms include neuronal toxic effects, systemic and central nervous system inflammation, and alterations in gut physiology and the microbiome. However, most prior studies have been limited by short exposure or follow-up periods (≤ 5 years) and insufficient exposure contrasts, unlike recent work that incorporates longer exposure periods. Since PD prodromal symptoms develop decades before clinical diagnosis, long-term TRAP exposure may contribute to disease progression or accelerate an already activated disease process.

Studies exploring gene-environment interactions in PD are limited, mostly relying on a single candidate gene approach. Findings from these studies have often not been replicated, and single genetic variants may not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of genetic susceptibility. The polygenic risk score (PRS), which aggregates single-nucleotide variants (SNVs; formerly single-nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with PD in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), has been shown to be associated with age at onsetand cognitive and/or motor progression in PD. By using the PRS, we can incorporate multilocus genotypic variability and investigate gene-environment interactions with TRAP with enhanced statistical power.

A positive association has previously been reported between long-term TRAP exposure and PD risk in central Californiaand Denmark. In the present study, we assess the interactions and joint effects of long-term TRAP exposure and genetic predisposition with PD risk using meta-analytical approaches to enhance statistical power while accounting for differences in environmental and genetic context. We hypothesize that TRAP interacts with the PRS, potentially modifying PD risk.

### Β-adrenoreceptors and the risk of Parkinson's disease [^9b8414f0]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

β-adrenoceptors are widely expressed in different human organs, mediate important body functions and are targeted by medications for various diseases (such as coronary heart disease and heart attack) and many β-adrenoceptor acting drugs are listed on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. β-adrenoceptor antagonists are used by billions of patients with neurological disorders, primarily for the treatment of migraine and action tremor (mainly essential tremor), worldwide.

Recent Developments

An observational study reported a link between the chronic use of the β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, while the chronic use of the β-adrenoceptor agonists was associated with a decreased risk. Further support of this association was provided by a dose-dependent decrease in the risk of Parkinson's disease with chronic β-adrenoceptor agonist (eg, salbutamol) use, and by functional data indicating a possible underlying molecular mechanism. Five additional epidemiological studies have examined the modulation of the risk of Parkinson's disease as a result of the use of β-adrenoceptor-acting drugs in different populations. Overall, similar estimates but different interpretations of the associations were provided. Several findings suggest that the increase in risk of Parkinson's disease associated with β-adrenoceptor antagonists use can be explained by reverse causation because prodromal Parkinson's disease is often associated with non-specific action tremor, which is usually treated with propranolol. The lower risk of Parkinson's disease seen in patients receiving β-adrenoceptor agonists is likely to be indirectly mediated by smoking because smoking has a strong inverse association with Parkinson's disease (people that smoke have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease). Smoking also causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is treated with β-adrenoceptor-agonist medications. Even if causal, the effect of β-adrenoceptor antagonists on the risk of Parkinson's disease would be small compared with other Parkinson's disease risk factors and would be similar to the risk evoked by pesticide exposure. The estimated risk of Parkinson's disease because of β-adrenoceptor antagonists use corresponds to one case in 10000 patients after 5 years of propranolol use, and would be considered a very rare adverse effect. Thus, not using β-adrenoceptor antagonists would severely harm patients with recommended indications, such as heart disease or migraine. Similarly, 50000 people would have to be treated for 5 years with salbutamol to prevent Parkinson's disease in one patient, suggesting that primary preventive therapy studies on disease modification are not warranted. WHERE NEXT? Epidemiological evidence for a causal relationship between use of β2-adrenoceptor antagonists and the increased risk of Parkinson's disease is weak, with other explanations for the association being more probable. Future observational studies are warranted to clarify this association. However, given the very low risk associated with propranolol, most clinicians are unlikely to change their treatment approach.

### Meta-analysis of early nonmotor features and risk factors for parkinson disease [^e978eb52]. Annals of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) has a prevalence of approximately 1% in individuals aged > 65 years.–The cause is unknown, but many individual risk factors for subsequent PD have been suggested. In addition, several early nonmotor features have been identified that precede the diagnosis of PD, sometimes by several years.–In the past 10 years, there have been a small number of meta-analyses addressing risk factors for subsequent PD, including smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).–No review has comprehensively assessed predictive risk factors for later diagnosis of PD. Here we report the largest and most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to date, which uses an extensive search of observational studies to calculate effect sizes of multiple risk factors for PD.

### Linking environmental risk factors with epigenetic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease [^e7f9ecf4]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Exposures and environmental risk factors reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease.

Other environmental factors are associated with an increase in PD risk. Studies suggest exposure to chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides and solvents are implicated in PD. To date, pesticides and herbicides have been more widely researched than other exposures, prompted by structural similarities of the herbicide paraquatand pesticide rotenoneto the known parkinsonism-causing metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP +). Although rural living and agricultural jobs have been touted as significant risk factors for developing PD, this appears to be chiefly due to increased exposure to pesticides. Living in urban areas with high levels of air pollution has also been linked to an increased risk of developing PD. Tanner et al. reported that the risk of parkinsonism increased with the use of pesticides including rotenone, dieldrin and paraquat, a finding consistently reported by several studies. Welders and people in the mining industry are also thought to be at increased risk of developing PD. Supporting this, studies have shown a higher incidence of PD in people exposed to heavy metals. Gorell et al. reported an increased risk of PD in those exposed to copper, manganese and lead. For example, workers in the top quartile for chronic occupational exposure to lead had a twofold risk of developing PD compared to those in the bottom quartile. However, there is conflicting evidence disputing these claims. Occupations involving exposure to solvents, such as trichloroethylene (TCE), have also been linked with an increased risk of developing PD. Contradicting this, a population-based case–control study showed no correlation between solvent exposure and PD, although it should be noted that, for all mentioned studies, cohorts were small and recall bias (i.e. of duration and concentration of exposure) could skew data. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been investigated in relation to PD. Both severe head trauma and mild TBI, i.e. with concussion, significantly increased the risk of developing PD. Other reported positive associations with PD risk include consumption of dairy products, use of ß-blockers, and diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Reviews by De Miranda et al.and Dorsey et al.offer comprehensive insights into the importance of investigating environmental exposures in Parkinson's disease (PD).

### Association between use of any of the drugs prescribed in Norway and the subsequent risk of parkinson disease: a drug-wide association study [^dd84c9a0]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Reverse causality is less likely for the drug classes that were associated with a reduced risk of PD, as treatment indications (conditions or symptoms) for these drugs would have to occur less frequently among individuals with prodromal PD compared with the general population to explain the associations.

Still, the indication for some of these drug groups could be related to known risk factors, such as smoking, which consistently has been associated with a lower risk of PD, although the underlying pathobiological mechanism is unknown and clinical trials with nicotine failed. Drugs used for nicotine dependency represent the largest group within the N07 class (other nervous system drugs) probably explaining the association with reduced PD risk for this class.

The drugs for obstructive airway diseases (R03, including β2-agonists) were shown to be related to reduced PD risk in newly published studies on French national health dataand Finnish health data. Specifically, β2-agonists have been previously investigated for a role in PD. Mechanistically, selective β2AR activation suppresses the degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons, prevents loss of striatal dopamine, and rescues movements in multiple rodent models of PD. Molecularly, β2 agonists reduce α-synuclein expression, and microglial activation. Epidemiologically, the significant association between β2-agonists and the risk of PD was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. However, there remains considerable controversy regarding the interpretation of the epidemiologic association (for discussion, see-). Notably, the R03 drug class includes also other treatments for chronic obstructive lung disease where smoking is a major risk factor, and this study design does not allow to shed light on the role of this possible confounding. For example, Hopfner et al.found inconsistent dose-response and exposure-time relationships between β2 agonists and risk, and a recent studydid not support an association. By contrast, the only study directly adjusting for smoking (not just chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) found a significant association between β2 agonists and reduced PD risk, and a follow-up study from Norway reports that after the exclusion of patients with COPD, corticosteroids and anticholinergics were no longer inversely associated with PD risk, whereas β2AR agonists remained associated.

### Smoking duration, intensity, and risk of parkinson disease [^ee916860]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relative importance of smoking duration vs intensity in reducing the risk of Parkinson disease (PD).

Methods

The study included 305,468 participants of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health cohort, of whom 1,662 had a PD diagnosis after 1995. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals from multivariate logistic regression models.

Results

Compared with never smokers, the multivariate ORs were 0.78 for past smokers and 0.56 for current smokers. Among past smokers, a monotonic trend toward lower PD risk was observed for all indicators of more smoking. Stratified analyses indicated that smoking duration was associated with lower PD risk within fixed intensities of smoking. For example, compared with never smokers, the ORs among past smokers who smoked > 20 cigarettes/day were 0.96 for 1–9 years of smoking, 0.78 for 10–19 years, 0.64 for 20–29 years, and 0.59 for 30 years or more (p for trend = 0.001). In contrast, at fixed duration, the typical number of cigarettes smoked per day in general was not related to PD risk. Close examination of smoking behaviors in early life showed that patients with PD were less likely to be smokers at each age period, but if they smoked, they smoked similar numbers of cigarettes per day as individuals without PD.

Conclusions

This large study suggests that long-term smoking is more important than smoking intensity in the smoking-Parkinson disease relationship.

### Environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease: a critical review and policy implications [^66e44e2c]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

To investigate causal relationships in epidemiology, use of the BH criteria is a well‐recognized approach. However, the BH criteria were never designed to be an exhaustive checklist, and absolute fulfilment of all criteria is not a prerequisite for causation to be concluded. Here, we use the criteria to help assess whether an association between the variable of interest (eg, pesticides) and the outcome (PD) is likely to be causal rather than merely correlated (Table 3). In general, the evidence for a relationship between pesticide exposure and PD according to the BH criteria is clear. Multiple epidemiological studies exist, both case–control and cohort studies, along with animal studies that support a link between pesticides and PD. However, there is a lack of studies with supporting evidence for criteria relating to, for example, specificity, temporality, and biological gradient for many specific pesticides (ie, maneb and glyphosate).

### Influence of current and previous smoking on current phenotype in Parkinson's disease [^4a1c9454]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although an inverse correlation between smoking and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been reported, research into the effect of smoking on current clinical progression remains limited for PD patients. Elucidation of a specific PD population who would benefit from smoking is challenging.

Methods

We evaluated 110 consecutive PD patients (mean age; 71.0 ± 8.0 years) at a single neurology clinic between 2010 and 2018. The association with smoking status was evaluated in sex- and age-matched controls (non-PD). This study assessed the impact of previous smoking exposure on the outcome of current PD-related parameters, along with any confounders, in addition to assessing fluctuation of parkinsonism induced by smoking exposure.

Results

The current smoking rate was significantly lower in PD versus non-PD (5.5% vs. 15.5%, P = 0.026), while there were similar rates between former and never smokers. Among the former smokers, most PD patients (97.3%) quit smoking prior to the onset of PD. There were no differences between PD patients with and without a history of smoking for current clinical parameters. Three PD patients with the mean onset age of 51.0 ± 5.3 y reported transient deterioration of their parkinsonism when smoking. Negative mood during cigarette smoke exposure was significantly increased over the entire life in PD patients with a history of smoking than those without (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although previous smoking history reportedly had a neuroprotective effect prior to onset, the association between the previous history and current phenotype in PD was not visible in the present study. However, the possibility that current nicotine intake might modify the parkinsonism deterioration will need to be further evaluated, especially in non-elderly patients. Cigarette smoke-related negative mood could be a confounder for quitting smoking in PD patients.

### Environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease: a critical review and policy implications [^8faa7627]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Current Evidence for a Causal Link

The relationship between pesticide exposure and PD gained attention following the discovery in 1983 that 1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1,2,3,6‐tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a substance structurally similar to the pesticide paraquat, resulted in rapid‐onset parkinsonism following intravenous injection. Since then, numerous epidemiological studies and meta‐analyses have reported associations between PD and pesticide exposure (Table 1), as well as with factors putatively related to pesticide exposure (ie, rural living, farming, and well‐water drinking).,

Evidence of a possible dose–response relationship between overall pesticide exposure and PD has been reported with a 5% versus 11% increased risk for 5 and 10 years of exposure duration, respectively, and one prospective study reported increased mortality in PD patients with occupational exposure to pesticides. A recent study identified an association with PD with long‐term exposure to 53 different pesticides (25 at a false discovery rate [FDR] of ≤ 0.01), whereas residential and workplace proximity to higher amounts of 10 of these 53 pesticides was associated with a faster PD symptom progression.

In 2016, a systematic review funded by Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC was published, in which they used the BH framework to investigate the association between PD and factors such as pesticides. It should be highlighted that Syngenta manufactures a significant proportion of commercially sold paraquat (a quarter of global paraquat sales according to its website). In this work, the authors observed a consistent positive association between pesticide use and PD, with an estimated relative risk of 1.56 (95% Cl = 1.37–1.77). However, they reported a lack of specificity and biological plausibility and concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a causal relationship with PD.

### Neuroprotection of low dose carbon monoxide in Parkinson's disease models commensurate with the reduced risk of Parkinson's among smokers [^65529513]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Smoking is associated with a reduced risk of PD, but the mechanisms underlying smoking-mediated neuroprotection have been unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that low doses of carbon monoxide (CO), which are constitutively and intermittently elevated in individuals who smoke, might contribute to neuroprotection. We demonstrate in genetic and toxin models of PD that treatment with low-dose CO preserves SNpc dopamine neurons and associated striatal dopamine. Further, we show that CO treatment reduces the accumulation of αSyn within neuron somas and reduces the phosphorylation of αSyn that is associated with toxicity. These results suggest that the administration of low-dose CO in rodent PD models may afford neuroprotection and contribute to the reduced risk of PD among smokers.

While there are numerous contaminants in tobacco smoke, CO is a major one. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that CO is associated with neuroprotection in PD is counter intuitive, as CO is thoroughly well-documented as a neurotoxin at high concentration and is generally considered an environmental toxin. It is also well-documented that peak CO-Hb levels in smokers are almost always below 15% and fluctuate given the episodic nature of the habit. Clearly documented adverse CO-related effects at 15% CO-Hb have not been identified other than limiting extensive exercise, some individuals with myocardial ischemia as well as with the developing fetus. Further, multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in both healthy and disease-impacted individuals have failed to identify clinically relevant adverse effects of CO at peak CO-Hb levels below 15% (clin trials.gov and). As all drugs cause toxicity at sufficient dose and other well-documented toxins have found important clinical applications, it will be important to understand the risk-benefit of CO at low levels in patient populations such as PD.

### Neuroprotection of low dose carbon monoxide in Parkinson's disease models commensurate with the reduced risk of Parkinson's among smokers [^59259d4e]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Paradoxically, cigarette smoking is associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson's Disease (PD). This led us to hypothesize that carbon monoxide (CO) levels, which are constitutively but modestly elevated in smokers, might contribute to neuroprotection. Using rodent models of PD based on α-synuclein (αSyn) accumulation and oxidative stress, we show that low-dose CO mitigates neurodegeneration and reduces αSyn pathology. Oral CO administration activated signaling cascades mediated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which have been implicated in limiting oxidative stress, and in promoting αSyn degradation, thereby conferring neuroprotection. Consistent with the neuroprotective effect of smoking, HO-1 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were higher in human smokers compared to nonsmokers. Moreover, in PD brain samples, HO-1 levels were higher in neurons without αSyn pathology. Thus, CO in rodent PD models reduces pathology and increases oxidative stress responses, phenocopying possible protective effects of smoking evident in PD patients. These data highlight the potential for low-dose CO-modulated pathways to slow symptom onset and limit pathology in PD patients.
