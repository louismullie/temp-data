## Question

A 9-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother for weakness, diaphoresis, and syncope. His mother says that he has never been diagnosed with any medical conditions but has been having "fainting spells" over the past month. Routine lab work reveals a glucose level of 25 mg/dL. The patient is promptly given glucagon and intravenous dextrose and admitted to the hospital for observation. The patient's mother stays with him during his hospitalization. The patient is successfully watched overnight and his blood glucose levels normalize on his morning levels. The care team discusses a possible discharge during morning rounds. One hour later the nurse is called in for a repeat fainting episode. A c-peptide level is drawn and shown to be low. The patient appears ill, diaphoretic, and is barely arousable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this child?
A. Munchausen syndrome
B. Munchausen syndrome by proxy
C. Somatic symptom disorder
D. Conversion disorder

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which psychiatric diagnosis best fits a 9-year-old with recurrent severe hypoglycemia and a low C-peptide during an episode. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypoglycemia and whether Whipple's triad is satisfied. Then, I should verify the significance of a low C-peptide during hypoglycemia and what that implies about insulin origin. Next, I will review the differential of pediatric hypoglycemia and exclude endogenous hyperinsulinism, insulin autoimmune syndrome, and other organic causes. After that, I need to consider factitious etiologies and the epidemiology of Munchausen syndrome by proxy in this context. Finally, I will match the most appropriate psychiatric diagnosis and outline immediate safety and diagnostic steps, including the critical sample and social work involvement [^1125rQWK] [^115aLgVt].

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture: a 9-year-old with recurrent episodes of diaphoresis, weakness, and syncope, with a documented glucose of 25 mg/dL that responds to dextrose, which satisfies Whipple's triad for hypoglycemia; I should double-check that symptoms align with neuroglycopenia and autonomic responses and that the low glucose was measured on a laboratory method, not just a point-of-care meter, to avoid artifact, and yes, the presentation is classic and the glucose is critically low for a child beyond the neonatal period, supporting true hypoglycemia [^1125rQWK] [^111Dakdk].

> Now, I need to interpret the low C-peptide during hypoglycemia; wait, let me verify the implication here: in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, endogenous insulin secretion should be inappropriately elevated or at least not suppressed, so C-peptide should be normal or high when glucose is low, but a suppressed C-peptide with hypoglycemia points away from endogenous hyperinsulinism and toward exogenous insulin administration because C-peptide is co-secreted with endogenous insulin but absent from pharmacologic insulin, so low C-peptide during hypoglycemia is a red flag for surreptitious insulin use [^115aLgVt] [^117Db16t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential and actively exclude endogenous causes: insulinoma would show inappropriately high or non-suppressed insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemia, which is the opposite of this case, and insulin autoimmune syndrome typically shows markedly elevated insulin with disproportionately high insulin-to-C-peptide ratios due to autoantibody interference, again not low C-peptide, so both are inconsistent with the reported labs; other organic causes like growth hormone deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, or ketotic hypoglycemia would present with low insulin and often ketosis, which also doesn't fit a low C-peptide hyperinsulinemic picture, so the pattern here is most consistent with exogenous insulin administration rather than endogenous disease [^116pto3U] [^116dS48a] [^1125K84e].

> I will now examine the possibility of factitious hypoglycemia; let me think about the epidemiology and mechanism: in children, factitious hypoglycemia is most often due to Munchausen syndrome by proxy, typically mediated by a caregiver administering insulin, and the biochemical signature is hypoglycemia with low C-peptide and often inappropriately elevated or discordant insulin depending on assay cross-reactivity with analogs; importantly, case series and reports document that a nontrivial fraction of pediatric hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases are due to surreptitious insulin, and delays in diagnosis occur when clinicians fail to obtain insulin and C-peptide during episodes, so the pattern here strongly suggests caregiver-fabricated illness with exogenous insulin [^115qUuTB] [^117Re1wS] [^1164aVYg].

> But wait, what if this were Munchausen syndrome in the child himself; hmm, wait a minute, that would imply the child is inducing his own hypoglycemia, which is exceedingly uncommon at age 9 and would not fit the classic pediatric pattern of caregiver-mediated poisoning; I should confirm that the vignette emphasizes the mother's presence and narrative control, which aligns with Munchausen by proxy rather than primary factitious disorder in the child, so the most likely psychiatric diagnosis here is Munchausen syndrome by proxy, also known as factitious disorder imposed on another [^115qUuTB] [^117Re1wS].

> Next, I should review why the other options are less likely: somatic symptom disorder requires distressing physical symptoms without intentional production or deception and with inconclusive medical findings, which does not match documented severe hypoglycemia with a clear exogenous mechanism; conversion disorder presents with neurological symptoms incompatible with recognized disease and lacks objective hypoglycemia, so neither fits the biochemical evidence of surreptitious insulin administration seen here [^notfound].

> I need to ensure immediate safety and diagnostic confirmation; hold on, I should verify that a critical sample during the next hypoglycemic episode includes plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and a screen for sulfonylureas, and I should consult the lab about insulin assay cross-reactivity with analogs because some assays miss analogs and can yield falsely low insulin despite exogenous administration; concurrently, I should involve social work and child protection, consider supervised visitation, and, if necessary, covert video surveillance in collaboration with security and legal counsel to document caregiver access and administration of insulin, as recommended in pediatric endocrine safety protocols for suspected factitious hypoglycemia [^1111HzQr] [^115aLgVt] [^1164aVYg].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis as Munchausen syndrome by proxy given the recurrent severe hypoglycemia, the suppressed C-peptide during an episode indicating exogenous insulin, the absence of an endogenous hyperinsulinemic disorder on differential, and the epidemiologic pattern of caregiver-mediated illness in children; the correct answer is B, Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and the next steps are to secure the child's safety, obtain a critical sample with appropriate assays, and initiate a multidisciplinary evaluation involving endocrinology, psychiatry, social work, and child protective services [^115aLgVt] [^115qUuTB] [^117Re1wS].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **Munchausen syndrome by proxy** (MSBP), given the recurrent severe hypoglycemia with a low C-peptide during an episode, which is classic for exogenous insulin administration [^115aLgVt]. This pattern is not explained by endogenous hyperinsulinism, insulinoma, or insulin autoimmune syndrome, and the mother's presence during episodes and the child's clinical course are highly suggestive of caregiver-induced illness [^115qUuTB]. Immediate steps should include securing the child, obtaining a critical sample during the next hypoglycemic episode, and involving Child Protective Services [^1111HzQr].

## Differential diagnosis of recurrent hypoglycemia in children

Recurrent hypoglycemia in children has a broad differential, including endocrine, metabolic, and psychiatric disorders [^1125K84e]. The most relevant to this case are:

- **Endogenous hyperinsulinism**: Insulinoma or congenital hyperinsulinism typically shows elevated insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemia [^116pto3U].

- **Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS)**: Characterized by autoantibodies to insulin, causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with elevated insulin and C-peptide [^116dS48a].

- **Factitious hypoglycemia**: Surreptitious insulin administration causes low C-peptide with elevated insulin during hypoglycemia [^115aLgVt].

- **Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP)**: Caregiver-induced illness, often via insulin or sulfonylureas, producing recurrent hypoglycemia [^115qUuTB].

---

## Laboratory findings and their interpretation

The key laboratory finding is a **low C-peptide level during hypoglycemia**, which strongly suggests exogenous insulin administration [^115aLgVt]. Normally, endogenous insulin secretion is accompanied by C-peptide; therefore, low C-peptide with hypoglycemia indicates external insulin use [^1125K84e]. In contrast, endogenous hyperinsulinism (e.g. insulinoma, congenital hyperinsulinism) shows elevated insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemia [^116pto3U]. IAS also shows elevated insulin and C-peptide due to autoantibody-bound insulin [^112t8a1q].

---

## Clinical features supporting MSBP

Several clinical features in this case support **MSBP**:

- **Recurrent hypoglycemia**: Multiple episodes of severe hypoglycemia, especially with low C-peptide, are highly suggestive of exogenous insulin administration [^115aLgVt].

- **Caregiver presence**: The mother's presence during episodes and hospitalization raises suspicion of caregiver-induced illness [^notfound].

- **Response to glucose**: Rapid recovery with intravenous dextrose is consistent with insulin-induced hypoglycemia [^notfound].

- **Absence of alternative explanations**: No evidence of endocrine or metabolic disorders, insulinoma, or IAS.

## Comparison with other psychiatric diagnoses

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to this case** |
|-|-|-|
| Munchausen syndrome | Self-induced illness, often with surreptitious insulin use | Not applicable, as the patient is a child |
| Somatic symptom disorder | Physical symptoms without medical explanation, no intentional deception | Not applicable, as hypoglycemia is objectively documented |
| Conversion disorder | Neurological symptoms without medical explanation, no intentional deception | Not applicable, as hypoglycemia is objectively documented |

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely diagnosis is **Munchausen syndrome by proxy**, given the recurrent severe hypoglycemia with low C-peptide and the clinical context [^115qUuTB]. Immediate actions should include securing the child, obtaining a critical sample during the next hypoglycemic episode, and involving child protective services [^1111HzQr].

### Higher risk of severe hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with a rapid loss of C-peptide during the first 6 years after type 1 diabetes diagnosis [^111Se17H]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

We conclude that low age at diagnosis and the presence of multiple autoantibodies predict a rapid decline of beta-cell function. Loss of C-peptide is associated with an increased risk and higher frequency of severe hypoglycemic events and less good blood glucose control. A higher BMISDS at diagnosis is predictive of a slow decline of beta-cell function.

HbA1c did not differ between rapid and slow progressors, but study subjects with less C-peptide had higher average calculated HbA1c first 2 years and slow progressors needed less insulin. Thus, even if it seems to be possible to achieve good glycemic control with use of intensive insulin treatment in spite of low residual C-peptide, even low own residual beta cell function improves metabolic control.

Furthermore, loss of residual C-peptide is known to be an important predictor for short-term complications such as severe hypoglyemia, which we confirm in this study, and ketoacidosisas well as for long-term diabetes complications.

We observed no episodes of ketoacidosis, but 22 events of SH during the 6 years of follow-up. SH was only experienced by study subjects with rapid loss of C-peptide during the first 3 years after diagnosis. These findings are well in line with previous evidence of a protective effect even of low levels of residual C-peptide on the frequency of SH. We found that the slow progressors even with low C-peptide (> 0.03 nmol/L) still had reduced risk of SH during the follow-up. The study subjects that experienced an SH during the 6 years of follow-up had lower levels of C-peptide at 18 and 30 months after diagnosis.

Subjects with a rapid decline of C-peptide presented with lower levels of C-peptide already at diagnosis and for every time point during the follow-up period, except during the remission period 3 months after diagnosis. These results are indicative of a lower beta-cell function in rapid progressors already at diagnosis, which could be related to a more aggressive immunological processes or a delayed diagnosis. At 3 months, the glycemic control was improved in both groups with the lowest average HbA1c and insulin requirements during the whole study period. The remaining beta-cells might temporarily recover, a clinical partial remission phase (honeymoon) starting after exogenous insulin treatment is initiated at diagnosis with improvement of the metabolic disturbance and peripheral insulin sensitivity. The duration of the remission period depends at least partly on the recovery of the beta-cell function, with a shorter period of C-peptide secretion in the rapid progressor, with a maximum stimulated C-peptide 3 months after diagnosis versus 9 months in slow progressor.

Adrenal insufficiency and drug or toxin evaluation — Adrenal insufficiency, congenital or acquired, may manifest with hypoglycemia; simultaneous measurement of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol is recommended if primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test may be needed for suspected secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. The possibility of drug administration (accidental or surreptitious) or a toxin may need to be considered, and specimens of plasma and urine obtained at the time of an acute episode may be informative. High plasma insulin level but low C-peptide level during hypoglycemia suggest exogenous insulin administration, and the drugs most commonly associated with hypoglycemia include insulin, sulphonylureas, alcohol.

Introduction

The progression to insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes is heterogenous. This study aimed to identify early characteristics associated with rapid or slow decline of beta-cell function and how it affects the clinical course.

Research design and methods

Stimulated C-peptide was assessed by mixed meal tolerance test in 50 children (< 18 years) during 2004–2017, at regular intervals for 6 years from type 1 diabetes diagnosis. 40% of the children had a rapid decline of stimulated C-peptide defined as no measurable C-peptide (< 0.03 nmol/L) 30 months after diagnosis.

Results

At diagnosis, higher frequencies of detectable glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) and IA-2A (p = 0.027) were associated with rapid loss of beta-cell function. C-peptide was predicted positively by age at 18 months (p = 0.017) and 30 months duration (p = 0.038). BMI SD scores (BMISDS) at diagnosis predicted higher C-peptide at diagnosis (p = 0.006), 3 months (p = 0.002), 9 months (p = 0.005), 30 months (p = 0.022), 3 years (p = 0.009), 4 years (p = 0.016) and 6 years (p = 0.026), whereas high HbA1c and blood glucose at diagnosis predicted a lower C-peptide at diagnosis (p = < 0.001) for both comparisons. Both GADA and IA-2A were negative predictors of C-peptide at 9 months (p = 0.011), 18 months (p = 0.008) and 30 months (p < 0.001). Ten children had 22 events of severe hypoglycemia, and they had lower mean C-peptide at 18 months (p = 0.025), 30 months (p = 0.008) and 6 years (p = 0.018) compared with others. Seven of them had a rapid decline of C-peptide (p = 0.030), and the odds to experience a severe hypoglycemia were nearly fivefold increased (OR = 4.846, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Low age and presence of multiple autoantibodies at diagnosis predicts a rapid loss of beta-cell function in children with type 1 diabetes. Low C-peptide is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia and higher Hemoglobin A1C. A high BMISDS at diagnosis is predictive of remaining beta-cell function during the 6 years of follow-up.

### Persistence of prolonged C-peptide production in type 1 diabetes as measured with an ultrasensitive C-peptide assay [^112XKH2L]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In type 1 diabetes, significant destruction of β-cells occurs prior to diagnosis. At the time of clinical onset, only ∼10% of normal β-cell mass remains. Levels of plasma C-peptide drop to ∼20% of the maximal mean of healthy people. A prospective study found that 2 years after diagnosis, insulin levels, after a mixed-meal stimulation, decreased to nearly 30% of baseline. Similar findings contribute to therapeutic nihilism that β-cells are nearly destroyed several years after diagnosis, especially with early age of onset. But is this pessimism warranted?

Studies show that patients with advanced disease do show some residual β-cell function, depending on individual variables. Low or vanished C-peptide levels are indicative of advancing disease after diagnosis, and undetectable C-peptide is usually observed after ∼1 year of disease duration. Yet, even small amounts of residual β-cell function confer fewer complications in most studies. The strongest evidence to date, however, finds that while higher and sustained levels of C-peptide are most beneficial, even modest levels of β-cell function in some with long-term disease are associated with lower rates of hypoglycemia and lower incidence of retinopathy and nephropathy.

### Insulin autoimmune syndrome in a 3-year-old boy: the youngest to date in China and a narrow review [^114DBNXk]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

At the onset, the insulin level of our patient was > 1000 pmol/L (venous glucose of 1.1 mmol/L), and the C-peptide level was 33.11 pmol/L. After a starvation test during hospitalization, the insulin level was 34.93 pmol/L, and the C-peptide level was 39.73 pmol/L. The significant difference in insulin levels between the two measurements, along with the disproportionate insulin to C-peptide ration, implicates the possible presence of IAAs or insulin receptor antibodies. Following the extended OGTT, an insulin to C-peptide molar ratio greater than 1 further supports the potential presence of aforementioned antibodies. In healthy individuals, the molar ratio of insulin to C-peptide in circulation via portal vein should be less than 1 because insulin has a relatively faster clearance compared to C-peptide. However, in patients with IAS, due to the high binding and low affinity of the insulin-IAAs complexes, the insulin to C-peptide molar ratio in circulation should theoretically be greater than 1, and Wong et al. confirmed this phenomenon. While, Yuan et al. found that 40% of IAS patients had an insulin to C-peptide molar ratio less than 1 during episodes of hypoglycemia, and similar findings have been found in our literature review. Thus, the insulin to C-peptide molar ratio cannot serve as a definitive diagnostic criterion for IAS. When exogenous insulin use has been excluded and non-ketotic hypoglycemia is present, positive IAAs may be the sole finding for IAS. What we emphasized is that an insulin to C-peptide molar ratio less than 1 during hypoglycemia does not entirely exclude IAS, and the molar ratio in OGTT also provides certain diagnostic reference value.

### Factitious hypoglycemia: a tale from the arab world [^117Re1wS]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The mother is usually the one who narrates the patient's history to the pediatrician. Listening and eliciting the parent's story is an art. One of the essential attributes of a good pediatrician is the readiness to believe the parent's story. Mothers are good historians and careful observers. The axiom that the mother is always right is true in most instances. However, occasionally the clinician is deliberately misled by the storyteller, resulting in numerous and potentially dangerous diagnostic investigations. We describe a boy with recurrent hypoglycemic coma in whom the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia was delayed as it is believed to be nonexistent in our community. We emphasize that in all patients with recurrent hypoglycemia, estimation of C-peptide and insulin should be performed even when the clinical settings are not in favor of the diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Munchausen syndrome by proxy, hypoglycemia.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^1125rQWK]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical definition and confirmation — Clinical hypoglycemia is defined as a PG concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs of impaired brain function, and confirmation relies on Whipple's triad: symptoms and/or signs consistent with hypoglycemia, a documented low PG concentration, and relief of signs/symptoms when PG concentration is restored to normal; suspected hypoglycemia should be treated promptly to avoid potential adverse consequences.

For suspected hyperinsulinism, the fasting test can be terminated when the PG concentration is < 50 mg/dL (< 2.8 mmol/L) with administration of glucagon (1 mg IV, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously) to evaluate the glycemic response. An exaggerated glycemic response (> 30 mg/dL [> 1.7 mmol/L]) is nearly pathognomonic of hyperinsulinism. Because plasma insulin concentration is sometimes not above the lower limit of detection, it is important to include the following tests when assessing the possibility of hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism: plasma BOHB and FFA (both inappropriately low; BOHB < 1.5 mmol/L [< 15 mg/dL] and FFA < 1.0–1.5 mmol/L [< 28–42 mg/dL]), and an increased glycemic response to glucagon. Based on the suspected diagnosis, additional tests performed on specimens obtained at the time that fasting is terminated should be considered, such as growth hormone, cortisol, total and free carnitine, acyl-carnitine profile, C-peptide, proinsulin, and drug screening.

Adrenal insufficiency, congenital or acquired, may manifest with hypoglycemia. Simultaneous measurement of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol is recommended if primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. An adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test may be needed to confirm suspected secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency.

The possibility of drug administration (accidental or surreptitious) or a toxin may need to be considered. Specimens of plasma and urine obtained at the time of an acute episode may be informative. High plasma insulin level but low C-peptide level during hypoglycemia suggest exogenous insulin administration. The drugs most commonly associated with hypoglycemia include insulin, sulphonylureas, alcohol, beta-blockers, and salicylates. Not all commercially available insulin assays measure the insulin analogues; thus, the finding of low insulin and C-peptide levels at time of hypoglycemia might not rule out surreptitious insulin administration. (Consultation with the testing laboratory should be considered if clinical suspicion is high.)

Postprandial hypoglycemia in infants and children is usually a complication of fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux (incidence 25%−30%) or gastric bypass bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. In these patients, a meal may trigger hypoglycemia 1–3 hours later. Postprandial hypoglycemia is often preceded by exaggerated glucose, glucagon-like peptide-1, and insulin responses, which can be detected on an oral glucose or mixed-meal tolerance test.

Critical sample for neonatal hypoglycemia — A "critical sample" at the time of hypoglycemia, best collected at < 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/L), is described as invaluable in diagnosing the cause and should include: plasma glucose, beta-hydoxybutyrate (ketones), insulin, c-peptide, growth hormone, cortisol, free fatty acids, lactate and bicarbonate. Can also consider checking carnitine, acyl-carnitine profile and serum ammonia after consultation with a Pediatric Endocrinologist.

### A difficult case of recurrent hypoglycaemia: role of insulin assays in establishing the diagnosis [^115QKTUp]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin assays are designed to detect endogenous insulin, however, insulin assays produced by different manufacturers may detect exogenous recombinant insulin, with varying degrees of cross-reactivity between different assays. We report a fascinating and difficult case of recurrent hypoglycaemia, where the final diagnosis was established with the help of insulin assays using different platforms.

Case Report

A 24-year-old female presented with recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes on a background of Type 1 diabetes mellitus and a completely resected synovial sarcoma of the right hip several years previously. She reported significant physical, sexual and emotional abuse leading to reduced appetite and weight loss. Despite withdrawing insulin therapy, she experienced profound hypoglycaemic episodes with detectable C-peptide and inappropriately elevated insulin levels, suggesting endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia; however, localization studies were negative and finally she was found to have exogenous hyperinsulinaemia after discordant insulin levels were detected using two different insulin assays. The C-peptide level was elevated as a result of stimulation by parenteral dextrose and was suppressed after dextrose was ceased. Her Type 1 diabetes mellitus was fabricated and she had factitious hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

Factitious hypoglycemia is difficult to diagnose and treat. A low blood glucose level, suppressed C-peptide level and an inappropriately elevated insulin level is the classic finding. We were able to make a diagnosis in the present case after discordant insulin levels were detected on the two different insulin assays, signifying cross-reactivities of the recombinant insulin with the assays. A multidisciplinary team approach with psychiatric input is needed to treat such cases.

### Evaluation and management of adult hypoglycemic disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7PbH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim is to provide guidelines for the evaluation and management of adults with hypoglycemic disorders, including those with diabetes mellitus.

Evidence

Using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence is graded very low (plus sign in circle ooo), low (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle oo), moderate (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle o), or high (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle).

Conclusions

We recommend evaluation and management of hypoglycemia only in patients in whom Whipple's triad — symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of those symptoms or signs after the plasma glucose concentration is raised — is documented. In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies — drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction — addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations — in persons with diabetes.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^114sGjP4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Values

Failure to investigate a neonate, infant, or child with suspected hypoglycemia increases the risk of delaying a definitive diagnosis and instituting effective treatment. Expeditiously identifying the specific cause of hypoglycemia, as outlined above, will enable prompt institution of appropriate treatment and decrease the risk of permanent brain injury from persistent and recurrent severe hypoglycemia. The decision to subject an infant or child to a diagnostic investigation for suspected hypoglycemia, which includes a monitored assessment of fasting adaptation that may expose the patient to the risk of another episode of hypoglycemia, places a higher value on achieving diagnostic certainty and a lower value on avoiding the discomfort, inconvenience, and cost of such procedures.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^116pto3U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Presentation

The Whipple triad, named after the American surgeon Allen O. Whipple (1881–1963), is the diagnostic hallmark establishing the existence of a hypoglycemic disorder and has the following 3 features: (1) symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia; (2) low plasma glucose measured at the time of the symptoms and signs; and (3) relief of symptoms and signs when the glucose is raised to a normal level. In addition to the familiar hypoglycemic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, nervousness, and feeling of hunger, neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, visual disturbances, or seizures may also occur. The latter may cause patients to be misdiagnosed with a psychiatric or neurological disorder. Symptoms occur mainly in the fasting state, but up to 20% of patients also described postprandial symptoms. By definition, in endogenous hyperinsulinism, the insulin secretion does not decrease to very low levels when plasma glucose concentrations decrease to hypoglycemic levels. Thus, in patients with insulinoma, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin concentrations are inappropriately high in the setting of low fasting plasma glucose concentrations. According to the most recent clinical practice guidelines, critical diagnostic findings are present when the confirmed fasting plasma glucose concentrations are preferably below 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or below 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (= hypoglycemia — depending on guidelines and cutoffs — the optimal cutoff level for blood glucose is currently still a matter of debate), plasma insulin concentrations of at least 3 μU/mL (18 pmol/L), plasma C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 ng/L (0.2 nmol/L), and plasma proinsulin concentrations of at least 5.0 pmol/L. The patients presented here fulfilled all these criteria. If hypoglycemia does not occur spontaneously, a 72-hour prolonged fasting test should be performed and blood should be drawn for measurements of insulin, and pro-insulin, or C-peptide measurements if hypoglycemia occurs. Some authors have advocated shorter fasting tests. There are data suggesting that a standardized evaluation of neurocognitive function during the fasting test (using the Mini-Mental test) can be helpful and more important than a glucose concentration threshold. Indeed, a median decrease in Mini-Mental score of ≥ 6 points has been shown to be superior for stopping the fasting test than a predefined glucose concentration. For the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia not caused by insulinoma in individuals who have not undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery, such as persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy and noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (nesidioblastosis), administration of exogenous insulin or sulfonylureas, insulinomatosis, and insulin (receptor) autoimmune syndrome (Hirata disease), the reader is referred to other publications.

### Insulin autoimmune syndrome in a 3-year-old boy: the youngest to date in China and a narrow review [^1115L493]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS), characterized by endogenous hypoglycemia associated with insulin autoantibodies, is a rare cause of hypoglycemia in pediatric patients. Here, we report a case of the youngest patient with IAS in China, and summarize the clinical characteristics of the disease through a narrow review of pediatric cases.

Case presentation

A 3-year-10-month-old Chinese boy presented with unconsciousness. Initially, he was misdiagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) due to non-ketotic hypoglycemia. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was negative, and no pancreatic space-occupying lesions were identified. He continued to have intermittent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia. During an extended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), his insulin to C-peptide molar ratio was greater than 1, and anti-insulin antibodies (IAAs) measurements were as high as 54.38 COI (normal range 0–1 COI). High-resolution human leukocyte antigen (HLA) test showed a DRB1*08:03/*12:02 genotype. He was eventually diagnosed with IAS. Hypoglycemic episodes were not observed as long as the patient adhered to the low and frequent carbohydrate diet. Six months later, the patient's anti-insulin antibody had decreased to 10.17 COI, and mildly symptomatic hypoglycemia occasionally occurred in the case of noncompliance with the diet. Based on 11 studies from a literature review and our own case, a total of 12 pediatric patients were analyzed. Most of these patients presented with unconsciousness initially and their episodes of hypoglycemia do not follow a definitive pattern. Adjustments in diet serve as an effective intervention, and spontaneous remission is relatively common.

Conclusion

When differentiating the causes of HH in pediatric patients, IAS should not be overlooked. Elevated levels of IAAs and an inappropriate insulin to C-peptide molar ratio during an extended OGTT are critical indicators.

### Achievement of target A1c levels with negligible hypoglycemia and low glucose variability in youth with short-term type 1 diabetes and residual β-cell function [^1158ULDE]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The availability of blinded CGM profiles in nondiabetic children and adolescents and in youth with longer-term diabetes who were successfully achieving target A1C goals with intensive treatment provided us with a unique opportunity to examine how glucose profiles in these two groups of participants compared with those in youth with well-controlled short-term T1D who retained residual insulin secretion. Since both groups of T1D participants were matched for A1C levels, it was not surprising that overall mean CGM glucose values were also similar. Nevertheless, youth with short-term T1D had a lower frequency of hypoglycemia and a trend toward less hyperglycemia than youth with longer-term T1D. In addition, glucose variability as assessed by the CV of sensor glucose levels was significantly reduced in the short-term versus longer-term T1D participants; short-term patients also had reduced daily insulin requirements (Table 1). In the DCCT, subjects with residual β-cell function had lower total daily insulin doses than subjects who were C-peptide nonresponders.

As expected, A1C levels, mean sensor glucose values, and glucose variability in the short-term T1D participants were higher than in nondiabetic youth of similar age. In addition to insulin deficiency, recent studies indicate that patients with short-term T1D have inappropriate increases in plasma glucagon levels during mixed-meal feedings, which may also contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the nondiabetic and the short-term T1D groups in the frequency of sensor values in the hypoglycemic range, which is particularly striking. In contrast, participants in the longer-term T1D group achieved A1C levels near or within the < 7.5% pediatric target range at the expense of a sharp increase in exposure to biochemical hypoglycemia. Using a one-step hyperinsulinemic, hypoglycemic clamp, we have demonstrated that 56% of the subjects in the short-term group maintained a glucagon response to hypoglycemia, which may have contributed to their low incidence of biochemical hypoglycemia. Since recurrent episodes of mild biochemical hypoglycemia have been implicated in the development of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure and hypoglycemia unawareness, the absence of such exposure in our short-term participants may also help explain why the risk of severe hypoglycemic events was reduced in C-peptide responders vs. C-peptide nonresponders in the DCCT.

### Detection of surreptitious administration of analog insulin to an 8-week-old infant [^1164aVYg]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

An 8-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with lethargy, tachycardia, and a blood glucose concentration of 1.8 mmol/L. After admission, hypoglycemia recurred on 3 additional occasions. Initial urinalysis results were negative for ketones, and the results of additional laboratory tests did not support the diagnosis of cortisol or growth hormone deficiency, oral hypoglycemic ingestion, or an inborn error of metabolism. Difficulty restoring and maintaining glucose concentrations along with a transient response to glucagon during 1 hypoglycemic episode suggested hyperinsulinism. In 1 hypoglycemic episode, elevated insulin and low C-peptide concentrations suggested exogenous insulin administration, but 2 subsequent blood samples obtained during hypoglycemia contained appropriately decreased concentrations of insulin. The insulin immunoassay initially used in this case (Roche ElecSys/cobas [Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN]) was insensitive to insulin analogs. Two additional immunoassays, 1 with intermediate (Immulite [Siemens, Deerfield, IL]) and 1 with broad (radioimmunoassay [Millipore, Inc, Billerica, MA]) reactivity to insulin analogs were used to characterize insulin in each of the critical blood samples. Samples obtained during hypoglycemia displayed a graded reactivity similar to that observed in type 1 diabetic patients prescribed insulin analogs, whereas a sample obtained from the patient and a control subject during euglycemia showed equal reactivity among the 3 assays. These data suggested administration of insulin analog to the child, and further characterization of insulin by using tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of Humalog. The child was subsequently placed in foster care with no further recurrence of hypoglycemia.

### Hypoglycemia [^115JM84y]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Under physiologic conditions, glucose plays a critical role in providing energy to the central nervous system. A precipitous drop in the availability of this substrate results in dramatic symptoms that signal a medical emergency and warrant immediate therapy aimed at restoring plasma glucose to normal levels. A systemic approach to the differential diagnosis is useful in identifying the cause of hypoglycemia. Once established, a specific and/or definitive intervention that addresses that underlying problem can be implemented. In most cases, this systemic approach to diagnosis and therapy is rewarded with a good outcome for the patient.

### Insulin autoimmune syndrome in a 3-year-old boy: the youngest to date in China and a narrow review [^1137tVXB]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

A fasting test was performed because the patient did not experience spontaneous hypoglycemia during hospitalization. Ten hours later, his peripheral blood glucose was 2.2mmol/L (venous blood glucose of 1.6 mmol/L), but no symptoms were observed. Concurrent evaluations of counter-regulatory hormones such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and thyroid hormones, revealed normal range. The insulin level was 34.93 pmol/L (normal range 41.6–187.5 pmol/L), C-peptide level was 39.73 pmol/L (normal range 364.2–1655.4 pmol/L), urine ketones were negative, and both β-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acids were suppressed. There was no evidence of acid-base imbalance, and the glucagon stimulation test was positive (glycemic response > 1.7mmol/L during hypoglycemia by a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg glucagon), indicating no inherited metabolic disorders such as ketone body synthesis impairment or fatty acid oxidation defects. Enhanced pancreatic MRI was normal, ruling out insulinoma. Based on these findings, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) was primarily suspected. WES did not identify any variants associated with congenital hyperinsulinism or insulinoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia, MEN). Subsequently, an extended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted (see Table 1), which revealed significantly elevated insulin levels and an insulin to C-peptide molar ratio greater than 1. Additionally, positive IAAs were observed (54.38 COI, normal range 0–1 COI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 5.3% (normal range 4–6%). The diagnosis was confirmed as IAS after excluding a history of exogenous insulin injection. Meanwhile, he had no history of viral infection or use of sulfur- or thiol-containing drugs such as methimazole, lipoic acid, or captopril before onset. Routine blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tests of anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and anti-extractable nuclear antigen antibody were all normal. Although the anti-nuclear antibody was positive at a low-titer (1:10), there were no signs of vasculitis, arthritis, or rheumatological diseases, which does not support a diagnosis of hematological or rheumatological diseases secondary to IAS. Then the high-resolution HLA typing was performed, revealing a DRB1*08:03/*12:02 genotype. We adjusted the patient's dietary to include lower carbohydrates and 5 to 6 small meals per day. Following these changes, the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes decreased, although occasional nocturnal hypoglycemia still occurred (0 to 2 episodes per week). The peripheral blood glucose levels ranged from 2.5 to 3 mmol/L in hypoglycemic episodes; therefore, we recommend that the patient supplemented with a small amount of carbohydrates before bedtime.

### Persistent C-peptide is associated with reduced hypoglycaemia but not hbAin adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes: evidence for lack of intensive treatment in UK clinical practice? [^1148ctt2]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent work has shown that many individuals with long duration Type 1 diabetes continue to produce low levels of endogenous insulin; however, the clinical significance of this is uncertain. β‐Cell function declines with increasing disease duration in Type 1 diabetes and this was assumed to progress to total β‐cell loss 1. Recent studies have demonstrated persistent endogenous insulin in many people with long duration Type 1 diabetes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Although there is rapid initial decline post diagnosis, insulin secretion reaches a plateau after ~ 7 years post diagnosis 7. Using highly sensitive C‐peptide assays up to 80% of those with long duration Type 1 diabetes (median duration 18 years) have been shown to have low‐level, detectable endogenous insulin secretion 5. Furthermore, some people with long duration Type 1 diabetes have surprisingly high levels of endogenous insulin, with 8–15% of those diagnosed in adulthood having either a serum C‐peptide > 0.2 nmol/l or a urine C‐peptide creatinine ratio of > 0.2 nmol/mmol 5, 6. The strongest clinical associations of C‐peptide appear to be disease duration and age at diagnosis, with those diagnosed younger being much less likely to have persistent C‐peptide 2, 5, 6, 8.

Section 2. Workup/Investigation of persistent hypoglycemia — We recommend that investigations be carried out to diagnose the underlying mechanism of persistent hypoglycemia disorders to provide specific management. GRADE 1+++. Evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination for features of hypopituitarism, glycogenosis, adrenal insufficiency, or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; whenever possible, specimens (a "critical sample") should be obtained at the time of spontaneous presentation and before treatment that may rapidly alter BOHB, FFA, and insulin. Assays for PG, bicarbonate, BOHB, and lactate are readily available and useful, with plasma held for plasma insulin, FFA, C-peptide, and carnitine/acyl-carnitine profile as indicated, and laboratory reference ranges for some tests may be inappropriate during childhood hypoglycemia.

### Recurrent hypoglycemia in a toddler [^112BavKA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of hypoglycemia in toddlers. This diagnosis should be considered in any hypoglycemic toddler with no prior history of abnormal growth who is developmentally normal when toxic ingestions and sepsis are inconsistent with the clinical picture. Diagnosis is important in preventing serious long-term sequelae and is made in the setting of hypoglycemia, ketonuria, and ketonemia. Therefore, checking urine and blood ketones is an essential part of the evaluation in any hypoglycemic toddler. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl with recurrent hypoglycemia secondary to idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia.

### Isolated growth hormone deficiency presenting with recurrent hypoglycaemia in a toddler [^11467erP]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Hypoglycaemia in infants and children is caused by a number of endocrine and metabolic defects, some of which are unique to this age group. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) has been rarely reported as a cause of recurrent fasting hypoglycaemia in children. An 18-month-old male child presented to us for evaluation of neuroglycopenic symptoms caused by recurrent episodes of fasting hypoglycaemia. Laboratory evaluation revealed ketotic hypoinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. The child was diagnosed to have GHD on the basis of two failed stimulation tests. A detailed work-up for metabolic and other hormonal causes of hypoglycaemia was negative. We present the case for its rarity and to highlight the importance of a detailed metabolic and hormonal assessment in evaluation of childhood hypoglycaemia.

Altered hypoglycemia awareness (HAAF) — effects and thresholds: Previous exposure to hypoglycemia can blunt and repeated episodes can eliminate neurogenic responses, leading to reduced or absent awareness and impaired hepatic glucose release; this hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) can persist for > 24 hours after a single episode, can occur during sleep and exercise, and recurrent hypoglycemia can shift the usual glucose threshold for neurogenic symptoms of 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) to a lower level, with features demonstrated in infants as young as age 10–13 weeks.

### Hypoglycemia: a complication of diabetes therapy in children [^114aMgcR]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The experience of hypoglycemia is probably the most feared and hated consequence of life with type 1 diabetes among pediatric patients and their parents. Although transient detrimental effects are clearly disturbing and may have severe results, there is surprisingly little evidence of long-term CNS damage, even after multiple hypoglycemic episodes, except in rare instances. Despite the latter evidence, we advocate that every treatment regimen be designed to prevent hypoglycemia without inducing unacceptable hyperglycemia and increasing the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications.

### Persistent C-peptide is associated with reduced hypoglycaemia but not hbAin adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes: evidence for lack of intensive treatment in UK clinical practice? [^116yKpGV]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths of our study include that we were able to utilize a highly sensitive C‐peptide assay, allowing for identification and classification of C‐peptide status at historically undetectable levels. We also robustly excluded individuals with both Type 2 and monogenic diabetes, ensuring that those with a high C‐peptide truly had Type 1 diabetes. Additionally, our recruitment process allowed the disease duration of both groups to be the same, removing a potential key confounder from this analysis. Our cohort were not part of a clinical intervention trial and received routine clinical care, making them reflective of current Type 1 diabetes management in the UK, both strengthening our findings and making them relevant to routine care in the UK.

Our study was limited by self‐reported hypoglycaemia and region‐restricted complication data reducing the power to assess a difference in complications. We used a validated hypoglycaemia questionnaire; however, this relied on participants both correctly identifying and recording hypoglycaemic episodes. It is likely that our data underestimate the frequency of hypoglycaemia, due to reduced hypoglycaemic awareness and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Accurate identification of hypoglycaemia relies on frequent blood glucose self‐monitoring or continuous glucose monitoring, neither of which were part of the study protocol. It would be valuable to carry out continuous glucose monitoring on a cohort of similar participants, looking to remove participant bias and potentially validate our findings. A further limitation of our hypoglycaemia analysis is that participants with low C‐peptide were younger (18.4 vs. 29.3 years), differences in care, and frequency of hypoglycaemia in the paediatric population may potentially influence our findings. Despite studying 69 cases aged under 18 years overall (median age 14 years), with 62 cases in the hypoglycaemia rate analysis, the number of people under 18 years with preserved C‐peptide was very low (6 of 69 and 4 of 62). Because of the absence of young children in the preserved C‐peptide group, our suggestion of potentially intensifying treatment in those with preserved C‐peptide is not applicable to children. This additionally raises the question of whether the high hypoglycaemia rate in young children is related directly to this lack of preserved C‐peptide in those diagnosed young, or to a mixture of metabolic and behavioural factors. The differences in age of study participants with and without preserved C‐peptide could potentially bias our findings of different insulin doses in those with low and high C‐peptide: many (51 of 151) of our low C‐peptide participants were in the pubertal age range (10–16 years), which can affect insulin requirements. However, when we excluded those between the ages of 10 and 16 years, the differences were similar: median daily insulin dose was 0.67 units/kg in the preserved group compared with 0.75 units/kg in the low group (n = 166, P = 0.1). A further limitation is that we were only able to obtain data on complications on participants based in the Exeter area, due to the availability of medical records. This reduced our power to identify differing rates of retinopathy and microalbuminuria, so we could not rule out smaller differences that may still be clinically relevant. The sample size for our complication analysis provided 80% power (α = 0.05), to detect a difference in proportions of 30% for both retinopathy and microalbuminuria, therefore meaningful differences in complications may not be detected with our limited sample size. A further limiting factor to this analysis was the selection criteria for our study, which excluded people with renal impairment, as C‐peptide is renally excreted and therefore less reflective of endogenous beta cell function in those with impaired renal function 20. Our study assessed endogenous insulin by measuring serum C‐peptide, and is therefore unable to differentiate between an association with preserved endogenous insulin, or a direct association with C‐peptide rather than endogenous insulin.

### Factitious hyperinsulinism leading to pancreatectomy: severe forms of munchausen syndrome by proxy [^115qUuTB]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical history and inappropriate insulin secretion during hypoglycemic episodes permit the diagnosis of hyperinsulinism. We report 2 cases of factitious hyperinsulinism leading to partial pancreatectomy. Case 1 was an 8-year-old girl who presented with severe hypoglycemia and elevated insulin and C-peptide levels. Catheterization of pancreatic veins was performed to localize the excess insulin secretion. Insulinoma was suspected, and partial pancreatectomy was performed. Ten days after surgery, severe hypoglycemia recurred with severely elevated plasma insulin levels (x100) but very low C-peptide plasma levels, suggesting factitious hyperinsulinemia. Hypoglycemic episodes before surgery were provoked by oral sulfonamides; postoperative episodes were caused by parenteral insulin. Falsified prescriptions for sulfonamides and insulin by the mother, a nurse, were found. Case 2 was a 6-month-old girl who presented with seizures and hypoglycemia but had a symptom-free interval of many months afterward. At 2 years of age, repeated hypoglycemic seizures and elevated insulin plasma levels suggested congenital hyperinsulinism. C-peptide plasma level, measured once, was normal, but blood sampling was performed 15 minutes after a hypoglycemic episode. Partial pancreatectomy was performed. Two weeks after surgery, hypoglycemic seizures recurred, and the patient was admitted for pancreatic vein catheterization. This investigation was performed during hypoglycemia and revealed high insulin levels and undetectable C-peptide levels, suggesting factitious hypoglycemia. Insulin/C-peptide ratio analysis is crucial to assess factitious hypoglycemia, although sulfonamide-induced hypoglycemia is not thereby detected. One percent (2 of 250) of all cases of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in our unit have been identified as Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Atypical disease history should raise the question of factitious hypoglycemia.

Research design and methods

Study subjects

Inclusion criteria to participate in the study were children and adolescent with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (< 18 years), with start of insulin treatment at admission, with informed consent to participate and followed regularly at Crown Princess Victoria Children's Hospital, Linköping, Sweden. Children with secondary diabetes and transition to non-insulin treatment during the years of follow-up were excluded from the study. All subjects were followed as part of clinical routine with measurements of residual beta-cell function at regular intervals from diagnosis until residual beta-cell function was undetectable. In order to study the difference between individuals with rapid or slow loss of residual beta-cell function, respectively, we included 50 subjects, some with rapid loss of C-peptide (n = 20), defined as having undetectable C-peptide (< 0.03 nmol/L) within 30 months after diagnosis and others who had residual function up to 6 years after diagnosis (n = 30).

The study subjects were born 1989–2007 and were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during the years 2004–2017. They were at diagnosis of the disease at an age of 10.6 ± 2.5 years, and 44% (n = 22) of them were male. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria for diagnosis and classification of type 1 diabetes. At diagnosis, all study subjects had been hospitalized at the Children's Hospital and started on multiple insulin injection therapy. Thereafter, they were followed by the diabetes team at regular visits. At the age of 18 years, the study subjects were transferred to a diabetes clinic for adults. In 14 of the study subjects some data were only available 4–6 years after diagnosis.

### Recognition, assessment and management of hypoglycaemia in childhood [^1123PU2V]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is frequent in children and prompt management is required to prevent brain injury. In this article we will consider hypoglycaemia in children after the neonatal period. The most common causes are diabetes mellitus and idiopathic ketotic hypoglycaemia (IKH) but a number of endocrine disorders and inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) need to be excluded. Elucidation of the diagnosis relies primarily on investigations during a hypoglycaemic episode but may also involve biochemical tests between episodes, dynamic endocrine tests and molecular genetics. Specific treatment such as cortisol replacement and pancreatic surgery may be required for endocrine causes of hypoglycaemia, such as adrenal insufficiency and congenital hyperinsulinism. In contrast, in IKH and most IEMs, hypoglycaemia is prevented by limiting the duration of fasting and maintaining a high glucose intake during illnesses.

### Recurrent hypoglycemia from insulin autoimmune syndrome [^112t8a1q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is an uncommon cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia characterized by autoantibodies to endogenous insulin in individuals without previous exposure to exogenous insulin. IAS is the third leading cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia in Japan, and is increasingly being recognized worldwide in non-Asian populations. We report a case of IAS in a Caucasian woman with recurrent complaints of hypoglycemia, with laboratory findings of serum glucose 2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL), insulin 54,930 pmol/L (7,909 μIU/mL), connecting peptide (C-peptide) 4,104 pmol/L (12.4 ng/mL), and a corresponding insulin to C-peptide molar ratio of 13.4 during a spontaneous hypoglycemic event. Autoantibodies to insulin were markedly elevated at > 50 kU/L (> 50 U/mL). IAS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic individuals. Distinction from insulinoma is especially crucial to prevent unwarranted invasive procedures and surgical interventions in hypoglycemic patients.

### Severe recurrent hypoglycaemia in a patient with aggressive melanoma [^115i3v8U]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present a case of hypoglycemia in a young patient without diabetes mellitus who presented initially with enlarging neck mass and weight loss, and was found to have aggressive melanoma with metastasis to multiple organs and diffuse lymphadenopathy. He had presented to the emergency room two times with neuroglycopenic symptoms that required admission and intravenous dextrose continuously. Evaluation of hypoglycemia included C-peptide, insulin levels, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I and -II, and ß- hydroxybutyrate. Insulin levels were suppressed appropriately during hypoglycemia, however, IGF-II:IGF-I ratio was high, suggesting non-islet tumour induced hypoglycemia. The presence of IGF-II produced by large tumors results in a low hepatic glucose output and increased uptake by skeletal muscle, resulting in hypoglycemia especially in a patient with extremely low appetite such as our patient. Treating the culprit malignancy leads to resolution of hypoglycemia, but corticosteroids have been used to suppress IGF-II levels and alleviate symptoms.

### Undiagnosed hypoglycaemia disorders in children detected when hypoglycaemia occurs in the setting of illness: a retrospective study [^117WNZDq]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The high frequency of hypoglycaemic disorders identified in this study underscores the critical importance of investigating children with hypoglycaemia during illness and argues against ascribing findings to prolonged starvation. Endocrinology should be consulted to guide the diagnostic evaluation. Young age and absence of ketosis and acidosis at presentation were identified as potential predictors. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^115WfwXh]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

During the first 24–48 hours of life, as normal neonates transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, their plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are typically lower than later in life. – Published guidelines for screening at-risk newborns and managing low PG concentrations in neonates focus on the immediate neonatal period, but do not address the diagnosis and management of disorders causing recurrent and prolonged hypoglycemia. – Distinguishing between transitional neonatal glucose regulation in normal newborns and hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important for prompt diagnosis and effective treatment to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury.

Moreover, the evaluation and management of pediatric hypoglycemia differ in several respects from that in adults, for whom guidelines were recently published. First, persistent hypoglycemia most often results from a congenital or genetic defect in regulating secretion of insulin, deficiency of cortisol and/or growth hormone, or defects in the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids. Second, it may be difficult to identify and distinguish newborn infants with a persistent hypoglycemia disorder from those with transitional low glucose levels in the initial 48 hours of life, as detailed in the separate document on transitional neonatal hypoglycemia prepared by our committee. Third, the first few months of life are the most vulnerable period for developmental disability, which occurs in ~25%–50% of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for preventing these sequelae. –

To address these deficiencies, the Pediatric Endocrine Society convened an expert panel of pediatric endocrinologists and neonatologists to develop guidelines for managing hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children, but excluding children with diabetes. The goals of these guidelines are to help physicians recognize persistent hypoglycemia disorders, guide their expeditious diagnosis and effective treatment, and prevent brain damage in at-risk babies.

Persistent hypoglycemia can have significant short and long term sequelae if not treated. Initial treatment to maintain euglycemia, until further diagnosis is available, is very important and includes providing adequate sources of glucose enterally or intravenously (the needed glucose infusion rate (GIR) in mg/kg/min should be calculated).

Neonates, infants, and children with hypoglycemia disorders — symptom thresholds and newborn physiology: Neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms usually occur when the PG concentration decreases to 50–70 mg/dL (2.8–3.9 mmol/L), and recurrent PG levels in this range may result in the development of HAAF, which increases the risk of subsequent hypoglycemia and attenuates its recognition; among high-risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder, the mean PG concentration in normal newborns during the first hours after birth (~55–60 mg/dL [~3 mmol/L]) is similar to the threshold for neurogenic symptoms in older children and adults but above the threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms.

### Best practice No 173: clinical and laboratory investigation of adult spontaneous hypoglycaemia [^117NZdbZ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Adult spontaneous hypoglycaemia is not a diagnosis per se but a manifestation of a disease. Although rare, it is important to identify spontaneous hypoglycaemia and its causes because treatment may be preventative or curative. Hypoglycaemia can occur as an epiphenomenon in many serious diseases. It is sufficient to recognise the disease's association with hypoglycaemia and then take appropriate action to prevent the recurrence of hypoglycaemia. In investigating apparently healthy individuals, common pitfalls to avoid are: failure to recognise subacute neuroglycopenia clinically; failure to document hypoglycaemia adequately during symptoms; failure to measure pancreatic hormones, counter-regulatory hormones, and ketones in hypoglycaemic samples; failure to recognise pre-analytical and analytical limitations of laboratory assays; and failure to abandon obsolete and inappropriate investigations. Providing these caveats are met, appropriate laboratory and radiological investigations will almost always uncover the cause of spontaneous hypoglycaemia.

### Hypoglycemia [^111ffDVL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Except in diabetic patients receiving insulin or sulfonylureas, hypoglycemia is a rare disorder. It is identified by modified Whipple's criteria consisting of neuroglycopenic symptoms, a blood glucose level equal to or less than 40 mg/dL, and relief of symptoms by glucose use. The sources of the body glucose are dietary intake, glycogenolysis, and [figure: see text] gluconeogenesis. The metabolism of glucose involves oxidation and storage as glycogen or fat. Causes of hypoglycemia include medications or toxins capable of decreasing blood glucose, disorders associated with fasting hypoglycemia, and postprandial hypoglycemic disorders. The most common type of hypoglycemia is insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics. Insulinoma is rare; however, it is the most common hormone-secreting islet cell tumor. The diagnosis is made by the occurrence of hypoglycemia in the presence of symptoms of neuroglycopenia and inappropriately high levels of insulin and C-peptide. In hospitalized patients, the diagnosis is best made by prolonged fast. Most insulinomas are small and require invasive methods for precise localization. In surreptitious insulin use, hypoglycemia is associated with low plasma C-peptide. Postprandial hypoglycemia occurs in response to feeding and is generally caused by excessive insulin effect. It is seen in patients with postgastric surgery and rarely in early diabetes mellitus. Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemia is rare and seems to be caused by subtle abnormalities of insulin response to food. Treatment of postprandial hypoglycemia consists of frequent small meals, with deletion of refined carbohydrate and increased protein intake. Primary treatment of insulinoma is surgical resection of the tumor.

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia — acute management: Any episode of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia should be rapidly corrected with IV dextrose infusion, with an initial dose of 200 mg/kg followed by infusion of 10% dextrose at a maintenance rate for age; in cases of hyperinsulinism, glucagon can be expected to raise PG concentration to normal or above within 10–15 minutes and to maintain that concentration for at least 1 hour, with doses of 0.5–1.0 mg given IV, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously usually effective, while lower doses (0.03 mg/kg) may carry less risk of transient nausea and vomiting but may be ineffective unless given IV.

Values — Because hypoglycemia disorders in older infants and children are uncommon, the recommendation to require the presence of Whipple's triad before undertaking an evaluation is used to avoid unnecessary risk and cost; for neonates and younger children in whom Whipple's triad cannot be applied, confirming a PG concentration at or below the neurogenic-symptom range is suggested, transitional hypoglycemia in normal newborns should be completely resolved before the usual time for discharge from the nursery at 2–3 days, and the committee emphasizes carefully excluding persistent hypoglycemia disorders before discharge to home in the small subset of high-risk neonates.

### Approach to the hypoglycemic patient [^1167r6Yw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia is commonly encountered in the emergency department. Patients can present with a myriad of symptoms and its presentation can mimic other more serious diagnoses. Despite the relative ease of its management, clinicians often miss the diagnosis or mismanage it even when discovered. Glucose is an important energy source for the brain and failing to recognize hypoglycemia or mismanaging it can lead to permanent neurologic disability or death. Although it is important to replenish glucose in a rapid fashion, it is equally important to discover and manage the underlying etiology to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

### Persistent C-peptide is associated with reduced hypoglycaemia but not hbAin adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes: evidence for lack of intensive treatment in UK clinical practice? [^114vViRP]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Most people with Type 1 diabetes have low levels of persistent endogenous insulin production. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that close to diagnosis preserved endogenous insulin was associated with lower HbA 1c, hypoglycaemia and complication rates, when intensively treated. We aimed to assess the clinical impact of persistent C-peptide on rate of hypoglycaemia and HbA 1c in those with long duration (> 5 years) Type 1 diabetes.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of 221 people (median age 24 years) with Type 1 diabetes. We confirmed ongoing endogenous insulin secretion by measuring C-peptide after a mixed-meal tolerance test. We compared self-reported hypoglycaemia (n = 160), HbA 1c, insulin dose and microvascular complications (n = 140) in those with preserved and low C-peptide.

Results

Stimulated median (IQR) C-peptide was 114 (43, 273) pmol/l and < 3 (< 3, < 3) pmol/l in those with preserved and low C-peptide respectively. Participants with preserved C-peptide had lower reported monthly rates of hypoglycaemia, with 21% fewer symptomatic episodes, 5.9 vs. 7.5 [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.79, P = 0.001], and 65% fewer asymptomatic episodes, 1.0 vs. 2.9 (IRR 0.35, P < 0.001). Those with preserved C-peptide had a lower insulin dose (0.68 vs. 0.81 units/kg, P = 0.01) but similar HbA 1c (preserved 69 vs. low 67 mmol/mol, P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Adults with Type 1 diabetes and preserved endogenous insulin production receiving usual care in the UK have lower daily insulin doses and fewer self-reported hypoglycaemic episodes, but no difference in HbA 1c. This is consistent with non-intensive treatment in previous studies, and suggests a need to consider therapy intensification to gain full benefit of preserved endogenous insulin.

### Low levels of C-peptide have clinical significance for established type 1 diabetes [^1158jh5i]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine whether the low C-peptide levels (< 50 pmol/l) produced by the pancreas for decades after onset of Type 1 diabetes have clinical significance.

Methods

We evaluated fasting C-peptide levels, duration of disease and age of onset in a large cross-sectional series (n = 1272) of people with Type 1 diabetes. We then expanded the scope of the study to include the relationship between C-peptide and HbA1c control (n = 1273), as well as diabetic complications (n = 324) and presence of hypoglycaemia (n = 323). The full range of C-peptide levels was also compared with 1,5-Anhydroglucitol, a glucose responsive marker.

Results

C-peptide levels declined for decades after diagnosis, and the rate of decline was significantly related to age of onset (P < 0.0001), after adjusting for disease duration. C-peptide levels > 10 pmol/l were associated with protection from complications (e.g. nephropathy, neuropathy, foot ulcers and retinopathy; P = 0.03). Low C-peptide levels were associated with poor metabolic control measured by HbA1c (P < 0.0001). Severe hypoglycaemia was associated with the lowest C-peptide levels compared with mild (P = 0.049) or moderate (P = 0.04) hypoglycaemia. All levels of measurable C-peptide were responsive to acute fluctuations in blood glucose levels as assessed by 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Low C-peptide levels have clinical significance and appear helpful in characterizing groups at-risk for faster C-peptide decline, complications, poorer metabolic control and severe hypoglycaemia. Low C-peptide levels may be a biomarker for characterizing at-risk patients with Type 1 diabetes.

### Reevaluation of a case of type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed before 6 months of age [^117P6mrT]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

A 17-year-old female was referred for the reassessment of her type 1 diabetes mellitus, with which she had been diagnosed at the age of 15 weeks owing to symptoms of ketoacidosis. The patient had mild learning difficulties, which resulted in her requiring additional support at school. There was no family history of diabetes.

Investigations

Measurements of plasma C-peptide and glutamate decarboxylase autoantibodies. Molecular genetic testing was performed.

Diagnosis

Intermediate developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes mellitus (DEND) syndrome as a result of a 59V > M Kir6.2 mutation.

Management

Treatment with high-dose oral glibenclamide replaced insulin treatment. Good glycemic control was achieved with levels of HbA(1c) consistently below 6.5% and no hypoglycemia.

### Exercise induced hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinism [^111XJPWi]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperinsulinism in childhood is often caused by genetic defects involving the regulation of insulin secretion leading to recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia. We report two patients with exercise induced hypoglycaemia.

Methods

Standardised short exercise tests with frequent blood glucose and plasma insulin measurements were performed in the patients and young healthy controls.

Results

Short term exercise resulted in insulin induced hypoglycaemia 15 to 50 minutes after the end of exercise. A massive burst of insulin secretion was observed within a few minutes of the start of exercise in both patients. By contrast glucose and insulin concentrations remained unchanged in healthy controls.

Conclusions

Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia after moderate physical exercise represents a rarely described phenotype of hyperinsulinism with an as yet unknown defect in the regulation of insulin secretion. It should be suspected in individuals with recurrent exercise related syncope or disturbance of consciousness.

### Intramuscular autotransplantation of pancreatic islets in a 7-year-old child: a 2-year follow-up [^112Krc5v]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

A 7-year-old girl with severe hereditary pancreatitis underwent total pancreatectomy. A total of 160,000 islet equivalents (6400 islet/kg) were transplanted to the brachioradialis muscle of the right forearm. Her plasma C-peptide level was undetectable after pancreatectomy but increased to 1.37 ng/mL after 17 days; at this time point, her insulin requirement was 0.75 units of insulin/kg/day. At 5- and 27-months, her hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and insulin requirements were 4.5 and 5.3% and 0.3 and 0.18 units/kg/day, respectively. Basal and stimulated C-peptide levels were 0.67 ± 0.07 and 3.36 ± 1.37 ng/mL, respectively. Stimulated insulin levels were 30% higher in the islet-bearing arm compared to the contralateral arm after glucagon stimulation. After surgery and islet transplantation, the quality of life improved dramatically and she gained 8 kg of weight. In summary, a normal HbA1c, a low insulin requirement and the absence of recurrent hypoglycemia and the gradient of insulin between the arms indicate that the intramuscularly transplanted islets contribute to a long-term clinically significant metabolic control.

### Residual β-cell function 3–6 years after onset of type 1 diabetes reduces risk of severe hypoglycemia in children and adolescents [^116MmD7w]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The study cohort of 342 children comprised 169 girls and 173 boys. The group included 61% of the total eligible population of Danish children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes for 3–6 years at the time of the study. Median age at type 1 diabetes onset was 9.2 years (interquartile range, 6.2–11.5); median age at inclusion in the study was 13.6 years (interquartile range, 10.8–15.7). Median diabetes duration was 4.2 years (interquartile range, 3.7–5.0). Four children were non-Caucasian and one child had a Danish father and a Philippine mother. Twenty-seven percent of the patients were treated by two insulin injections per day, 61% were treated by multiple subcutaneous insulin injections, and 12% were treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin injections. Patient characteristics stratified for C-peptide < 0.04 nmol/L or > 0.04 nmol/L are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of the 342 patients by RBF as assessed by stimulated C-peptide

RBF after 3–6 years of type 1 diabetes

A total of 160 patients (46.8%) had detectable levels of meal-stimulated C-peptide (≥ 0.01 nmol/L); of these, 134 (39.2%) also had detectable levels of C-peptide during the fasting state, leaving 26 patients with only detectable meal-stimulated C-peptide. A strong correlation between fasting and meal-stimulated C-peptide levels was demonstrated (Spearman ρ = 0.93; P < 0.01). Ninety-two patients (27%) had meal-stimulated C-peptide concentrations (RBF) of > 0.04 nmol/L. Of these, 65 patients (19%) had RBF between 0.04 and 0.2 nmol/L (low-RBF) and 27 patients (8%) had RBF > 0.2 nmol/L (high-RBF). Eighty patients (23.3%) had stimulated RBF > 0.06 nmol/L. There was no sex difference in RBF. Older age at diabetes onset increased the probability of having stimulated RBF > 0.04 nmol/L, but 11% of children with diabetes onset before 7 years of age had stimulated RBF > 0.04 nmol/L at 3–6 years after diabetes onset (Table 1). Long diabetes duration increased the probability of having RBF < 0.04 nmol/L (Table 1).

### Hypoglycemia in patients with congenital muscle disease [^111o2Hdg]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level below 60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/L) in infants and children, has been reported sporadically in children with neuromuscular disease. Bruce et al. described two girls with spinal muscular atrophy type II (muscle mass only 10% of body weight) with recurrent, severe hypoglycemic episodes that went unrecognized until the girls became comatose and were found to have blood glucose levels of 30–34 mg/dl (1.7–1.9 mmol/L) and metabolic acidosis. In one girl (case #2), hypoglycemia frequently developed in the morning after fasting overnight. Shu et al. reported a similar case; a 7-year-old boy with congenital muscular dystrophy with hypoglycemic episodes both upon awakening and during the course of viral illnesses. A 34-h fasting study in 9 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy did not precipitate hypoglycemia, however these patients demonstrated lower alanine levels, suggesting a decreased reserve of gluconeogenic substrate from muscle. Reports of hypoglycemia are equally rare among adults with neuromuscular disease. Importantly, the incidence of hypoglycemia among adults and children with neuromuscular disease has not been systematically investigated.

It has been proposed that low muscle mass in the context of muscle atrophy predisposes children with neuromuscular disorders to hypoglycemia. In healthy children, glucose levels can be maintained by hepatic glycogenolysis during periods of fasting for approximately 8–12 h. As glycogen stores are depleted, however, amino acids derived from the breakdown of muscle tissue become essential substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis. In the glucose-alanine cycle, for example, alanine is released into the bloodstream by skeletal muscle and taken up by the liver. There, it is converted to pyruvate which then enters the gluconeogenic pathway, creating glucose that can be shuttled back to muscle as an energy source. Thus, when a patient with low muscle mass fasts or has increased energy requirements (e.g. during illness), he/she may be at risk for developing hypoglycemia due to inadequate gluconeogenic substrate from muscle. This risk is compounded in children because of their limited hepatic glycogen stores compared with adults.

In this retrospective study, we identified 10 patients with a confirmed molecular or clinical and immunohistological diagnosis of congenital muscular dystrophy or congenital myopathy who experienced at least one episode of documented hypoglycemia. We report the frequency, common triggers, and symptoms associated with hypoglycemia episodes as well as any accompanying biochemical abnormalities available. We suggest that these patients deserve prompt evaluation of glucose levels when presenting with signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and routine evaluation of glucose homeostasis.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^117Db16t]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to the above considerations, measurement of plasma insulin and proinsulin concentrations is necessary to establish the pathogenesis of fasting hypoglycemia. The diagnosis of an islet cell tumor is based on the persistence of inappropriately increased plasma insulin concentrations in the face of a low glucose concentration. In addition, an increase in the ratio of fasting proinsulin to insulin in patients with hypoglycemia strongly suggests the presence of an islet cell tumor. The absence of these associated changes in glucose, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations in an individual with fasting hypoglycemia makes the diagnosis of an islet cell tumor most unlikely, and alternative explanations should be sought for the inability to maintain fasting euglycemia.

Measurement of the C-peptide response to intravenous glucagon can aid in instances in which it is difficult to differentiate between the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Even in this clinical situation, however, the response to drug therapy will provide useful information, and measurement of C-peptide may not be clinically necessary. Measurement of C-peptide is essential in the investigation of possible factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration.

In the past, some advocated insulin assays in the evaluation and management of patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with this syndrome manifest insulin resistance by androgen excess, as well as by abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism; both abnormalities may respond to treatment with metformin or thiazolidinediones. Although clinical trials have generally evaluated insulin resistance by using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, ratios of fasting glucose to insulin, and other modalities, the optimal laboratory evaluation of these patients in routine clinical care has not been clearly defined. It is unclear whether assessing insulin resistance through insulin measurement has any advantage over assessment of physical signs of insulin resistance (BMI, presence of acanthosis nigricans), and routine measurements of insulin are not recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

### Assessment and management of anti-insulin autoantibodies in varying presentations of insulin autoimmune syndrome [^116dS48a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) features hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to insulin autoantibodies in exogenous insulin-naive individuals. IAS presents with recurrent postabsorptive or fasting hypoglycemia, alternating with postprandial hyperglycemia, due to "buffering" by autoantibodies, which sequester insulin in immune complexes during the acute phase of insulin secretion, only to release it slowly later, at physiologically inappropriate times.

IAS cannot easily be distinguished on clinical grounds from tumoral or other forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, which includes hypoglycemia caused by surreptitious insulin administration. Altered kinetics of insulin clearance in the presence of antibody binding also commonly skews insulin/C-peptide molar ratios upward, sometimes dramatically so, as insulin clearance is delayed while C-peptide clearance is unaffected. As insulin/C-peptide molar ratios are often used to discriminate exogenous from endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, this raises the risk that maleficent insulin use may be erroneously diagnosed, with potentially decisive implications for criminal and child custody proceedings.

Anti–insulin antibody (IA) assays are not standardized and yield variable, qualitative, or semiquantitative results; moreover, detection of IA does not prove the presence of circulating insulin-antibody complexes. Methods currently used to confirm hormone-antibody complexes include precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is not specific, and gel filtration chromatography (GFC), which may be used in conjunction with ex vivo addition of insulin to enhance sensitivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) methods now offer quantification of insulin that is more robust in the face of antihormone antibody interference than immunoassay.

Effective use of different immunosuppressive regimens in IAS has been described, including prednisolone, hydrocortisone, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rituximab, and plasmapheresis, but no consensus exists about optimal therapy. We now extend experience by presenting clinical and biochemical characteristics of six patients with varying presentations of IAS and responses to immunosuppression.

Prevention of DKA

Prevention of DKA at onset is most dramatically demonstrated when early diagnosis is made through genetic and immunologic screening of high-risk children. For the general population, an example has been provided by the Italian School and Physician Awareness Program directed at 6–14-year-olds, which reduced the rates of new-onset DKA from 78% to nearly 0% over 6 yearsMaterials used in this effort are available online.

In the 1970s, a comprehensive approach involving outreach clinics, frequent routine and emergency telephone contact, and a camping program supported by state funding for children with special healthcare needs dramatically reduced recurrent DKA episodes. Private patients in the program had a reduction in hospital admission days from preintervention of 2.8/patient/year to 0.3 and in the second year to 0. The children sponsored by the state program had a reduction from 4.9/patient/year to 1.8 and in the second year to 0.9.

Patients with compliance problems account for a disproportionate number of recurrent DKA episodes. In the UK surveillance study, 4.8% of patients accounted for 22.5% of all episodesand as noted above, 20% of patients in Colorado accounted for 80% of recurrent DKA episodes. The principal immediate reason for the recurrent DKA in children and adolescents is insulin omission, reflected in low or absent levels of free insulin. The necessity for assuring administration of insulin by responsible adults is critical.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^1127LEco]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children — clinical context and risks: During the first 24–48 hours of life, plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are typically lower than later in life, and distinguishing transitional neonatal glucose regulation from hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury. Persistent hypoglycemia most often results from a congenital or genetic defect in regulating secretion of insulin, deficiency of cortisol and/or growth hormone, or defects in the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids, and it may be difficult to identify and distinguish affected newborns in the initial 48 hours of life. The first few months of life are the most vulnerable period for developmental disability, which occurs in ~25%-50% of children with congenital hyperinsulinism, and early recognition and treatment are crucial for preventing these sequelae. The goals of these guidelines are to help physicians recognize persistent hypoglycemia disorders, guide their expeditious diagnosis and effective treatment, and prevent brain damage in at-risk babies.

### Undiagnosed hypoglycaemia disorders in children detected when hypoglycaemia occurs in the setting of illness: a retrospective study [^11623KKW]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Incidental detection of hypoglycaemia during childhood illness commonly occurs following prolonged starvation, in which glucose utilisation exceeds glucose supply. Rarely, it may be the initial presentation of an underlying hypoglycaemia disorder wherein missing the diagnosis carries a high risk of harm. The reported prevalence of undiagnosed hypoglycaemia disorders among children seen in the emergency department for any reason ranges between 10% and 28%. However, these studies were not limited to children presenting with acute illness. Consequently, whether children with hypoglycaemia detected during acute illness require an endocrine workup remains controversial. We sought to evaluate the yield of conducting an evaluation when hypoglycaemia occurs in this setting and to describe the clinical and biochemical features of those children ultimately found to have underlying pathology.

Assessment of hypoglycaemia

Participants completed a modified Clarke's hypoglycaemia questionnaire to assess rate and awareness of hypoglycaemia at the time of mixed‐meal tolerance test. The questionnaire is comprised of eight multiple choice questions, with answers being scored as 0 (aware) or 1 (reduced awareness). The maximum score is 7 and a score > 4 indicates reduced hypoglycaemic awareness 22. Rates of hypoglycaemia were determined by response to questions 5 and 6, they record frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes in the last month (defined as blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/l) with and without symptoms during the episode respectively, as described previously 23. Frequency of episodes was taken as a monthly average; those answering '1–3 episodes in the last month' were averaged to 2, 'once a week' to 4 (1 × 4), '2–3 episodes per week' to 10 (2.5 × 4), '4–5 episodes per week' to 18 (4.5 × 4), and 'almost daily' to 25.

Assessment of HbA 1c and microvascular complications

HbA 1c was measured at the study visit and a historic HbA 1c mean calculated from a local laboratory records. With informed consent we collected historic glycaemic control data from a biochemistry laboratory download of all recorded samples over the preceding 12 years in participants from our local area. HbA 1c was measured at this time using ion exchange chromatography HPLC on the TOSOH G8 analyser (TOSOH Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) and standardized to IFCC. Historic HbA 1c mean was calculated for each participant from all available results prior to recruitment [median (IQR) of 18 (12, 26) observations over 8 (5, 10) years].

For participants from our local area, clinical data on microvascular complications were obtained from hospital laboratory and retinal screening records. These records were not available for participants whose general practice used the laboratory and retinal screening service of other regional hospitals. Retinopathy status was obtained from the participant's most recent retinal screening record. The worst grade of retinopathy identified at the retinal screening visit prior to recruitment was recorded. Nephropathy status was defined according to whether an individual had ever had clinically defined microalbuminuria, as based on their biochemistry records. Microalbuminuria was defined as having two of three consecutive albumin to creatinine ratios high (> 2.5 mg/mmol for men and > 3.5 mg/mmol for women).

Incidence of severe hypoglycemia

We observed the same high frequencies of severe hypoglycemia in the group with no detectable C-peptide as in the group with C-peptide < 0.04 nmol/L (Table 2). In the group with C-peptide > 0.04 but < 0.2 nmol/L (low-RBF), and in the group with C-peptide > 0.2 nmol/L (high-RBF), the frequency of severe hypoglycemia was considerably lower (Table 2). The incidence of severe hypoglycemic episodes in the low-RBF and high-RBF groups was 7.6 ± 2.8 per 100 patients, whereas in the non-RBF group it was 17.6 ± 2.4 per 100 participants (Table 1). Hence, the odds ratio (OR) for having a hypoglycemic incident in the non-RBF group compared with the low-RBF and high-RBF groups was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.10–7.08; P < 0.03). When adjusting for age, diabetes duration, sex, HbA 1c level, daily insulin requirement, and insulin administration technique, logistic regression analysis revealed an adjusted OR of 2.65 (95% CI, 1.10–6.35; P < 0.03). Mean HbA 1c in the group with hypoglycemia did not differ from that in the group without hypoglycemia (8.47 ± 0.17% [69.1 ± 1.9 mmol/mol] vs. 8.31 ± 0.08% [67.3 ± 0.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.44). Mean daily insulin dose for the group with hypoglycemia was not different from that for the group without hypoglycemia (1.08 ± 0.04 units/kg/day vs. 1.06 ± 0.02 units/kg/day; P = 0.74).

### Biomarkers of insulin for the diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infants and children [^117HjvEd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate thresholds of various biomarkers for defining excess insulin activity to recognize congenital hyperinsulinism.

Study Design

This was a retrospective chart review of diagnostic fasting tests in children with ketotic hypoglycemia (n = 30) and genetically/pathology confirmed congenital hyperinsulinism (n = 28). Sensitivity and specificity for congenital hyperinsulinism were determined for plasma insulin, β-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids (FFA), C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and the glycemic response to glucagon (through the glucagon stimulation test [GST]) at the time of hypoglycemia.

Results

Only 23 of the 28 subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism had detectable insulin (median, 6.7 μIU/mL), and insulin was undetectable in all subjects with ketotic hypoglycemia. Compared with ketotic hypoglycemia, subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism had higher GST values (57 vs 13 mg/dL; ΔGST ≥ 30 mg/dL in 24 of 27 subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism vs 0 of 30 subjects with ketotic hypoglycemia) and C-peptide levels (1.55 vs 0.11 ng/mL), with lower levels of FFA (0.82 vs 2.51 mM) and IGFBP-1 (59.5 vs 634 ng/mL). At the time of hypoglycemia, the upper limits of β-hydroxybutyrate and FFA in subjects with congenital hyperinsulinism were higher than reported previously (β-hydroxybutyrate < 1.8 mM and FFA < 1.7 mM), providing the best sensitivity for congenital hyperinsulinism vs ketotic hypoglycemia. A C-peptide level ≥ 0.5 ng/mL was 89% sensitive and 100% specific, and an IGFBP-1 level ≤ 110 ng/mL was 85% sensitive and 96.6% specific.

Conclusion

Because low or undetectable insulin level during hypoglycemia does not exclude the diagnosis of hyperinsulinism, C-peptide and IGFBP-1 may inform the diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism. In this group of children with well-defined congenital hyperinsulinism, thresholds for "suppressed" β-hydroxybutyrate and FFA are higher than previously reported levels.

### Association of low fasting C-peptide levels with cardiovascular risk, visit-to-visit glucose variation and severe hypoglycemia in the veterans affairs diabetes trial (VADT) [^1171z97u]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast, those with low C-peptide levels were less obese, had relatively normal lipid levels, and required more frequent use of insulin; thus, this group appeared to share more type 1 diabetes characteristics. Consistent with our finding of higher CVD risk in our low C-peptide group, individuals with type 1 diabetes with greater beta-cell damage (as indicated by lower C-peptide levels) are at higher risk of diabetes complications. Similar to type 1 diabetes, reduced beta-cell function in our low C-peptide group manifested in higher glucose variation and rates of severe hypoglycemia.

Our results suggest that this phenotype (with some type 1 diabetes features) may be present in a surprising portion of patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. Consistent with the relatively more type 1 diabetes phenotype, the fasting C-peptide levels in the lower range indicated a beta-cell dysfunction not too dissimilar from type 1 diabetes (typically < 0.25 nmol/l). Some of these individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes may deserve to be classified within other diabetes subtypes, including hybrid forms of diabetes; slowly evolving, immune-mediated diabetes of adults, previously known as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA); ketone-prone diabetes (KPD) or monogenic defects of β-cell function. In a nested case–control cohort from the ACCORD trial, those with low C-peptide levels had higher rates of testing positive for several islet antibodies and increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. These findings of a spectrum of phenotypes within the broader category of type 2 diabetes is consistent with growing genetic evidence of sub-phenotypes of diabetes. Recognition of these differences may affect medication selection and other health care decisions. For example, use of insulin sensitizers in this low C-peptide group may be less useful than insulin or compounds promoting insulin secretion. Although insulin supplementation may be appropriate in these individuals to improve glycemic control, it will also increase the risk of hypoglycemia and, as discussed above, may not limit glucose variation. This may therefore also be a group that may benefit more from use of continuous glucose monitoring to better adjust treatment regimens to reduce hypoglycemia and glucose fluctuations. Finally, adding medications with known cardioprotective action may help reduce the risk of CVD in this relatively higher risk group.

### Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency is a cause of long-fasting hypoglycemia [^112QvHH4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVE/CONTEXT: Long-fasting hypoglycemia in children may be induced by neurotransmitter disorders.

Case Report

A 5-year-old girl with a medical history of chronic diarrhea presented three episodes of severe hypoglycemia (20 mg/dL) between ages 3 and 5 years. She became pale and sweaty with hypothermia (33.5°C), bradycardia (45 bpm), and acidosis and presented a generalized seizure. During the 17-hour fast test performed to determine the etiology of her hypoglycemia, insulin and C-peptide were appropriately low, and human GH, IGF-I, cortisol, amino acids, and acylcarnitines were in the usual range for fasting duration. However, the presence of vanillactic and vanilpyruvic acids in urine led us to investigate the metabolism of dopamine and serotonin in the cerebrospinal fluid. Indeed, these results indicated an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency that impairs the synthesis of serotonin, dopamine, and catecholamines. The diagnosis was confirmed by the low aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme activity in plasma (5 pmol/min/mL; reference value, 20–130) and the presence of two heterozygous mutations, c.97G > C (p.V33L, inherited from her father) and c.1385G > C (p.R462P, inherited from her mother) in the DCC gene. She was supplemented with pyridoxine and raw cornstarch (1 g/kg) at evening dinner to reduce the night fast. The episodes of hypoglycemia and the chronic diarrhea were suppressed.

Conclusion

Here is the first case report of long-fasting hypoglycemia due to a nontypical AADC deficiency. Hypoglycemia was severe, but the other neurological clinical hallmarks present in AADC-deficient patients were mild to moderate. Thus, neurotransmitter disorders should be considered in any patients presenting hypoglycemia with urine excretion of vanillactic acid.

### Extremes of clinical and enzymatic phenotypes in children with hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase activating mutations [^1128iBCe]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Patients.

Child 1 is a 17-year-old male subject who had a large-for-gestational-age birth weight of 4.8 kg at term. Hypoglycemia was detected in the first hour after delivery, and high rates of intravenous glucose infusion were required to control blood glucose levels (18 mg · kg −1 · min −1; normal < 5–6). Plasma insulin levels at times of hypoglycemia were found to be elevated (8–15 μU/ml; normal < 3). He was not fully responsive to diazoxide, defined as being able to fast > 12 h with blood glucose of > 70 mg/dl. However, treatment with a high dose of diazoxide (20 mg · kg −1 · day −1) and feedings every 4 h prevented symptoms of hypoglycemia, although plasma glucose levels remained largely between 2.8 and 3.3 mmol/l (50–60 mg/dl). There were no family members with hypoglycemia.

At 1 year of age, he was referred to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia because of persistently low plasma glucose values of 2.2–3.3 mmol/l (40–60 mg/dl). A trial of octreotide gave only transient improvement in control of hypoglycemia. Because of persistent hypoglycemia at 23 months of age, a 95% pancreatectomy was performed; however, this failed to control hypoglycemia. Diazoxide treatment was retried, but plasma glucose fell to 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) after only 5 h of fasting. Treatment consisted of feedings given frequently, day and night. Despite the low levels of plasma glucose, hypoglycemic symptoms rarely occurred, mainly triggered by exercise or high-carbohydrate feedings. His parents report that his hypoglycemia appeared to improve after age 11 years, and nighttime feedings were stopped. However, they also report that he now has occasional hyperglycemia after meals, suggestive of mild glucose intolerance. Currently, child 1 has normal school performance.

### Lack of association between residual insulin production and glucagon response to hypoglycemia in youth with short duration of type 1 diabetes [^116JURiK]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As we anticipated, approximately one-third of our youngsters had subnormal plasma glucagon responses to hypoglycemia and four of the seven lost glucagon responsiveness altogether. We also expected to see a progressive decline in the glucagon response over time during the first year of T1D, but our cross-sectional results did not demonstrate such a relationship. These findings are similar to those recently reported by Siafarikas et al. who also found that glucagon responses to hypoglycemia are commonly lost during the first year of diabetes in adolescents with T1D.

Based on the intraislet hypothesis, we had expected that loss of residual β-cell function, as reflected by a reduction in stimulated C-peptide levels using the gold-standard MMTT, would be associated with a corresponding loss of glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. However, in contrast to the loss of glucagon responses to hypoglycemia, the C-peptide response to the MMTT was surprisingly well preserved during the first year of T1D, with fasting baseline C-peptide levels of ≥ 0.2 nmol/L in all but three subjects and meal-stimulated values ≥ 0.2 nmol/L in all but one subject. Consequently, in the group of diabetic subjects as a whole there was no significant correlation between the magnitude of the increase in plasma glucagon to hypoglycemia and the MMTT-stimulated C-peptide level. Even more important, peak stimulated C-peptide values ranged between 0.54 and 1.12 nmol/L in the four patients who had negligible plasma glucagon responses, whereas the one patient with very low basal and stimulated C-peptide levels had a rise in plasma glucagon that was within the nondiabetic range.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

25% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of acute symptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia in the neonate or older infant to restore depressed blood glucose levels and control symptoms. Other drugs, such as epinephrine and glucagon, should be considered in patients unresponsive or intolerant to dextrose (glucose). Oral feeding of dextrose may be necessary in infants with frequently recurring hypoglycemic episodes or to prevent recurrences due to hyperinsulinemia.

25% Dextrose Injection also provides a minimal source of carbohydrate calories.

### Factitious hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with diabetes [^113iWozS]. Pediatric Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Factitious hypoglycemia is a condition of self-induced hypoglycemia due to surreptitious administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. In adults, it is an uncommon, but well known clinical entity observed in individuals with and without diabetes.

Objectives

To report a case of factitious hypoglycemia highlighting diagnostic pitfalls, to identify common characteristics of children and adolescents with factitious hypoglycemia, and to examine whether the information on long-term outcome exists.

Methods

We present a case of an adolescent with type 1 diabetes who had self-induced hypoglycemia of several years' duration; and we conducted a systematic literature review on factitious hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with diabetes.

Results

We identified a total of 83 articles of which 14 met the inclusion criteria (describing 39 cases). All but 1 individual had type 1 diabetes and the majority was female (63%). Average age was 13.5 ± 2.0years with the youngest patient presenting at the age 9.5years. Blood glucose control was poor (hemoglobin A1c: 12.1 ± 4.0%). In 35%, psychiatric disorders were mentioned as contributing factors. Only 3 reports provided follow-up beyond 6 months.

Conclusions

Factitious hypoglycemia typically occurs in adolescents with type 1 diabetes who use insulin to induce hypoglycemia. Awareness of this differential diagnosis and knowledge of potentially misleading laboratory results may facilitate earlier recognition and intervention. Little information exists on effective treatments and long-term outcome.

### C-peptide determination in the diagnosis of type of diabetes and its management: a clinical perspective [^113fMF14]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Total loss of endogenous insulin secretion is a quite different condition when compared with even minimal maintenance of residual secretion, which translates into important clinical differences in type 1 diabetes regarding glycaemic control, metabolic status and risk of late vascular complications. Unmeasurable C‐peptide or its concentrations of less than 0.05‐0.10 nmol/L (note the detection level can vary according to different assays), indicates nearly total endogenous insulin deficiency, and the need for exogenous insulin replacement. Total insulin deficiency is associated with a greater risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), greater difficulty in maintaining HbA1c at less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) because of high glucose variability, as well as a higher risk of hypoglycaemia. On the other hand, C‐peptide concentrations above 0.10‐0.20 nmol/L translate into less difficult glycaemic control, lower glycaemic variability and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. In this regard, Rickels et al. recently showed that higher C‐peptide (defined as peak MMTT C‐peptide > 0.40 nmol/L) is associated with more time in range and lower mean blood glucose. In the same study, people with higher C‐peptide also had a greater glucagon response than people with very low C‐peptide (i.e. those with peak MMTT C‐peptide < 0.007 nmol/L). This finding is consistent with another study showing significantly higher glucagon concentrations during hyperinsulinaemic stepwise hypoglycaemic clamps among people with type 1 diabetes with detectable (≥ 0.05 nmol/L) compared with undetectable C‐peptide. As a result, people with type 1 diabetes and preserved C‐peptide experience fewer hypoglycaemia events than their counterparts with undetectable C‐peptide. Notably, however, residual insulin micro‐secretion (defined as peak C‐peptide levels > 0.03 nmol/L after a MMTT) did not influence peak glucagon levels after a MMTT, suggesting that the few remaining functioning beta cells may be unable to exert an efficient paracrine action to halt the inappropriate glucagon secretion in response to meals observed in people with type 1 diabetes. A recent, large study of more than 6000 people with type 1 diabetes with unsatisfactory glycaemic control (HbA1c 8.0%‐8.5%, 63‐68 mmol/mol) over an average period of 5.2 years, has shown that fasting C‐peptide of more than 0.20 nmol/L, compared with fasting C‐peptide of less than 0.005 nmol/L, is associated with lower insulin requirement, lower HbA1c and a reduced risk of DKA and hypoglycaemia. Of note, in terms of hypoglycaemia risk, a continuous relationship with hypoglycaemic episodes down to the limit of C‐peptide detection (0.003 nmol/L) was found. These interesting observations may result from the buffering activity of a minimally maintained endogenous insulin secretion on glucose homeostasis, emphasizing the importance of therapeutic efforts to minimize loss of endogenous insulin secretion over time in type 1 diabetes. Despite the documented benefits of residual C‐peptide in the type 1 diabetes population, detectable C‐peptide was not associated with significant benefits in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes in terms of pregnancy outcomes.

Neuroendocrine defenses and injury risk — The first defense against falling PG is suppression of insulin secretion when PG falls below the normal postabsorptive mean of ~85 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L); a further reduction to 65–70 mg/dL (3.6–3.9 mmol/L) elicits glucagon secretion and activation of the sympathoadrenal system, and at a PG concentration < 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L), plasma cortisol and growth hormone levels increase; because the brain has only a few minutes worth of stored fuel reserves, interruption of glucose delivery can have devastating consequences and severe and prolonged hypoglycemia can cause permanent brain injury.

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia: learning from claims [^116aNS2F]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

The majority of babies make successful metabolic adaptation to postnatal nutrition without developing clinically significant hypoglycaemia.
When there are risk factors for impaired metabolic adaptation, there must be monitoring and management to prevent progression to clinically significant hypoglycaemia.
Treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia associated with abnormal clinical signs is a clinical emergency.

What this study adds?

Cases of neonatal hypoglycaemia sufficiently severe to cause brain injury and resulting in litigation are rare.
In these rare cases, in addition to human costs to the family, there are enormous financial costs to the NHS in terms of payments against claims.
Despite standard texts and guidelines, deficits in clinical care result in delayed diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglycaemia.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^112APhXu]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Normal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations — neonates, infants, and children — After the first 48 hours of life, mean PG in the postabsorptive state in normal neonates and in infants and children does not differ from adults at 70–100 mg/dL, although children under age 4 years may have a PG concentration < 70 mg/dL and lethargy and tachycardia in fatty acid oxidation defects are observed when PG decreases to 60–70 mg/dL. In normal newborns shortly after birth, the mean PG threshold for suppression of insulin secretion is ~55–65 mg/dL, compared with ~80–85 mg/dL in older infants, children, and adults; by 72 hours of age PG is similar to older infants and children, therefore the standards for normal neonates must never be extrapolated beyond 2–3 days after birth, and we suggest delaying diagnostic evaluations until 2–3 days after birth.

### Emergency evaluation of syncope in children… [^1154x8uk]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem in children presenting to emergency departments. Before adolescence, about 15 percent of children have at least one episode of sudden transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous recovery. The cause usually is benign but may reflect significant cardiac, neurologic, or metabolic pathology. Massin and associates evaluated the medical records of a series of children presenting to an emergency department with syncope beginning in 1998. Participants were followed passively through their medical records until the summer of 2003 to identify further information that may have been related to the initial syncopal episode. Among the 226 patients who had 252 presentations to the emergency department for syncope, 144 were discharged directly, and 82 were admitted to the hospital. Neurocardiogenic syncope was the most common diagnosis, with neurologic problems being identified in 21 patients.

Cardiac problems were identified in five patients; in the remaining patients, psychogenic problems, breath-holding spells, or intoxication through poisoning or drug overdose was determined to be the cause of syncope, with isolated cases of obstructive respiratory disease, hypoglycemia, and aplastic crisis. Recurrence was associated with psychogenic and cardiac causes. Physical examinations were normal in 218 children, although cardiovascular and neurologic findings were useful in a small group of patients. The authors conclude that a careful history focusing on events leading up to the syncopal episode and a complete physical examination seem to direct the choice of appropriate diagnostic testing. If the initial work-up does not reveal the diagnosis, close follow-up may clarify it. Psychiatric disorders should be considered in children with neurocardiogenic syncope.

### Classification, diagnosis, and treatment of syncope… [^115AyPRN]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurally-mediated syncopes are most commonly reflex in type and consist of a transient disturbance in the autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure. They occur at any age, but most commonly in toddlers and in children between 9 and 14 years of age. Characteristically, the child is either sitting or standing, and suffers dizziness, nausea, and pallor, followed by loss of tone and consciousness. Hypotension and/or bradycardia result in cerebral hypoxia and, when severe, an anoxic seizure and incontinence. The reflex anoxic seizure resembles a pallid breath-holding attack in a toddler and consists of opisthotonus and twitching. Unlike an epileptiform discharge, the electroencephalographic record is flat during a reflex anoxic seizure.
