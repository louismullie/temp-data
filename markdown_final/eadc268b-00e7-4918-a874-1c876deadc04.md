Please write a brief overview paragraph of the preoperative assessment for hand surgery.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a brief overview paragraph of the preoperative assessment for hand surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about foundational risk stratification and the role of history/physical examination. Then, I should verify diabetes optimization and HbA1c thresholds. Next, I will review when cardiac evaluation is warranted for non-cardiac surgery. After that, I need to check timing and workup for preoperative anemia. I will then examine the utility of routine versus targeted laboratory testing. I should confirm indications for antibiotic prophylaxis in clean elective hand surgery. I will also ensure wrong-site prevention specifics for hand procedures are addressed. Finally, I will consider patient-centered expectation setting, opioid stewardship, and timing of preassessment to optimize modifiable risks.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: a thorough history and physical anchored to the planned procedure, baseline comorbidities, and functional capacity, with formal risk stratification using ASA class given its association with complications in hand surgery; ASA III–IV independently predicts higher surgical site complications, and overall 30-day complication rates after hand surgery hover around 2–3%, which helps calibrate baseline risk and the need for further optimization [^115hastE].

> Now, diabetes and glycemic optimization — wait, let me verify the threshold and the evidence base. I should confirm a recent HbA1c if not measured within 3 months and consider postponing elective surgery, when safe, if HbA1c is 8.5% or higher, which aligns with ESC 2022 guidance; importantly, while older systematic reviews suggest limited high-quality data that routine preoperative glucose/HbA1c testing improves outcomes in otherwise healthy adults, hand-specific data indicate higher infection risk in insulin-dependent diabetes and potential value of optimization, so I need to ensure decisions are individualized rather than algorithmic [^111q4ziN] [^112htTZx] [^113Tu3ga].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal cardiac testing — I should apply the 2022 ESC non-cardiac surgery framework: reserve stress imaging for patients with poor functional capacity facing high-risk surgery and a high likelihood of CAD, and use the same indications for invasive angiography as in nonsurgical care; in patients with diabetes plus suspected or known CAD or with autonomic neuropathy, retinopathy, or renal disease who are undergoing intermediate- or high-risk procedures, preoperative cardiac assessment is warranted, whereas routine workup for low-risk, ambulatory hand cases without symptoms is unnecessary [^116tW7U5] [^1122yYfE] [^116p7QQp].

> Next, I should review anemia: I need to ensure early screening to allow time for correction — ideally about 4 weeks preoperatively — using an algorithmic approach to diagnose iron deficiency, chronic disease, or renal-related anemia and to institute therapy; for elective major surgery, deferring until anemia is corrected reduces bleeding and transfusion exposure, although for minor ambulatory hand procedures the urgency and invasiveness guide how aggressively we delay [^112sZiqD] [^115M43x8] [^111FM2an].

> Let me think about routine laboratory testing — hmm, wait a minute, do we actually need blanket labs in healthy patients? Evidence from other elective specialties supports that protocolized, selective testing based on history and exam reduces unnecessary tests without compromising safety, so I should confirm that labs are targeted to clinical indications rather than obtained routinely for low-risk hand surgery in healthy patients [^113Gu6vg].

> I will now examine perioperative antibiotics: I should double-check that prophylaxis is not routinely indicated for clean elective hand surgery, which is supported by both evidence syntheses and surgeon surveys; however, I need to consider selective prophylaxis in higher-risk contexts, such as poorly controlled hyperglycemia, while recognizing that even in patients with prosthetic joints undergoing clean hand surgery, the incidence of hematogenous PJI is extremely low and routine prophylaxis is not recommended [^113Tu3ga] [^114NU6JC] [^113r6W5B].

> But wait, what about hand surgery–specific safety hazards? Wrong-site surgery risk is disproportionately high in the hand; I need to ensure robust verification of laterality, specific digit, and procedure with preoperative marking and standardized timeouts tailored to hand anatomy to minimize preventable harm [^113tADUk].

> Next, I should review patient-centered communication and expectation setting: let me consider that even after technically successful procedures, willingness to repeat surgery varies widely, underscoring the need to align goals, recovery trajectories, and likely functional outcomes with patient priorities; qualitative work in hand surgery reinforces that clear expectations, communication quality, and perceived functional gains drive satisfaction and should be integrated into preoperative counseling [^114b5TVV] [^116M2M77].

> I need to ensure optimization extends to behavioral and analgesic planning: preoperative counseling on limited, procedure-appropriate opioid quantities reduces prolonged use, and smoking cessation for at least four weeks preoperatively should be advised to mitigate wound and pulmonary complications; if available, structured preoperative education programs can support behavior change, though evidence for "surgery schools" varies across settings [^115xAaKh].

> Finally, timing matters — let me double-check that assessments occur early enough to modify risks: scheduling preassessment several weeks ahead allows for anemia correction, glycemic optimization, cardiac evaluation if indicated, and patient education, which together reduce last-minute cancellations and perioperative complications; even though routine unselected testing lacks benefit, proactively addressing modifiable risks improves safety and readiness for elective hand procedures [^112sZiqD] [^115M43x8] [^113Gu6vg].

Preoperative evaluation for hand surgery emphasizes a **focused history and exam** to confirm diagnosis, assess function, and identify comorbidities that increase risk, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and smoking [^1129YTeJ] [^114MKw22]. Routine labs are **not needed for healthy patients** [^113Gu6vg] [^112htTZx]; obtain CBC, HbA1c, and ECG when indicated by comorbidities or age [^113Gu6vg]. Optimize **modifiable risks** [^111FM2an] by controlling diabetes [^116p7QQp], managing cardiovascular disease, and ensuring smoking cessation for at least four weeks [^114MKw22]. Prophylactic antibiotics are **not routinely required for clean elective cases** [^114NAeJz]; consider them for patients with poorly controlled diabetes or immunosuppression. Clearly document the surgical plan [^114cUetB], laterality [^113tADUk], and consent, and provide patient education on expectations [^113Vnzd8], anesthesia, and postoperative care to reduce complications and improve satisfaction.

### The impact of preoperative testing for blood glucose concentration and haemoglobin A1c on mortality, changes in management and complications in noncardiac elective surgery: a systematic review [^112htTZx]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

The risks associated with surgery are elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus. For this reason, preoperative diagnostics frequently include the measurement of blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), but it is unclear whether these tests contribute to improved perioperative or postoperative outcomes.

- **Objectives**: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence that preoperative testing for blood glucose and HbA1c might influence the following outcome parameters: changes in clinical management, mortality, and the incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery.

- **Design**: We performed a systematic search of the literature from January 2001 to March 2013, thus updating a review carried out by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) up to the year 2001.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Controlled studies, including cohort and case-control studies with a population of at least 60 patients, were eligible.

- **Results**: The search retrieved 1346 records (including hand-search). Twenty-two studies met all inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Fifteen cohort and two case-control studies evaluated the effectiveness of preoperative blood glucose testing, and nine studies assessed the effectiveness of testing HbA1c. Four of the included studies evaluated both tests. There were no data derived from high-quality studies supporting routine preoperative testing for blood glucose or HbA1c in otherwise healthy adult patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.

### Complications within 30 days of hand surgery: An analysis of 10,646 patients [^1129YTeJ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American College of Surgeons Surgical Quality Improvement Program database collects detailed and validated data on demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing operations in most subspecialties. This dataset has been previously used to quantify complications and identify risk factors in other surgical subspecialties. We sought to determine the incidence of postoperative complications following hand surgery and to identify factors associated with increased risk of complications in order to focus preventive strategies.

- **Methods**: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data from 2006 to 2011 were queried using 302 hand-specific Procedural Technology codes. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the population, and potential risk factors and patient characteristics were analyzed for their association with complications in the 30-day postoperative period using both univariate and multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: There were 208 hand-specific Procedural Technology codes represented in the data, and of these, 84 were associated with at least 1 complication. The overall incidence of complications within 30 days of hand surgery was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 2.2%-2.8%). In univariate analysis, older age, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, use of steroids, bleeding disorder, increasing American Society of Anesthesiologists class, increasing wound class, emergency procedure, longer operative time, and preoperative transfusion were associated with significant risk.

### Preoperative A1c and postoperative infection in elective hand surgery [^113Tu3ga]. Hand (2023). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus affects 10.5% of the US population. Numerous studies have documented an increased risk of complications for patients with diabetes after different types of surgery, including hand surgery. By aiming for a preoperative target hemoglobin A1c (A1c), the risk of surgical complications following elective hand surgery may be reduced for patients with diabetes. This literature review was conducted to evaluate the association between diabetes mellitus and surgical site infections and, more specifically, to determine whether there is any association between preoperative A1c level and postoperative infections in hand surgery.

The risk for surgical site infections and wound complications appears to be higher for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, but not necessarily for patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, when compared with patients without diabetes. The role of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with diabetes undergoing elective hand surgery was also considered. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to be beneficial for healthy patients undergoing clean, elective hand surgery. However, preoperative antibiotics may have a protective role for some patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia.

### Complex surgical conditions of the hand: avoiding the pitfalls [^114cUetB]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Many factors can contribute to a successful result in hand surgery, as is the case in all orthopaedic surgery. An accurate diagnosis, with emphasis on a complete history coupled with a detailed physical examination supplemented with the appropriate ancillary studies and proper preoperative surgical planning, is necessary to reach this goal. An improper diagnosis, such as in suspected carpal tunnel syndrome, can result in continued symptoms. We will emphasize some of the more complex and difficult conditions in hand surgery that necessitate a high level of clinical acumen. It is hoped that by highlighting these details, we may help others avoid common pitfalls and achieve an excellent result, thus avoiding litigation. Although these are not the only problems involved in hand surgery, they are complex and can be missed easily.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "successful" hand procedures [^114b5TVV]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

In this study, we describe a prospective, long-term assessment of patient willingness to repeat surgery after routine hand surgeries. We found that, at a patient's final response, the overall proportion of patients willing to repeat surgery after common hand surgery procedures is 81.6%. Importantly, even routine, presumably low-risk, high-success procedures range in patient desire to repeat surgery from 52% to 88%. This relatively high rate of not wanting to repeat surgery is more significant than what is traditionally quoted during preoperative counseling in our experience. Providing accurate information on the general patient experience is essential for setting patients' expectations and promoting shared decision-making.

When presented with a surgical option, patients frequently ask what the "success rate" of the operation is. This can be a difficult question to answer, as a successful outcome means different things to different patients depending on their pre-procedure pain and function, as well as expectations and other psychosocial factors. There are also situations where a surgeon and patient may differ in their perspectives of a successful surgical outcome. Routine hand surgeries are often described as "highly successful" with "few complications", but few studies have published quantifications of patient satisfaction after these procedures. In many cases, a few case series have been published, but these generally involve small numbers of patients from a single surgeon.

### Patient-derived framework for quality in hand surgery: A qualitative analysis [^116M2M77]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the growing attention to evaluating care from the patient perspective, the most common definitions and measurements of quality are currently defined by physicians and health systems. Studies have demonstrated how a lack of patient input can lead to discrepancies between patients' and physicians' assessments of quality and, subsequently, worse patient outcomes. Although quality measures are increasingly used in hand surgery, insufficient work has examined whether these quality measures align with what matters to patients. We completed a qualitative study to assess how patients define high-quality care through the pre-, peri-, and postoperative phases of care in hand surgery.

Based on our prior work, we created an open-ended interview guide and conducted semistructured interviews with 43 hand surgery patients at 5 tertiary-care institutions during various phases of care. We completed a thematic analysis to generate subcodes and open codes to identify themes in high-quality care from the patient perspective.

Patients defined high-quality care as a process of setting and meeting clear expectations, achieving functional goals after surgery, and feeling comfortable with and cared for by the care team. We identified the following patient-centered themes that contributed to high-quality care:

- **Communication**: Effective interactions between the patient and care team through all phases of care.
- **Diagnosis and treatment**: Efficient and accurate diagnosis and treatment.
- **Outcomes and experience**: Satisfactory treatment outcomes and postsurgical experience.
- **Systemic aspects**: Acceptable systemic aspects of care.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^1137LnhP]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

After completion of the systematic review and meta-analyses and compilation of the evidence into strategically structured tables by the two primary reviewers, a task force consisting of clinical and methodological experts reviewed findings to assess the evidence and provide appropriate recommendations for clinical practice. These findings were reviewed in the context of two panel meetings and via both telephone and electronic communication.

Members of the task force assessed the quantity, quality, and consistency of the published evidence according to the method proposed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group, using the modified grading system adopted by the American College of Chest Physicians. The strength of any recommendation depends on two factors: (i) the trade-off between benefits, risks, burden, and cost; and (ii) the confidence in estimates of those benefits and risks (level of evidence). If the trade-off between benefits and risks is clear, the recommendation is strong (Grade 1, "we recommend"); if the trade-off is less clear — the best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient or society values — the recommendation is weak (Grade 2, "we suggest"). The evidence supporting the recommendation is graded in three levels according to its methodological strength: high-quality evidence (A), usually from meta-analyses or randomized controlled trials; moderate-quality evidence (B), typically from randomized controlled trials with significant limitations or observational studies with large effects; and low-quality evidence (C).

### Larger perioperative opioid prescriptions lead to prolonged opioid use after hand and upper extremity surgery: A multicenter analysis [^115xAaKh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

**Risk factors for filling an additional opioid prescription postoperatively**: Patients who filled at least one additional opioid prescription postoperatively were significantly more likely to have been preoperative opioid users (48.7% versus 19.9%, P < 0.001), to have been prescribed opioids for more than 7 days' duration (7.9% versus 3.4%, P = 0.026), and to have received a prescription that overlapped with a previous opioid prescription (14.7% versus 2.7%, P < 0.001). Other risks included having an extended opioid prescription duration (14.6% versus 3.1%, P < 0.001) and overlapping prescriptions.

### The preFACE: A preoperative psychosocial screen for elective facial cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dentistry patients [^1111a3UU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Currently, no brief and objective screening protocol exists to assist surgeons and dentists in identifying patients likely to report unsatisfactory outcomes after cosmetic surgery interventions. The aims of this study were to: (1) investigate the relationship between postoperative dissatisfaction and preoperative characteristics, including psychiatric disturbance, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, dysmorphic concerns, and body image; and (2) empirically derive a preoperative psychosocial screening instrument to identify patients who may require preoperative assessment or counseling.

- **Methods**: The sample comprised 84 patients (69 women and 15 men) undergoing elective cosmetic facial surgery or cosmetic dentistry. Before surgery, a self-report questionnaire was administered to evaluate many of the psychosocial characteristics associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. Six months after surgery, a follow-up questionnaire included items evaluating postoperative satisfaction.

- **Results**: The findings revealed that preoperative psychiatric disturbance, anxiety, depression, low appearance evaluation, and body area dissatisfaction are psychosocial risk factors indicating an increased likelihood of patient dissatisfaction with surgical outcomes. The PreFACE (Preoperative FAcial Cosmetic surgery Evaluation) is a brief objective preoperative screening questionnaire that can be easily and efficiently administered to elective facial cosmetic surgery and cosmetic dentistry patients.

### Show me the evidence [^114UptDG]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Reporting outcomes based on clinical evidence is going to set the standards for hand surgery practice. Hand surgeons will be judged by the evidence that their interventions are doing the most good for the most people at a price that patients and/or insurance companies are willing to pay. Evidence-based practice is the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. The best evidence comes from randomized clinical trials, which are expensive, time-consuming, and not always possible. Sometimes we have to settle for good evidence, which may be the best evidence that is available. Nevertheless, if the future demands good evidence, then as hand surgeons and researchers we need to supply that evidence. Thus, first we have to know how and where to look for what's out there and then what we can do to add to this body of knowledge.

### Immediate and durable clinical improvement in the non-operated hand after contralateral surgery for patients with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome [^111GMmhf]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Little is known about clinical improvement in the non-operated hand after unilateral surgery for patients who present with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). In this prospective study of patients with bilateral CTS, we evaluated the clinical effects on the non-operated hand following unilateral contralateral carpal tunnel surgical release.

- **Material and methods**: During a consecutive period of 22 months, 69 patients with bilateral CTS underwent unilateral open carpal tunnel release. Bilateral subjective and objective evaluations were performed pre-operatively and at days 2, 15, and 180 after surgery. Subjective evaluations, analyzed with the Student's t-test, included the Boston-Levine symptom severity score and a visual analogue scale including pain, nocturnal symptoms, and numbness. A telephone survey was conducted 12 months after surgery.

- **Results**: The Boston-Levine severity score of the contralateral non-operated hand decreased from 2.70 pre-operatively to 1.70 at 2 days (p < 0.001). The visual analogue pain score decreased at 2 days for 61 patients (88%), whereas the nocturnal symptoms decreased or disappeared in 63 cases (91%) and the paresthesia in 52 cases (75%) (ps < 0.001). These beneficial effects were stable over time with no statistically significant change at 180 days. Overall, 58 patients (84%) observed a total resolution or significant improvement in their symptoms at 6 months. At 12 months, 100% of patients responded to a telephone survey. Fifty-one of them (74%) reported minimal or no symptoms in the non-operated hand. Linear regression analysis of these outcomes highlights the stability and durability of these improvements.

### Antibiotic use in hand surgery: Surgeon decision making and adherence to available evidence [^114NU6JC]. Hand (2020). Low credibility.

There are no clearly defined guidelines from hand surgical societies regarding preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Many hand surgeons continue to routinely use preoperative prophylaxis despite limited supporting evidence. This study aimed to determine the scenarios in which surgeons administer antibiotics, the reasons for their administration, and whether these decisions are evidence-based.

- **Methods**: An anonymous 25-question survey was e-mailed to the 921-member American Society for Surgery of the Hand listserv. We collected demographic information, and participants were asked whether they would administer antibiotics in a number of surgical scenarios and for what reasons.

- **Respondent groups**: Respondents were divided into three groups based on their antibiotic administration preferences:
	- Group 1 (40 respondents) would give antibiotics in short cases with healthy patients without hardware.
	- Group 2 (9 respondents) would not give antibiotics in any scenario.
	- Group 3 (129 respondents) would give antibiotics situationally.

- **Analysis**: The Fisher exact test compared demographic variables, frequency of use, and indications for antibiotic prophylaxis.

- **Results**: Of the 921 recipients, 178 (19%) responded. Demographic variables did not correlate with the antibiotic use group. Operative case time greater than 60 minutes, medical comorbidity, and pinning each increased antibiotic use. Group 1 respondents were more likely to admit that their practice was not evidence-based (74.4%) and that they administered antibiotics due to medical-legal concerns (75%). Twenty-two percent of respondents reported observing a complication from routine prophylaxis.

### Do vascular surgery patients need a cardiology work-up? A review of pre-operative cardiac clearance guidelines in vascular surgery [^111vrSNT]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

This study outlines the appropriate pre-operative cardiac work-up for patients scheduled for major peripheral vascular surgery.

- **Design**: Review of the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: A review focusing on studies that have correlated the pre-operative cardiac work-up patients receive with the cardiac morbidity and mortality following vascular surgery. Only studies with level A evidence were included.

- **Results**: Peri-operative beta blockade has been shown to decrease cardiac complications after vascular surgery in all risk groups. Non-invasive cardiac testing is only necessary for patients in the intermediate/high risk group. Coronary revascularization should only be considered following a positive non-invasive cardiac test.

- **Conclusions**: Patients must be risk stratified pre-operatively based on history and physical examination. Low-risk patients should receive peri-operative beta blockade only, with no further non-invasive testing. Conversely, intermediate and high-risk patients should undergo non-invasive cardiac testing before going to the operating room.

### An examination of complication rates and surgery durations in elective hand surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113fy1JH]. Hand (2025). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges to hand surgeons as hospitals worked to adapt to unprecedented demands on resources and personnel. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes in elective hand surgery using a large national database.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective review of the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) dataset for patients undergoing elective hand procedures in 2019 and 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, procedural factors, and outcomes were compared between cases occurring in 2019 and 2020. Multivariable regressions were performed to evaluate the association between operative year and 30-day outcomes.

- **Results**: A total of 8,971 patients were included, with a mean age of 52.2 ± 16.7 and 52.8 ± 16.4 years for the 2019 and 2020 cohorts, respectively. Compared to the 2019 cohort, the 2020 cohort demonstrated a higher prevalence of obesity (43.3% vs. 40.8%, P = 0.019), hypertension requiring medication (32.9% vs. 35.0%; P = 0.046), and American Association of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class ≥ 3 (30.4% vs. 27.0%; P < 0.001).

There were no significant differences in outcomes, including 30-day readmissions, reoperation, or complications between cohorts on unadjusted or multivariable analysis. Elective hand cases performed during the pandemic were associated with longer operating times and more frequently involved patients with greater comorbidities. Despite these differences, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic demonstrated similar outcomes.

### Preoperative muscle weakness as defined by handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes: A systematic review [^114S8C5X]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

A substantial minority of patients sustain an excess of postoperative complications and accelerated, post-hospital discharge mortality. In surgical procedures known to have a mortality of greater than 5% in the UK, elderly patients (mean age 75 years) and emergency procedures account for over 80% of deaths, but less than 15% of total procedures. Physician- and patient-friendly, practical, and inexpensive tools are required to guide and risk-stratify perioperative management objectively for this cohort of patients.

Measurements of exercise capacity and muscle strength are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population. However, the comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular reserve — most objectively using cardiopulmonary exercise testing — is challenging for immobile patients, time-consuming, and costly to extend as a general screening tool to the wider, at-risk surgical population.

By contrast, handgrip strength is an inexpensive, objective bedside test which has established population norms and has been extensively tested in a range of chronic general medical conditions. It may reflect, in part, the association of impaired muscle strength with malnutrition and cardiopulmonary or metabolic diseases. Handgrip strength can be assessed by instructing the patient to keep their shoulders adducted and neutrally rotated, the arm in a vertical position, the wrist in a neutral position, and to squeeze the grip with maximal strength. The highest result in a seated or semi-seated position may be used.

### Preoperative evaluation for minimally invasive gynecologic surgery: What is the best evidence and recommendations for clinical practice [^113Gu6vg]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2019). Low credibility.

Preoperative evaluation for elective benign gynecologic procedures is a necessary step in reducing perioperative complications. Although a thorough history and physical examination are the foundation of this assessment, much evidence exists that physicians rely on unnecessary laboratory and diagnostic testing. Our goal was to perform a systematic review of the available literature regarding preoperative evaluation to better inform preoperative test selection and to identify deficiencies in the literature. There is very limited data specific to preoperative testing for patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries. Abnormal test results are common when routine, unselected testing is applied. Using a protocol to guide preoperative testing improves patient care by eliminating unnecessary tests without compromising the efficacy of predicting adverse perioperative events or case cancellation and modifications.

### Safety in hand surgery: Eliminating wrong-site surgery [^113tADUk]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). High credibility.

After studying this article, the participant should be able to:

1. Understand the definition of wrong-site surgery and what it may encompass.
2. State the causes of wrong-site hand surgery.
3. Give examples of initiatives used to prevent wrong-site surgery.
4. Describe a process to minimize the risk of performing wrong-site surgery.

Wrong-site surgery remains a problem in our ever-evolving culture of surgical safety, and hand surgeons are at particularly high risk. Broadly speaking, wrong-site surgery is a procedure performed at an incorrect anatomical site. In hand surgery, this includes errors in laterality, wrong digit(s), wrong procedure(s), or even a failure to complete all indicated procedures. This article examines the scope of this safety issue, the challenges to preventing wrong-site surgery, and the authors' proposed solutions to eliminating wrong-site surgery and establishing a culture of safety in hand surgery.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^112sZiqD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We propose an algorithm for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia based on the above recommendations.

- **Algorithm for detection, evaluation, and management**: If anaemia is detected on a screening sample, evaluation is necessary and begins with an assessment of iron status. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation levels, or both indicate absolute iron deficiency, referral to a gastroenterologist to rule out a gastrointestinal malignancy as a source of chronic blood loss may be indicated. If serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both rule out absolute iron deficiency, serum creatinine and GFR determination may indicate chronic kidney disease and the need for referral to a nephrologist. When serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, or both are inconclusive, further evaluation to rule out absolute iron deficiency or inflammation/chronic disease is necessary. A therapeutic trial of iron would confirm absolute iron deficiency. No response to iron therapy would indicate the anaemia of chronic disease, suggesting that ESA therapy be initiated.

These recommendations are intended to provide guidance for preoperative evaluation in the elective surgical patient. Limiting preadmission testing to a few days before the scheduled operative procedure precludes the opportunity to evaluate and manage the patient with unexplained anaemia. The recommended time frame of testing is 4 weeks prior to surgery.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1176LjBt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically with respect to preoperative evaluation, ACG 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining high-resolution manometry before antireflux surgery or endoscopic therapy to rule out achalasia and absent contractility. Additionally, provocative testing should be obtained to identify contractile reserve, such as multiple rapid swallows, in patients with ineffective esophageal motility.

### Protocol for evaluation of perioperative risk in patients aged over 75 years: Aged patient perioperative longitudinal evaluation-multidisciplinary trial (APPLE-MDT study) [^112kacCA]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

With the extended life expectancy of the Chinese population and improvements in surgery and anesthesia techniques, the number of aged patients undergoing surgery has been increasing annually. However, safety, effectiveness, and quality of life for aged patients undergoing surgery are facing major challenges. In order to standardize the perioperative assessment and procedures, we have developed a perioperative evaluation and auxiliary decision-making system named "Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation–Multidisciplinary Trial (APPLE-MDT)".

- **Methods**: We will conduct a perioperative risk evaluation and targeted intervention, with follow-ups at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Aged Patient Perioperative Longitudinal Evaluation-Multiple Disciplinary Trial Path" (hereinafter referred to as the APPLE-MDT path) in surgical decision-making for aged patients (≥ 75 years) undergoing elective surgery under non-local anesthesia in the operating room. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the postoperative outcome and health economics of the APPLE-MDT path applied to the surgical decision-making of aged patients (≥ 75 years) undergoing elective surgery under non-local anesthesia, and to optimize intervention strategies for aged patients undergoing surgery to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications and improve the quality of life after surgery.

- **Discussion**: It is necessary to formulate a reliable, effective, and concise evaluation tool that can effectively predict outcomes for this demographic.

### Hand surgery in rheumatoid arthritis: State of the art and suggestions for research [^112YZEWF]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The role of surgery in the clinical management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated hand dysfunction is still a subject of controversy. The efficacy of surgery in RA-associated hand dysfunction is assessed through an exhaustive review of published studies.

- **Methods**: A high-sensitivity search strategy was used to identify original studies related to hand and wrist surgery in RA patients in MedLine and CENTRAL. We selected articles including at least two adult RA patients that evaluated clinical outcomes through an observational or experimental design. Eligible studies were evaluated by standardized criteria. Two investigators independently used a pre-defined form to extract data about patient population, intervention, follow-up, and clinical outcomes. Disagreements were discussed and resolved.

- **Results**: One hundred and ninety-six papers met the inclusion criteria. Only five were randomized trials, while most studies followed an observational design, often of poor quality. As such, we could not pool data for statistical analysis; however, we were still able to provide a best evidence synthesis. A positive trend suggesting the efficacy of total carpal arthrodesis and metacarpophalangeal arthroplasty in reducing pain and improving function seemed to emerge from the published studies.

- **Conclusions**: Despite recent advances in medical treatment, surgery still plays a role in the clinical management of RA-associated hand dysfunction. However, the majority of the available studies showed methodological flaws that prevented a clear definition of both surgical outcomes and overall efficacy.

### I-PASS enhances effectiveness and accuracy of hand-off for pediatric general surgery patients [^112Riy6J]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). High credibility.

I-PASS is a validated and standardized hand-off protocol shown to reduce medical error and improve hand-off efficiency in the pediatric medical population. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, accuracy, and resident satisfaction of implementing I-PASS on a pediatric surgery service.

- **Methods**: A prospective intervention Quality Improvement (QI approved) study was utilized to evaluate resident written and verbal hand-offs before and after implementation of I-PASS on a pediatric surgery service at a tertiary center. Anonymous surveys were completed by residents following each observation. Results were analyzed using T or Mann-Whitney U Tests and Chi Square.

- **Results**: A total of 49 written tools and 50 verbal hand-offs were compared pre-and post I-PASS implementation. With I-PASS, increased written accuracy was observed in the documentation of the patient summary (p < 0.05). Accuracy in the verbal hand-off of illness severity, patient summary, contingency plan, action list, and synthesis also improved (p < 0.05); however, the duration of hand-off increased (p < 0.01). Post-implementation surveys of residents demonstrated an increased understanding of patient management (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Implementing I-PASS on a pediatric surgery service with modifications catered to surgical patients improved the effectiveness and accuracy of written and verbal patient hand-offs and increased provider satisfaction and preparedness.

- **Level of evidence**: Level II.

Regarding perioperative care for adrenocortical carcinoma, and specifically with respect to preoperative evaluation, the ENSAT/ESES 2017 guidelines recommend eliciting a clinical history and performing a physical examination to assess the following before adrenalectomy for suspected ACC:

- **Symptoms related to hormone excess**: Identifying signs that may indicate an imbalance in hormone production.
- **Symptoms related to local compression by a large mass**: Evaluating any discomfort or functional impairedness caused by the tumor size.
- **Detailed family history for familial forms of cancer**: Understanding the potential hereditary nature of the adrenocortical carcinoma.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery: Standardized postoperative instructions in hand surgery [^1144ufZa]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a standardized approach to the care of the surgical patient. Postoperative patient instructions, an aspect of ERAS protocols, are difficult to standardize in hand surgery because of the diversity of procedures. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of standardized hand surgery postoperative instructions on the number of unscheduled postoperative patient encounters.

- **Methods**: The study was an institutional review board-approved prospective cohort in which all hand surgery patients from six surgeons at a single, hospital-based academic institution were included. For a six-month period, both before and after establishing a standardized postoperative instructional handout, data were collected on unscheduled postoperative encounters within 14 days of surgery.

- **Results**: There were 330 patients in the control group versus 282 who received standardized postoperative instructions. Trauma comprised 24.6% of cases in comparison to 75.4% elective. Individual surgeons did not significantly influence whether patients had an encounter. Overall, patients who received standardized instructions were just as likely as the control group to have unscheduled encounters (41.5% vs. 43.9%, respectively). Notably, elective patients were significantly more likely to have encounters (46%) versus trauma patients (33.1%; p = 0.007); however, the standardized instructions did not influence the number of encounters for either group.

This study did not demonstrate a difference in unscheduled postoperative encounters after initiation of standardized postoperative instructions.

### Preoperative muscle weakness as defined by handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes: a systematic review [^1114ARNU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

The definition of impaired handgrip strength has varied across studies. These studies have compared grip strength values from healthy controls, reference populations, or patients without postoperative morbidity to those of surgical patients. For instance, nine studies defined impaired handgrip strength as less than 85% of a general, age-matched population, though the reference populations differed between studies.

Six studies measured handgrip strength exclusively from the non-dominant hand, while three studies focused on the dominant hand. Seven studies did not specify which hand was tested. Moreover, 11 out of 19 studies did not report the timespan over which handgrip strength measurements were taken before surgery. The time points used to assess postoperative handgrip strength varied between studies. Detailed protocols for conducting handgrip strength measurements were absent in most studies.

- **Postoperative morbidity**: Out of 15 studies summarized in Table 5 that explored the relationship between handgrip strength and postoperative morbidity, 10 reported a significant relationship between lower handgrip strength and increased postoperative morbidity. Unfortunately, no studies defined postoperative morbidity using validated morbidity assessment tools. Various morbidities were recorded prospectively, but only a few studies detailed how these morbidities were determined.

### Discrepancies between meeting abstracts and subsequent full text publications in hand surgery [^114p9efB]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Research abstracts presented during the proceedings of an annual meeting are often cited and can influence clinical practice. Prior studies show that roughly 50% of abstracts at American Society for Surgery of the Hand meetings are eventually published. Yet, it is unknown how often the results or conclusions of published studies differ from the podium presentation. The objective of this study was to quantify the differences between abstracts presented during the annual meeting of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and the resulting manuscripts.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed every abstract delivered as a podium presentation at the American Society for Surgery of the Hand annual meeting from 2000 to 2010. We searched the PubMed database for matching publications and compared authorship, country of origin, hypothesis, study design and methodology, changes in study groups or populations, results, and conclusions.

- **Results**: Of 798 total abstracts, we analyzed 719 involving the hand, wrist, and brachial plexus. Fifty-six different journals published 393 of the abstracts, for a 49% publication rate. Mean time to publication was 18 months with a median of 14 and a maximum of 122 months. There were inconsistencies between the results and/or conclusions in 14% of full-length articles compared with the abstract presented at the meeting. A total of 9% of articles were published with fewer subjects. Authorship changes were noted in 54% of publications.

Abstracts represent preliminary investigations, and major and minor changes occur before subsequent publication.

### Perioperative quality initiative consensus statement recommendations on the definition, development, implementation and outcomes of pre-operative surgery schools [^113Vnzd8]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Pre‐operative group sessions incorporating patient education and behavior change interventions, known as 'surgery schools', are becoming increasingly common before major elective surgery worldwide. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgery schools, and the development and delivery of these complex interventions lack standardization.

In collaboration with the Perioperative Quality Initiative, we aimed to develop evidence- and expertise-based consensus statements and recommendations regarding the definition, design, content, and outcomes of surgery schools. Thirty-two international multidisciplinary experts in surgery school and pre-operative preparation attended a series of virtual meetings based on a modified Delphi methodology. A systematic review and additional targeted literature searches were used to propose statements for the definition, design, content, and outcomes of surgery schools. Statements and recommendations were discussed iteratively and refined in multiple rounds until agreement was reached.

Consensus was reached on a definition of surgery school, as well as three statements and 18 recommendations related to scope, outcomes, intervention development, delivery, inclusivity, and educational content of surgery schools. Seventeen areas were highlighted as priorities for future research.

These consensus statements and recommendations are intended to help clinicians and service managers who plan to develop and implement surgery schools.

### Detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in the elective orthopaedic surgical patient: NATA guidelines [^116HhNn3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary panel of physicians with expertise in orthopaedic surgery, orthopaedic anaesthesia, haematology, and epidemiology was convened by the Network for Advancement of Transfusion Alternatives (NATA) with the aim of developing practice guidelines for the detection, evaluation, and management of preoperative anaemia in elective orthopaedic surgery.

A broad, systematic search strategy was applied to Medline (1966–January 2010) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (January 2010 edition) to identify randomized controlled trials and observational studies evaluating the detection, evaluation, and treatment of anaemia in orthopaedic surgery. The Medline database was searched using the MeSH keywords 'anaemia', 'orthopaedics', and 'blood transfusion'. Additional relevant studies not identified from the electronic search were sought by hand-searching bibliographies of relevant identified articles and via consultation with clinical experts in the field. All citation screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers.

### Anesthetic neurotoxicity in congenital hand surgery: An overview of the evidence and advice for counseling parents [^115XkzaD]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Millions of children undergo general anesthesia for surgical procedures each year, the implications of which are not fully understood. Animal models demonstrate neurotoxicity and long-term cognitive impairment following exposure to common general anesthetic agents. However, it is unclear if human brains are affected in a similar fashion and what — if any — the implications on cognitive development may be. Furthermore, it is not known if these effects are additive and if they can be avoided by delaying reconstruction. Here, we explore reconstructive surgical timelines for common congenital hand differences in light of the available anesthetic neurotoxicity evidence, with an emphasis on preoperative counseling.

### Preoperative muscle weakness as defined by handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes: a systematic review [^113DmuJd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

The discussion within our systematic review contrasts with large population studies. We examined the relationship between preoperative handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes and did not find compelling data supporting the hypothesis that general population study results are applicable to perioperative medicine. Most studies were of reasonable quality. However, they featured significant potential confounding factors that varied markedly between studies. Various instruments have been used to measure grip strength, often without other corroborative assessments of strength.

Due to substantial variations in how each specified outcome was defined between studies, along with a lack of analyses testing any particular association, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses of results or formally test heterogeneity between studies. This marked heterogeneity limits definitive conclusions for the perioperative environment, leaving this preoperative assessment largely unexplored. Nevertheless, despite the limitations discussed, several studies suggest that the role of preoperative handgrip strength assessment warrants further exploration.

Large epidemiological studies have shown that perioperative morbidity is associated with dramatic differences in post-discharge life expectancy across different operations and health systems. The cost and expertise required by certain preoperative tests, such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing, presents challenges.

### Level of evidence and publication rates of abstracts presented at the American Society for Surgery of the Hand annual meetings: Comparison over 23 years [^115i574B]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The primary aims of this study were to determine how the level of evidence and publication rates of American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) abstracts presented at the national meeting have changed over the past 23 years.

- **Methods**: Abstracts presented at the ASSH annual meeting from 1992 to 2014 were reviewed. Level of evidence (LoE) and publication status for each abstract were recorded. We calculated annual and overall LoE, publication rates, average time to publication, and top journals of publication for abstracts presented from 1992 to 2014. The LoE was categorized into level 1 or 2 studies, levels 3 to 5 studies, or nonclinical studies.

- **Results**: A total of 1,757 abstracts were presented at ASSH meetings from 1992 to 2014; 942 abstracts were published in peer-reviewed journals for an overall publication rate of 53.6%. There was a significant increase in the proportion of levels 1 to 2 LoE abstracts over time (18% in 2007–2014 vs. 11% in 1999–2006 and 2% in 1992–1998). There was also a significantly higher percentage of abstracts published over time (62% in 2007–2014 vs. 52% in 1999–2006 and 47% in 1992–1998). Levels 1 to 2 LoE studies were associated with higher publication rates than nonclinical or levels 3 to 5 LoE studies.

- **Conclusions**: This research provides historical trends on the LoE of abstracts presented at the ASSH annual meetings. Our study shows that there are increasing numbers of levels 1 to 2 studies as well as higher publication rates of abstracts presented at more recent ASSH annual meetings. Levels 1 to 2 studies are more likely to be published.

### How can we make hand surgery carbon neutral [^112ePLnb]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Climate change is a major public health threat worldwide. Operating theaters are responsible for extensive waste production due to the resource-intensive nature of surgery, including hand surgery.

- **Methods**: An online literature search was performed to ascertain the approaches that surgeons may undertake to positively impact the environment.

- **Results**: Surgeons can make hand surgery more carbon neutral through various measures that have been categorized as pre-, intra-, and postoperative interventions. With all changes, the aims are to minimize waste and costs while optimizing patient outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Administrative obstacles to implementing pro-climate hospital changes may be overcome by also considering likely cost benefits with many environmentally friendly measures. New measures in hand surgery should consider patient safety, clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, and the environmental impact.

### AGA clinical practice update on advances in per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and remaining questions — What we have learned in the past decade: Expert review [^113qat3r]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for achalasia, more specifically concerning preoperative evaluation, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive diagnostic workup. This should include clinical history, review of medications, upper endoscopy, timed barium esophagram, and high-resolution manometry in the evaluation for POEM. It is advisable to consider obtaining endoscopic functional luminal impedance planimetry as an adjunct test, particularly when the diagnosis is equivocal.

### Preoperative evaluation of the patient with pulmonary disease [^116Vg5UU]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Preoperative pulmonary evaluation is important in the management of patients with lung disease who are undergoing elective cardiothoracic or noncardiothoracic surgery. In some instances, preoperative pulmonary evaluations may also contribute to the management of patients being considered for urgent surgery.

The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) is high and associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stays. Perioperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective noncardiothoracic surgery can be more accurately predicted than in those undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery.

Effective strategies to prevent complications in the postoperative period are few. Incentive spirometry and continuous positive airway pressure are the only modalities of proven benefit. Identifying patients who are at risk for the development of PPCs and managing their underlying modifiable risk factors aggressively prior to surgery is essential.

### Patient-related risk factors associated with surgical site complications after elective hand surgery [^115hastE]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to identify independent risk factors associated with an increased rate of surgical site complications after elective hand surgery.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent elective hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow surgery over a 10-year period at a single institution. Electronic medical records were reviewed, and information regarding patient demographics, past medical and social history, perioperative laboratory values, procedures performed, and surgical complications was collected. Surgical site complications included surgical site infections, seromas or hematomas, and delayed wound healing or wound dehiscence. A univariate analysis was then performed to identify potential risk factors, which were then included in a multivariate regression analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 3,261 patients who underwent elective hand surgery and met the above inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this study. The mean age was 57 years, with 65% female and 35% male patients. The overall surgical complication rate was 2.2%. Univariate analysis of patient factors identified male sex; number of procedures greater than one; history of drug, alcohol, or smoking use; American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III and IV; and serum albumin less than 3.5 mg/dL to be significantly associated with complications. However, multivariate regression analysis identified that only ASA class III and IV (odds ratio = 3.27) was significantly associated with surgical complications.

- **Conclusions**: Patients classified as ASA class III or IV were identified as having a significantly increased risk of surgical complications.

### Linear regression analysis of hospital episode statistics predicts a large increase in demand for elective hand surgery in England [^114XGwLX]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

We integrated two factors, demographic population shifts and changes in prevalence of disease, to predict future trends in demand for hand surgery in England to facilitate workforce planning.

- **Methods**: We analysed Hospital Episode Statistics data for Dupuytren's disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and trigger finger from 1998 to 2011. Using linear regression, we estimated trends in both diagnosis and surgery until 2030. We integrated this regression with age-specific population data from the Office for National Statistics in order to estimate how this will contribute to a change in workload over time.

- **Results**: There has been a significant increase in both absolute numbers of diagnoses and surgery for all four conditions. Combined with future population data, we calculate that the total operative burden for these four conditions will increase from 87,582 in 2011 to 170,166 (95% confidence interval 144,517–195,353) in 2030.

- **Discussion**: The prevalence of these diseases in the ageing population, and increasing prevalence of predisposing factors such as obesity and diabetes, may account for the predicted increase in workload. The most cost-effective treatments must be sought, which requires high-quality clinical trials. Our methodology can be applied to other sub-specialties to help anticipate the need for future service provision.

### Perioperative quality initiative consensus statement recommendations on the definition, development, implementation and outcomes of pre-operative surgery schools [^114A821u]. Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

The preparatory work and meetings followed the broad stages of a Delphi process. A systematic review of pre‐operative surgery schools, as well as additional targeted literature reviews on each topic, were conducted by IF‐J to identify relevant evidence for best practice. Initially, 30 candidate statements and recommendations for discussion were proposed by IF‐J; a 'statement' was defined as a position supported by the literature, and a 'recommendation' was defined as a suggested course of action based on the literature and expert opinion. These were accompanied by evidence summaries together with a suggested level of certainty of the supporting evidence using the GRADE approach — a scale ranging from very low to high, based on the authors' confidence in the evidence — and an overall strength of recommendation.

- **Meeting schedule**: A leadership team comprising IF‐J, MG, and DL met to discuss the proposed statements and recommendations for discussion and compile them within a live working document. This document was continually added to and edited throughout each of the expert meetings and during the analysis that took place in between meetings.

- **Voting and agreement**: The degree of group agreement on each statement/recommendation during the workshops was ascertained through Roman voting (one thumb vote) using Microsoft Teams reaction functions. Voting was moderated by group chairs and later verified by IF‐J following review of each meeting recording and transcription.

### Preoperative muscle weakness as defined by handgrip strength and postoperative outcomes: A systematic review [^117DNNcf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Impaired preoperative handgrip strength may be associated with increased postoperative morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay following surgery. Given the robust predictive power of this inexpensive, objective bedside test beyond the perioperative population, further studies of its role in predicting postoperative outcomes appear to be warranted, provided prospective, objectively defined measures of morbidity are employed.

### A systematic review of qualitative research in hand surgery [^114T6LQT]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

- **Data analysis**: Interrater reliability was calculated for title and abstract, as well as full-text screening, using the K statistic. This was interpreted according to Landis and Koch benchmarks, with 0 representing no agreement and 1 representing perfect agreement. A descriptive analysis was conducted for study reporting, characteristics, methodology, and results. Journal impact factors were determined on Clarivate, and journal reporting quality was also characterized with descriptive analysis. A 2-tailed, 2-sample t-test performed on Microsoft Excel was used to calculate the difference between SRQR scores for: (1) studies that reported using a reporting guideline and those that did not; and (2) studies published before and after the SRQR. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.

- **Content analysis**: Content analysis was performed to identify outcomes for the two most frequently reported conditions in hand surgery qualitative research. Only articles that solely discussed these conditions were included. Content analysis is a systematic manner of coding themes and was chosen for this study as it is useful for summarizing the collective conclusions of included studies. The methodology as described by Thomas and Harden was performed. It involved the following three stages: (1) free line-by-line coding; (2) organization of "free codes" into related areas to construct "descriptive" themes; and (3) development of "analytical" themes. Triangulation was performed to add rigor to the analysis process. Three reviewers (C.H. X.-W.L. R.P.L.) independently performed each step of the content analysis described.

### A systematic review of qualitative research in hand surgery [^112Z3nb4]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

There is no widely accepted standard for quality assessment of qualitative research. Instead, the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research network endorses the following reporting guidelines: the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR). The COREQ provides reporting guidelines for interviews and focus groups, while the SRQR has a wider scope and provides criteria for all forms of qualitative research. It is a 21-item checklist for complete, transparent reporting of qualitative research. It includes the fundamentals of all research studies (title, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conflict of interest, and funding) while describing qualitative-specific items for methodology and reporting results. Detailed explanations of each item are provided in a table and supplementary appendix in the original article.

The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the reporting quality of hand surgery qualitative research with the SRQR. The secondary objectives were to:

1. Determine which hand surgery domains qualitative research has been conducted in.
2. Describe the methodology of qualitative research in hand surgery (such as reporting guideline use).
3. Compare SRQR scores for studies using reporting guidelines with those that did not.
4. Determine if the SRQR resulted in improved reporting of qualitative research in hand surgery since its initial introduction.
5. Analyze reporting quality by journal publication.
6. Identify outcomes for common conditions.

### Prophylactic antibiotics prior to hand surgery in patients with prosthetic joints [^113r6W5B]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) after elective clean hand surgery and whether prophylactic antibiotics are warranted for patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty (TJA), a study was conducted. **Methods**: All patients undergoing elective clean hand surgery between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively cross-referenced with those who had a prior TJA at the same urban academic medical center. The inclusion criteria required patients to have undergone clean hand surgery during the study period, be adults aged 30 to 90, have had a previous TJA, and not have a history of a PJI. Charts were reviewed to gather data on patient demographics, co-morbidities, the type of TJA and hand surgery performed, the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the hand surgery, and occurrence of PJI within 3 months post-surgery. **Results**: A total of 331 patients (181 females and 150 males) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 13% received prophylactic antibiotics before their hand surgery, while 87% did not. Only one case of PJI was recorded within 3 months of hand surgery. No relationship was identified between the occurrence of PJI and the hand surgery or the necessity for preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of PJI after clean hand surgery is very low, leading researchers to conclude that routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for patients undergoing clean elective hand surgery with a history of prior TJA.

### Preoperative anxiety in Chinese adult patients undergoing elective surgeries: A multicenter cross-sectional study [^111nbCJe]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Preoperative anxiety is associated with increased use of anesthetics and poorer postoperative outcomes. However, the prevalence of preoperative anxiety has not been characterized in Chinese patients. In this study, we aimed to estimate the overall prevalence of preoperative anxiety in Chinese adult patients and explore the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with preoperative anxiety in China.

- **Methods**: This study was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted at 32 tertiary referral centers in China from September 1 to October 31, 2020. Adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were evaluated by the 7-item Perioperative Anxiety Scale (PAS-7) for preoperative anxiety after entrance to the operating zone.

- **Results**: A total of 5191 patients were recruited, and 5018 of them were analyzed. The prevalence of preoperative anxiety measured by PAS-7 was 15.8% (95% CI 14.8 to 16.9%). Multivariable analyses showed female sex, younger age, non-retirement status, first-time surgery, higher-risk surgeries, and poorer preoperative sleep were associated with higher prevalence of preoperative anxiety.

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative anxiety was relatively common, with a prevalence of 15.8% among adult Chinese patients undergoing elective surgeries. Further studies are needed using suitable assessment tools to better characterize preoperative anxiety, with additional focus on perioperative education and intervention, especially in primary hospitals.

This study was registered prospectively at ChiCTR1900027639 on November 22, 2019.

### Clinical quality measures for intraoperative and perioperative management in carpal tunnel surgery [^112ecppn]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

We developed 24 draft measures during our panel evaluation, with changes made to all but two of these measures, including the division of one measure into two. Notably, two intraoperative measures did not meet the validity criteria, and the panelists removed one postoperative measure that addressed a rare situation.

### Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimisation prior to elective arterial vascular surgery: A health economic analysis [^115q8pAN]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of older people are undergoing vascular surgery. Preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimisation (CGA) reduces postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. Establishing CGA-based perioperative services requires a health economic evaluation prior to implementation. Through a modelling-based economic evaluation using data from a single-site clinical trial, this study evaluates whether CGA is a cost-effective alternative to standard preoperative assessment for older patients undergoing elective arterial surgery.

- **Methods**: An economic evaluation, using decision-analytic modelling, compared preoperative CGA and optimisation with standard preoperative care in older patients undergoing elective arterial surgery. The incremental net health benefit of CGA, expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness.

- **Results**: CGA is a cost-effective substitute for standard preoperative care in elective arterial surgery across a range of cost-effectiveness threshold values. An incremental net benefit of 0.58 QALYs at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £30k, 0.60 QALYs at a threshold of £20k, and 0.63 QALYs at a threshold of £13k was observed. Mean total pre- and postoperative health care utilisation costs were estimated to be £1,165 lower for CGA patients, largely accounted for by reduced postoperative bed day utilisation.

- **Conclusion**: This study demonstrates a likely health economic benefit in addition to the previously described clinical benefit of employing CGA methodology.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "successful" hand procedures [^116cqdBL]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

It is not in the best interest of either the patient or the surgeon to undergo a surgery that will ultimately result in patient dissatisfaction. Future studies will be necessary to further ascertain the reasons for patient dissatisfaction, including analysis of ongoing symptoms, complications, and unmet expectations. Comparing patients treated non-operatively and operatively may also yield further insights. This knowledge could provide insight into improving preoperative counseling, selecting better candidates for surgery, as well as finding ways to identify dissatisfied patients early in the postoperative course and potentially offer an early intervention.

This study represents an important first step toward this goal by providing data which can be shared with patients during preoperative conversations. It is clear, however, that we still do not understand dissatisfied patients well enough. There is ample opportunity for qualitative research efforts to better determine what is driving this group of patients and why they are dissatisfied. Being able to accurately quantify patient satisfaction within a given setting is the important first step toward recognizing deficiencies and areas for improvement, understanding how to improve satisfaction, and ultimately increasing the value provided to patients through hand surgery.

### The influence of timing and route of administration of intravenous ketorolac on analgesia after hand surgery [^117LJErv]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

A double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 47 patients scheduled for hand surgery under general anaesthesia to determine whether ketorolac given as part of an intravenous regional anaesthesia technique could provide better postoperative analgesia than ketorolac given intravenously either before or after surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive ketorolac 20 mg: intravenously in the non-operative arm before surgery (systemic presurgery group); intravenously to the operative arm after tourniquet inflation (regional presurgery group); or intravenously in the non-operative arm after surgery (systemic postsurgery group).

Postoperative pain scores were similar in the systemic presurgery and regional presurgery groups. The mean visual analogue summary pain score during the 24 h after surgery was 12.2 mm higher in the systemic postsurgery group than in the systemic presurgery group (95% CI: 0.8–23.7 mm, p = 0.037). There were no clinically important differences in mean postoperative visual analogue pain scores between the three study groups. Furthermore, there were no statistical differences in the mean postoperative morphine requirements between the three study groups. There is no benefit, in terms of improved postoperative analgesia, in giving ketorolac as an intravenous regional anaesthetic compared with systemic administration before surgery. The administration of ketorolac after surgery, rather than before, is not supported.

### Perioperative evaluation and management in dermatologic surgery [^117VEnrc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Thorough and efficient perioperative evaluation is mandatory for all patients undergoing dermatologic operation. Patients may present with concise or extensive medical histories, and an organized approach will focus attention on issues relevant to the patient's dermatologic disease and the planned surgical procedure. Management of common perioperative issues in a proactive and standardized manner, with the opportunity to individualize decisions when clinical conditions indicate, is an efficient and optimal approach. This review highlights the efficient and thorough evaluation of perioperative issues and suggests guidelines for the optimal management of common perioperative issues, including cardiac devices, antibiotic prophylaxis, and anticoagulation.

### An evidence-based review of optimal perioperative practices in minor hand surgery [^114NAeJz]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Like many surgical subspecialties, there have been frequent advancements and discoveries in the field of hand and upper extremity surgery. With a rapidly growing literature base, it can be difficult to remain updated on the latest recommendations.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was completed on PubMed using MeSH terms. Topics included nutrition management, anticoagulation, immunosuppressive medication management, antibiotic use, skin preparation, splinting, tourniquet use, and suture choice. Data from articles with a level of evidence 1A-3C were included.

- **Results**: A total of 42 articles were identified and reviewed to provide evidence for recommendations regarding various aspects of pre-, intra-, and post-operative care.

- **Conclusions**: The objective of this manuscript is to serve as a resource for evidence-based recommendations by the findings of recent evidence related to perioperative care in elective hand surgery. Additional studies are required in certain areas of the literature in order to provide stronger recommendations.

### Consensus on a multidisciplinary treatment guideline for de Quervain disease: Results from the European HANDGUIDE study [^114cYB7n]. Physical Therapy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, specifically with respect to postoperative care, HANDGUIDE 2014 guidelines recommend advising patients on the following for the first 10–14 days postoperatively:

- **Elevate the hand**: Keep the hand above heart level to prevent swelling.

- **Move the fingers**: Encourage finger movements to prevent scar adhesions.

- **Avoid heavy lifting**: Refrain from heavy lifting or forceful activities until 2–6 weeks after surgery.

- **Rest the hand**: Rest the hand and avoid thumb activity (splinting can be used).

### The role of prophylactic antibiotics in elective hand surgery [^114xmYLM]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The literature has poorly defined the role of antibiotic agents in elective hand surgery. This may be due to a small number of well-designed studies specifically addressing the efficacy of antibiotics in this field. Our purpose is to critically review the literature in an attempt to more precisely define the role of prophylactic antibiotics in elective hand surgery.

### Use of placebo controls in the evaluation of surgery: Systematic review [^115H4csY]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases identified a total of 4543 records. We found an additional 23 articles using a hand search of relevant literature and the references of the articles identified using the database search. Out of these 4566 records, 1597 duplicates were discarded, leaving 2969 records. Of these, 2860 did not meet inclusion criteria, and a further 56 studies were excluded after reviewing the full text of the article. Among them were 12 articles reporting additional outcomes of a trial, seven follow-up papers, and seven studies that reported results in a way that made the comparison between the surgical and placebo arm impossible. This resulted in 53 full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Figure 1 details the study identification and reasons for exclusion.

Fig 1: Flow chart of study identification, listing reasons for exclusion during the review process

A keyword search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database identified 14 relevant trials, including two studies already found using the electronic search and 12 studies that were not yet available as full-text articles in November 2013.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: All included studies were assessed for risk of bias (see supplementary appendix 2). The risk of bias related to sequence generation, concealment of treatment allocation, and blinding during the procedures was generally low. In some trials, the measures undertaken to maintain blinding were not explicitly described. However, these trials used endoscopic techniques in patients.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "successful" hand procedures [^117TQQHk]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Healthcare quality has become an increasingly important metric across surgical specialties, including hand surgery. The definition of healthcare quality has evolved over time, with the paradigm largely built upon the Institute of Medicine's framework for patient-centered care that is responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values. Multiple authors have articulated the need to further define quality within the unique context of hand surgery. A variety of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been employed to this end, but each has its own defined minimal clinically important difference, which is unique for particular pathologies.

A frequently used surrogate for quality has been patient-reported satisfaction, despite being an imperfect solution to measuring quality. Previous literature has noted that patient satisfaction is a complex goal which can be affected not only by the technical expertise of the surgeon but also by pain, function, psychosocial factors, and even the cost of parking. Patient-reported likelihood to repeat surgery is another valuable metric, which focuses the patient's evaluation on whether their preoperative expectations of the surgery align with outcomes. It takes into account not only the final outcome but also the course taken to reach that point. A procedure might provide patients with pain relief and return of function, but if it required years of therapy and months of missed work that were inconsistent with preoperative expectations, patients may not choose to repeat the surgery.

### Billing and utilization trends for hand surgery indicate worsening barriers to accessing care [^111gSgx2]. Hand (2023). Low credibility.

Hospitals and providers may increase hand surgery charges to compensate for decreasing reimbursement. Higher charges, combined with increasing utilization of ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), may threaten the accessibility of affordable hand surgery care for uninsured and underinsured patients.

- **Methods**: We queried the Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary to collect the number of procedures, charges, and reimbursements of hand procedures from 2010 to 2019. We adjusted procedural volume by Medicare enrollment and monetary values to the 2019 US dollar. We calculated weighted means of charges and reimbursements, which were then used to calculate reimbursement-to-charge ratios (RCRs). We calculated overall change and r² from 2010 to 2019 for all procedures, stratified by procedural type, service setting, and state where service was rendered.

- **Results**: Weighted mean charges, reimbursement, and RCRs changed by +21.0% (from $1,227 to $1,485; r² = 0.93), +10.8% (from $321 to $356; r² = 0.69), and -8.4% (from 0.26 to 0.24; r² = 0.76), respectively. The Medicare enrollment-adjusted number of procedures performed in ASCs increased by 63.8% (r² = 0.95). Trends in utilization and billing varied widely across different procedural types, service settings, and states.

- **Conclusions**: Charges for hand surgery procedures steadily increased, possibly reflecting an attempt to make up for reimbursements perceived to be inadequate. This trend places uninsured and underinsured patients at greater risk for financial catastrophe, as they are often responsible for full or partial payment.
