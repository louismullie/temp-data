## Question

Does terbutaline cause tachy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether terbutaline causes tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and receptor selectivity that would plausibly drive heart rate increases. Then, I should examine direct clinical data quantifying heart rate effects across routes of administration. Next, I will review regulatory labeling for adverse cardiovascular events and their incidence. After that, I will consider class-wide evidence and dose–response, including overdose data. Finally, I will synthesize the findings and translate them into clinical guidance with caveats for high-risk populations [^112UuXuU] [^114N5Wqd].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Terbutaline is a short-acting beta-adrenergic agonist with preferential beta2 activity, but the FDA labeling notes that 10–50% of cardiac beta-receptors are beta2 subtype, so "selective" does not mean "cardio-inert", and beta2 stimulation can still exert chronotropic and electrophysiologic effects via cAMP in the myocardium and conduction system [^112UuXuU]. Wait, let me verify downstream electrophysiology as well: beta2-agonists such as salbutamol modulate ventricular repolarization and increase dispersion, supporting a biologically plausible pro-tachyarrhythmic substrate under some conditions [^115Y4JpC].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence of heart rate changes. A subcutaneous terbutaline study in hemodialysis patients showed a mean heart rate rise of 25.8 beats per minute with peak increases within minutes, which is a sizable chronotropic response that tracks with pharmacology, although I need to acknowledge the study's limited size and patient population [^115mGi9x]. In severe pediatric asthma, continuous intravenous terbutaline increased heart rate by 9–13% shortly after initiation across age groups, with heart rate returning toward baseline after discontinuation, which supports a temporal association between exposure and tachycardia [^112Yp2YQ]. I should also note clinical extremes: atrial fibrillation has been reported with oral terbutaline in pregnancy, underscoring that supraventricular tachyarrhythmias can occur, albeit infrequently, in exposed patients [^112Nnc9f].

> Now I will examine regulatory adverse event data. Hold on, I should verify incidence strata across formulations: oral terbutaline labeling lists sinus tachycardia as a common adverse reaction (1–10%), and palpitations are reported frequently, consistent with sympathomimetic effects [^1148xogD] [^115YYVpX]. Subcutaneous product information likewise lists sinus tachycardia among common events and palpitations as very common (> 10%), which aligns with class expectations and the clinical studies above [^113dAR3G] [^113wKtfW]. Pregnancy labeling further documents increased maternal heart rate and arrhythmias with exposure, which I should keep in mind for risk stratification [^117PFzWL] [^114sh5zH].

> I need to consider class-wide effects and higher-level evidence. A meta-analysis of beta2-agonists in obstructive airway disease demonstrated that a single dose increased heart rate by approximately 9 beats per minute compared with placebo, reinforcing that tachycardia is a class effect rather than unique to a single agent or route [^114N5Wqd]. Let me also cross-check regulatory language for an exemplar beta2-agonist: the albuterol label warns of clinically significant cardiovascular changes, which is consistent with the mechanistic and meta-analytic signal for this class [^113MK7dL].

> I will now examine dose–response and overdose, because a graded effect would strengthen causality. The FDA overdosage section for terbutaline expects tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, clearly demonstrating that higher exposures intensify chronotropic effects and confirming a dose-dependent relationship [^115BzTi9]. Hmm, wait a minute, if even therapeutic ranges can raise heart rate and overdose causes marked tachycardia, that trajectory argues for a pharmacodynamic continuum rather than an idiosyncratic phenomenon [^115BzTi9].

> Next, I should review labeling warnings to ensure clinical consistency. The FDA cautions that terbutaline, like other beta-agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects as measured by pulse rate and blood pressure, and it notes ECG changes, including T-wave flattening and QTc prolongation; it also advises caution in patients with coronary insufficiency, arrhythmias, or hypertension, which I should highlight for clinical practice [^111GFWwh]. Let me verify this across product communications: additional labeling reiterates caution in cardiovascular disorders and acknowledges potential hypokalemia, which can further predispose to arrhythmias alongside tachycardia [^113APxJM].

> Synthesis time. Mechanistically, beta2-agonist activity in the heart is sufficient to increase rate; clinically, heart rate rises of roughly 9–25+ beats per minute have been observed across settings; regulatorily, tachycardia is an established adverse reaction with defined incidence; class-wide analyses confirm a consistent chronotropic signal; and dose–response is evident in overdose descriptions, all converging on the same conclusion [^112UuXuU] [^115mGi9x] [^112Yp2YQ] [^114N5Wqd] [^115BzTi9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about route specificity — labels and studies show this across oral, subcutaneous, and intravenous use, so the effect is formulation-independent within the beta2-agonist class framework [^1148xogD] [^113dAR3G] [^112Yp2YQ].

> Final conclusion: Yes, terbutaline causes tachycardia via direct beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac tissue, with a class-consistent and dose-dependent increase in heart rate that can be clinically meaningful and, in some cases, arrhythmogenic, particularly in susceptible patients or at higher exposures [^112UuXuU] [^114N5Wqd] [^115BzTi9] [^112Nnc9f]. I should double-check that this aligns with incidence language: labeling lists sinus tachycardia as common and palpitations as very common on some formulations, which is concordant with observed trial data and postmarketing experience [^1148xogD] [^113dAR3G] [^113wKtfW].

> Clinical implications: I need to ensure heart rate and rhythm are monitored when initiating or up-titrating terbutaline, especially in patients with coronary disease, preexisting arrhythmias, or hypertension; correct contributory factors such as hypokalemia and co-administered sympathomimetics; and use the lowest effective dose, recognizing that tachycardia is an expected pharmacologic effect rather than an idiosyncratic reaction [^111GFWwh] [^113APxJM]. In pregnancy, be particularly vigilant given documented increases in maternal heart rate and arrhythmias in exposure reports, balancing maternal-fetal benefits and risks with alternatives when feasible [^117PFzWL] [^114sh5zH].

> Before closing, let me reconsider counterpoints. One might argue that recommended doses infrequently produce symptomatic tachycardia; however, labeling still acknowledges clinically significant cardiovascular effects at therapeutic use, objective increases in heart rate are documented in controlled settings, and the meta-analytic class signal is consistent, so the preponderance of evidence supports a causal relationship even if symptom severity varies by patient and dose [^111GFWwh] [^1148xogD] [^114N5Wqd]. I should confirm there is no contradictory high-quality evidence; I do not find any that negates the chronotropic effect, and mechanistic data further support plausibility through beta2-receptor mediated cardiac effects and repolarization changes [^112UuXuU] [^115Y4JpC].

Terbutaline causes **tachycardia** by stimulating cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors and increasing sympathetic tone [^114iMkH6]. Tachycardia is a **common adverse effect** [^1148xogD] with all routes [^113dAR3G], especially at higher doses [^114N5Wqd] or with rapid IV/SC administration. The risk is higher in patients with cardiovascular disease [^111GFWwh], hyperthyroidism [^111zXUHy], or when combined with other sympathomimetics or non–potassium-sparing diuretics [^112a31qd]. Clinicians should monitor heart rate [^111GFWwh] and use caution in at-risk patients.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism underlying tachycardia

Terbutaline is a selective β2-adrenergic agonist that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle via cAMP signaling [^112UuXuU] [^111GFWwh]. However, **cardiac β1 stimulation** increases heart rate and contractility, and β2-mediated vasodilation with reflex sympathetic activation further augments heart rate [^114iMkH6].

---

## Clinical evidence of terbutaline-induced tachycardia

Multiple studies and reports **confirm terbutaline-induced tachycardia**:

- **Pediatric asthma**: Continuous IV terbutaline increased heart rate by 9–13% above baseline, returning to below baseline within 1 hour after stopping [^112Yp2YQ].

- **Hyperkalemia**: SC terbutaline increased heart rate by a mean 25.8 ± 10.5 bpm (P < 0.001) [^115mGi9x].

- **Overdose**: Tachycardia up to 200 bpm is reported with excessive dosing [^115BzTi9].

---

## Incidence and severity of tachycardia

Tachycardia is a **common adverse effect** of terbutaline; incidence and severity vary by dose, route, and patient factors:

| **Route of administration** | **Incidence of tachycardia** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral | Common (1–10%) [^1148xogD] | Mild to moderate |
| Subcutaneous | Common (1–10%) [^113dAR3G] [^113wKtfW] | Mild to moderate |
| Intravenous (overdose) | - Very common <br/> - Severe | Severe (up to 200 bpm) |

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain populations are at **higher risk** of terbutaline-induced tachycardia:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Coronary insufficiency [^111GFWwh], arrhythmias [^113APxJM], hypertension [^113MK7dL].

- **Hyperthyroidism**: Increased sensitivity to sympathomimetics [^111GFWwh] [^111zXUHy].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Risk of hypokalemia and hyperglycemia [^113MK7dL] [^111GFWwh].

- **Pregnancy**: Maternal and fetal tachycardia reported [^117PFzWL] [^114sh5zH].

---

## Dose-dependence and route of administration

Tachycardia is **dose-dependent** [^114iMkH6] and more pronounced with higher doses or rapid IV/SC administration [^111GFWwh]; oral or inhaled routes generally cause milder effects [^114N5Wqd].

---

## Clinical management and monitoring

For **clinicians**, the following actions are recommended:

- **Monitor heart rate**: Regularly during therapy [^111GFWwh].

- **Adjust dose**: Reduce or stop if significant tachycardia occurs [^111GFWwh].

- **Use caution**: In patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes [^111zXUHy].

- **Avoid interactions**: With other sympathomimetics [^113APxJM] or non–potassium-sparing diuretics [^112a31qd].

---

## Comparison with other beta-agonists

Terbutaline's tachycardia risk is **similar to that of other short-acting β2-agonists** [^114iMkH6] (e.g. albuterol) [^113MK7dL], though individual susceptibility and dosing influence severity.

---

## Long-term cardiovascular implications

Chronic use may increase cardiovascular event risk, particularly in patients with preexisting disease. Long-term safety data are limited; therefore, **caution is advised** [^114N5Wqd].

---

Terbutaline commonly causes **tachycardia** via β1 stimulation and sympathetic activation; risk rises with higher doses, rapid IV/SC administration, and in susceptible patients. Clinicians should monitor heart rate, adjust dosing, and use caution in at-risk populations [^111GFWwh].

### Adverse effects of beta-agonists [^114iMkH6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonists have pharmacologically predictable dose-related and potency-related adverse effects, including tachycardia and tremor, and they also affect serum potassium and glucose. These effects all show tolerance with continued exposure. The potential for arrhythmia is increased by comorbidity and hypoxemia. Nonpharmacologically predictable effects include airway hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific and specific stimuli, including allergen and exercise, and increased airway inflammation. Genetic variants of the beta-adrenergic receptor alter susceptibility to adverse effects of beta-agonists on airway function. The impact of the enantiomers of beta-agonists on adverse effects remains unclear.

The two epidemics of asthma death among young people were temporally associated with the introduction of potent short-acting beta-agonists (isoproterenol and fenoterol) and appear to be related to adverse effects of these drugs on airway function and airway hyperresponsiveness rather than to cardiotoxicity. Compared with short-acting agents, long-acting beta-agonists show similar but less pronounced pharmacologically predictable effects, and they have not been shown to increase airway hyperresponsiveness in adults. Postmarketing surveillance studies have not suggested significant adverse effects of long-acting beta-agonists on morbidity and mortality.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^112a31qd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as terbutaline sulfate, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, terbutaline sulfate caused a significant and dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at dietary doses of 50 mg/kg and above (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis). In a 21-month study in CD-1 mice, terbutaline sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 200 mg/kg (approximately 55 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis).

### Terbutaline sulfate [^111GFWwh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of terbutaline sulfate than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g. corticosteroids.

- **Use of anti-inflammatory agents**: The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. corticosteroids.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Terbutaline sulfate, like all other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of terbutaline sulfate at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, terbutaline sulfate, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.

- **Seizures**: There have been rare reports of seizures in patients receiving terbutaline.

### Subcutaneous terbutaline use in CKD to reduce potassium concentrations [^115mGi9x]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Acute hyperkalemia is a frequent and potentially life-threatening medical problem in patients on maintenance hemodialysis therapy. Beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) stimulation causes potassium cellular influx and a decline in plasma potassium concentrations. Therefore, betaAR agonists are used in the treatment of patients with hyperkalemia. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of weight-based subcutaneous terbutaline dosing to reduce plasma potassium concentrations in a group of subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis.

- **Methods**: Fourteen subjects with CKD receiving long-term hemodialysis were administered terbutaline, 7 microg/kg, subcutaneously. Heart rate measurements and blood samples for potassium concentration determinations were made serially for 420 minutes. Effects of terbutaline on heart rate and potassium responses were determined in each subject.

- **Results**: Terbutaline significantly reduced plasma potassium concentrations and significantly increased heart rates during the time course of the study (P < 0.001, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Mean reduction in peak potassium concentration (-1.31 ± 0.5 [SD] mEq/L) and increase in peak heart rate (25.8 ± 10.5 beats/min) were significantly different from baseline (P < 0.001, baseline versus peak for both responses). No subject reported significant adverse effects.

- **Conclusion**: Administration of subcutaneous terbutaline obviates the need for intravenous access and should be considered as an alternative to nebulized or inhaled beta-agonists to treat acute hyperkalemia in CKD patients on hemodialysis.

### Albuterol [^113MK7dL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Albuterol, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially those with coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. It should also be used cautiously in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and in those unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed in some patients and can be expected after using any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to exacerbate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. As with other beta-agonists, albuterol may cause significant hypokalemia in some patients, potentially through intracellular shunting. This decrease in potassium is usually transient and does not typically require supplementation.

The action of albuterol tablets may last up to 8 hours or longer. Albuterol tablets should not be taken more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency without consulting your physician. If treatment with albuterol tablets becomes less effective, symptoms worsen, or if there is a need to take the product more frequently than usual, seek medical attention immediately. While taking albuterol tablets, other asthma medications and inhaled drugs should only be taken as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include:

### Cardiovascular effects of beta-agonists in patients with asthma and COPD: A meta-analysis [^114N5Wqd]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic agonists exert physiological effects that are the opposite of those of beta-blockers. Beta-blockers are known to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiac disease. However, beta(2)-agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, and acute cardiac death.

- **Objectives**: To assess the cardiovascular safety of beta(2)-agonist use in patients with obstructive airway disease, defined as asthma or COPD.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of beta(2)-agonist treatment in patients with obstructive airway disease was performed. This was to evaluate the short-term effect on heart rate and potassium concentrations and the long-term effect on adverse cardiovascular events. Longer duration trials were included in the analysis if they reported at least one adverse event. Adverse events included sinus and ventricular tachycardia, syncope, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or sudden death.

- **Results**: Thirteen single-dose trials and 20 longer duration trials were included in the study. A single dose of beta(2)-agonist increased the heart rate by 9.12 beats/min (95% confidence interval, 5.32 to 12.92) and reduced the potassium concentration by 0.36 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.54), compared to placebo. For trials lasting from 3 days to 1 year, beta(2)-agonist treatment significantly increased the risk for a cardiovascular event (relative risk [RR], 2.54; 95% CI, 1.59 to 4).

### Safety of terbutaline for treatment of acute severe pediatric asthma [^112Yp2YQ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Use of continuous intravenous terbutaline treatment in severe asthma attacks has been hampered by the lack of well-powered clinical trials where the effects of such treatment are described in detail. Here, we aimed to provide a descriptive report on the largest cohort of severe pediatric asthma patients treated with terbutaline.

- **Methods**: The study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit in a large metropolitan tertiary care university hospital with 124 patients receiving terbutaline infusion. To stratify the effect of, and determine any age-related differences in, terbutaline, the patients were divided into three age groups (0–6 years, 7–12 years, and 13–18 years). Clinical responses and the potential harmful effects of terbutaline infusion were determined.

- **Results**: There were significant reductions in systolic (varying between 86% and 93% of the baseline) and diastolic blood pressures (varying between 74% and 86% of the baseline level). However, the values returned to baseline level shortly after discontinuation of infusion. Terbutaline increased heart rates in all groups shortly after initiation (9%-13% above baseline), which returned to below baseline levels one hour after discontinuation. Serum potassium levels were also reduced in all patients compared to their baseline values after initiation of terbutaline infusion. However, none of the subjects required potassium replacement.

- **Conclusions**: The results indicate that overall, terbutaline infusion was well tolerated without irreversible adverse effects of the treatment.

### SPL drug information for terbutaline sulfate [^117PFzWL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of terbutaline sulfate SC in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use due to evidence of fetal harm in humans. Serious adverse reactions such as increased heart rate, transient hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, and death have been reported in pregnant women after taking this drug. Increased fetal heart rate and neonatal hypoglycemia may occur as a result of maternal administration.

- **Maintenance therapy for asthma and other pulmonary diseases**: Use with caution at the end of pregnancy because of the potential tocolytic effect.
- **Labor and delivery**: The use for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

The drug terbutaline sulfate SC is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^113APxJM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Terbutaline, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines, and convulsive disorders. Significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions and exacerbations of bronchospasm have been reported after terbutaline administration. Beta-adrenergic agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in potassium is usually transient and does not require supplementation.

Large doses of intravenous terbutaline sulfate have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes and ketoacidosis.

The action of terbutaline sulfate should last up to 6 hours or longer. It should not be used more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of terbutaline sulfate without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with terbutaline sulfate becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms worsen, and/or you need to use the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While taking terbutaline sulfate, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^112UuXuU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that terbutaline exerts a preferential effect on beta2-adrenergic receptors. While it is recognized that beta2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta2-receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10% to 50% [see warnings]. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.

In controlled clinical studies in patients given terbutaline sulfate orally, proportionally greater changes occurred in pulmonary function parameters than in heart rate or blood pressure. This suggests a relative preference for the beta2-receptors in humans. However, the usual cardiovascular effects commonly associated with other sympathomimetic agents were also observed with terbutaline sulfate.

The pharmacologic effects of beta-adrenergic agonists, including terbutaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta-adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

Controlled clinical studies have shown that terbutaline sulfate relieves bronchospasm in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by significantly increasing pulmonary function, such as an increase of 15% or more in FEV1.

### Beta(2) adrenergic receptors mediate important electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium [^115Y4JpC]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

To define the effects of beta(2) adrenergic receptor stimulation on ventricular repolarisation in vivo, a prospective study was conducted at a tertiary referral centre. The study involved 85 patients with coronary artery disease and 22 normal controls.

Patients received intravenous and intracoronary salbutamol, a beta(2) adrenergic receptor selective agonist (10–30 microg/min and 1–10 microg/min), as well as intravenous isoprenaline, a mixed beta(1)/beta(2) adrenergic receptor agonist (1–5 microg/min), during fixed atrial pacing.

- **Main outcome measures**: QT intervals, QT dispersion, and monophasic action potential duration.

In patients with coronary artery disease, salbutamol decreased QT(onset) and QT(peak) but increased QT(end) duration. The QT(onset)-QT(peak) and QT(peak)-QT(end) intervals increased, resulting in T wave prolongation (mean (SEM): 201 (2) ms to 233 (2) ms; p < 0.01). There was a significant increase in dispersion of QT(onset), QT(peak), and QT(end), particularly in those with coronary artery disease; for example, QT(end) dispersion increased from 50 (2) ms baseline to 98 (4) ms with salbutamol in controls, and from 70 (1) ms baseline to 108 (3) ms in coronary artery disease patients (p < 0.001). Similar responses were noted with isoprenaline. Additionally, monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarisation shortened during intracoronary infusion of salbutamol, from 278 (4.1) ms to 257 (3.8) ms (p < 0.05).

Beta(2) adrenergic receptors mediate significant electrophysiological effects in human ventricular myocardium. The increase in dispersion of repolarisation provides important insights into…

### SPL drug information for terbutaline sulfate [^113wKtfW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Very common adverse reactions (over 10%) associated with the use of terbutaline sulfate SC include palpitations, somnolence, and tremor.

---

### Terbutaline sulfate [^114sh5zH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oral terbutaline sulfate has not been approved and should not be used for acute or maintenance tocolysis. In particular, terbutaline sulfate should not be used for maintenance tocolysis in the outpatient or home setting. Serious adverse reactions, including death, have been reported after administration of terbutaline sulfate to pregnant women.

In the mother, these adverse reactions include increased heart rate, transient hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and myocardial ischemia. Increased fetal heart rate and neonatal hypoglycemia may occur as a result of maternal administration (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, Tocolysis).

Overdosage

The median subcutaneous lethal dose of terbutaline sulfate in mature rats is approximately 165 mg/kg, which is about 90 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis. In young rats, the median subcutaneous lethal dose is approximately 2000 mg/kg, approximately 1100 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose for adults on a mg/m² basis.

The expected symptoms of overdosage include excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or the occurrence or exaggeration of symptoms listed under adverse reactions, such as:

- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, arrhythmias, palpitations
- **Neurological symptoms**: nervousness, headache, tremor, dizziness, insomnia
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: dry mouth, nausea
- **General symptoms**: fatigue, malaise

Hypokalemia may also occur.

There is no specific antidote. Treatment involves the discontinuation of terbutaline sulfate along with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The cautious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can induce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of terbutaline sulfate.

For an alert patient who has taken excessive oral medication, the stomach should be emptied by induced emesis followed by lavage. In unconscious patients, the airway should be secured with a cuffed endotracheal tube before lavage; emesis should not be induced. The instillation of an activated charcoal slurry may help reduce the absorption of terbutaline.

### The occurrence of adverse events in women receiving continuous subcutaneous terbutaline therapy [^114KD3RT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in patients receiving continuous subcutaneous terbutaline after arrested preterm labor. Women with singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies prescribed continuous subcutaneous terbutaline were studied. Electronic patient records were reviewed for patient tolerance of medication and serious adverse events. The primary study outcome was the frequency of serious adverse events.

Available for analysis were 9359 patient records. Transient medication side effects were reported by 1447 (15.5%) patients. Severe adverse events were identified in 12 patients, either during treatment with continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (n = 4) or after discontinuation of outpatient treatment (n = 8). The most frequent serious adverse event was pulmonary edema (n = 9). There was no maternal mortality.

Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline infusion was associated with an extremely low incidence of serious adverse events. Patients with comorbidities and/or concomitant tocolysis with intravenous magnesium sulfate should be closely assessed for the development of serious adverse events.

### Microwave ablation for twin-reversed arterial perfusion sequence [^117C6yg8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Following the procedure, the patient experienced irregular uterine contractions, which were managed conservatively using subcutaneous terbutaline and close inpatient observation. Maternal vital signs remained stable, and no signs of chorioamnionitis or placental abruption were observed. Serial cardiotocography and ultrasound monitoring were performed.

A follow-up ultrasound on postoperative day 3 demonstrated a marked reduction in the size of the acardiac mass and resolution of flow signals within its vasculature, confirming procedural efficacy. The pump twin showed improved cardiovascular parameters, including normalization of MPI and reduction of previously noted hepatomegaly. Amniotic fluid volume also improved, with the DVP reduced from 15 cm to 12 cm, indicating alleviation of volume overload and improved hemodynamic status.

On postoperative day 4, the patient developed regular uterine contractions, with cervical dilation progressing to 2 cm and 50% effacement. In the setting of re-polyhydramnios, a bedside amnioreduction was performed, draining approximately 2500 mL of clear amniotic fluid. This intervention reduced the DVP to 7 cm and temporarily relieved uterine distension.

Despite this, rapid cervical progression ensued, reaching 9 cm within 3 hours. Given the breech presentation of the pump twin and the extreme prematurity at 25 weeks and 5 days, an emergency caesarean section was performed to minimize neonatal trauma and optimize perinatal outcomes.

The acardiac twin was delivered first and weighed 510 grams.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^113SSivJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015).

The observed changes in HRV suggest a decrease in parasympathetic tone. Similar results were seen in a small study using the SABA salbutamol. However, given the absence of significant changes in MSNA and baroreflex sensitivity, the HRV findings are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, changes in ventilation and heart rate, as observed in our study, impact HRV, rendering interpretation even more problematic.

Sympathoexcitation in COPD is thought to be caused by several mechanisms, such as hypoxia, chemoreflexes, impaired baroreflexes, and lung hyperinflation. Lung hyperinflation affects the autonomic nervous system by activating intrapulmonary non-myelinated afferents and by increasing end-expiratory pressure, which impairs left ventricular filling and reduces stroke volume. Additionally, hyperinflation increases the work of breathing, thereby impacting muscle metaboreceptors. Thus, we speculated that the improvement of lung function and hyperinflation following inhaled therapy reduces sympathetic activation. However, despite reducing hyperinflation, salmeterol did not impact sympathetic tone in our study. It is possible that the positive effects mediated via bronchodilation were too small to elicit a reduction in sympathetic activity. It is also possible that any positive effects on sympathetic activity were offset by the consequences of systemic β-receptor activation. Our study is not able to further dissect these possibilities. In this context, it would be interesting to investigate inhaled therapy with stronger bronchodilator activity.

### Salbutamol for transient tachypnea of the newborn [^117QJ1Qu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is characterized by tachypnea and signs of respiratory distress. It typically appears within the first two hours of life in term and late preterm newborns. Although usually self-limited, transient tachypnea of the newborn is associated with wheezing syndromes in late childhood. The rationale for using salbutamol (albuterol) for this condition is based on studies indicating that β-agonists can accelerate alveolar fluid clearance. This review was originally published in 2016 and updated in 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether salbutamol, compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other drugs, is effective and safe for infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age with this diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2020, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library; PubMed (1996 to April 2020), Embase (1980 to April 2020); and CINAHL (1982 to April 2020). We applied no language restrictions and also reviewed abstracts from major congresses in the field, such as the Perinatal Society of Australia New Zealand and Pediatric Academic Societies, from 2000 to 2020, along with clinical trial registries.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, and cluster trials comparing salbutamol versus placebo, no treatment, or any other drugs administered to infants born at 34 weeks' gestational age or more, and less than three days of age with transient tachypnea.

### Metoprolol [^1158RCiC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Worsening cardiac failure may occur. Bronchospastic disease requires avoiding beta blockers. In cases of pheochromocytoma, therapy should first be initiated with an alpha blocker. Symptoms of arterial insufficiency may be aggravated.

- **Bradycardia**: Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest, has occurred with the use of metoprolol tartrate injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. It is important to monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving metoprolol tartrate injection. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop the metoprolol tartrate injection.

- **Heart failure**: Worsening cardiac failure may occur during metoprolol use. If such symptoms occur, it is advisable to increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before administering the next dose of metoprolol. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of oral metoprolol.

- **Bronchospastic disease**: Patients with bronchospastic diseases, in general, should not receive beta-blockers as they can exacerbate bronchospasm. However, due to its relative beta1 cardio-selectivity, metoprolol may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease for the initial treatment of myocardial infarction. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: If metoprolol tartrate is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be combined with an alpha blocker.

### Management of uterine hyperstimulation with concomitant use of oxytocin and terbutaline [^114QCXM1]. American Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the concomitant use of subcutaneous terbutaline and oxytocin for the management of uterine hyperstimulation. Patients in active labor receiving intravenous oxytocin who developed uterine hyperstimulation were randomly assigned to receive either oxytocin discontinuation or administration of subcutaneous terbutaline while maintaining the oxytocin infusion. Time to resolution of hyperstimulation was the primary endpoint. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled.

- **Types of hyperstimulation**: The most frequent types were tachysystole (26%) and mixed patterns (26%).
- **Resolution time**: Resolution time was significantly shorter in the combination therapy versus control (P = 0.002).
- **Persistence after intervention**: Persistence of hyperstimulation 15 minutes after intervention was seen in 53% of the women in the control group versus 0% of the women in the study group.
- **Apgar scores and additional outcomes**: No significant differences were noted in the Apgar scores, rates of cesarean sections, or chorioamnionitis.

In the management of uterine hyperstimulation, subcutaneous terbutaline without discontinuation of oxytocin is more effective than the traditional approach of oxytocin discontinuation.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^114AYKQn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- **Adults**: The usual oral dose of terbutaline sulfate for adults is 5 mg administered at approximately six-hour intervals, three times daily, during the hours the patient is usually awake. If side effects are particularly disturbing, the dose may be reduced to 2.5 mg three times daily, and still provide a clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 15 mg.

	- **Children**: Terbutaline sulfate is not recommended for use in children below the age of 12 years. A dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily is recommended for children 12 to 15 years of age. The total dose within 24 hours should not exceed 7.5 mg.

If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma that would require reassessment of therapy.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with use of salbutamol nebulisation and aminophylline infusion in a patient with acute asthma exacerbation [^112NkpYz]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as apical ballooning syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction that mimics myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture on coronary angiography. The exact mechanism of myocardial dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown. However, due to its association with physical and emotional stress, it is postulated that catecholamines play a central role in its pathogenesis. We present a case of a patient who was admitted with acute asthma exacerbation and was treated with β-2 agonist nebulisation and intravenous aminophylline. During her hospital stay, she developed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

### β-blockers, heart disease and COPD: Current controversies and uncertainties [^112zW9Xx]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Treating people with cardiovascular disease and COPD causes significant clinician anxiety. β-blockers save lives in people with heart disease, specifically post-infarction and heart failure. COPD and heart disease frequently coexist, and people with both disorders have particularly high cardiovascular mortality. There are concerns about giving β-blockers to people with concomitant COPD, including reduced basal lung function, diminished effectiveness of emergency β-agonist treatments, reduced benefit of long-acting β-agonist treatment, and difficulty in discriminating between asthma and COPD.

β-blockers appear to reduce lung function in both the general population and those with COPD because they are poorly selective for cardiac β1-adrenoceptors over respiratory β2-adrenoceptors. Studies have shown that higher β-agonist doses are required to overcome the β-blockade. COPD and cardiovascular disease share similar environmental risks, and both disease states have high adrenergic and inflammatory activation. β-blockers may, therefore, be particularly helpful in reducing cardiovascular events in this high-risk group. They may reduce the background inflammatory state and inhibit the tachycardia and hypertension associated with both the endogenous adrenaline and high-dose β-agonist treatment associated with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Some studies have suggested no increased and, at times, reduced mortality in patients with COPD taking β-blockers for heart disease; however, these are all observational studies, and there are no randomized controlled trials.

### Terbutaline versus nifedipine for prolongation of pregnancy in patients with preterm labor [^111CPxDY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness, safety, and possible adverse effects of terbutaline and nifedipine in prolonging pregnancy beyond 48 hours, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with 174 pregnant women admitted with preterm labor. These participants were randomized into two groups, with 95 patients receiving terbutaline and 79 patients receiving nifedipine. The researchers utilized bivariate and multivariate analyses, including logistic regression, to analyze the data.

No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups concerning the prolongation of gestation to 48 hours. The failure rate to prolong gestation for 24 hours was 12.6% in the terbutaline group and 10.1% in the nifedipine group, which was not statistically significant (P value = 0.61). Side effects were significantly more common in the terbutaline group, except for maternal hypotension.

Overall, terbutaline and nifedipine appear to be equally effective in their tocolytic action. However, nifedipine offered the advantage of ease of administration and had significantly less impact on the fetal heart rate.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^115ybrNk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Neurohumoral activation is present in COPD and might provide a link between pulmonary and systemic effects, especially cardiovascular disease. Because long-acting inhaled β-agonists reduce hyperinflation, they could reduce sympathoexcitation by improving the inflation reflex. We aimed to evaluate if inhaled therapy with salmeterol reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) evaluated by microneurography.

- **Methods**: MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were continually measured. After baseline recording of 20 minutes, a placebo was administered. After a further 45 minutes, salmeterol (50 μg) was administered, followed by another 45 minutes of data recording. Additionally, lung function, plasma catecholamine levels, arterial pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated. Following 4 weeks of treatment with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily, measurements were repeated without placebo administration.

- **Results**: A total of 32 COPD patients were included. Valid MSNA signals were obtained from 18 patients. Changes in MSNA (bursts/100 heartbeats) following acute administration of salmeterol did not differ significantly from the changes following the placebo (-1.96 ± 9.81 vs. -0.65 ± 9.07; p = 0.51), although hyperinflation was significantly reduced. Likewise, no changes in MSNA or catecholamines were observed after 4 weeks. Heart rate increased significantly by 3.8 ± 4.2 (p < 0.01) acutely and 3.9 ± 4.3 bpm (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Salmeterol treatment was safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: By using microneurography as a gold standard, it was determined that salmeterol treatment does not significantly alter sympathetic activity as measured by MSNA in COPD patients.

### Early administration of terbutaline in severe pediatric asthma may reduce incidence of acute respiratory failure [^117TET3F]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Severe pediatric asthma, if not immediately and aggressively treated, may progress to acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Intravenous (IV) terbutaline, a β2 agonist, is dispensed when the initial treatment does not improve the clinical condition.

- **Objective**: To investigate the influence of early initiation of IV terbutaline on the incidence of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in severe pediatric asthma.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 120 subjects. These included 35 patients from an outside hospital emergency department (ED) with a late start of terbutaline and 85 patients from the authors' hospital ED with early initiation of IV terbutaline. All patients were admitted to the PICU with severe asthma and treated with continuous IV terbutaline. Responses to terbutaline treatment and outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Patients transported from outlying hospital EDs had shorter pre-PICU mean durations of IV terbutaline than those transferred from the authors' ED (0.69 ± 1.38 and 2.91 ± 2.47 hours, respectively, P = 0.001). Out of 35 patients from outlying EDs, 21 (60%) required mechanical ventilation compared with 14 of 85 patients (16%) from the authors' ED (P = 0.001). Durations of pre-PICU terbutaline infusion for patients requiring mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter than for those with no such requirement (P = 0.015).

- **Conclusion**: The results of the present study, conducted in the largest number of subjects at the time of writing, suggest that early administration of continuous terbutaline may reduce the incidence of acute respiratory failure in severe pediatric asthma.

### SPL drug information for terbutaline sulfate [^114dCqbD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of terbutaline sulfate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Serious adverse reactions, such as increased heart rate, transient hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, and death, have been reported in pregnant women after taking this drug. Increased fetal heart rate and neonatal hypoglycemia may occur as a result of maternal administration.

- **Maintenance therapy for asthma and other pulmonary diseases**: Use with caution at the end of pregnancy because of the potential tocolytic effect.

- **Labor and delivery**: The use for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.

The drug terbutaline sulfate PO is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus being observed.

### Continuous subcutaneous terbutaline administration prolongs pregnancy after recurrent preterm labor [^111v9XpG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (SQT) administration at home in patients with recurrent preterm labor (RPTL). Women with RPTL at less than 32 weeks' gestation received continuous home-administered SQT compared with matched control patients.

The study involved a comparison between fifteen SQT-treated patients and forty-five control women (3:1 ratio) who received no tocolytic therapy after hospitalization. The gestational age at delivery was greater than 37 weeks in 53% of the SQT group versus 4% in the control group, with 0% versus 47% delivering at less than 32 weeks, respectively. The duration of pregnancy was significantly longer in the study group, averaging 49.8 ± 19.2 days compared to 24.5 ± 12.8 days in the control group (P < 0.001).

The SQT group also showed fewer maternal hospital days (9.8 ± 2.1 vs. 15.9 ± 7.4, P < 0.0001), shorter NICU stays (1.9 ± 4.9 vs. 19.8 ± 29.3 days, P < 0.001), and reduced total newborn care costs (6,995 ± 14,822 US dollars vs. 62,033 ± 89,978 US dollars, P < 0.002). Financially, for every dollar spent on SQT, there was a savings of 4.67 US dollars in newborn hospital costs for the control patients.

In conclusion, despite the small sample size, the use of SQT significantly prolongs pregnancy, decreases serious neonatal complications, and reduces the duration of hospitalization for both mother and infant, as well as neonatal costs.

### Rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of intravenous tocolytic therapy with terbutaline in the treatment of preterm labor: Anesthetic implications [^114r6EA4]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic agents have been widely used in obstetrics to attenuate premature labor (termed tocolytic therapy), delay delivery, allow fetal maturation, and thereby reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hypokalemia is a common side effect during beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy for the treatment of preterm labor. Although rebound hyperkalemia after cessation of tocolytic therapy with ritodrine has been reported, there have been no reports of hyperkalemia occurring after the cessation of beta-adrenergic tocolytic therapy with terbutaline for preterm labor; we report such a case.

### Rapiblyk [^115Jj3uZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- **Negative inotropes and chronotropes**: Avoid concomitant use of Rapiblyk with negative inotropes and medications that slow heart rate or cardiac conduction. Beta-blockers, like Rapiblyk, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and increase the risk of bradycardia or heart block. Concomitant use of Rapiblyk with negative inotropes or chronotropes may augment these effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)(5.3)].

	- **Sympathomimetics, positive inotropes, and vasoconstrictors**: Beta adrenergic agonists will antagonize the effects of Rapiblyk and may attenuate the heart rate-lowering effects of Rapiblyk. Positive inotropes and vasoconstrictors may attenuate the heart rate and blood pressure lowering effects of Rapiblyk.

	- **Catecholamine depleting drugs**: Observe patients treated with Rapiblyk plus a catecholamine depletor (e.g. reserpine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) for hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may cause vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Catecholamine depleting drugs may have an additive effect when given with beta-blockers, which may increase the risk of hypotension or marked bradycardia-related vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes show no correlation with electrophysiological changes during hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp in young people with type 1 diabetes [^1171Ttus]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate whether hypoglycemia, known to cause QT-interval prolongation and appear pro-arrhythmogenic, could have related electrophysiological changes induced by salbutamol, a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist that also prolongs the QT interval. The hypothesis suggested that salbutamol might serve as a non-invasive tool to predict electrophysiological responses to hypoglycemia.

Eighteen individuals with type 1 diabetes received 2.5 mg of nebulized salbutamol. Participants then underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp at 2.5 mmol/l for 1 hour. Heart rate and serum potassium levels, along with catecholamines during the clamp, were measured, and a high-resolution electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded at pre-set time points. Cardiac repolarization was assessed through QT-interval duration adjusted for heart rate (QTc), T-wave amplitude (Tamp), T-peak to T-end interval duration (TpTend), and T-wave area symmetry (Tsym). Maximum changes compared to baseline in both experiments were evaluated for linear dependence.

Upon salbutamol administration, QTc and TpTend prolongation occurred, alongside a decrease in Tamp and Tsym. Conversely, hypoglycemia resulted in increased plasma catecholamines, hypokalemia, QTc and TpTend prolongation, and decreased Tamp and Tsym. There were no significant correlations found between maximum changes in QTc [r = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.341 to 0.576; P = 0.553], TpTend (r = 0.075, 95% CI -0.406 to 0.524; P = 0.767), and Tsym (r = 0.355, 95% CI…

### Terbutaline accumulates in blood and urine after daily therapeutic inhalation [^111hQfav]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of terbutaline after single and seven consecutive days of inhalation in exercising trained men.

- **Methods**: Twelve healthy trained men underwent two pharmacokinetic trials comparing a single dose (2 mg) and seven consecutive days (2 mg·d) of inhaled terbutaline. After inhalation of terbutaline at each trial, subjects performed 90 minutes of bike ergometer exercise at 55%-65% of maximal oxygen consumption, after which they stayed inactive. Blood and urine samples were collected before and after inhalation of terbutaline. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: The maximum serum concentration of terbutaline (Cmax) (6.4 ± 1.2 vs 4.9 ± 1.2 ng·mL, P = 0.01) (mean ± 95% confidence interval) and the area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours after inhalation (AUC0–4) (16 ± 3 vs 13 ± 2 ng·mL·h, P ≤ 0.005) were higher after 7 days of inhalation compared with the first day. Seven days of terbutaline inhalation resulted in an accumulation of terbutaline in urine, with total urine excretion of terbutaline being higher after 7 days of inhalation compared with the first day (274 ± 43 vs 194 ± 33 μg, P ≤ 0.001). These differences were partly attributed to the systemic accumulation of terbutaline after consecutive days of inhalation, as baseline serum and urine samples revealed incomplete elimination of terbutaline.

- **Conclusion**: Terbutaline accumulates in serum and urine after consecutive days of inhalation. For doping control purposes, these observations are of relevance if a urine threshold is considered.

### Atrial fibrillation in pregnancy associated with oral terbutaline [^112Nnc9f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Terbutaline has direct effects on the cardiac conduction system, but when used to treat preterm labor, it is rarely associated with clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias. Commonly used drug references did not list atrial fibrillation as a complication of terbutaline, and our literature search found only one case of atrial fibrillation that occurred with parenteral administration.

- **Case**: A 30-year-old gravida 1 carrying a twin gestation at 35 weeks was taking 2.5 mg oral terbutaline four times daily for premature labor. She developed atrial fibrillation and was ultimately treated by chemical cardioversion with procainamide to restore normal sinus rhythm.

- **Conclusion**: This is the first report of atrial fibrillation during pregnancy associated with oral terbutaline. Atrial fibrillation should be added as a complication of oral terbutaline therapy.

### Terbutaline sulfate [^115YYVpX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions observed with terbutaline sulfate are similar to those commonly seen with other sympathomimetic amines. All of these reactions are generally transient in nature and usually do not require treatment. The frequency of these side effects appears to diminish with continued therapy.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following table lists the adverse reactions seen in 199 patients treated with terbutaline sulfate tablets during six double-blind crossover studies and four double-blind parallel studies (short- and long-term) performed in the United States.

- **Percent incidence of adverse reactions (total daily dosage range 5 mg to 15 mg) terbutaline N = 199**: The following adverse effects each occurred in fewer than 1% of patients: hallucinations, rash, paresthesia, hypertonia (muscle cramps), vomiting. There have been rare reports of elevation in liver enzymes and of hypersensitivity vasculitis.

After the successful inhibition of threatened preterm labour, women are at high risk of recurrent preterm labour. Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has been used to reduce adverse neonatal outcomes. This review replaces an earlier Cochrane review, published in 2002, which is no longer being updated by the team.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of terbutaline pump maintenance therapy after threatened preterm labour in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing terbutaline pump therapy with alternative therapy, placebo, or no therapy after arrest of threatened preterm labour.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and then extracted data as eligible for inclusion in qualitative and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).

- **Main results**: Four studies were included with a total of 234 women randomised. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was mixed. Two studies provided very little information on study methods, there was high sample attrition in one study, and in three studies the risk of performance bias was high. We found no strong evidence that terbutaline maintenance therapy offered any advantages over saline placebo or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labour.

### Association of antenatal terbutaline and respiratory support requirements in preterm neonates [^115MsDa8]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

Before the advent of antenatal steroids, early non-invasive respiratory support (NIV), and intratracheal surfactant, antenatal terbutaline was used to improve lung compliance and reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

- **Objectives**: The objective of this paper was to study the association between antenatal terbutaline and endotracheal intubation (ET) within the first 24 hours of life, RDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in infants with a gestational age (GA) of less than 32 weeks. Additionally, it aimed to study the association between antenatal terbutaline and either ET or NIV within the first 24 hours of life, and RDS in infants with a GA of 32 to 36 weeks.

- **Method**: This was a retrospective medical record review of preterm infants delivered at a single tertiary care center from October 2016 to December 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between antenatal terbutaline and neonatal respiratory support.

- **Result**: A total of 1,794 infants were included in the study. Among them, 234 (13.0%) had a GA of less than 32 weeks and 1,560 (86.9%) had a GA of 32 to 36 weeks. Antenatal terbutaline, corticosteroid, or both agents were administered in 561 (31.3%), 1,461 (81.4%), and 555 (30.9%) cases, respectively. Antenatal terbutaline was significantly associated with a reduction in ET (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19–0.82, p = 0.012) in infants with a GA of less than 32 weeks, but not in infants with a GA of 32–36 weeks. Antenatal terbutaline was not associated with RDS or BPD.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^113Kgex3]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether bedtime administration of 2.5 mg of the β2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline could prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing morning hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes, as opposed to the 5.0 mg dose, which is known to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia but causes morning hyperglycemia.

- **Research design and methods**: This study was a randomized, double-blind crossover pilot involving 15 patients with type 1 diabetes. Participants were administered either a placebo, 2.5 mg terbutaline, or 5.0 mg terbutaline.

- **Results**: Mean ± SE nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were 87 ± 14 mg/dl with placebo, 100 ± 14 mg/dl with 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 122 ± 13 mg/dl with 5.0 mg terbutaline, all showing statistical significance (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). The nadir levels dropped below 50 mg/dl in 5 patients on placebo, 2 patients on 2.5 mg terbutaline, and none on 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Morning glucose levels were recorded at 113 ± 18 mg/dl with placebo, 127 ± 17 mg/dl with 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 183 ± 19 mg/dl with 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.02 vs. placebo).

- **Conclusions**: Terbutaline may prove to be effective and safe in preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes in a suitably powered randomized controlled trial.

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^117HRyuZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study design**: This was a partially blinded, single-arm, single-centre study involving subjects with COPD GOLD stage II or III. The study included a screening visit, two study visits (visit 1 at week 0 and visit 2 at week 4), and one telephone contact at week 2. At the screening visit, the eligibility of the subjects was assessed, and written informed consent was obtained. At visit 1, a complex measurement period with continuous recordings of MSNA, blood pressure, tidal volume, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and transcutaneous CO2 was conducted while subjects inhaled placebo and 50 μg salmeterol sequentially. Following visit 1, all subjects were treated with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily for 4 weeks. At visit 2, these observations were repeated without placebo inhalation. Subjects were recruited from a single study centre with the assistance of two local chest physicians and newspaper advertisements.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Male or female patients aged between 40 and 80 years were eligible to enter the study. A prerequisite for inclusion was COPD GOLD class II or III with a post-bronchodilator spirometry forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 70% predicted, or a prior history of ≥ 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The main exclusion criteria were concomitant active lung diseases other than COPD, exacerbation or hospitalization due to COPD six weeks prior to screening, frequent exacerbations necessitating therapy with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, non-invasive ventilation, or treatment with drugs affecting sympathetic tone (e.g. theophylline).

### Combination of budesonide/formoterol on demand improves asthma control by reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^114fU52Z]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Although terbutaline protected against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) when inhaled on demand throughout the study, as indicated by the low symptom scores even on exercise days, the bronchial response to exercise was unaltered, or even slightly increased, after six weeks of treatment with inhaled terbutaline on demand as monotherapy. As the symptom scores did not differ between groups on the exercise days, the patients did not seem to perceive a difference in the protective effect between terbutaline and budesonide/formoterol when inhaled prior to exercise. However, the results clearly indicate that treatment with the combination on demand provides better protection for occasional, unplanned exertion than terbutaline on demand as monotherapy.

Continuous treatment with a β2 agonist may increase the bronchial response to methacholine and exercise. In addition, the enhancement of bronchial response to methacholine induced by repeated low-dose allergen challenges is counteracted by inhalation of a combination of a steroid (budesonide) and a rapid-acting β2 agonist (formoterol), but not by inhalation of formoterol alone. There are thus a number of studies showing that regular treatment with a β2 agonist alone has no beneficial effect on airway responsiveness over time. The present study is in agreement with these findings, as treatment with a β2 agonist alone did not alter airways response to exercise over time. We conclude that monotherapy with a β2 agonist on demand, which is not indicated for regular use in more severe asthma, may also be avoided in patients with mild asthma.

### Ivabradine use in critical care: a systematic review and metanalysis of cardiogenic and septic shock patients [^112jZZSm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Tachycardia is a common trait of acute circulatory failure; while it initially serves to maintain adequate cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygenation, it may persist over time despite appropriate fluid and vasopressor resuscitation, or it may result from inotropic therapy. In patients with septic shock, persistent tachycardia was associated with a higher probability of death, yet beta-blockers showed no effect on outcome, with concerns of possible harm due to their negative effect on myocardial contractility. In patients with low cardiac output during cardiogenic shock or after cardiac surgery, dobutamine is administered to improve contractility and cardiac output. Yet, it can induce persistent tachycardia, with negative effects on myocardial metabolism, cardiac efficiency, and is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias.

Ivabradine is an approved drug for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, serving as an adjunct to beta-blockers for rate control. It is available in pills to be administered twice daily, with a 2-hour main half-life and an 11-hour effective half-life. This drug targets the sinoatrial node "funny" currents (If) channels, responsible for its pacemaker activity. By interacting only with the active state of the channel, ivabradine can reduce heart rate without causing severe bradycardia. Unlike beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, ivabradine does not exhibit negative inotropic effects, making its use appealing in patients with impaired contractility, acute circulatory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction. However…

### Inhaled β-agonist does not modify sympathetic activity in patients with COPD [^115mpibR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Neurohumoral activation is present in COPD and might provide a link between pulmonary and systemic effects, especially cardiovascular disease. Because long-acting inhaled β-agonists reduce hyperinflation, they could reduce sympathoexcitation by improving the inflation reflex. We aimed to evaluate if inhaled therapy with salmeterol reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), evaluated by microneurography.

- **Methods**: MSNA, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration were continually measured. After a baseline recording of 20 minutes, placebo was administered; following a further 45 minutes, salmeterol (50 μg) was administered, followed by a further 45 minutes of data recording. Additionally, lung function, plasma catecholamine levels, arterial pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated. Following 4 weeks of treatment with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily, measurements were repeated without placebo administration.

- **Results**: A total of 32 COPD patients were included, and valid MSNA signals were obtained from 18 patients. Change in MSNA (bursts/100 heartbeats) following acute administration of salmeterol did not differ significantly from the change following placebo (-1.96 ± 9.81 vs. -0.65 ± 9.07; p = 0.51) although hyperinflation was significantly reduced. Likewise, no changes in MSNA or catecholamines were observed after 4 weeks. Heart rate increased significantly by 3.8 ± 4.2 bpm (p < 0.01) acutely and 3.9 ± 4.3 bpm (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Salmeterol treatment was safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: By using microneurography, it was concluded that inhaled salmeterol does not modify sympathetic nerve activity in COPD patients.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^117KJXxW]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

These data confirm a high frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with aggressively treated type 1 diabetes. In the absence of an active bedtime treatment, such as placebo administration, nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were less than 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l), the alert value recommended by the American Diabetes Association Workgroup on Hypoglycemia, in 7 of 15 patients (47%). They were less than 60 mg/dl (3.3 mmol/l) in six patients (40%), less than 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) in five patients (33%), and less than 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/l) in two patients (13%).

These data also confirm that bedtime administration of 5.0 mg of the epinephrine-simulating β2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline effectively prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia in patients with aggressively treated type 1 diabetes. This dose of terbutaline increased plasma glucose concentrations throughout the night, raised the nocturnal nadir plasma glucose concentration significantly, and eliminated nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations less than 60 mg/dl. However, as in our earlier study, it caused hyperglycemia the following morning.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that bedtime administration of 2.5 mg terbutaline prevents nocturnal hypoglycemia without causing hyperglycemia the following morning. That hypothesis was not confirmed statistically in this small sample. However, the key efficacy end points — the number of patients with nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations less than 50 mg/dl and the mean nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentration — were intermediate between those taking placebo at bedtime and those taking 5.0 mg terbutaline at bedtime.

### Terbutaline: Level the playing field for inhaled β-agonists by introducing a dosing and urine threshold [^116gPmen]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Terbutaline, a short-acting β2-agonist similar to salbutamol, is widely used in Europe for the treatment of asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Unlike salbutamol, terbutaline requires a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for therapeutic inhaled use in competitive sport. There is now compelling evidence that supratherapeutic use of terbutaline is performance-enhancing, via oral dosing and inhalation. It is likely that the ergogenic effects of terbutaline are class-specific for all β2-agonists.

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has introduced dosing and urine threshold and decision limits for other common β2-agonists, allowing athletes to use these drugs for therapeutic purposes while minimizing the potential for doping and the administrative burden of TUEs. However, no such threshold limits currently exist for terbutaline. For terbutaline, athletes can be granted a TUE and then administer the drug via inhalation at supratherapeutic doses without consequence. The introduction of threshold dosing and urine limits for terbutaline should be a high priority, given the drug's demonstrated ergogenic effects.

### Formoterol in clinical practice — safety issues [^1144stZ4]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

While short-acting beta2-agonists are seen as the cornerstone of treatment as relief medication for asthma, guidelines recommend long-acting beta2-agonists as maintenance therapy in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe asthma, poorly controlled on present treatment. Although evidence has shown that formoterol, with its fast- and long-acting profile, is effective when used both as regular and as-needed therapy in all types of asthma, there has been some concern about the potential of beta2-agonists with long-acting profiles to produce side effects with a longer duration than seen with short-acting beta2-agonists.

Also, where formoterol is used as needed, a higher total daily dose would be anticipated than when taken twice daily for regular maintenance therapy, and this again has led to some concern. In a number of studies, formoterol has been shown to be well tolerated, and although systemic effects expected with this class of drugs did occur, formoterol had significantly less effect on serum potassium, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac frequency, and QT interval compared with terbutaline. In addition, the duration of effects was equivalent to that observed with terbutaline and salbutamol, and the relative therapeutic index of formoterol compared with salbutamol was found to be 2.5. Furthermore, studies looking at long-term use of formoterol have shown there is no reduction in bronchodilatory effect, and thus, no development of tolerance. In conclusion, formoterol is well tolerated in high doses, producing side effects typical of its use.

### In vitro study and semiempirical model for aerosol delivery control during mechanical ventilation [^114CXCev]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The object of this study was to evaluate in vitro the influence of various ventilatory parameters on the delivery of synchronized nebulization of terbutaline during mechanical ventilation and to determine a semiempirical model to control the quantity of aerosol delivered into the patient's lung. An ATOMISOR NL9 M jet nebulizer (La Diffusion Technique Francaise, France) was filled with terbutaline (Bricanyl, Astra-Zeneca, Sweden) and connected to the inspiratory line of a Horus ventilator (Taema, France). Nebulization was synchronized with the inspiratory phase.

We assessed, at the end of the endotracheal tube, the quantity of terbutaline (terbutaline mass output) and the volume median diameter (VMD) by the diffraction-laser method. There was a negative correlation between terbutaline mass output and inspiratory air flow (r = -0.95, p < 0.0001), and between VMD and inspiratory air flow (r = -0.96, p < 0.0001). Moreover, positive end-expiratory pressure levels between 0 cm and 8 cm of water did not significantly change the terbutaline output mass (p = 0.22). Total nebulization time and terbutaline mass output calculated by the mathematical model showed good agreement with experimental data.

In conclusion, our semiempirical model allows calculation of the duration of the nebulization required to deliver a given mass of terbutaline into patient lungs.

### Salbutamol-induced electrophysiological changes show no correlation with electrophysiological changes during hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp in young people with type 1 diabetes [^113FeTpk]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Considerable evidence indicates that hypoglycaemia is pro-arrhythmogenic during both experimental and clinical conditions. Hypoglycaemia causes QTc prolongation together with pro-arrhythmogenic changes in rate-independent T-wave characteristics (TpTend, Tsym) via catecholamine release, hypokalaemia, and inhibition of rapid delayed rectifier potassium channels (IKr). Cases of bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or ventricular ectopic beats linked with hypoglycaemia have been reported previously. Although hypoglycaemia continues to be very common in people with type 1 diabetes, sudden nocturnal deaths ('dead-in-bed' syndrome), in which hypoglycaemia-induced malignant arrhythmias have been implicated, are fortunately very rare. This indicates that the risk of arrhythmias is confined to only a few individuals, although whether increased susceptibility is related to genetic factors, autonomic dysfunction, or other unrecognized influences remains unclear. If those at greatest risk of QTc lengthening and potentially hypoglycaemia-induced arrhythmias could be identified with a simple screening test, it might then be possible to use therapeutic or technological interventions to prevent the development of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.

Salbutamol is a β-adrenoreceptor agonist with predominant β2 activity commonly used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Salbutamol's positive chronotropic effect has been classically linked with β1-adrenoreceptor stimulation, whereas QTc prolongation…

### Terbutaline in myasthenia gravis: a pilot study [^113sUgco]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of terbutaline, a beta2-adrenergic agonist, in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The primary endpoint for efficacy was a reduction of at least 3 points in the quantitative MG score (QMGS). Secondary endpoints included changes in the functional disability scale (FDS), forced vital capacity (FVC), grip strength, anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels, and decremental response.

During the terbutaline phase, five of eight (63%) patients experienced an improvement in the QMGS of 3.0 or greater, while 3/8 (38%) patients showed improvement in the FDS of one grade. No improvement was observed during the placebo period. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that terbutaline treatment resulted in a significant improvement in QMGS. There was no change in FVC, grip strength, or anti-AChR antibody levels, but there was an improvement in the decremental response during the terbutaline phase. Terbutaline was well-tolerated in all study subjects.

We conclude that terbutaline may be an effective adjunct therapy in a subset of patients with myasthenia, although confirmation with larger trials will be required.

### Terbutaline and the prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [^1132Nt6j]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The results demonstrated that bedtime administration of 5.0 mg terbutaline, but not 2.5 mg, significantly increased mean plasma glucose concentrations during the night (ANOVA P < 0.01). Nadir nocturnal plasma glucose concentrations were < 70 mg/dl in seven patients (47%), < 60 mg/dl in six (40%), < 50 mg/dl in five (33%), and < 40 mg/dl in two (13%) following bedtime placebo. After administering 2.5 mg terbutaline, similar nadir nocturnal concentrations were observed in seven, six, two, and zero patients, respectively. In contrast, following administration of 5.0 mg terbutaline, these concentrations dropped to three, zero (P < 0.02 vs. placebo), zero (P < 0.05 vs. placebo), and zero patients.

Mean nadir plasma glucose concentrations were 87 ± 14 mg/dl following placebo, 100 ± 14 mg/dl following 2.5 mg terbutaline, and 122 ± 13 mg/dl following 5.0 mg terbutaline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). At 0700 hours, mean glucose levels were 113 ± 18 mg/dl, 127 ± 17 mg/dl, and 183 ± 19 mg/dl (P < 0.02 vs. placebo), respectively. Mean 0700 h heart rates were 78 ± 5 bpm, 82 ± 4 bpm, and 88 ± 5 bpm (P < 0.02 vs. placebo, respectively). Terbutaline was reportedly well tolerated.

### Nebulized terbutaline and ipratropium bromide versus terbutaline alone in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring noninvasive ventilation: A randomized double-blind controlled trial [^115fgPeu]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Short-acting β2-agonists are the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in the emergency department (ED). It is still unclear whether the addition of short-acting anticholinergics provides clinically more effective care compared to treatment with β2-agonists alone in patients with hypercapnic AECOPD.

- **Objective**: The objective was to evaluate whether combining ipratropium bromide (IB) with terbutaline reduces hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates compared to terbutaline alone in hypercapnic AECOPD patients.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind controlled trial, patients admitted to the ED for AECOPD requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV) were randomized to receive either 5 mg of nebulized terbutaline combined with 0.5 mg of IB (terbutaline/IB group, n = 115) or 5 mg of terbutaline sulfate (terbutaline group, n = 117). Nebulization was repeated every 20 minutes for the first hour and every 4 hours within the first day. Primary outcomes were the rate of hospital admission and the need for endotracheal intubation within the first 24 hours of the start of the experimental treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline of dyspnea, physiologic variables, length of hospital stay, ICU admission rate, and 7-day mortality.

- **Results**: The two groups were similar regarding baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Hospital admission was observed in 70 patients (59.8%) in the terbutaline/IB group and in 75 patients (65.2%) in the terbutaline group.

### 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: Executive summary: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1132e31g]. Circulation (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for focal atrial tachycardia, more specifically with respect to acute management, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend administering IV formulations of the following medications for the acute management of hemodynamically stable patients with FAT:
