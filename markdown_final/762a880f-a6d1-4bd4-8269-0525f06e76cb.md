## Question

Calcium causes less stomach upset

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether calcium causes less stomach upset, and if so, under what conditions and formulations that applies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which "calcium" is being discussed — supplemental calcium salts versus medications that happen to be calcium salts. Then, I should verify the gastrointestinal side-effect profiles of common calcium supplements, especially calcium carbonate versus calcium citrate. Next, I will review mechanistic reasons for differences in tolerability. After that, I should check special populations where tolerability differs, such as those on PPIs or after bariatric surgery. Finally, I will synthesize practical, dose-splitting strategies and a bottom-line answer with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't conflate different issues. When people ask if "calcium" causes less stomach upset, they usually mean oral calcium supplements like calcium carbonate or calcium citrate, not drugs that merely contain calcium as a salt such as atorvastatin calcium or fosamprenavir calcium, which have their own distinct GI profiles unrelated to calcium per se. I need to keep the focus on calcium supplements and their tolerability rather than the unrelated GI adverse effects of statins or antiretrovirals [^111xtxZu] [^113qG38E].

> Now, I should review the core evidence on GI tolerability of calcium supplements. Wait, let me verify the comparative tolerability claim: multiple authoritative sources indicate calcium citrate is generally better tolerated than calcium carbonate, with fewer reports of gas, bloating, and constipation; this is reflected in endocrine and nutrition guidelines and in head-to-head clinical work in hypoparathyroidism, where calcium citrate was associated with less constipation than calcium carbonate while maintaining calcium targets [^115wa3RN] [^11678iAr] [^115wa3RN].

> I will now examine why tolerability differs mechanistically. Calcium carbonate requires gastric acid to dissolve and liberate calcium, producing carbon dioxide in the process, which can cause bloating, flatulence, and constipation; in contrast, calcium citrate is soluble at higher pH and does not generate CO2, which likely explains its better GI tolerability in many patients, particularly those with reduced gastric acid or on acid suppression [^1163DQoU] [^11678iAr] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations where this matters. In patients on proton pump inhibitors or with achlorhydria, calcium citrate is preferred because calcium carbonate absorption is impaired without acid; similarly, after bariatric surgery with duodenal bypass and reduced acid exposure, calcium citrate achieves superior absorption and is the recommended form, which also tends to translate into better tolerability in practice [^115wa3RN] [^114ejHBs] [^116tNigv] [^113KZ4Ji].

> Next, I should review dose and timing strategies that reduce GI upset irrespective of salt. Let me double-check the absorption ceiling: calcium absorption is saturable, so doses above about 500–600 mg elemental calcium per sitting are absorbed less efficiently and more likely to cause GI symptoms. Dividing total daily intake into smaller doses with meals improves absorption and tolerability, and pairing with vitamin D further supports absorption and may reduce the total pill burden needed [^115wa3RN] [^111AWzzN] [^116mChuw].

> But wait, what about the overall risk of GI adverse events at a population level? Do supplements actually increase GI problems. I should confirm that: randomized data and meta-analyses show higher rates of GI adverse events with calcium supplements compared with placebo, including constipation, cramping, and even hospital admissions for GI symptoms in some trials. This reinforces the value of using the lowest effective dose, splitting doses, and choosing better-tolerated salts when symptoms occur [^111UzBPJ] [^115BSvAv] [^1163xWiY].

> Let me consider formulation nuances that can further mitigate symptoms. Switching from calcium carbonate to calcium citrate, using chewable or liquid forms, and ensuring adequate hydration can reduce constipation and bloating. In patients who still have symptoms, a short trial of a different salt or a lower per-dose amount often helps, and clinicians should reassess total calcium intake to avoid exceeding the upper limit of about 1,200–1,500 mg/day from supplements in most adults [^113yanv6].

> I should double-check the bottom line before concluding. The claim that "calcium causes less stomach upset" is not universally true; rather, calcium citrate generally causes less stomach upset than calcium carbonate, especially in people with low gastric acid, after bariatric surgery, or those prone to gas and constipation, whereas calcium carbonate is more often associated with bloating and constipation due to CO2 generation and acid dependence; across formulations, keeping elemental calcium to 500–600 mg per dose and taking with food improves tolerability, and real-world trials still show a modest increase in GI adverse events with supplements versus placebo, so individualized selection and dose-splitting are key [^115wa3RN] [^11678iAr] [^111UzBPJ] [^115BSvAv].

Calcium supplements can cause **GI upset** — especially constipation, bloating, and nausea [^113yanv6] [^111Jo5QR] with calcium carbonate being more likely to cause these effects than calcium citrate [^113yanv6]. To minimize GI upset, **take calcium with food**, **split doses ≤ 500–600 mg**, and consider calcium citrate if symptoms persist or if you have low stomach acid or are on PPIs [^115wa3RN] [^115Hb65T]. If GI symptoms continue, **switch formulations** or use a lower dose [^113yanv6].

## Gastrointestinal side effects of calcium supplements

Calcium supplements, particularly calcium carbonate, are associated with several **GI side effects**, including:

- **Constipation**: The most common side effect, occurring in approximately 10–20% of users [^111UzBPJ].

- **Bloating and gas**: Frequently reported, especially with calcium carbonate [^113yanv6].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Less common but still reported [^111Jo5QR].

- **Abdominal discomfort**: Generalized abdominal pain and discomfort are occasionally reported [^115BSvAv].

---

## Factors influencing gastrointestinal tolerance

Several factors influence the likelihood and severity of **GI upset** from calcium supplements:

| **Factor** | **Influence on GI upset** |
|-|-|
| Formulation | Calcium carbonate is more likely to cause GI upset than calcium citrate due to its requirement for gastric acid for absorption and its tendency to cause constipation and bloating [^113yanv6] [^115wa3RN] |
| Dose | Higher doses (> 600 mg elemental calcium per dose) increase the risk of GI upset. Splitting doses improves tolerance [^111Rh7Pe] |
| Timing | Taking calcium supplements with food significantly reduces GI upset compared to taking them on an empty stomach [^notfound] |
| Individual susceptibility | Patients with pre-existing GI conditions (e.g. IBS, IBD) or those taking medications that affect GI motility (e.g. opioids, anticholinergics) are more susceptible to GI upset [^notfound] |

---

## Comparative gastrointestinal tolerance of different calcium formulations

Calcium citrate is generally better tolerated than calcium carbonate, particularly in patients with **low gastric acid** or those taking **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** [^115Hb65T]. Calcium citrate does not require gastric acid for absorption and is less likely to cause constipation and bloating [^113yanv6]. Calcium carbonate, while effective and inexpensive, is more likely to cause **GI upset**, particularly constipation and bloating, due to its reliance on gastric acid for absorption and its tendency to cause gas formation [^113yanv6].

---

## Clinical evidence on gastrointestinal tolerance

Clinical studies consistently show that calcium supplements, especially calcium carbonate, are associated with **increased GI side effects**. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that calcium supplementation significantly increased the incidence of GI side effects, including constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort [^115BSvAv]. Another study specifically comparing calcium citrate and calcium carbonate found that calcium citrate was associated with significantly less constipation and overall GI discomfort than calcium carbonate [^11678iAr].

---

## Strategies to minimize gastrointestinal upset

Patients experiencing GI upset from calcium supplements can try several strategies to improve tolerance:

- **Split dosing**: Divide the total daily calcium intake into smaller doses (≤ 500–600 mg per dose) to improve absorption and reduce GI upset [^115wa3RN] [^111AWzzN].

- **Take with food**: Taking calcium supplements with meals significantly reduces GI upset compared to taking them on an empty stomach [^notfound].

- **Switch formulations**: If GI upset persists, switching from calcium carbonate to calcium citrate may improve tolerance [^113yanv6] [^11678iAr].

- **Hydration**: Ensuring adequate fluid intake can help reduce constipation associated with calcium supplements [^113yanv6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized calcium supplementation** and careful monitoring of GI tolerance. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends calcium citrate for patients with low gastric acid or those taking PPIs, as it does not require gastric acid for absorption and is generally better tolerated [^115wa3RN]. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) also recommends individualized calcium supplementation, with attention to GI tolerance and patient preferences [^111Rh7Pe].

---

## Conclusion

Calcium supplements, particularly calcium carbonate, can cause **GI upset**, including constipation, bloating, and nausea [^113yanv6]. Calcium citrate is generally better tolerated, especially in patients with low gastric acid or those taking PPIs [^115wa3RN]. Strategies such as split dosing, taking supplements with food, and switching formulations can significantly improve GI tolerance [^115wa3RN].

### Effect of dairy calcium or supplementary calcium intake on postprandial fat metabolism, appetite, and subsequent energy intake [^115tS3Qd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

High calcium intake has been shown to increase fecal fat excretion.

Objective

Our aim was to examine whether a high calcium intake from dairy products or from supplements affects postprandial fat metabolism and appetite through fat malabsorption.

Design

Four different isocaloric meals were tested in 18 subjects according to a randomized crossover design. The test meals contained high (HC meal: 172 mg/MJ), medium (MC meal: 84 mg/MJ), or low (LC meal: 15 mg/MJ) amounts of calcium from dairy products or a high amount of calcium given as a calcium carbonate supplement (Suppl meal: 183 mg/MJ). Concentrations of plasma total triacylglycerol, chylomicron triacylglycerol, serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, ghrelin, peptide YY, glucose, and insulin and appetite sensation were measured before and at regular intervals until 420 min postprandially.

Results

Dairy calcium significantly diminished the postprandial lipid response. The baseline adjusted area under the curve for chylomicron triacylglycerol was approximately 17% lower after the MC meal (P = 0.02) and approximately 19% lower after the HC meal (P = 0.007) than after the LC meal and approximately 15% lower after the MC meal (P = 0.0495) and approximately 17% lower after the HC meal (P = 0.02) than after the Suppl meal. No consistent effects of calcium on appetite sensation, or on energy intake at the subsequent meal, or on the postprandial responses of cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, ghrelin, peptide YY, insulin, or glucose were observed.

Conclusions

Increased calcium intakes from dairy products attenuate postprandial lipidemia, most probably because of reduced fat absorption, whereas supplementary calcium carbonate does not exert such an effect. This may be due to differences in the chemical form of calcium or to cofactors in dairy products. Calcium did not affect appetite sensation, glucose metabolism, or gut hormone secretion.

### Dietary supplements and prevention of preeclampsia [^112zWRaZ]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

By contrast, excessive calcium intake is not entirely free of concern: although the conclusions of the recent meta-analyses regarding the association between excessive calcium intake and cardiovascular disease risk differs, there are several reports indicating that calcium supplementation (> 1000 mg/day) increases the risk of cardiovascular side effects. Considering that the average daily calcium intake of women of reproductive age in Japan is approximately 500 mg, and the tolerable upper limit of calcium intake established by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare is 2500 mg/day, calcium supplementation of 1000–1500 mg is generally safe. Considering the above, low-dose supplementation (500 mg) is reasonable from the standpoint of cost and effort of high-dose supplementation.

Although there is insufficient evidence on the timing of prophylactic supplementation, it is recommended to start as soon as possible after pregnancy confirmation. The benefits of calcium supplementation before or at the beginning of pregnancy are not well established. Regarding the type of calcium supplementation, calcium citrate, calcium carbonate, and calcium gluconate are available options, but calcium carbonate is considered the most cost-effective. Calcium carbonate is inexpensive and more bioavailable than calcium gluconate; however, its absorption may be reduced if consumed between meals. The bioavailability of calcium citrate is not affected by diet; however, its high cost and the nearly 50% lower calcium content by weight are notable disadvantages. Calcium is typically consumed as a dietary supplement. From the insurance coverage perspective in Japan, L-aspartate calcium can be prescribed because the indications on the drug information for L-aspartate calcium state "calcium supplementation during pregnancy and lactation". Thus, low-dose calcium supplementation (500 mg/day) is recommended during pregnancy in regions with low calcium intake, including in Japan

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^112ySp2B]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Results

We recruited women by sending mass e-mail advertisements to UW female faculty in January 2008 (Fig. 1). Eighty-three women called our research center in response to the email, and 33 were interested and eligible on the basis of a phone interview. Twenty-three women came to the CTRC and provided written informed consent to enter the study. Two women could not complete the 7-day diet diary and withdrew from the study. Thus 21 women completed all study visits.

Fig. 1
Study recruitment.

Table 2 summarizes subjects' characteristics (n = 21). Their mean age was 58 ± 7 years; 17 women were white, and 2 each were black and Hispanic. Subjects' mean 25(OH)D and PTH levels at baseline were 28 ± 13 ng/mL and 49 ± 24 pg/mL, respectively.

Table 2
Subjects' Anthropomorphic, Laboratory, and Dietary Characteristics

Through the combination of dietary and supplemental intake, subjects ingested 1400 ± 650 mg of calcium per day, approximately half (46%) consumed with breakfast. The calcium content of the breakfast varied between subjects (700 ± 600 mg); however, each woman's calcium intake from diet and supplements was identical at each of her three study visits. Twelve subjects (57%) took supplements containing calcium prior to the research study; these were continued during inpatient stays (Table 2).

Six women reported occasional heartburn, but only one woman carried a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. No participant reported antacid use within the past 2 months. Three women had significant gag reflex preventing placement of the nasogastric tube. Baseline gastric pH was 3.4 ± 1.8 (range 0 to 6) among the remaining 18 women, similar to levels reported among women in another study. Seven women had a gastric pH between 0 and 3, and 11 had a gastric pH greater than 3.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^1127wX1w]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Increased calcium absorption from synthetic stable amorphous calcium carbonate: double-blind randomized crossover clinical trial in postmenopausal women [^112Len6f]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium supplementation is a widely recognized strategy for achieving adequate calcium intake. We designed this blinded, randomized, crossover interventional trial to compare the bioavailability of a new stable synthetic amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) with that of crystalline calcium carbonate (CCC) using the dual stable isotope technique. The study was conducted in the Unit of Clinical Nutrition, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel. The study population included 15 early postmenopausal women aged 54.9 ± 2.8 (mean ± SD) years with no history of major medical illness or metabolic bone disorder, excess calcium intake, or vitamin D deficiency. Standardized breakfast was followed by randomly provided CCC or ACC capsules containing 192 mg elemental calcium labeled with 44Ca at intervals of at least 3 weeks. After swallowing the capsules, intravenous CaCl2 labeled with 42Ca on was administered on each occasion. Fractional calcium absorption (FCA) of ACC and CCC was calculated from the 24-hour urine collection following calcium administration. The results indicated that FCA of ACC was doubled (± 0.96 SD) on average compared to that of CCC (p < 0.02). The higher absorption of the synthetic stable ACC may serve as a more efficacious way of calcium supplementation.

### Calcium vitamin D3 supplementation in clinical practice: side effect and satisfaction [^114mSJ5k]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to assess side effects and satisfaction about OsteoCalVitFort (500 mg calcium and 400 I.U. of vitamin D3) usage.

Methods

A total 186 people were participated with range age from 18 to 65 years old. Each participant received 1 pack that contains 60 OsteoCalVitFort tablet and used two tablet OsteoCalVitFort daily (1 tablet after breakfast and 1 after dinner). By a phone call, side effects and satisfaction about OsteoCalVitFort were assessed.

Results

The rate of constipating (8.0%) and bloating (12.5%) were decreased significantly after OsteoCalVitFort supplement intake (1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively). Similar results were observed in metallic taste in mouth, tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, bone/muscle pain and mental/mood change after Calcium Vitamin D3 supplementation intake. Totally, 94% of patients were satisfied about OsteoCalVitFort usage.

Conclusion

The results of the research indicate despite the high quality of OsteoCalVitFort supplement, there are no side effects which have been seen in other supplements.

### Ibandronate sodium (Boniva) [^115CVxFW]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

17.1 Information for Patients

Patients should be instructed to read the Patient Information
Leaflet carefully before taking BONIVA, to re-read it each time the prescription
is renewed and to pay particular attention to the dosing instructions in order
to maximize absorption and clinical benefit.

BONIVA should be taken at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink
(other than water) of the day and before taking any oral medication or
supplementation including calcium, antacids or vitamins (see DRUG INTERACTIONS [7.1]).
To facilitate delivery to the stomach, and thus reduce the potential for
esophageal irritation, BONIVA tablets should be swallowed whole with a full
glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz) while the patient is standing or sitting in an
upright position. Patients should not lie down for 60 minutes after taking
BONIVA.
Patients should not eat, drink anything except for water, or take other
medications for 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.
Plain water is the only drink that should be taken with BONIVA. Note that
some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore
should not be used.
Patients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for
oropharyngeal ulceration.
The BONIVA 2.5 mg tablet should be taken at the same time each day.
If a once-daily dose is missed, the patient should be instructed to skip
that dose and return to their normal schedule the next day.
The patient must not take two 2.5 mg tablets within the same day.
The BONIVA 150 mg tablet should be taken on the same date each month (i.e.,
the patient's BONIVA day).
The patient must not take two 150 mg tablets within the same week.
If the once-monthly dose is missed, and the patient's next scheduled BONIVA
day is more than 7 days away, the patient should be instructed to take one
BONIVA 150 mg tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
[2.3]). The patient should then return to taking one BONIVA 150 mg
tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day, according to their
original schedule.
If the once-monthly dose is missed, and the patient's next scheduled BONIVA
day is only 1 to 7 days away, the patient must wait until the subsequent month's
scheduled BONIVA day to take their tablet. The patient should then return to
taking one BONIVA 150 mg tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day,
according to their original schedule.

2.6	Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take FOSAMAX at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of FOSAMAX [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking FOSAMAX with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of FOSAMAX by decreasing its absorption into the body.
Take FOSAMAX upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, a FOSAMAX tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6–8 ounces). To facilitate gastric emptying FOSAMAX oral solution should be followed by at least 2 ounces (a quarter of a cup) of water. Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. FOSAMAX should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)].

2.7	Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8	Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^116BabEa]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Patient population

Women at least 5 years past the onset of menopause, defined as the date of last menses, were eligible for participation. We excluded women reporting an allergy to PPI, those taking prescription medication for heartburn (PPI or H₂-blocker therapy), and those taking over-the-counter antacids within the past 2 months. Women with intestinal conditions associated with malabsorption or hypochlorhydria, stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease, or nasal anatomy preventing nasogastric tube placement also were excluded. We further barred women taking medications known to alter calcium metabolism or interact with omeprazole. The University of Wisconsin (UW) Human Subjects Committee reviewed and approved the study protocol, and the study was registered as a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00582972).

We recruited subjects through e-mail letters of invitation and screened women who called our center via phone. Interested and potentially eligible subjects underwent a screening visit to confirm eligibility and provide written informed consent. We recruited women of all races and ethnic groups. Race was assessed and recorded at the screening visit because African Americans absorb calcium more efficiently than white people.

Prior to the first calcium absorption study, subjects completed 7-day food diaries using a food scale. The study nutritionist (LAD) used Food Processor software (ESHA Research, Salem, OR, USA) to assess subjects' energy, macronutrient, fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, vitamin D, oxalate, and caffeine intake. We replicated each subject's typical intake of all nutrients during each of her 25-hour hospital stays; her breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks were identical at each of the three study visits. Food not consumed during each stay was bagged and weighed. Subsequently, the study nutritionist analyzed subjects' intake of nutrients during each research admission. During the study, subjects continued current nutritional supplement use to ensure that changes in calcium absorption were unrelated to changes in calcium intake. Throughout the study, investigators tracked any changes in supplement use, including calcium supplements.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^116iuwPk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional Therapy

Generally, symptomatic adults with XLH are treated with phosphate salts (750–2000 mg/day) divided into 3 to 4 doses daily, and active vitamin D (calcitriol [0.5 to 1 µg/day] or alfacalcidol [0.75–1.5 μg daily]), especially when treating osteomalacia or fractures. Doses may then be lowered during the maintenance phase of treatment to minimize long-term complications. A balanced use of calcitriol (useful in dampening PTH secretion) and phosphate is of value in order to avoid phosphate stimulation of PTH, which exacerbates renal phosphate loss and further lowers serum phosphate. Importantly, phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy without concurrent active vitamin D. Active vitamin D without phosphate salts, however, may be considered in adults with mild symptoms.

Figure 4.
GRADEd monitoring recommendations for follow-up in adults with XLH.

Figure 5.
GRADEd treatment recommendations in adult XLH.

Adequate dietary calcium intake is recommended to provide calcium for skeletal mineralization and the healing of osteomalacia and rickets, especially during the first few months of treatment, acknowledging that the active vitamin D also increases gastrointestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, and the combination may increase the risk of hypercalciuria. As calcium supplements act as phosphate binders, potentially reducing the bioavailability of phosphate supplements, calcium intake must be separated 1 hour from phosphate intake. Elevated PTH with concomitant low urinary Ca/Cr may indicate the need for increasing the calcium intake.

Phosphate supplementation is often limited by gastrointestinal tolerability issues, including dyspepsia, and a laxative effect. Patients may opt to discontinue phosphate replacement due to gastrointestinal side effects. As mentioned above, complications of conventional therapy include secondary and tertiary (hypercalcemic) hyperparathyroidism, nephrocalcinosis, and CKD. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs in about 25% to 30% of adults with XLH and may develop several years after stopping conventional therapy. The resulting hypercalcemia limits the use of active vitamin D. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually requires multi-gland parathyroidectomy, and hypercalcemia can still recur. Cinacalcet may be effective as adjunctive therapy for hyperparathyroidism.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^11678iAr]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction of urinary oxalate excretion in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. The reduction of urinary oxalate might be related to the higher gastric solubility of Ca‐Cit that made available a greater amount of free calcium ions than CaCO 3. These free calcium cations, by forming calcium‐oxalate salts in the gastrointestinal tract, may have reduced oxalate intestinal absorption, thus reducing the concentration of oxalate absorbed and thus presented to the renal tubules. This noteworthy observation is relevant to the fact that urinary oxalate is one of the most important promoters of crystal growth, and the reduction in the excretion of this index might be important in reducing the risk of renal stone formation. Other factors, such as phosphorus, also may promote the nucleation of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Nevertheless, in our study, serum and urinary phosphate levels did not differ between Ca‐Cit‐ and CaCO3‐treated patients.

Ca‐Cit was also associated with less constipation than CaCO₃. It is possible that the residual intestinal citrate forms complexes with magnesium to a greater extent than with CaCO 3. These magnesium complexes can have a laxative osmotic action that may explain our finding of an improvement of constipation in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. An alternative explanation is that constipation was increased by CaCO 3 administration, whose dissolution, by forming CO₂, may be responsible for side effects such as flatulence, general gastrointestinal disorders, and notably, constipation.

However, this is not enough to improve overall QOL in these patients. SF‐36 and FACIT are validated but are not disease‐specific questionnaires, which may not be sensitive enough for QOL evaluation of HypoPT subjects. It is very likely that the high amount of calcium that is necessary to maintain normocalcemia in these patients completely abolished the possible advantages given by Ca‐Cit in other categories of patients who generally are prescribed lower doses of calcium. It is also possible that this short‐term study was not conducted long enough to see a difference in the QOL parameters.

### K-PHOS® ORIGINAL potassium acid phosphate-dailyMeddailymed.nlm.nih.gov › dailymed › fda › fdaDrugXsl… [^115ZcEqs]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

K PHOS ORIGINAL- potassium phosphate, monobasic tablet, soluble Beach Products, Inc. ----------. Each tablet contains potassium acid phosphate 500 mg. Each tablet yields approximately 114 mg of phosphorus and 144 mg of potassium or 3. 7 mEq. Inactive ingredients: Magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, starch, stearic acid. For use in patients with elevated urinary pH. K-PHOS® ORIGINAL helps keep calcium soluble and reduces odor and rash caused by ammoniacal urine. Also, by acidifying the urine, it increases the antibacterial activity of methenamine mandelate and methenamine hippurate. This product is contraindicated in patients with infected phosphate stones; in patients with severely impaired renal function and in the presence of hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia. This product contains potassium and should be used with caution if regulation of this element is desired.

Occasionally, some individuals may experience a mild laxative effect during the first few days of phosphate therapy. If laxation persists to an unpleasant degree, reduce the daily dosage until this effect subsides or, if necessary, discontinue the use of this product. Careful monitoring of renal function and serum calcium, phosphorus and potassium may be required at periodic intervals during potassium phosphate therapy. Other tests may be warranted in some patients, depending on conditions. The use of antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or aluminum in conjunction with phosphate preparations may bind the phosphate and prevent its absorption. Potassium-containing medications or potassium-sparing diuretics may cause hyperkalemia when used concurrently with potassium salts. Patients should have serum potassium level determinations at periodic intervals.

Concurrent use of salicylates may lead to increased serum salicylate levels since excretion of salicylates is reduced in acidified urine. Serum salicylate levels should be closely monitored to avoid toxicity. Gastrointestinal upset may occur with the use of potassium phosphate. Also, bone and joint pain could occur. The following adverse effects may be observed with potassium administration: irregular heartbeat; dizziness; mental confusion; weakness or heaviness of legs; unusual tiredness; muscle cramps; numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in hands or feet; numbness or tingling around lips; shortness of breath or troubled breathing.

### Adverse events from calcium supplementation: relationship to errors in myocardial infarction self-reporting in randomized controlled trials of calcium supplementation [^115BSvAv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical effects of calcium supplements on adverse events reporting have not been well described. This study reviews randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence of adverse events to clarify the epidemiology of these events. The hypothesis that patient self-report of myocardial infarction (MI) is increased in individuals receiving calcium supplementation is because of an increase in non-MI events incorrectly perceived by the patient as being because of MI, is examined. In seven RCTs summary self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event rates were more common in participants receiving calcium. These were described as constipation, excessive abdominal cramping, bloating, upper GI events, GI disease, GI symptoms, and severe diarrhoea or abdominal pain (calcium 14.1%, placebo 10.0%), relative risk (RR) 1.43 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.59, p < 0.001. Adjudicated functional GI hospitalizations in one study were calcium 6.8%, placebo 3.6% (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21–3.05, p = 0.006). Direct comparison of self-reported and adjudicated MI events in the two trials of dietary calcium supplementation showed self-reported MI rates of 3.6% in the calcium group and 2.1% in the placebo group. After adjudication the MI rates were 2.4% in the calcium group and 1.6% in the placebo group (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.88–2.45, p = 0.145). These data support the hypothesis that calcium tablets increase the incidence of adverse GI events, which may account for an increase in self-reported MI in calcium treated patients but not controls.

### AGA clinical practice update on chemoprevention for colorectal neoplasia: expert review [^1178BfEn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Calcium — associations with colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma risk are as follows: Observational studies link dietary and/or supplemental calcium intake to reduced CRC risk, including a 2016 analysis of the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study in which higher calcium intake was associated with lower CRC risk (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95); the effect appeared dose-dependent and did not seem to differ for dietary versus supplemental calcium, and the American Institute for Cancer Research concluded that calcium supplements decrease CRC risk. For adenoma, a large polyp prevention trial (n = 913) found that 1200 mg of elemental calcium daily modestly reduced recurrent adenoma risk versus placebo (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.98), and a subsequent meta-analysis including this and 2 smaller randomized trials found that calcium supplementation was associated with roughly 20% reduction in adenoma.

### Calcium intake and bone mineral density: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nCf3X]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Maintaining a calcium intake of at least 1000–1200 mg/day has long been recommended for older individuals to treat and prevent osteoporosis. Calcium supplements are commonly taken to achieve such intakes, which are considerably higher than the average intake of calcium in the diet in older people in Western countries, around 700–900 mg/day. Recently, concerns have emerged about the risk-benefit profile of calcium supplements. The small reductions in total fracturesseem outweighed by the moderate risk of minor side effects such as constipation, coupled with the small risk of severe side effects such as cardiovascular events, kidney stones, and admission to hospital with acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Consequently, some experts have recommended that older people increase their calcium intake through their diet and take supplements only when that is not feasible. In a systematic review of calcium intake and fractures, we concluded that there was no evidence of an association between increased dietary calcium intake and lower risk of fracture. We identified only two small randomised controlled trials of dietary calcium intake that reported fracture as an outcome. Numerous cohort studies, however, assessed the relation between dietary calcium, milk or dairy intake, and risk of fracture, and most reported neutral associations.

The putative mechanism by which calcium intake affects bone health is by increasing bone mineral density (BMD). BMD is a surrogate endpoint for fracture risk that allows biological effects to be explored in randomised controlled trials of modest size. We investigated whether the results of randomised controlled trials with BMD as an endpoint support the recommendations to increase dietary calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements in older adults (aged > 50) to determine whether increasing intake from dietary sources has effects on BMD and, if so, whether they are similar to the effects of calcium supplements on BMD.

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^1149hJtf]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

The greatest limitation of our study was its short-term nature. The Institute of Medicine recommends that researchers wait 12 days for equilibrium to occur before measuring changes in calcium homeostasis following an intervention. We extended our treatment interval to 30 days, but this might be insufficient to detect true long-term changes in FCA from PPIs. Notably, many patients take PPIs for years. A prospective intervention study of longer duration should be performed to confirm the findings of this study. Additionally, a study assessing changes in calcium absorption following cessation of PPIs might be informative, although rebound reflux symptoms might interfere with successful ability to stop PPI therapy. Two participants took their last dose of omeprazole the day prior to admission, but a post hoc analysis indicated no differential change in FCA when excluding these women. Additionally, omeprazole's effect on gastric acid production persists for more than 24 hours after dosing, with gradual return of gastric acidity 3 to 5 days after cessation of therapy (package insert). We did not measure gastric pH following omeprazole therapy and therefore cannot determine whether women with greater changes in gastric pH may have experienced a decrease in calcium absorption following omeprazole therapy. Our participants were relatively young and healthy; PPIs might decrease calcium absorption in elderly adults or those with multiple comorbidities. Finally, PPI therapy simply might mark people with impaired absorption of nutrients owing to their underlying gastrointestinal illnesses; we excluded such subjects from this study.

Subjects' average 25(OH)D level indicated insufficiency during the first calcium absorption study visit and sufficiency at subsequent visits. However, we found no statistical differences in subjects' serum 25(OH)D levels throughout the study when analyzing serum 25(OH)D as a continuous variable. Multivariate analyses revealed that 25(OH)D was not a significant variable affecting fractional calcium absorption. Finally, we would not expect small changes in serum 25(OH)D levels to influence fractional calcium absorption in a meaningful way based on our previous publication, in which very large increments in serum 25(OH)D yielded only small increases in calcium absorption. Indeed, using the dual stable calcium isotope technique, we documented that calcium absorption increased by only 3% ± 1% (p = .04) when subjects' serum vitamin D levels increased from 22 ± 4 to 64 ± 21 ng/mL following prescription of high-dose vitamin D.

### Does it make a difference how and when you take your calcium? The acute effects of calcium on calcium and bone metabolism [^111hxejY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium supplements are widely used to prevent osteoporosis. However, little is known about the metabolic effects of different dosages and of the timing of the dosages.

Objective

The aim was to study the effects of the timing of the dose (study 1), the effects of the size of the dose (study 2), and the effects of small repetitive doses (study 3) of calcium on calcium and bone metabolism in women.

Design

The investigation was conducted in 3 parts, each with 10 participants. In study 1, calcium loads (0 and 25 mg/kg body wt) were taken at 0900 and 2100. In study 2, calcium loads of 0, 250, and 1000 mg were taken at 0900. In study 3, calcium loads of 0 and 200 mg were taken 4 times/d. Markers of calcium and bone metabolism were followed.

Results

There was no significant difference in the response of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) to the calcium load taken at 0900 and that at 2100. There was a significant dose-response effect of the calcium load on serum ionized calcium (P = 0.00005) and serum PTH (P = 0.0003). Small calcium doses (200 mg) taken 4 times/d kept the PTH secretion at a lower level than during the control day (P = 0.016). None of the doses caused significant changes in the markers of bone formation and resorption measured.

Conclusions

The calcium loads had no significant effect on the markers of bone formation and resorption measured, although even small calcium doses decreased serum PTH and increased serum ionized calcium concentrations rapidly. The effect was similar whether calcium was taken in the morning or in the evening.

### Dependence of oxalate absorption on the daily calcium intake [^111AkwcY]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Two to 20% of ingested oxalate is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy humans with a daily 800 mg calcium intake. Calcium is the most potent modifier of the oxalate absorption. Although this has been found repeatedly, the exact correlation between calcium intake and oxalate absorption has not been assessed to date. Investigated was oxalate absorption in healthy volunteers applying 0.37 mmol of the soluble salt sodium [(13)C(2)]oxalate in the calcium intake range from 5 mmol (200 mg) calcium to 45 mmol (1800 mg) calcium. Within the range of 200 to 1200 mg calcium per day, oxalate absorption depended linearly on the calcium intake. With 200 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption (± SD) was 17% ± 8.3%; with 1200 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption was 2.6% ± 1.5%. Within this range, reduction of the calcium supply by 70 mg increased the oxalate absorption by 1% and vice versa. Calcium addition beyond 1200 mg/d reduced the oxalate absorption only one-tenth as effectively. With 1800 mg calcium per day, the mean absorption was 1.7% ± 0.9%. The findings may explain why a low-calcium diet increases the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^111NtYjp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

PPIs hypothetically increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture by causing hypochlorhydria, reduced intestinal calcium absorption, and subsequent negative calcium balance. Since calcium solubility depends on the pH of the solution, calcium absorption likewise may depend on gastric pH. This supposition was supported by a study of 11 achlorhydric subjects who in the fasting state demonstrated impaired absorption of a calcium carbonate gelatin capsule but normal absorption of a calcium citrate solution. However, absorption of calcium carbonate was restored to normal when these subjects consumed calcium carbonate capsules with breakfast. Typically, individuals ingest calcium from dietary sources instead of supplements. Thus the ability of achlorhydric patients to absorb calcium with a meal would seem more applicable to the ability to absorb calcium while taking PPIs.

Other studies cast significant doubt on the import of gastric acid and calcium solubility on subsequent calcium absorption. In one study, calcium carbonate was administered with a meal to eight adults. Absorption of calcium carbonate was measured twice by lavage, once when subjects' gastric pH was maintained at 7.4 using NaHCO₃ infusion and again when gastric pH was maintained at 3.0 using HCl infusion. Calcium absorption was identical in both conditions despite a marked difference in calcium carbonate solubility at differing pH. Subsequently, another group performed a post hoc analysis of calcium absorption data collected from 352 subjects across multiple studies using calcium sources that varied in solubility by five orders of magnitude. The relationship between calcium solubility and absorption was weak; calcium absorption was more strongly related to food components coingested with the calcium salt.

Five studies (Table 1) have investigated the direct effect of PPIs on intestinal calcium absorption with discordant results. However, important limitations of these studies prevent definitive conclusions regarding the effect of PPIs on calcium absorption. First, none of the studies used dual isotopes to measure calcium absorption, and three used serum calcium levels, which correlate only weakly with absorption data obtained using the "gold standard" dual-isotope method. Second, the duration of PPI therapy was less than 12 days in four studies. The Institute of Medicine recommends that researchers wait 12 days for equilibrium to occur before measuring changes in calcium homeostasis following an intervention. Third, one study measured calcium absorption in the fasting state, which might not reflect calcium absorption efficiency with a meal. Finally, one study did not measure calcium absorption prior to the onset of PPI therapy. It therefore remains uncertain whether PPI-associated hypochlorhydria truly decreases calcium absorption.

### Onset of acid-neutralizing action of a calcium / magnesium carbonate-based antacid using an artificial stomach model: an in vitro evaluation [^113EhB3A]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antacids have been widely used for many years for the symptomatic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and mild, non-ulcer dyspepsia. Calcium carbonate-based antacids are one of the most potent over-the-counter antacids, known to have a rapid, long-lasting, and effective neutralizing action that is increased by the addition of magnesium carbonate, as in Rennie ® (Bayer). In the lower esophagus or in the stomach, calcium and magnesium carbonate react with the hydrochloric acid to form water and soluble mineral salts. However, although Rennie is a well-established antacid that has been on the market for over 85 years, published studies on the onset of action of calcium carbonate are scarce. The scientific data demonstrating its onset of action were generated some time ago and remain unpublished. Much has changed since then, and it is time to reconfirm the onset of action for Rennie.

### Ibandronate sodium (Boniva) [^115yvWbs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake
is inadequate. Intake of supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be delayed
for at least 60 minutes following oral administration of BONIVA in order to
maximize absorption of BONIVA.

Physicians should be alert to signs or symptoms signaling a possible
esophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to
discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of
esophageal irritation such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing,
retrosternal pain, or heartburn.

17.2 FDA-Approved Patient Labeling

Read this patient information carefully before you start taking
BONIVA. Read this patient information each time you get a refill for BONIVA.
There may be new information. This information is not everything you need to
know about BONIVA. It does not take the place of talking with your health care
provider about your condition or your treatment. Talk about BONIVA with your
health care provider before you start taking it, and at your regular
check-ups.

What is the most important information I should
know about BONIVA?

BONIVA may cause serious problems in the stomach and the esophagus (the tube
that connects your mouth and stomach) such as trouble swallowing, heartburn, and
ulcers (see " What are the possible side
effects of BONIVA? ").

You must take BONIVA exactly as prescribed for BONIVA to
work for you and to lower the chance of serious side effects (see " How should I take BONIVA? ").

What is BONIVA?

BONIVA is a prescription medicine used to treat or prevent osteoporosis in
women after menopause (see the end of this leaflet for " What is osteoporosis? ").

BONIVA may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing
bone mass in most women who take it, even though they won't be able to see or
feel a difference. BONIVA may help lower the chances of breaking bones
(fractures).

### Risedronate sodium [^114bQbDJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic Findings: In the risedronate sodium tablets clinical trials, endoscopic evaluation was encouraged in any patient with moderate-to-severe gastrointestinal complaints, while maintaining the blind. Endoscopies were performed on equal numbers of patients between the placebo and treated groups [75 (14.5%) placebo; 75 (11.9%) risedronate sodium tablets]. Clinically important findings (perforations, ulcers, or bleeding) among this symptomatic population were similar between groups (51% placebo; 39% risedronate sodium tablets).

Once-a-Week Dosing

The safety of risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 95 years. The duration of the trials was one year, with 480 patients exposed to risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and 485 exposed to risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and H2antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All women received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus vitamin D supplementation up to 500 international units per day if their 25-hydroxyvitamin D3level was below normal at baseline.

### Novel calcium-gelled, alginate-pectin beverage reduced energy intake in nondieting overweight and obese women: interactions with dietary restraint status [^115uHJvD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Foods containing strong-gelling fibers may provide a safe and efficacious strategy for reducing food intake by stimulating endogenous satiety signaling.

Objective

A novel, 2-part beverage, consisting of alginate-pectin and calcium components, that forms a stable, fibrous gel in the stomach was tested to determine its effects on subjective satiety and food intake in overweight and obese women.

Design

The investigation was a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects (n = 29) ingested a 2-part beverage twice per day (once before breakfast and once midafternoon) for 7 d. Three alginate-pectin formulations were tested: 1.0 g, 2.8 g, and control (no fiber). Subjective satiety and ad libitum food intake were measured on days 1 and 7 of each 1-wk treatment period with a 1-wk washout between testings.

Results

A significant reduction in food intake was observed at dinner for both formulations compared with the control formulation. The effects of the gel beverage differed as a function of rigid dietary restraint status. Women in the lower 50th percentile of rigid restraint consumed 12% less energy during the day and 22% less for the evening snack in the 2.8-g condition compared with the control condition. No effect was found for women in the upper 50th percentile of rigid restraint.

Conclusions

Consumption of a postingestion, calcium-gelled fiber beverage twice daily reduced energy intake in overweight and obese women with low rigid restraint scores. Use of foods designed to enhance satiety may be an effective adjunctive therapy for weight loss; however, more research is needed to determine how dietary restraint alters this response.

### A randomized cross over trial of tolerability and compliance of a micronutrient supplement with low iron separated from calcium vs high iron combined with calcium in pregnant women [^111TJLZ1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Prenatal micronutrient combinations with high iron content are associated with high rates of gastrointestinal symptoms. This coupled with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy results in women often discontinuing their multivitamins. A new prescription supplement (PregVit) that separates iron from calcium in two tablets — morning and evening, has lower elemental iron content (35 mg), but results in similar extent of iron absorption when compared to another supplement containing (60 mg) of elemental iron (Materna). The objectives of this study were to compare tolerability and compliance with PregVit vs. a supplement with high iron content (Materna), in pregnant women.

Methods

Randomized, crossover open labeled study in 135 pregnant women attending outpatient clinics in Ontario and Quebec.

Results

Use of PregVit was associated with a 30% reduction in constipation rate as compared to Materna. Both products demonstrated similar compliance rates. Compliance of Materna was negatively associated with the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. No such correlation was found for PregVvit.

Conclusion

PregVit, a supplement with lower iron content (35 mg), has significantly decreased constipation rates as compared to 60 mg iron — Materna and has similar compliance rates. High iron content in multivitamin supplements is associated with adverse effects in pregnancy.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^116mChuw]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The two main forms of calcium in supplements are carbonate and citrate. Calcium carbonate should be taken with food because absorption is dependent on stomach acid, whereas calcium citrate is absorbed equally well when taken with or without food and is the preferred form for patients receiving proton pump inhibitors. Other calcium forms in supplements include calcium gluconate, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate, and calcium citrate malate.

The main circulating form of vitamin D is calcidiol. Vitamin D also exists in two inactive forms, namely vitamin D 2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol), which are hydroxylated in the liver to form calcidiol and then in the kidneys to form the biologically active form, calcitriol. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum calcidiol concentration below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/l), and insufficiency is defined as a calcidiol level of 21–29 ng/ml (52–72 nmol/l). Patients with a calcidiol concentration below 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l) can be considered to be severely deficient. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by reduced synthesis via the skin (owing to limited sun exposure, skin pigmentation or skin thinning as a result of ageing), decreased vitamin D absorption, and increased catabolism. Calcitriol enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and promotes bone mineralization and remodelling: there is a significant decrease in intestinal calcium absorption when serum vitamin D levels fall below 30 ng/ml.

Similar to calcium daily reference values, the recommended daily intake of vitamin D varies by guidelines and depends on the patient population being treated. The amount of vitamin D supplementation required to achieve adequate serum levels (> 30 ng/ml or > 75 nmol/l) depends on a variety of factors in addition to the baseline vitamin D levels including age, body mass index, sun-exposure history, and the use of medications that can affect vitamin D metabolism and intestinal absorption. Among patients who are at risk of vitamin D deficiency, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend that adults aged up to 70 years receive a preventative dose of vitamin D 600 IU daily, and those older than 70 years receive 800 IU daily. The International Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that adults aged 60 years and over receive 800–1000 IU daily.

### Comparison of calcium citrate and calcium carbonate absorption in patients with a roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and one-anastomosis gastric bypass: a double-blind, randomized cross-over trial [^113KZ4Ji]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of calcium (Ca) citrate and Ca carbonate supplementation on Ca absorption following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgeries.

Setting

A single specialized bariatric center.

Methods

A randomized, double-blinded, crossover study between October 2023 and February 2024. One hundred fifty participants 6 months postmetabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) were randomly selected from the electronic patient record system to create a pool of patients to randomize for the study. The intestinal absorption of Ca carbonate and Ca citrate among groups divided by surgical procedure was compared over 8 hours of testing. Measurements included serum and urine Ca concentrations for peak values (C max) and area under the curve (AUC 0–8h), along with parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels to calculate minimum PTH (PTH min) and cumulative PTH decline (AUC 0–8h).

Results

In total, 50 per each surgery group were included with an average age of 40.5 ± 7.6 years, of whom 128 (85.3%) were female. The participants' average BMI was 30.3 ± 2.0 kg/m². The average time elapsed after MBS was 9.8 ± 1.0 months. Ca citrate intake significantly lowered PTH levels and showed enhanced relative Ca bioavailability compared to Ca carbonate. Specifically, PTH levels were notably reduced from 3 to 6 hours postadministration with Ca citrate, with significant differences (P < .001). Ca citrate also demonstrated superior relative bioavailability, as evidenced by a higher AUC 0–8h of 76.1 mg/dL·h versus 74.7 mg/dL·h for carbonate (P = 0.001) and a C max of 9.8 mg/dL compared to 9.5 mg/dL for carbonate (P < .001). Additionally, urinary Ca excretion over 9 hours was significantly greater in the citrate group at 83.7 mg/dL compared to 68.6 mg/dL for carbonate (P < .001).

Conclusion

The study demonstrates that Ca citrate was significantly better than carbonate in reducing PTH levels, enhancing relative Ca bioavailability, and increasing urinary Ca excretion. Additionally, Ca citrate resulted in higher cumulative urinary Ca excretion, indicating better Ca absorption.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^1163j6Mp]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Calcium safety and upper limits — In a Swedish prospective longitudinal cohort, calcium intake of more than 1,500 mg/day was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.67) for all-cause mortality, and a large study raised concerns about nephrolithiasis although the absolute risk of kidney stones was small (2.5% in the calcium-supplemented group versus 2.1% in the control group) with a mean total calcium intake of ∼2,100 mg. A study of more than 9,000 participants followed for 10 years found that postmenopausal women taking 500 to 1,000 mg of supplemental calcium had a significant survival advantage over women not taking supplements, while low dietary calcium intake (< 700 mg/day compared with 1,400 mg/day) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risks and a meta-analysis found no effect of calcium supplements on cardiovascular risk. In summary, studies to date suggest that dietary calcium may be preferred over supplemental calcium and that total calcium intake should not exceed 1,500 mg/day; increasing calcium intake beyond the recommended levels has not been shown to be useful and may be harmful.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^11174p1D]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective double‐blind crossover trial, we showed that Ca‐Cit is as effective as CaCO 3 in maintaining target calcium levels in chronic postsurgical HypoPT. It is believed that Ca‐Cit salts, due to their more rapid metabolism and lack of CO 2 production, may increase calcium bioavailability more efficiently and to a greater degree than CaCO 3 salts as clearly shown in the setting of bariatric surgery. This reasoning could also lead to an expectation that Ca‐Cit may maintain calcium levels at lower doses than CaCO 3. However, the lack of PTH and the mean high dosage of calcium supplementation might have prevented this conclusion to be drawn.

The other endpoint of the study was the evaluation of risk factors for nephrolithiasis assessed by the AP(CaOx) index changes. Although there was a trend toward reduction of AP(CaOx) index in Ca‐Cit treated patients, it was not significant. This index is particularly important because previous studies have clearly shown higher supersaturation levels for stone formers compared with non‐stone formers. Intuitively, higher values of AP(CaOx) index should increase risk of stone formation. Many studies focused on potassium citrate (K‐Cit) have demonstrated that this salt is able to reduce urinary AP(CaOx) index and hence the risk of nephrolithiasis. In fact, K‐Cit is recommended as a first‐choice treatment for renal stone disease. Although Ca‐Cit is a different salt from K‐Cit, we expected a similar increase in citrate excretion with a potential effect on urinary AP(CaOx) index. Indeed, Ca‐Cit, after rapid metabolism in the stomach, provides an extra alkali load, which in turn may reduce urinary supersaturation with respect to calcium‐oxalate (CaOx). However, in our study, the urinary citrate did not differ between Ca‐Cit and CaCO 3 ‐treated patients. We hypothesized that more citrate remained in the intestine. Indeed, the estimated gastrointestinal alkali absorption was similar in the two groups of patients, with a consequent lack of any urinary pH increase in Ca‐Cit‐treated patients. Furthermore, PTH is able to modulate the renal distal tubular reabsorption of calcium, whereas in HypoPT subjects, most of the calcium absorbed in the intestine is definitely found in the urine. The lack of any PTH modulation on tubular calcium reabsorption may have played an additional role in maintaining AP(CaOx) index similar in both treatment arms.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^116KUNWH]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Nutritional monitoring and supplementation after metabolic/bariatric surgery — all patients should be followed regularly and closely for potential nutritional deficiencies, and the Endocrine Society has provided a strong recommendation for periodic clinical and biochemical monitoring for micro- and macro- nutritional deficiencies. Metabolic procedures have the greatest risk for nutritional deficiency, especially the biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). All bariatric surgery patients should receive an average of 60–120 g of protein daily, and those with mal-absorptive components require a low carbohydrate diet to avoid "dumping". Typical doses of elemental calcium are 1,200–2,000 mg daily, preferably as calcium citrate; if the duodenum is bypassed, sub-lingual vitamin B12 is recommended. Iron deficiency is common and prophylactic therapy is typically given with vitamin C; women with ongoing menstrual losses should receive a higher dose. Fat-soluble vitamin (K, A, D, and E) status should be monitored; calcium and vitamin D deficiencies contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism and may require higher than typical replacement dosing of vitamin D (taken with food for best absorption) and elemental calcium, ideally as calcium citrate. Thiamine deficiency can also occasionally occur, typically associated with intractable vomiting after surgery.

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^113gWprL]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Study interventions

We measured participants' intestinal calcium absorption on three separate occasions using the dual stable calcium isotope protocol. Stable isotopes are calcium atoms of different atomic weights with no radioactivity. The dual-isotope method is considered the "gold standard" method by which to measure calcium absorption owing to its accuracy, lack of toxicity, and essentially identical biochemical behavior to that of the dominant calcium atom, ⁴⁰Ca. We administered one isotope (⁴⁴Ca) orally to trace fractional calcium absorption (FCA) and the other isotope (⁴²Ca) intravenously to trace renal and intestinal calcium recycling. We used a formula incorporating the isotope doses and their concentrations in participants' 24-hour urine collections to calculate FCA.

Trace Sciences International (Wilmington, DE, USA) provided ⁴²Ca and ⁴⁴Ca as calcium carbonate powder. The UW Waisman Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility reconstituted isotopes into calcium chloride solutions using the NIH protocol, including tests for sterility and pyrogenicity. Once cleared for human use, the isotope solutions were stored at the UW Pharmacy Research Center until administration to subjects.

Phosphate binder implementation challenges — major challenges related to a shift entirely away from calcium-containing binders relate to potentially higher costs, lower gastrointestinal tolerance that may vary by individual and type of non–calcium–based phosphate binder, and unquantified risks with concurrent use with calcimimetics; for many US patients with CKD stage 5D, particularly those with insufficient or no prescription medication coverage, calcium-based binders may be the only feasible option; calcium carbonate is very inexpensive, while calcium acetate is far less expensive than commonly used non–calcium containing binders; therefore, even if some clinicians want to prescribe calcium-free binders, they may not prescribe them due to practical reasons, and until calcium-free binders become more accessible and additional studies establish the safety of calcimimetic-induced hypocalcemia, the implementation of the KDIGO suggested guidance to restrict the dose of calcium-based phosphate binders in adults may remain limited.

5.2.8.3 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation

Statement 99. We recommend that all patients receiving a course of corticosteroids for a disease flare should receive an intake of 800–1000 mg/day calcium and 800 IU/day vitamin D (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). This can be achieved by administration of oral calcium and vitamin D supplements while on corticosteroids, or vitamin D only if dietary calcium intake is adequate. Lifestyle modification advice including regular physical exercise and smoking cessation should also be provided (Agreement: 90.9%).

For patients who have to receive corticosteroids, other factors should be addressed that have a negative impact on bone mineral density. This includes advice to stop smoking, reduce excess alcohol intake and partake in regular muscle-building and weight-bearing exercise such as weight training or running. Vitamin D deficiency is common, and occurs in more than half of patients with UC and Crohn's disease in the UK and northern Europe. In older people, there is evidence from a systematic review that vitamin D supplementation with daily dose of 700–800 IU reduces the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures. A study of patients with Crohn's disease showed that treating their active disease, and supplementing vitamin D with 800 IU and 500–1000 mg calcium daily, resulted in a small increase in bone density over the next 4 years. Steroids reduce calcium absorption from the gut and increase urinary losses, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism which results in bone resorption. A Cochrane review of five trials confirmed that calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients treated with steroids prevented bone loss from the lumbar spine and forearm. Calcium supplementation may increase cardiovascular risk (particularly if not accompanied by vitamin D supplementation). A Swedish long-term cohort study showed that a total (dietary and supplements) calcium intake greater than 1400 mg daily was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.4; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.67). Calcium supplements should not be given without vitamin D, and treatment with calcium and vitamin D should not therefore continue long term unless dietary calcium intake is less than 800 mg daily. An online calcium calculator can be used to estimate dietary calcium intake. Vitamin D should be measured and supplemented if deficient, with a high loading dose followed by maintenance.

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^111UzBPJ]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Small benefits might be useful at a population level if calcium supplements were used widely, well tolerated, and safe. Persistence with calcium supplements in clinical trials is low, however, at about 40–60%, and in one recent randomised controlled trial, there were 24 more women admitted to hospital for acute gastrointestinal symptoms in the calcium group than the placebo group, and 16 fewer women with a fracture. In another randomised controlled trial, there were 68 more women with a kidney stone in the CaD group and 56 fewer women with a fracture. In our randomised controlled trial and subsequent meta-analyses, the cardiovascular risks of calcium were similar toor exceededthe benefits of calcium on fracture prevention. In addition, 10–20% of people experience gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, which cause a considerable number to stop taking the supplements. Thus, because of the small benefits of use and unfavourable risk:benefit profile, calcium supplements should not be recommended for fracture prevention either at an individual or population level.

Treatment of early/mild to moderate hypoparathyroidism — patients whose PTH is < 15 pg/mL, serum calcium is < 8.5 mg/dL, or ionized Ca is < 1.1 mmol/L should be considered for postoperative oral calcium supplementation; a regimen of 400–1200 mg per day of elemental calcium (1–3 g of calcium carbonate; i.e., 2–6 TUMS per day) or the equivalent in calcium citrate (2000–6000 mg per day) administered orally in divided doses is usually sufficient; calcium carbonate (40% elemental calcium) and calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) are the most common salts and should be taken with meals, with calcium carbonate requiring an acidic environment to dissolve; patients on proton pump inhibitors, elderly patients with achlorhydria, and gastric bypass patients may be better treated with calcium citrate; levothyroxine should be taken one hour before or three hours after calcium salts are taken; the prolonged period of fasting during sleep may contribute to early morning hypocalcemia if oral calcium is prescribed three times daily rather than every eight hours.

### Conventional treatment of hypoparathyroidism [^115DAeFG]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy of hypoparathyroidism consists of oral calcium and either activated vitamin D or vitamin D supplements at varying doses. Although adjusting dosing of calcium and/or activated vitamin D or vitamin D itself, the serum calcium should be obtained weekly or monthly depending on the clinical situation. Calcium supplementation in hypoparathyroidism usually consists of calcium carbonate because it is 40% elemental calcium by weight. However, calcium citrate (21% elemental calcium) is indicated for patients with achlorhydria and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Many clinicians prefer to uptitrate the activated form of vitamin D to reduce the amount of calcium supplementation.

### A randomized cross over trial of tolerability and compliance of a micronutrient supplement with low iron separated from calcium vs high iron combined with calcium in pregnant women [^117EYBYo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Prenatal micronutrient supplementation is indicated for all pregnant women, because the recommended daily allowances (RDA) for many vitamins and minerals are not met during pregnancy with dietary sources alone. Prior to 1990's, physicians typically commenced prenatal micronutrients at the time of diagnosis of pregnancy. However, proving the ability of folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects, has led to the recommendation to start prenatal micronutrient supplementation when planning pregnancy. A recent analysis has further documented the importance of micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy in preventing malformations other than neural tube defects. The findings are consistent with the notion that periconceptional multivitamin use, containing folic acid, reduces the overall occurrence of birth defects by 15–33%, in addition to the demonstrated reduction in neural tube defects.

Typically, many prenatal supplements contain, among other minerals, elemental iron at 50–60 mg, to prevent pregnancy-induced anemia secondary to increasing fetal needs. However, this level of iron content has been associated adverse gastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting and constipation. The common occurrence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) has further led women to discontinue prenatal supplementation containing these levels of iron.

A new prescription prenatal micronutrient supplement PregVit ® has recently been introduced into the Canadian Market aiming to address these issues: PregVit ®, taken twice daily, contains less elemental iron (35 mg) than many other prenatal supplements. Iron is incorporated in the morning dose (Table 1). The evening dose of PregVit ® contains calcium, which is known to inhibit iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. By separating the two elements it was hypothesized that despite a lower total iron dose – a similar systemic exposure to iron would occur as with the other high iron prenatal supplements. Moreover, PregVit ® contains higher doses of vitamin C, which is also known to facilitate iron absorption (Table 1).

### Heartburn relief with bicarbonate-rich mineral water: results of the randomised, placebo-controlled phase-III trial STOMACH STILL [^113mPzyr]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with parallel-group design was conducted from April 2019 to June 2021 in 12 study sites in Germany in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (version 2013) and the requirements of the German Medicinal Products Act.

The trial was planned with an adaptive design in two stages to determine the superiority of Staatl. Fachingen Still (verum) over placebo in terms of efficacy for the treatment of heartburn. Placebo was a conventional mineral water with far lower mineralisation than verum. Verum and placebo were visually similar and packed in identical bottles with the same label. Furthermore, both study drugs had a comparable low content of carbonic acid (for composition of study drugs, see online supplemental methods). After screening, the patients went through a run-in phase during which they were advised to drink at least 1.5 L/day of water or other beverages. Only patients with an intake of at least 1.5 L/day of liquids on at least 10 days prior to baseline and with a Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) score ≥ 8 in the dimension 'heartburn' considering the last 7 days prior to baseline were eligible for randomisation. Patients were centrally allocated to the lowest yet unassigned random number in a blinded fashion to either the verum or placebo group (ratio 1:1, block randomisation with block size n = 4). During the treatment period, each patient received for 42 days (6 weeks) either 1.5 L/day of verum or 1.5 L/day of placebo, both to be drunk over the course of the day. The volume of intake was documented in a diary and controlled by the number of empty/full bottles returned. Rescue medication was provided within the clinical trial (Rennie Kautabletten — calcium carbonate/magnesium carbonate); intake was allowed in case the patient considered the heartburn episode as not tolerable and had to be documented. Patients were advised not to change their general eating habits during the trial. Patients, investigators and trial staff remained blinded for the entirety of the trial duration and data analysis.

### Acute biochemical variations induced by calcium citrate and calcium carbonate in type 2 diabetic patients: impaired calcium absorption in type 2 diabetic patients with prolonged gastric emptying time [^1115rkwc]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium supplementation is important in the treatment of osteoporosis, a disease that may also occur in diabetic patients. The acute effects of calcium supplementation and their relationship to gastric emptying time, however, have rarely been studied in type 2 diabetic patients. We evaluated the acute biochemical variations induced by the administration of two different calcium preparations, calcium citrate and calcium carbonate, in 16 (male/female: 13/3) Chinese diabetic patients. Serum free calcium, intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH), and amount of urinary excretion of calcium (uCal/uCr) were evaluated after a single dose of 1200 mg of elemental calcium in each preparation. The free calcium levels did not change significantly in either group. However, significant suppression of i-PTH after calcium citrate administration at 1 h (17.1 ± 2.0 pg/ml, P = 0.023), and after calcium carbonate administration at 2 h (14.2 ± 2.5 pg/ml, P = 0.000), was noted when compared with individual basal level (21.2 ± 2.5 and 19.3 ± 2.4 pg/ml, respectively). The suppressive effect on i-PTH lasted for 6 h after calcium citrate and 5 h after calcium carbonate preparation of the 6-h study period. After administration of calcium citrate, the uCal/uCr of 2-to-4-h collection was significantly higher than that of the basal and 0-to-2-h collections: 0.25 ± 0.04 vs. 0.19 ± 0.03, P = 0.025; and 0.25 ± 0.04 vs. 0.19 ± 0.02, P = 0.014, respectively. A similar finding was observed for calcium carbonate: 0.23 ± 0.03 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02, P = 0.019; and 0.23 ± 0.03 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02, P = 0.011, respectively. We conclude that, in this group of Chinese type 2 diabetic patients in our study, the oral administration of 1200 mg elemental calcium in either calcium citrate or calcium carbonate preparation can induce a significant suppression of i-PTH. This may be helpful in preventing or treating osteoporosis. A prolonged gastric emptying time in these diabetic subjects may contribute to the non-significant alteration in free calcium levels after the administration of either calcium preparation.

### Calcium citrate versus calcium carbonate in the management of chronic hypoparathyroidism: a randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial [^1163DQoU]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is defined by hypocalcemia and undetectable or insufficient levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). According to international guidelines, standard treatment of HypoPT includes oral calcium salts and active vitamin D metabolites to prevent hypocalcemia and to maintain serum calcium levels in the low‐normal range or just below normal.

Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) is the most widely used preparation to treat HypoPT because it contains the highest percentage of elemental calcium on a molecular weight basis (eg, 42%) and is the least expensive. It requires a source of acid, either gastric hydrochloric acid or an acidic element in the diet (eg, protein). The acid converts the carbonate salt to carbonic acid that immediately is converted to water and carbon dioxide (CO 2). It is the production of CO₂ that is believed to be responsible for side effects such as flatulence, constipation, bloating, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

These inconvenient clinical issues with CaCO 3 raise the question about whether another calcium preparation might be more advantageous in HypoPT. Calcium citrate (Ca‐Cit) is one such alternative because it has a solubility at higher pH levels (> 6.5) and does not therefore require gastric acid for absorption. It is, thus, generally recommended in patients with achlorhydria or who are receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Its bioavailability irrespective of food is another advantage over CaC0 3.

Another potential advantage of Ca‐Cit in HypoPT is that citrate salts are used in the treatment of nephrolithiasis, since they have shown an inhibitory effect on kidney stone formation because the most frequent kidney stones consist of 70% to 80% calcium oxalate. Since patients with HypoPT are at risk for kidney stones, Ca‐Cit may harbor this additional therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there are no studies aimed to investigate the efficacy of Ca‐Cit in the management of subjects with chronic HypoPT.

This study was conducted to directly compare the use of CaCO₃ and Ca‐Cit in HypoPT. We aimed to investigate, in subjects with chronic HypoPT, (i) the effect of Ca‐Cit on elements that contribute to risk of nephrolithiasis, (ii) the ability of Ca‐Cit to maintain normal serum calcium levels compared with CaCO₃, and (iii) its impact on quality of life (QOL).

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111Rh7Pe]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Nutrition — calcium and vitamin D in postmenopausal women notes that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed daily intakes of calcium for postmenopausal women were 1,000 mg to 1,200 mg, with an upper limit of 2,000 mg. Average dietary calcium intake in postmenopausal women in the United States and Canada is 700 mg to 800 mg, about one-third from dairy, so an average dairy-free diet contains up to 500 mg. Few healthy women need to take more than 500 mg to 600 mg of a calcium supplement to achieve the IOM-recommended daily intake. No serious adverse events have been observed with dietary calcium intake of less than 600 mg, and larger daily intakes are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and constipation. In the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Calcium and Vitamin D Study the average dietary calcium intake was about 1,100 mg daily, and adding 1,000 mg of a calcium supplement daily increased the risk of kidney stones by 17%. Although a clinical trial and a meta-analysis raised the possibility that a supplement of 1,000 mg daily (total daily intake approximately 2,000 mg) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, that association was not observed in the WHI, and a subsequent meta-analysis found that 2,000 mg to 2,500 mg per day was not associated with cardiovascular risk in healthy adults. In the absence of proof of benefit, a total daily calcium intake of more than 1,200 mg is not recommended for healthy postmenopausal women or those with osteoporosis.

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^111csVmY]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Adherence to supplements, particularly calcium supplements, is often low, which can have a negative impact on efficacy. In patients receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, measures should be taken to maximise adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplements: the risk of hypocalcaemia and the importance of adherence to supplements should be discussed with patients, and serum calcium levels should be monitored to assess adherence. Regular patient follow-up to encourage treatment compliance may help to ensure that supplements are taken correctly.

Compliance may be enhanced by choosing a suitable dose and delivery method for calcium and vitamin D supplements. Calcium and vitamin D supplements are available as separate or combined formulations, as a variety of delivery compounds including oral tablets, capsules, soft-chews, powders, or as solution. Calcium carbonate, available as powder formulations, has been shown to have increased bioavailability compared with calcium citrate, most often given as tablet formulations. However, patient preference studies of calcium and vitamin D supplements have shown that soft-chew tablets are preferred over powder formulations. In addition, patients are more likely to be adherent with once-daily dietary supplements than with twice-daily supplements. However, the advantages of once-daily supplementation depend on the dose required and should be considered in light of the reduced percentage absorption of calcium when it is given in doses above 500 mg. As discussed above, vitamin D supplements can be given weekly or biweekly, which may improve adherence compared with daily supplements.

Calcium supplements are associated with a number of adverse events that may reduce patient compliance with treatment. In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events are common in patients taking calcium supplements. Compared with calcium citrate, calcium carbonate is more often associated with GI symptoms. Although most GI adverse events are mild, a meta-analysis assessing the safety of calcium supplements in randomised trials found a significantly increased incidence of hospital admissions for GI adverse events in patients receiving calcium (6.8%) when compared with those receiving placebo (3.6%). For patients who experience unmanageable adverse events with calcium supplements, it is essential to provide dietary advice on how to increase calcium intake with calcium-rich foods (Table 2). In contrast, vitamin D supplements are generally well tolerated, but we advise regular monitoring of vitamin D levels in patients who are at a high risk of hypocalcaemia and those for whom poor adherence to supplementation is suspected.

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^112Bc37V]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.

Micronutrient deficiency replacement after bariatric surgery — Vitamin D, E, K, and calcium dosing is specified as follows: For vitamin D, "For mild deficiency, vitamin D3 3000 IU/day, orally. Once vitamin D levels normalize, vitamin D3 dose should be at least 1000 IU/ day after gastric bypass and at least 2000 IU/ day after biliopancreatic diversion/ duodenal switch", and "Many bariatric multivitamins have 3000 IU vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)". For more severe deficiency, the table lists "vitamin D3 6000 IU daily or vitamin D2 50,000 IU/week orally". Vitamin E guidance states, "A typical dose to treat vitamin E deficiency is 100–1000 IU orally, with maintenance dose at least 15 mg per day. (∼22.5 IU)". Vitamin K notes, "A typical oral replacement dose is 90–120 mcg/day vitamin K", that "Many bariatric multivitamins have 120–300 mcg vitamin K", and that persistent malabsorption "may require 300 mcg per day vitamin K". For calcium, "Calcium deficiency is often treated with calcium citrate 1200–1500 mg/ day, or 1800–2400 mg/day after BPD/DS, preferably in divided doses to enhance absorption", and "Calcium citrate may be better absorbed than calcium carbonate and is often preferred".

Calcium supplement formulations and dosing — Calcium carbonate has a generous calcium content (40%), may cause gastrointestinal complaints, requires gastric acid for absorption, and is best absorbed when taken with meals, whereas calcium citrate has a lower calcium content (21%), absorption is not dependent on gastric acid, and it may be less likely to cause GI complaints; in addition to tablets, chewable supplements as well as gummy preparations are available. For optimal absorption, calcium supplementation should not exceed 500 to 600 mg per dose, irrespective of the preparation, and for patients requiring more than 600 mg of calcium supplement daily, the dose should be divided.

### Bariatric nutrition and evaluation of the metabolic surgical patient: update to the 2022 Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) bariatric surgery, gastrointestinal hormones, and the microbiome clinical practice statement (CPS) [^114ejHBs]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Calcium deficiency after bariatric surgery — pathophysiology, formulation choice, and monitoring are outlined as follows: Calcium deficiency is frequent after procedures like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass due to impaired absorption from duodenal bypass and reduced gastric acid, with secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone resorption risk; concurrent vitamin D deficiency worsens malabsorption, so lifelong supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is necessary. Calcium citrate is the preferred form of calcium in bariatric patients due to superior absorption without gastric acid, and regular monitoring of serum calcium, vitamin D, and PTH with bone density assessment is recommended, with calcium and vitamin D levels evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery and yearly thereafter.

Calcium supplementation and bone health

A recent large meta-analysis of 26 randomised controlled trials reported that calcium supplements lowered the risk of any fracture by a modest but statistically significant 11% (n = 58 573; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). Even so, the authors concluded that the evidence for calcium supplements on bone health was weak and inconsistent.

Other large meta-analyses found that calcium supplementation was most effective for preventing hip fractures when it was combined with Vit D. Indeed Vit D plays a major role in intestinal calcium absorption and bone health (figure 2). Additionally, calcium absorption is, in part, dependent on adequate stomach acid, and both these parameters tend to decrease with age. Drugs that markedly reduce stomach acid, such as proton pump inhibitors, have been shown to reduce calcium absorption and increase risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

Figure 2

A large meta-analysis focusing on calcium intake and fracture risk found that in women (seven prospective cohort studies = 170 991 women, 2954 hip fractures), there was no association between total calcium intake and hip fracture risk (pooled RR per 300 mg total = 1.01; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.05). In men (five prospective cohort studies = 68 606 men, 214 hip fractures), the pooled RR per 300 mg of calcium daily was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.03).

Monosupplementation with calcium, especially using the most commonly prescribed formulations (calcium carbonate and calcium citrate) might drive down the absorption of phosphate, thereby contributing to bone demineralisation secondary to abnormal calcium to phosphate ratios. The recently updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has stated that there is insufficient evidence that calcium and Vit D prevent fractures in premenopausal women or in men who have not experienced a prior fracture. Indeed, the USPSTF now recommends against daily calcium supplementation for primary prevention of fragility fractures; stating, 'the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined'.

### Calcium vitamin D3 supplementation in clinical practice: side effect and satisfaction [^111ZeYyY]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is little debate about calcium needs during lifespan for optimizing health in health of bone and out of bone. Many people are avoid or limit dairy products because of lactase intolerant, then they have no choice but to eat supplement. Calcium supplements cause few, if any, side effects, unfortunately. Side effects can sometimes occur, including gas, constipation, bloating, nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite, mental/mood changes, and bone/muscle pain. Vitamin D3 is used to facilitate absorption of the calcium in the gut, and to facilitate calcium incorporation in the bones. Low vitamin D levels are associated with impairment of the active absorption of calcium. Fortified Vitamin D3 with calcium without gastrointestinal side effect is a greatest effective factor to prevent bone loss. OsteoCalVitFort seems more potent form of other Vitamin D and Calcium supplement (500 mg calcium and 400 I.U. of vitamin D3). The aim of this study was to evaluate side effects and satisfaction level of OsteoCalVitFort among people who consumed calcium supplement.

NCCN Gastric Cancer Version 3.2025 — post-gastrectomy nutritional monitoring — survivors who undergo gastrectomy are at risk for long-term health issues, and a prospective study of 254 patients who were followed for 5 years after gastrectomy (partial or total) found that symptoms including diarrhea, dysphagia, reflux, eating restrictions, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, and fatigue negatively impacted long-term quality of life. Survivors of gastrectomy also have unique nutritional needs due to frequent vitamin and mineral deficiencies and other gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions, and studies have shown that long-term anemia and deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and zinc can occur. Supplementation of nutrients such as vitamin B12 and iron is safe and effective for reversing these deficiencies, and it is recommended to supplement and monitor levels of vitamin B12 and D, iron, and calcium; daily multivitamin and mineral complexes that include other vitamins and nutrients are recommended as clinically indicated. Lifelong monitoring and management of nutritional sequelae of gastrectomy should be established with appropriate practitioners and specialists.

### Comparison of the absorption of calcium carbonate and calcium citrate after roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^116tNigv]. Obesity Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) restricts food intake. Consequently, patients consume less calcium. In addition, food no longer passes through the duodenum, the main site of calcium absorption. Therefore, calcium absorption is significantly impaired. The goal of this study is to compare two common calcium supplements in gastric bypass patients.

Method

Nineteen patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover study comparing the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate and calcium citrate salts. Serum and urine calcium levels were assessed for peak values (C (max)) and cumulative calcium increment (area under the curve [AUC]). Serum PTH was assessed for minimum values (PTH(min)) and cumulative PTH decrement (AUC). Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated analysis of variance model.

Results

Eighteen subjects completed the study. Calcium citrate resulted in a significantly higher serum C (max) (9.4 + 0.4 mg/dl vs. 9.2 + 0.3 mg/dl, p = 0.02) and serum AUC (55 + 2 mg/dl vs. 54 + 2 mg/dl, p = 0.02). Calcium citrate resulted in a significantly lower PTH(min) (24 + 11 pg/ml vs. 30 + 13 pg/ml, p = 0.01) and a higher AUC (-32 + 51 pg/ml vs. -3 + 56 pg/ml, p = 0.04). There was a non-significant trend for higher urinary AUC in the calcium citrate group (76.13 + 36.39 mg/6 h vs. 66.04 + 40.82, p = 0.17).

Conclusion

Calcium citrate has superior bioavailability than calcium carbonate in RYGB patients.

### Calcium intake and risk of fracture: systematic review [^1163xWiY]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Older men and women are recommended to take at least 1000–1200 mg/day of calcium for bone health and prevention of fractures. The average intake in the diet in Western countries is 700–900 mg/day, and lower in Asia and Africa, meaning that most older people would need to take calcium supplements to meet these recommendations. These guidelines for calcium intake have been widely implemented, and, in some Western countries, more than 30–50% of older women take calcium supplements. Clinical trials of calcium supplements at doses of 1000 mg/day, however, have reported adverse effects, including cardiovascular events, kidney stones, and hospital admissions for acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Consequently, older people have been encouraged to improve bone health by increasing their calcium intake through food rather than by taking supplements. This advice assumes that increasing dietary calcium intake to the recommended level of > 1200 mg/day prevents fractures without causing the adverse effects of calcium supplements.

We assessed the evidence supporting the recommendation to increase dietary calcium intake to prevent fractures and compared the anti-fracture efficacy of increasing calcium intake through dietary sources with the anti-fracture efficacy of calcium supplements. We undertook a systematic review of studies of dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements in older adults (> 50) with fracture as an endpoint. We primarily focused on the results of randomised controlled trials, but when insufficient evidence from such trials was available, we considered results of observational studies.

### Comparison of common calcium supplements… [^113yanv6]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Medical Letter consultants reviewed the efficacy and safety of current calcium supplements. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Calcium supplements are derivatives of natural products, such as oyster shell or bone. Some are marketed primarily as antacids. Calcium carbonate and phosphate preparations have the highest concentration of elemental calcium, about 40 percent. Calcium citrate contains 21 percent elemental calcium, and calcium lactate and gluconate contain 13 and 9 percent, respectively. A recent meta-analysis found that absorption of calcium citrate was 27 percent higher than that of calcium carbonate when taken on an empty stomach and 22 percent higher when taken with meals. It did not make a difference which preparation of calcium was taken or in which dosage.

Taking calcium with food in dosages of 500 mg or less increases absorption. Calcium preparations must be dissolved before they can be absorbed; the absorption rate for calcium is about 20 to 30 percent. The absorption of calcium supplements differs by preparation. Foods such as spinach, rhubarb and wheat bran can decrease calcium absorption. In postmenopausal women with low dietary calcium intake, specially prepared 500-mg tablets of calcium citrate malate were more effective in preventing bone loss than 500-mg tablets of calcium carbonate, although the difference was not significant. In another study, 500 mg of calcium citrate taken with breakfast produced serum calcium levels significantly higher than those demonstrated after 500 mg of calcium carbonate. The most common adverse effects of calcium supplements are constipation, intestinal bloating and excess gas. Adverse effects occur most frequently with calcium carbonate.

Switching preparations or increasing fluid intake may relieve symptoms. Patients who form calcium-containing stones are generally advised not to take calcium supplements. However, a low intake of calcium can aggravate the risk of stone formation by increasing absorption and urinary excretion of oxalate. High calcium intakes can increase stone formation in patients with absorptive hypercalciuria. Those with renal hypercalciuria may experience increased bone loss if calcium intake is too low. Medical Letter consultants reiterate the need for adequate calcium supplementation in all persons, regardless of age or sex. Calcium carbonate may cause more adverse events. Calcium citrate may be better absorbed than the other calcium salts. The consultants conclude that any calcium supplement taken in dosages of 500 mg or less with meals may improve absorption.

### Association between daily calcium intake and the prevalence of chronic diarrhea: an analysis of NHANES 2005–2010 data [^114qyeA6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the fixed threshold based on dietary guidelines (e.g. < 1 vs. ≥ 1 g/day) did not reach statistical significance, its direction and effect size were consistent with those observed in the continuous and RCS analyses, which suggested a nearly linear inverse association. These findings support, at the population level, the recommendation to gradually increase calcium intake from suboptimal levels toward the guideline-recommended intake (approximately 1,000–1,200 mg/day for adults, depending on age and sex). In practice, a food-first approach is encouraged to increase calcium intake, with a preference for low-fat or fat-free dairy products. For individuals with lactose intolerance, lactose-free milk, yogurt, or hard cheeses can be used as alternatives. Non-dairy sources include calcium-fortified plant-based milk, tofu coagulated with calcium salts, small fish consumed with bones, and certain dark green leafy vegetables. A stepwise increase of approximately 300 mg/day (equivalent to ~ 1 cup of dairy) is a practical approach. If dietary intake remains insufficient, calcium supplements may be considered, typically in divided doses of 200–500 mg of elemental calcium per serving (e.g. calcium carbonate with meals, calcium citrate regardless of meals), while ensuring total calcium intake does not exceed the age-specific tolerable upper intake level. Adequate vitamin D status should also be maintained to support calcium absorption. Individualized assessment is recommended for populations at risk, such as those with a history of kidney stones, hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, or advanced chronic kidney disease. Clinically, a 2–4 week trial of increased calcium intake (by 300–600 mg/day) can be implemented, with response evaluated using tools such as the BSFS and monitoring of adverse effects, to inform further adjustments to the intervention.

### Calcium supplementation for people with overweight or obesity [^1125NHaX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major health problem worldwide as it can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and insulin resistance. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide across different age groups. There is evidence of an inverse relationship between calcium intake and body weight. The clinical relevance of a small reduction in body weight has been questioned. However, at a population level, a small effect could mitigate the observed global trends.

Objectives

To assess the effects of calcium supplementation on weight loss in individuals living with overweight or obesity.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database), and two clinical trials registries. The date of the last search of all databases (except Embase) was 10 May 2023. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of calcium in participants with overweight or obesity of any age or gender. We excluded studies in participants with absorption problems. We included studies of any dose with a minimum duration of two months. We included the following comparisons: calcium supplementation versus placebo, calcium-fortified food or beverage versus placebo, or calcium-fortified food or beverage versus non-calcium-fortified food or beverage. We excluded studies that evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D or mixed minerals compared to placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were body weight, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were anthropometric measures other than body weight, all-cause mortality, and morbidity.

Main Results

We found 18 studies that evaluated the effect of calcium compared to placebo or control, with a total of 1873 randomised participants (950 participants in the calcium supplementation groups and 923 in the control groups). All included studies gave oral calcium supplementation as the intervention. We did not find any studies evaluating calcium-fortified foods. We excluded 38 studies, identified four ongoing studies, and listed one study as 'awaiting classification'. Sixteen studies compared calcium supplementation to placebo; two studies compared different doses of calcium supplementation. Doses ranged from very low (0.162 g of calcium/day) to high (1.5 g of calcium/day). Most studies were performed in the USA and Iran, lasted less than six months, and included only women. Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in little to no difference in body weight (mean difference (MD) -0.15 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to 0.24; P = 0.45, I² = 46%; 17 studies, 1317 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence by two levels for risk of bias and heterogeneity. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality, or morbidity/complications as outcomes. Only five studies assessed or reported adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests a low frequency of adverse events, with no clear difference between intervention and control groups. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control probably results in a small reduction in body mass index (BMI) (MD -0.18 kg/m 2 ,95% CI -0.22 to -0.13; P < 0.001, I² = 0%; 9 studies, 731 participants) and waist circumference (MD -0.51 cm, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.29; P < 0.001, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 273 participants). Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation compared to placebo or control may result in a small reduction in body fat mass (MD -0.34 kg, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.05; P < 0.001, I² = 97%; 12 studies, 812 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Calcium supplementation for eight weeks to 24 months may result in little to no difference in body weight in people with overweight or obesity. The current evidence is of low certainty, due to concerns regarding risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity. We found that the degree of heterogeneity might be partly explained by calcium dosage, the presence or absence of a co-intervention, and whether an intention-to-treat analysis was pursued. While our analyses suggest that calcium supplementation may result in a small reduction in BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass, this evidence is of low to moderate certainty. Future studies could investigate the effect of calcium supplementation on lean body mass to explore if there is a change in body composition.
