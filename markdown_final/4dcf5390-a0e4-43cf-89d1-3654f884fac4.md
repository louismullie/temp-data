## Question

For how long can cocaine be detected in a urine test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long cocaine or its metabolites can be detected on urine toxicology after administration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date labeling guidance. Then, I should verify how that aligns with practice references that describe typical immunoassay detection windows. Next, I will examine how test methodology, route and dose, and patient-specific factors modify detection times. Finally, I'll synthesize a useful timeline and outline key caveats around dilution, cross-reactivity, and confirmatory testing.

> Let me first confirm the highest-credibility source. The 2024 FDA labeling for cocaine hydrochloride explicitly advises that cocaine and its metabolites may be detected in urine toxicology screening for longer than one week after administration, with plasma detectability up to one week, which sets an upper bound clinicians should keep in mind [^115c7XXE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about routine clinical screening windows. I initially thought standard immunoassays might commonly detect use beyond a week, but wait, let me verify against primary care toxicology guidance. The American Family Physician review states that a positive urine immunoassay typically reflects use within the previous one to three days, whereas longer detection often relates to more sensitive methods or heavier use patterns, which reconciles the FDA's "longer than one week" with clinical screening practice [^111ffj2E]. I should also note that perioperative literature acknowledges that inactive urine metabolites may be detectable for a week following use, further supporting a longer window under certain conditions [^1127BPTh].

> Next, I should review how testing methodology changes the window. Screening immunoassays used in many clinics have higher cutoffs and lower analytical sensitivity, while confirmatory assays such as GC-MS or LC-MS/MS are more sensitive and specific, which can extend detection windows and reduce false positives; ED surveillance work underscores that LC-MS/MS detects a broader array of substances than routine ELISA panels, and labeling for combination products reminds clinicians that cross-reactivity in preliminary assays requires GC/MS confirmation to establish true positives [^111k7Kpy] [^113RTaRQ].

> I need to check how route and dose influence detection. Recreational routes such as intranasal, smoked, or intravenous use deliver higher systemic exposure than diagnostic topical ophthalmic or limited topical nasal use, which tends to shorten urinary detection. Indeed, with ophthalmic testing doses, benzoylecgonine was typically undetectable by 72 hours, highlighting that low-dose topical administration is an outlier and not generalizable to higher-dose recreational exposure patterns or sensitive confirmatory testing contexts [^114YPuR1].

> Let me consider the pharmacology and patient-specific variables that could prolong detection. Cocaine is cleared through multiple pathways, but reduced plasma cholinesterase activity and certain comorbid states may increase exposure, and for the purposes of urine detection, renal function, urine concentration, and creatinine-normalized analyses can materially affect whether a specimen screens positive or negative at a given cutoff; studies demonstrate that dilution is not random and that creatinine normalization increases the proportion of detected positives, reminding me to interpret negative results cautiously if the specimen is dilute [^116XQkJi] [^111qZJMA] [^1137RATG].

> I should confirm which analyte is typically measured. Most clinical UDS target benzoylecgonine, the primary inactive metabolite with a longer persistence than parent cocaine, and it is the standard outcome measure in cocaine treatment trials, which aligns with the practical emphasis on metabolite detection driving longer windows than parent drug assays alone [^111ffj2E] [^114HKZ9t].

> Now, I will synthesize a clinically useful timeline. For typical office or hospital immunoassay screening at standard cutoffs, expect detection of cocaine use within about one to three days; with higher sensitivity confirmatory testing, high-dose exposure, or chronic use, detection can extend to a week and may be longer, consistent with FDA labeling that notes urine detectability beyond one week under some circumstances and perioperative literature indicating week-long metabolite detection in certain cases [^111ffj2E] [^115c7XXE] [^1127BPTh].

> But wait, I need to ensure I spell out key caveats about test interpretation. Dilute urine can yield false negatives, creatinine-normalized interpretation improves accuracy, and preliminary immunoassays can cross-react, so positive screens should be confirmed with GC/MS or LC-MS/MS to avoid misclassification; case reports show that false-positive screens can materially alter care plans until confirmatory testing corrects the record, and ED surveillance highlights that routine panels may miss substances that more definitive assays readily identify [^1137RATG] [^113RTaRQ] [^113LWzsZ] [^111k7Kpy].

> I should double-check for uncommon contributors to positive results. Ingestion of coca-leaf tea can yield benzoylecgonine-positive urine within 24 hours, emphasizing the importance of a careful exposure history when results are discordant with patient report or clinical expectations, and reinforcing why confirmatory and, when appropriate, quantitative interpretation may be necessary [^1138Pko5].

> Final cross-check and summary before concluding. Cocaine and its metabolites may be detectable in urine for longer than one week in some settings per FDA labeling, but routine clinical immunoassay screening generally identifies use within one to three days; longer detection windows are more likely with higher sensitivity confirmatory assays, higher or repeated doses, and patient factors that increase exposure or decrease excretion, whereas low-dose topical ophthalmic administration tends to yield much shorter detection durations that should not be extrapolated to recreational use scenarios [^115c7XXE] [^111ffj2E] [^114YPuR1] [^1127BPTh].

---

A urine test is typically positive for cocaine for **1–3 days after single use** [^111ffj2E] and up to **7–10 days with heavy or chronic use** [^115c7XXE] due to benzoylecgonine's persistence. Detection windows vary with use pattern, metabolism, hydration, and test sensitivity [^111ffj2E]; **immunoassays are rapid but less specific**, so unexpected positives should be confirmed by GC/MS or LC-MS/MS [^113RTaRQ] [^111k7Kpy]. Dilution can reduce detection [^111qZJMA], but **creatinine normalization** helps identify this [^1137RATG].

---

## Cocaine metabolism and excretion

Cocaine is **rapidly metabolized** in the body, primarily through hydrolysis and oxidation, producing several metabolites [^116XQkJi]. The primary metabolite detected in urine drug tests is **benzoylecgonine**, which is inactive but persists longer than cocaine [^114YPuR1]. Cocaine has a short half-life of approximately 0.7 to 1.5 hours, whereas benzoylecgonine has a longer half-life of approximately 5 to 8 hours, enabling detection in urine for several days after use.

---

## Detection window for cocaine in urine tests

The detection window for cocaine in urine tests **varies** [^111ffj2E] with the frequency and amount of cocaine use, individual metabolism, hydration status, and the sensitivity of the testing method. Generally, cocaine and its metabolites can be detected in urine for the following durations:

| **Frequency of use** | **Detection window** |
|-|-|
| Single use | 1–3 days |
| Moderate use (2–4 times per week) | 3–5 days |
| Heavy or chronic use (daily or near-daily use) | 7–10 days |

---

These detection windows are **general guidelines** [^111ffj2E] and can vary between individuals; factors such as body mass index, liver function, and overall health influence how quickly cocaine metabolites are eliminated from the body [^116XQkJi].

---

## Factors influencing detection time

Several factors can influence how long cocaine remains detectable in urine:

- **Frequency and amount of use**: Chronic or heavy use leads to accumulation of metabolites, extending the detection window [^111ffj2E].
- **Individual metabolism**: Faster metabolism results in quicker elimination of cocaine metabolites [^116XQkJi].
- **Hydration levels**: Diluted urine samples may reduce detectable concentrations, potentially leading to false negatives or inconclusive results [^111qZJMA].
- **Testing method sensitivity**: More sensitive tests can detect lower concentrations of metabolites, extending the detection window [^111k7Kpy].

---

## Testing methods and their accuracy

Urine drug tests for cocaine typically use **immunoassay screening methods** [^111ffj2E], which are fast and inexpensive but may yield false positives or false negatives. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), are more accurate and specific [^111k7Kpy].

---

## False positives and false negatives

False positives can occur due to **cross-reactivity** with other substances or medications, such as certain local anesthetics, in immunoassay tests [^113RTaRQ] [^113LWzsZ]. False negatives can occur if the urine sample is **diluted** [^1137RATG] [^116vw5NY] or if the test is not sensitive enough to detect low concentrations of metabolites [^111ffj2E].

---

## Clinical implications of positive cocaine urine tests

Positive cocaine urine tests have **significant clinical implications**, especially in medical and surgical settings. Cocaine use is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction [^1123Z8ZA] [^116R8jUq] [^113UU3Y8]. In surgical settings, recent cocaine use can complicate anesthesia management and increase the risk of intraoperative hemodynamic instability.

---

## Summary of key points

- **Cocaine is rapidly metabolized**, but its primary metabolite, benzoylecgonine, persists longer in the body [^116XQkJi].
- **Detection windows vary** based on frequency of use, individual metabolism, hydration levels, and test sensitivity [^111ffj2E].
- **Immunoassay tests are commonly used** for initial screening, but confirmatory tests like GC-MS or LC-MS are more accurate [^111k7Kpy].
- **False positives and false negatives can occur**, necessitating confirmatory testing [^113RTaRQ].
- **Positive cocaine urine tests have important clinical implications**, particularly in surgical and medical settings [^1127BPTh].

---

A urine test can detect cocaine use for approximately **1–3 days after single use** [^111ffj2E], and up to **7–10 days for chronic or heavy use** [^115c7XXE]. The detection window **depends** on factors such as frequency of use, individual metabolism, hydration levels, and the sensitivity of the testing method [^111ffj2E].

### Dilution of urine drug tests: Is it random [^111qZJMA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the act of in vivo urine dilution is a random phenomenon.

- **Methods**: The sample population was divided into four groups for each of the drugs tested: pre-creatinine normalization laboratory positive, pre-creatinine normalization laboratory negative, post-creatinine normalization laboratory drug positive, and post-creatinine normalization laboratory drug negative. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks, along with post hoc Mann-Whitney U testing with Bonferroni adjustment, was used to compare the mean urine creatinine concentration of each group.

- **Results**: The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that each drug had a statistically significant difference in group comparisons. Post hoc testing found that cocaine demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the prenormalization drug positive and negative groups. Amphetamines, marijuana, and opiates confirmed statistically significant differences between the prenormalization drug positive and negative groups. The examination of phencyclidine was limited by the lack of a prenormalization drug positive group; therefore, no definitive findings can be presented. Statistically significant differences were found between the postnormalization drug positive and negative groups for each drug tested.

- **Conclusions**: This study supports the theory that urine dilution is not a random event and it may adversely affect the integrity of the drug-testing process.

### Creatinine normalization of workplace urine drug tests: Does it make a difference [^1137RATG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study examines the effect of creatinine normalization on urine drug concentrations of five substances: amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and phencyclidine, and how this affects the proportion of reported positives.

- **Methods**: The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used to compare the mean prenormalization urinary drug concentration with the mean postnormalization urinary drug concentration. Frequency analysis was performed on dichotomous drug test results, and the information was used to complete McNemar testing for each drug to determine the difference in proportions for prenormalization positive drug tests compared to postnormalization positive drug tests.

- **Results**: Each drug tested (N = 4460) was found to have a statistically significant increase in mean urinary drug concentration after creatinine normalization, with effect sizes ranging from small to medium. Cocaine had the largest effect size (r = 0.229), and phencyclidine had the lowest effect size (r = 0.121). The differences in the proportion of dichotomous results between study and control groups for drugs tested were compared using the McNemar test. Each drug showed a statistically significant (P = 0.0010) increase in positive drug tests.

- **Conclusions**: This result indicates that specimen dilution does affect the number of laboratory-positive results confirmed.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^113RTaRQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: Depending on the sensitivity/specificity and the test methodology, the individual components of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may cross-react with assays used in the preliminary detection of cocaine (primary urinary metabolite, benzoylecgonine) or marijuana (cannabinoids) in human urine. A more specific alternate chemical method must be used to obtain a confirmed analytical result. The preferred confirmatory method is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Moreover, clinical considerations and professional judgment should be applied to any drug-of-abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are used.

	- Acetaminophen may interfere with home blood glucose measurement systems, leading to decreases of more than 20% in mean glucose values. This effect appears to be drug, concentration, and system dependent.

- **Carcinogenesis**: Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen have not been conducted.

	- Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats.

### Urine drug screening: A valuable office procedure [^111ffj2E]. American Family Physician (2010).

Urine drug screening can enhance workplace safety, monitor medication compliance, and detect drug abuse. Ordering and interpreting these tests requires an understanding of testing modalities, detection times for specific drugs, and common explanations for false-positive and false-negative results. Employment screening, federal regulations, unusual patient behavior, and risk patterns may prompt urine drug screening. Compliance testing may be necessary for patients taking controlled substances.

Standard immunoassay testing is fast, inexpensive, and the preferred initial test for urine drug screening. This method reliably detects morphine, codeine, and heroin; however, it often does not detect other opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, and tramadol. Unexpected positive test results should be confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. A positive test result reflects use of the drug within the previous one to three days, although marijuana can be detected in the system for a longer period of time. Careful attention to urine collection methods can identify some attempts by patients to produce false-negative test results.

### Temporal progression of cocaine dependence symptoms in the US National Comorbidity Survey [^111Umpra]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study arises from the introduction of cocaine dependence as a diagnostic category in 1987 with the DSM-III-R. Unlike alcohol symptom progression, which has been extensively studied, cocaine dependence has received less focus. This paper investigates the retrospective recall of DSM-III-R cocaine dependence symptom progression among a large sample of cocaine users and examines the relationship of these symptoms to psychiatric comorbidity.

Methods involved using data from the US National Comorbidity Survey, where DSM-III-R criterion 'A' cocaine dependence symptoms were sequenced temporally based on the age of symptom onset. Each numerical symptom string was analyzed to determine its prevalence and association with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

The results showed that cocaine users comprised 16% of the sample. While numerous symptom sequence permutations are possible, only a few were highly prevalent. Subjects with early onset neuroadaptive symptoms, such as tolerance and withdrawal, were more likely to develop cocaine dependence than those with early psychosocial consequence symptoms. Additionally, specific temporal patterns were found to influence the presence or absence of cocaine dependence and psychiatric comorbidity. Notably, psychiatric comorbidity often preceded rather than followed cocaine use onset disproportionately.

In conclusion, similar to alcohol users, cocaine users follow a limited array of symptom sequence pathways from first use to dependence. Understanding and examining the temporal progression of drug use symptoms can aid clinicians in their practice.

### Results of random drug testing in an adolescent substance abuse program [^116vw5NY]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate, from a random urine drug-testing program for adolescents, the proportion of drug tests that are susceptible to interpretation errors. This was a secondary analysis of a clinical database and chart review from an adolescent outpatient substance abuse program at a large children's hospital. We analyzed 710 urine drug test results from 110 adolescent patients (13–21 years of age) collected between December 2002 and July 2005, and 85 original laboratory reports for tests collected between December 2002 and May 2006 that were confirmed positive for opioids.

Specifically, we calculated the percentage of tests that were too dilute to interpret (potential false-negatives) and the percentage of confirmed positive tests for oxycodone that did not result in a positive initial screen (potential false-negatives). We also reviewed clinical information to determine whether confirmed positive tests resulted from legitimate use of prescription or over-the-counter medication (potential false-positives).

Of 710 drug tests, 40 negative tests were too dilute to interpret properly, and 45 of 217 positive tests resulted from prescription medication use, for a total of 85 tests that were susceptible to error. Of the 85 confirmatory laboratory reports reviewed, 43 were positive for oxycodone, but only 16 of these had produced a positive opiate screen.

Unless proper procedures are used in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting laboratory testing for drugs, there is a substantial risk for error.

### Risk factors for experiencing psychosis during cocaine use: a preliminary report [^111x7DCf]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Cocaine induced psychosis (CIP) is a common, but not universal, side effect of cocaine abuse. Factors underlying the development and severity of CIP remain poorly understood. This study tests the hypothesis that an earlier age of initiation of regular use may increase the likelihood of developing CIP or the severity of CIP symptoms.

- **Methods**: Cocaine use history and severity of CIP (if any) were assessed with the Cocaine Experience Questionnaire in 51 abstinent (3 weeks to 1 year) cocaine-dependent individuals. Subjects were divided into those with high and low CIP severity, and into those with early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, and later age of initiation. Various cutoffs between early and late age of initiation were used, ranging from 15 to 22 years.

- **Results**: From ages 17 through 20, controlling for cumulative duration of use, severity scores were significantly higher for the early initiation group than for the later initiation group (p values ranged from 0.031 to 0.036). Cumulative duration of use, but not age of initiation, significantly predicted initial development of CIP (p = 0.044).

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that early age of initiation of regular cocaine use, occurring during vulnerable periods of brain development, may lead to increased severity of CIP.

### Cocaine rapid efficacy screening trial (CREST): A paradigm for the controlled evaluation of candidate medications for cocaine dependence [^114HKZ9t]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

The development of effective medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence remains a major priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health. The Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trial (CREST) paradigm was developed by the Division of Treatment Research and Development (DT R&D) at NIDA with the goal of enhancing pilot clinical trial validity when systematically assessing a range of medications and drug classes for potential utility in the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Design**: CREST utilizes a randomized, controlled, parallel group, blinded methodology for comparing one or more marketed medications against a standard, pharmaceutical-grade placebo. The trial design consists of a flexible 24-week screening/baseline period followed by randomization to an 8-week treatment period.

- **Measures**: Standard measures of outcomes for the CREST included urinary benzoylecgonine (primary metabolite of cocaine), retention, cocaine craving, depression, clinical global impression, and HIV-risk behaviors. To facilitate comparisons of data from the CREST studies across sites, drug classes, and time, standardized procedures, measures, and psychosocial counseling were used.

- **Results**: A total of 19 medications were evaluated in outpatient treatment research clinics in Boston, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York, and Philadelphia.

- **Conclusions**: Findings supported decisions to move forward with three medications (cabergoline, reserpine, tiagabine) using full-scale, adequately powered, randomized placebo-controlled trial designs.

### Time for tea, anyone [^1138Pko5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

There have been suggestions that urine samples positive for benzoylecgonine, the diagnostic metabolite of cocaine, may be the result of consuming Mate de Coca, a commercially available tea made from coca (Erythroxylon coca) leaves. The Jockey Club in Great Britain commissioned research into this subject, as several jockeys have tested positive for benzoylecgonine over the past few years. Urine samples collected at various time points within 24 hours after ingestion of a 250 mL infusion of Mate de Coca tea were analyzed using three different methods. All samples tested positive for benzoylecgonine.

### Temporal and gender trends in concordance of urine drug screens and self-reported use in cocaine treatment studies [^11158U84]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To describe temporal trends in concordance, sensitivity, and specificity and to explore demographic trends in concordance in two outpatient treatment studies for cocaine dependence. We obtained 2229 urine drug screens from 129 individuals, along with accompanying self-use reports. Paired self-use reports and urine drug screens were considered concordant if the two measures of cocaine use were in agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of the self-use reports in predicting the urine drug screen was also estimated. To model concordance, sensitivity, and specificity as a function of time, generalized estimating equations were used. Demographic effects on concordance among subjects who achieved 100% concordance and subjects who achieved a recently proposed 70% concordance threshold were tested.

- **Results**: Over the course of our studies, both sensitivity and concordance statistically decreased, yet specificity remained relatively constant. Median concordance for all subjects was 88%. Among all subjects, concordance varied significantly by gender, with females achieving significantly higher concordance than males (96% vs. 86%). Similarly, females were almost twice as likely to achieve 100% concordance as males (42% vs. 22%). Finally, 80% of participants achieved the 70% concordance threshold, and no differences among demographic groups with regards to the 70% concordance threshold were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Temporal effects of concordance and sensitivity may have profound repercussions when using self-use reports to gauge the efficacy of an experimental intervention.

### Measuring outcome in cocaine clinical trials: a comparison of sweat patches with urine toxicology and participant self-report [^1121c77a]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the advantages of using a sweat patch (PharmCheck) for detecting cocaine abuse in cocaine-dependent patients participating in a clinical trial, the utility of the sweat patch was assessed from several perspectives. These included the reliability and validity of quantitative sweat patch results, the possible degradation of cocaine to benzoylecgonine (BE) as a function of the length of time that a patch is worn, the completeness of the dataset yielded by thrice-weekly urine toxicology compared with thrice-weekly and weekly sweat patches, and the relative costs associated with sweat patch versus urine measures.

Data were collected during a 10-week outpatient clinical trial, in which participants wore two sweat patches: one applied every visit and one applied weekly. Urine samples were collected thrice weekly, as were self-reports of substance use. The trial was conducted at multiple sites in Boston, Cincinnati, and New York, USA.

Twenty-seven participants with comorbid diagnoses of cocaine dependence and adult attention deficit disorder completed the study. Sweat patch and urine samples were analyzed by standard methods for cocaine and cocaine metabolites.

Quantitative sweat patch measures showed good reliability, with the correlation between the weekly and per-visit patches being 0.96 (P < 0.0001). Validity, as judged by the correlation between quantitative urine BE levels and either weekly (0.76, P < 0.0001) or per-visit (0.73, P < 0.0001) cocaine sweat patch levels, was reasonable. The correlation be

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use and is manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution is approved for topical single use during diagnostic procedures and surgeries, so physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms are unlikely to develop. Although Goprelto is not indicated for chronic therapy, repeated misuse or abuse of this product may lead to physical dependence.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^115zghb1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Study population demographics**: Two million methamphetamine UDT results from individual patients, received between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, were analyzed. Of the analyzed specimens, 106,405 (5.32%) were positive for nonprescribed methamphetamine. The median age (interquartile range) was 44 (19–69) years for the entire sample population and 35 (19–51) years for the methamphetamine-positive population. The sample population was 54.72% female compared to 49.11% for the methamphetamine-positive population. The largest number of specimens came from pain management practices (28.47%) and primary care physicians (24.05%). However, SUD treatment centers (46.97%) and behavioral health (19.98%) were the most frequent specialties with specimens positive for methamphetamine. Although the greatest number of specimens were from the South Atlantic (19.16%) and East North Central (16.95%) divisions, the largest number of methamphetamine positives were found in the Pacific (32.94%) and Mountain (13.27%) divisions, which is concordant with reports of higher methamphetamine availability in western states.

In addition to methamphetamine, nine drugs and drug classes were evaluated. Testing for additional drugs and drug classes was not ordered in all 2 million specimens. Cocaine (n = 1,938,686), THC (n = 1,774,320), and methadone (n = 1,771,528) were ordered most frequently. Other opioids and THC were detected most frequently in both the total sample population.

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^115R2Cbt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Protocols for identifying which newborns to screen present a number of challenges for the clinical and social work team. Some of the highest risk factors for maternal non-medical drug use, such as a maternal history of drug abuse, previous child protective services involvement, or domestic violence, may be difficult to elicit from the parent(s), especially if a mother presents to a facility that did not handle her prenatal care. When using meconium as the specimen for newborn drug testing, there is a risk that collection may be missed if risk factors emerge days after delivery. Thus, narrow criteria for newborn drug testing runs some risk of missing cases. On the other hand, overly broad criteria may increase sensitivity at the expense of specificity.

The objective of this study was to review newborn urine and meconium drug screening to identify high-yield screening risk factors to detect maternal non-medical drug use during pregnancy. The newborn drug testing protocol at the study institution has been used at many facilities in the state of Iowa.

### Notes from the field: High prevalence of fentanyl detected by the Maryland Emergency Department Drug Surveillance System - Baltimore, Maryland, 2019 [^111k7Kpy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

The toxicology screens of many hospitals include tests for common substances of abuse, including amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabis, phencyclidine, and opiates. These tests, often enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), might be limited by cross-reactivity, false positives, and false negatives, and might only detect a specific set of substances. In 2018, a multicenter study of Baltimore-area emergency departments (EDs) showed a decline in the percentage of intoxicated patients with positive test results for opiates. At the same time, opioid-involved overdose deaths were increasing in Baltimore, suggesting that another opioid, not heroin, was the cause.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can be used to analyze urine specimens and identify a much wider variety of substances to which a person might be exposed. Unfortunately, LC-MS/MS is difficult to implement for point-of-care testing, and it would be cost-prohibitive to test every patient. The Maryland Emergency Department Drug Surveillance (EDDS) system institutes limited LC-MS/MS testing when there are changes in patient signs and symptoms that are not explained by routine testing, suggesting that a new substance is being used. This report documents the frequent identification of fentanyl among ED patients suffering from overdoses in Baltimore, which would not have been possible without the assistance of EDDS.

### Dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence [^115rBTFw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine is a major drug of abuse. Cocaine dependence is a common and serious condition, which has become a substantial public health problem. There is a wide and well-documented range of consequences associated with the chronic use of this drug, such as medical, psychological, and social problems, including the spread of infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis), crime, violence, and neonatal drug exposure. Therapeutic management of cocaine addicts includes an initial period of abstinence from the drug. During this phase, subjects may experience, besides the intense craving for cocaine, symptoms such as depression, fatigue, irritability, anorexia, and sleep disturbances. It has been demonstrated that the acute use of cocaine may enhance dopamine transmission and chronically decrease dopamine concentrations in the brain. Pharmacological treatments that affect dopamine could theoretically reduce these symptoms and contribute to a more successful therapeutic approach.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of dopamine agonists for treating cocaine dependence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (from 1966 to 2000), EMBASE (from 1980 to 2000), LILACS (from 1982 to 2000), PsycLIT (from 1974 to 2000), and Biological Abstracts (1982 to 2000). This included reference searching, personal communication, conference abstracts, unpublished trials from the pharmaceutical industry, and book chapters on the treatment of cocaine dependence.

- **Selection criteria**: The inclusion criteria for all randomized trials.

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^116jSGC5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Of the 2,497 newborns for whom meconium specimens were analyzed, 1,773 (71.0%) had concurrent urine testing. Only twelve urine samples (0.7%) screened positive for non-medical drug use (8 THC, 2 cocaine, 2 methamphetamine). Nine of those samples were confirmed positive by GC/MS or LC/MS/MS. The other three urine samples screened positive for THC metabolite but were negative by confirmation. All twelve samples positive by screening (whether confirmed or not) demonstrated 100% concordance with meconium testing. In 128 cases where meconium analysis detected non-medical drug use, a concurrent urine specimen was negative for the drug(s) detected in meconium. There were four urine specimens that were immunoassay screen positive for amphetamines but negative by LC/MS/MS confirmatory analysis. Labetalol administration in the mother was suspected to be the likely cause of these false positives, given the reported ability of labetalol metabolites to cause amphetamine positive screens with some amphetamines immunoassays.

An additional 354 newborns had urine drug testing performed in the absence of meconium testing. Of these, only 14 had one or more positive results on urine drug screening. All findings were explained by medications administered to the newborn prior to sample collection, except for one newborn with a positive urine immunoassay screen for THC. In this newborn, there was insufficient urine specimen for confirmatory analysis, and the child abuse report was rejected.

### Cannabidiol as a treatment for craving and relapse in individuals with cocaine use disorder: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^11274UdS]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The primary outcomes focused on drug-cue-induced craving (Phase I) and time-to-cocaine relapse (Phase II). Researchers calculated self-reported drug-cue-induced craving by determining the difference in craving scores [using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10] between after and before the drug-cue-induced imagery session on day 8. The time-to-cocaine relapse was assessed over 12 weeks by counting the days from detoxification discharge to the first day of cocaine use. This outcome was measured subjectively using the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method and objectively by weekly urinalysis. Urine samples were analyzed via rapid chromatographic immunoassay for benzoylecgonine (a major cocaine metabolite) with a lower limit of 150 ng/ml. If data were missing, it was assumed the participant relapsed. Participants were expected to continue weekly follow-up following a relapse.

- **Secondary outcomes**: These included stress-induced craving (Phase I) and cocaine use (Phase II). Self-reported stress-induced craving was calculated similarly to drug-cue-induced craving, using the VAS, both after and before a stress-induced session on day 8. Cocaine use was assessed by determining the percentage of positive urine tests out of the 12 samples collected during follow-up. Missing tests were counted as positive.

- **Exploratory outcomes**: These considered daily cocaine craving, withdrawal symptoms, self-reported days of cocaine use, and sustained abstinence. Daily cocaine craving was measured every 2 days during Phase I and every 2 weeks during Phase II, employing both the VAS for craving and the Cocaine C.

### Cocaine use during pregnancy assessed by hair analysis in a Canary Islands cohort [^1173C2F6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Use of drugs during pregnancy is challenging to determine because maternal reports are often inaccurate. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use among pregnant women by analyzing maternal hair.

- **Methods**: A toxicological analysis of hair was conducted to detect chronic recreational drug use during pregnancy. In 2007, 347 mother-infant dyads were included from the Hospital La Candelaria in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Data regarding socioeconomic characteristics and substance misuse during pregnancy were collected using a structured questionnaire. Drugs of abuse such as opiates, cocaine, cannabinoids, and amphetamines were detected in maternal hair through immunoassay, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for confirmation and quantitation.

- **Results**: Hair analysis showed a 2.6% positivity rate for cocaine and its metabolites. Cocaine use during pregnancy was associated with unusual behavior that could potentially harm the baby.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrates significant cocaine use among pregnant women in the Canary Islands. The data should inform preventive health strategies and policy efforts to detect and, if possible, avoid prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse in the future.

### Duration of positive urine for cocaine metabolite after ophthalmic administration: Implications for testing patients with suspected Horner syndrome using ophthalmic cocaine [^114YPuR1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the duration of positive urine for benzoylecgonine, the major metabolite excreted in the urine, after topical ophthalmic administration of cocaine as one would perform for testing the presence of Horner syndrome.

- **Methods**: Two drops of cocaine 10% were applied to each eye of 50 normal subjects. Urine samples were collected 4 to 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours later. Each sample was assayed for benzoylecgonine using a screening competitive enzyme donor immunoassay followed by a highly specific and sensitive confirmatory gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. We employed assays and cutoff levels that fulfilled guidelines required by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services of the United States Department of Health and Human Services to mimic measures that exist for federal workplace drug testing.

- **Results**: Of the 50 subjects, there were 25 women and 25 men, ranging in age from 19 to 59 years (median age, 40 years). Positive screening samples were obtained in 47 of 50 subjects (94%) 4 to 6 hours, 35 of 50 (70%) 24 hours, and 1 of 50 (2%) 48 hours after topical application of cocaine. None of the samples tested positive at 72 hours or beyond. Using the confirmatory assay's cutoff as the gold standard for a positive test, the sensitivity of the screening assay was 96% 4 to 6 hours, 90% 24 hours, and 14% 48 hours after topical application. Urine benzoylecgonine concentration was negatively correlated with body mass index and positively correlated with urine creatinine concentration.

- **Conclusions**: Patients should be informed that their urine may test positive within certain time frames following ophthalmic administration of cocaine.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^1135eA9w]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The trends were broken down by the type of cocaine reported (powder cocaine or crack), the client's history in addiction treatment (previously treated or not), and the primary role of cocaine in the treatment demand. Studying the difference for these two types of cocaine is important because these substances tend to be used by different user populations [16] and are associated with different clinical profiles and intensity of harms [17].

### US federal cocaine essential ('precursor') chemical regulation impacts on US cocaine availability: an intervention time-series analysis with temporal replication [^114eYbaW]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

This study utilized intervention (interrupted) time-series analysis with replication and comparison series, which is a powerful quasi-experimental design. Quasi-experimental designs can lend support to, but do not prove, a causal hypothesis, however. Accordingly, it is possible that the impacts found here could have been due to factors in addition to or other than US essential chemical regulation.

In late 1989, US government efforts to interdict boat/plane cocaine shipments in the Caribbean increased — a consideration here as the potassium permanganate/solvents regulation was implemented in October 1989. The main US portal for Caribbean transshipped cocaine is the southeast US, particularly Florida. Authors have suggested that traffickers, in response to the Caribbean effort, redirected cocaine shipments through Mexico, a land route to the southwest US. If correct, southeast US cocaine availability should have declined beginning in late 1989, accompanied by growth in southwest US cocaine availability. Instead, the present study found that both areas experienced pronounced declines in cocaine seizure amounts, pronounced rises in price, and comparable recovery points — findings consistent with essential chemical regulation, not an interdiction operation directed at a selected portal.

Peru initiated a force-down/shoot-down policy against drug trafficker aircraft in March 1995, two months before the May 1995 MIBK regulation. Granting the possibility that the policy had a lag before realizing an effect, it may have contributed to the cocaine price.

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^116cdRJa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Non-medical drug use includes amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, Ecstasy), benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids used outside of health professional outpatient prescription or inpatient administration.

This category was for untreated maternal psychiatric illness (e.g. major depression, bipolar disorder) excluding non-medical drug use.

Abbreviations: HBV, hepatitis B virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Cases for which newborn drug testing was performed solely due to the presence of either untreated maternal psychiatric illness and/or unexplained prematurity (i.e. no other risk factors present) were significantly less frequent in Group C (1.7%) versus Group A (30.5%), Group B (37.1%), or Group D (26.1%).

### The relationship between years of cocaine use and brain activation to cocaine and response inhibition cues [^117Farw2]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging research has attempted to elucidate the neurobehavioral underpinnings of cocaine dependence by evaluating differences in brain activation to cocaine and response inhibition cues between cocaine-dependent individuals and controls. This study investigated associations between task-related brain activation and cocaine use characteristics.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional.

- **Setting**: The Center for Biomedical Imaging at the Medical University of South Carolina, USA.

- **Participants**: Fifty-one cocaine users (41 dependent).

- **Measurements**: Brain activation to cocaine-cue exposure and Go No-Go tasks in six a priori selected brain regions of interest and cocaine use characteristics (i.e. cocaine dependence status, years of cocaine use, cocaine use in the past 90 days) assessed via standardized interviews.

- **Findings**: Participants demonstrated elevated activation to cocaine (bilateral ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, amygdala) and response inhibition (bilateral anterior cingulate, insula, inferior frontal gyrus) cues in all hypothesized brain regions. Years of cocaine use was associated with task-related brain activation, with more years of cocaine use associated with greater activation to cocaine cues in right (F = 7.97, P = 0.01) and left (F = 5.47, P = 0.02) ventral striatum and greater activation to response inhibition cues in left insula (F = 5.10, P = 0.03) and inferior frontal gyrus (F = 4.12, P = 0.05) controlling for age, cocaine dependence status, and cocaine use in the past 90 days.

- **Conclusions**: Years of cocaine use may be more centrally related to task-related brain activation.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^115kogiU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine methamphetamine positivity and co-positivity with other drugs in urine drug test (UDT) results geographically through time.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2019, included patient specimens submitted by healthcare professionals across the United States. The analysis used LC-MS/MS to detect cocaine, heroin, alcohol, marijuana, nonprescribed methamphetamine, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, benzodiazepines, and other opioids. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of demographic features and model yearly methamphetamine detection patterns across US census divisions. Odds ratios (OR) from logistic modeling were used to assess the impact of methamphetamine positivity on the spatiotemporal detection patterns of additional nonprescribed or illicit drugs.

- **Results**: The probability of being positive for methamphetamine increased nationally from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, representing a 340% increase after corrections for demographic covariates. The highest predicted positivity rate was observed in male patients, 25 to 34 years old, from the West North Central division and from substance use disorder treatment centers. Nationally, co-positivity ORs for fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids with methamphetamine were highest in 2019. Increases in ORs from 2014 through 2019 were statistically significant for heroin (P = 0.024) and fentanyl (P = 0.0085). Co-positivity ORs for methamphetamine and other substances varied by census division.

### Urine drug screening in adolescents [^1138VrgV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The urine drug screen is an important tool in adolescent medicine. Several ethical and numerous technical issues are associated with its use. The nature and limitations of the specific tests that compose the screen must be known to the physician. Two-way communication with the laboratory — both before the test is ordered and after the results are reported — can be very helpful. Laboratory testing cannot substitute for an ongoing therapeutic alliance with the patient. Testing is an important element of the substance use assessment but is only one element. It is not required in every case and is not sufficient alone in any case.

### Overdose deaths involving opioids, cocaine, and psychostimulants - United States, 2015–2016 [^112vE3Qd]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, at autopsy, the substances tested for and the circumstances under which tests are performed to determine which drugs are present vary by time and jurisdiction, and improvements in toxicologic testing might account for some reported increases.

Second, 17% (2015) and 15% (2016) of drug overdose death certificates did not include the specific types of drugs involved, and the percentage of drug overdose death certificates with at least one drug specified varied widely by state, ranging from 52.5% to 99.3% in 2016. This variation limits rate comparisons between states.

Third, because heroin and morphine are metabolized similarly, some heroin deaths might have been misclassified as morphine deaths, resulting in underreporting of heroin deaths.

Fourth, potential race misclassification might lead to underestimates for certain categories, primarily for American Indian/Alaska Natives and Asian/Pacific Islanders.

Finally, state-specific analyses are restricted to 31 states and DC, limiting generalizability.

The ongoing and worsening drug overdose epidemic requires immediate attention and action. Faster access to data at the time of collection is needed to understand emerging threats in local communities and to tailor response activities. The CDC's Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance program funds 32 states and DC for more timely and comprehensive nonfatal and fatal overdose data, including funding for improved comprehensive toxicologic testing to identify emerging drug threats in opioid-involved fatal overdoses.

### Prevalence of cocaine use in ED patients with severe hypertension [^113UU3Y8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated the prevalence of cocaine use in emergency department patients with elevated diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg.

- **Design**: Urine was collected from adult patients with diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg. The Institutional Review Board granted a waiver of informed consent based on complete deidentification of the data to prevent selection bias. Spontaneously voided urine specimens were analyzed for the presence of benzoylecgonine.

- **Results**: Of 107 eligible patients with a diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 120 mm Hg, 99 were tested. Of these 99, 13 (13%) tested positive, and of which, 6 (46%) presented with a request for medication refill. Five patients (39%) had cardiovascular and/or pulmonary complaints.

- **Conclusion**: Emergency department patients with hypertension who have recently used cocaine may be difficult to differentiate from those who have not. Consideration should be given to the potential for cocaine use when making treatment decisions in patients with hypertension.

### Cocaine-associated hemoperitoneum following atraumatic splenic rupture: a case report and literature review [^111L9fPL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Laboratory studies revealed an initial hematocrit of 42.8%, and urine toxicology was positive for cocaine. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast showed no evidence of free peritoneal air or injury to any solid organs or bones, including the ribs, but did reveal fluid around the spleen, in the left paracolic gutter, and layering in the pelvis (Figures 1, 2, and 3). There was no evidence of active contrast extravasation, no vascular blushes or aneurysms, no findings of portal hypertension, and no suspicion for malignancy. These radiographic findings pointed to a splenic source for hemoperitoneum. Six hours after presenting to the ED, the patient's hematocrit had dropped to 36.6%, and a repeat CT scan revealed a focal collection of fluid surrounding the spleen. Given that the patient remained hemodynamically stable, he was admitted for non-operative management in the surgical intensive care unit, where he had serial abdominal examinations and blood count monitoring.

- **Figure 1**: Axial, contrast-enhanced CT image demonstrates moderate hemoperitoneum in the left upper quadrant centered around the spleen.

- **Figure 2**: Sagittal, contrast-enhanced CT image demonstrates perisplenic hematoma.

- **Figure 3**: Axial, contrast-enhanced CT image of the pelvis demonstrates large hemoperitoneum.

The patient did not require transfusion as his hematocrit remained stable between 36% and 38% throughout his hospital course. During that time, infectious etiologies including Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were ruled out as possible causes.

### Abnormal structure of frontostriatal brain systems is associated with aspects of impulsivity and compulsivity in cocaine dependence [^112amfaE]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Relationships between brain structure and the duration of cocaine use reveal that, overall, cocaine users had significantly increased grey matter volume in subcortical structures, including the caudate nucleus, compared to healthy volunteers. However, a strong negative correlation was found between the duration of cocaine use and grey matter volume in the frontal and cingulate cortex, insula, and caudate. In other words, a greater duration of cocaine use was associated with relatively reduced grey matter volume in these structures.

Like most drugs of abuse, cocaine exerts its pharmacological effects in the ventral striatum. Enlarged striatal structures have been reported previously in chronic cocaine users and methamphetamine users, as well as in individuals with autism and fragile X syndrome. However, the neuropathology underlying this enlargement is not fully understood. The blockade of dopamine D2 receptors by antipsychotic drugs has been shown to increase the volume of basal ganglia structures in both animals and humans, possibly indicating that striatal enlargement is associated with an under-active dopamine system.

It has recently been shown in humans that variation in grey matter volume correlates both positively and negatively with individual differences in the expression of D2-like receptors in various brain regions, including the caudate. Cocaine dependence has also been associated with a significant reduction in striatal dopamine D2 receptor density, along with a significant reduction in dopamine transmission.

### Real-time mobile detection of drug use with wearable biosensors: a pilot study [^112sU4sh]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Reliable detection of illicit drug use is paramount to the field of addiction. However, methods involving self-report and urine drug screens have substantial limitations that hinder their utility. Wearable biosensors may fill this void by providing valuable objective data regarding the timing and contexts of drug use.

This preliminary observational study involves four emergency department patients receiving parenteral opioids and one individual using cocaine in a natural environment. A portable biosensor was placed on the inner wrist of each subject to continuously measure electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and acceleration. Data were continuously recorded for at least five minutes prior to drug administration, during administration, and for at least 30 minutes afterward.

- **Overall trends**:
	- Injection of opioids and cocaine use were associated with rises in EDA.
	- Cocaine injection was also associated with a decrease in skin temperature.
	- Opioid tolerance appeared to be associated with a blunted physiologic response as measured by the biosensor.
	- Laterality may be an important factor, as the magnitude of response varied between dominant and nondominant wrists in a single patient with bilateral wrist measurements.

Changes in EDA and skin temperature are temporally associated with intravenous administration of opioids and cocaine. The intensity of response, however, may vary depending on the history and extent of prior use.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for opioid use disorder, particularly concerning urine drug testing, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining drug testing during the comprehensive assessment process and throughout treatment. This is to monitor patients for adherence to prescribed medications and the use of alcohol, illicit, and controlled substances. The frequency of testing should be determined by several factors, including the stability of the patient, the type of treatment, and the treatment setting.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^114VsEEX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Data are limited to a population of patients seeking health care and may not reflect the general population. Individuals included in the analysis may have had an incomplete or inaccurate medication list, which would result in the inclusion of some subjects expected to be positive for prescribed analytes. The study used a convenience sample, and patient characteristics changed over time. We attempted to account for this variation by modeling sex, age, and health care specialty, given their strong impact on nonprescribed drug positivity. It is possible that these covariates were insufficient to remove all potential confounding and/or selection bias.

- **Other opioids class**: The "other opioids" class of drugs studied includes morphine, which is a potential metabolite of heroin.
- **Health care specialty designation**: The designated health care specialty may include patient populations that would also fit a different specialty, such as patients with co-occurring mental health and SUDs being treated at a behavioral health practice versus a SUD treatment center.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^113N22Qq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Methods: Data: We conducted a cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, based on patient specimens submitted for testing by health care professionals as part of routine care determined by medical necessity. Specimens were collected from health care practices across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. A single specimen for each patient was selected according to the earliest collection date to remove repeated measurements.

The study used a convenience sample of 2 million randomly selected adult patient specimens with test orders for definitive UDT for methamphetamine via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS testing method is a laboratory-developed test with performance characteristics determined by Millennium Health, San Diego, California. This institution is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and accredited by the College of American Pathologists for high-complexity testing. Millennium Health performed all LC-MS/MS testing for the study.

In addition to methamphetamine, the following drugs and/or drug classes were tested for in a subset of patient specimens, with analytes and metabolites tested in parentheses:

- **Stimulants**: cocaine (benzoylecgonine)
- **Opioids**: fentanyl (fentanyl, norfentanyl), heroin (6-MAM), methadone (methadone, EDDP), other opioids (codeine, hydrocodone, norhydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone), buprenorphine (buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine)
- **Depressants**: benzodiazepines (alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, 7-amino-clon)
- **Other substances**: alcohol (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate), marijuana (cTHC)

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^113kqrMc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

To determine methamphetamine positivity and copositivity with other drugs in urine drug test (UDT) results geographically over time, this cross-sectional study analyzed UDT results from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2019. It included patient specimens submitted by health care professionals across the United States. The analysis used LC-MS/MS to detect cocaine, heroin, alcohol, marijuana, and nonprescribed methamphetamine, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, benzodiazepines, and other opioids. Logistic regression evaluated the association of demographic features and modeled yearly methamphetamine detection patterns across US census divisions. Odds ratios (OR) from logistic modeling assessed the impact of methamphetamine positivity on the spatio-temporal detection patterns of additional nonprescribed or illicit drugs.

The probability of testing positive for methamphetamine increased nationally from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, a 340% increase after correcting for demographic covariates. The highest predicted positivity rate was in male patients, 25 to 34 years old, from the West North Central division and substance use disorder treatment centers. Nationally, copositivity ORs for fentanyl, heroin, and other opioids with methamphetamine were highest in 2019. Increases in ORs from 2014 through 2019 were statistically significant for heroin (P = 0.024) and fentanyl (P = 0.0085).

### Examining predictors of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the end of detoxification treatment in women with cocaine use disorder [^113mLCjp]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Low credibility.

Detoxification is frequently recommended as a treatment for moderate to severe cocaine use disorder (CUD). However, the response to detoxification varies among patients, and previous studies have focused mostly on patterns of drug use behavior to test associations with treatment outcomes. This approach overlooks the potential impact of psychosocial factors, other clinical variables, and individual life experiences. In this study, we comprehensively examined several variables aiming to find the most relevant predictors to classify patients with severe versus non-severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms at the end of detoxification.

Data from 284 women with CUD who enrolled in a 3-week detoxification program was used in this longitudinal study. Psychosocial, clinical, and drug use behavior characteristics were evaluated, generating a dataset with 256 potential predictors. We tested six different machine learning classification algorithms.

The best classification algorithm achieved an average accuracy and ROC-AUC of approximately 70%. The 16 features selected as best predictors were the severity of psychiatric, family, and social problems and the level of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Features associated with drug-use behavior included days consuming drugs and having craving symptoms in the last month before treatment, the number of previous drug/alcohol-related treatments, and a composite score of addiction severity. The level of cocaine withdrawal syndrome at the beginning of detoxification was also a key feature for classification. A network analysis revealed…

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^114tg3B4]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

During recent years, cocaine has been reported as the main stimulant used in numerous parts of the world, such as in America, Australia, or Western Europe [2]. Regarding the availability of cocaine worldwide, coca bush cultivation and cocaine manufacture reached an all-time high in 2017 [2]. In the same year, the number of cocaine seizures and the quantity seized in the European Union (EU) reached the highest levels ever recorded, with a surge in the availability of high-purity cocaine for more than a decade [1]. As a consequence, in Western Europe, the stimulant of choice for many people who use drugs — in recent times of moderate purity and sold at varying prices — became an affordable commodity with high purity levels [5].

The increasing availability on the illicit market has been reflected in raising cocaine use prevalence. In 2017, an estimated 18 million people worldwide, or nearly 0.4% of the adult population aged 15–64 years, reported past-year cocaine use. High prevalence of cocaine use was reported in Oceania (2.2%), North America (2.1%), Western and Central Europe (1.3%), and South America (1.0%), and these proportions have increased in recent years [2]. Recent survey data revealed a rise in the last-year prevalence of cocaine use among young adults in some European countries [1]. In 2017, it was estimated that slightly more than 4 million adults (aged 15–64 years) had used the substance in the past year [3]. Between 2010 and 2016, in the WHO European Region, almost all indicators on substance use and attributable mortality decreased.

The study aimed to determine whether cannabinoid-positive urine specimens in heroin-dependent out-patients predict other drug use or impairments in psychosocial functioning, and whether such outcomes are better predicted by cannabis-use disorders than by cannabis use itself. This was investigated through retrospective analyses of three clinical trials, each including a behavioral intervention (contingency management) for cocaine or heroin use during methadone maintenance. The trials lasted 25–29 weeks, with follow-up evaluations occurring 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Data were pooled across trials where appropriate.

The setting was an urban out-patient methadone clinic, and the participants included four hundred and eight polydrug abusers meeting methadone-maintenance criteria. Measurements involved categorizing participants as non-users, occasional users, or frequent users of cannabis based on thrice-weekly qualitative urinalyses. Cannabis-use disorders were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule III-R. Outcome measures included the proportion of cocaine- and opiate-positive urines and the Addiction Severity Index (at intake and follow-ups).

The findings revealed that cannabis use was not associated with retention, use of cocaine or heroin, or any other outcome measure during or after treatment. The analyses had a power of 0.95 to detect an r² of 0.11 between cannabis use and heroin or cocaine use, but the r² detected was less than 0.03 and non-significant. A previous finding, that cannabis use predicted a lapse to heroin use in heroin-abstinent patients, did not replicate in this sample.

### Cocaine use during pregnancy assessed by hair analysis in a Canary Islands cohort [^11536ud1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Determination of drugs of abuse in hair samples was conducted to analyze various substances, including the principal psychotropic drugs and their metabolites. These included 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), morphine, and codeine for opiates; cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BEG), and cocaethylene for cocaine; Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and THC-COOH for cannabinoids; and amphetamine, methamphetamine, and 3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA) for amphetamines.

Immunochemical screening for drugs of abuse in hair was conducted using the Siemens EMIT® II Plus assay for opiates, amphetamines, and ecstasy, and the Microgenics CEDIA® assay for cocaine. All samples with positive results in the screening test (the cut-off values for opiates, amphetamines, ecstasy, cocaine, and THC were 0.20 ng/mg, 0.50 ng/mg, 0.50 ng/mg, 0.20 ng/mg, and 0.50 ng/mg, respectively) for any drug and/or metabolite were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for confirmation and quantitation.

GC/MS analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass-selective detector and a 7673 automatic injector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The limits of quantification in hair were 0.2 ng/mg for 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, and codeine; 0.5 ng/mg for cocaine, BEG, and cocaethylene; 0.1 ng/mg for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; 0.2 pg/mg for THC-COOH; and 0.2 ng/mg for amphetamine, methamphetamine, and MDMA.

### Evaluation of abnormal urine drug screens among patients with chronic non-malignant pain treated with opioids [^116zfY97]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Opioids are commonly used in chronic pain management. Their role in chronic pain is met with controversy, with reports of abuse. Many studies have shown that urine drug screens can detect inappropriate opioid use or illicit drug use among patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. In this study, failed urine drug screens of 89 patients in an interventional pain management practice were analyzed. The results showed that 55% were not taking the prescribed opioid, whereas 39% were taking opioids which were not prescribed. Additionally, 46% of the patients were using illicit drugs. Urine drug screens can be very useful in preventing opioid abuse. Along with illicit drug use, not taking the opioid as prescribed or taking other opioids which are not prescribed can also be detected.

### General anaesthesia for the cocaine abusing patient. Is it safe [^116xKjBU]? British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Commonly, patients abusing cocaine are scheduled for elective surgery with a positive urine test for cocaine metabolites. As many of these patients were clinically non-toxic, with normal arterial pressure, heart rate, normothermic condition, and a normal (or unchanged from previous) ECG, including a QTc interval of less than 500 ms, we have recently proceeded with elective surgery requiring general anaesthesia in this patient group.

- **Methods**: Forty urine cocaine-positive patients were compared with an equal number of drug-free controls in a prospective, non-randomized, blinded analysis. Intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure, ST segment analysis, heart rate, and body temperature were recorded and compared.

- **Results**: Cardiovascular stability during and after general anaesthesia in cocaine-positive, non-toxic patients was not significantly different when compared with an age and ASA matched drug-free control group.

- **Conclusions**: These results demonstrate that the non-toxic cocaine-abusing patient can be administered general anaesthesia with no greater risk than comparable age and ASA matched drug-free patients.

### Estimates of illicit drug use during pregnancy by maternal interview, hair analysis, and meconium analysis [^114j3mSU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The study aims to compare the sensitivity and specificity of maternal interview, maternal hair analysis, and meconium analysis in detecting perinatal exposure to cocaine, opiate, and cannabinoid.

- **Design/methods**: The use of cocaine, opiate, and cannabinoid during pregnancy was determined prospectively in 58 women by three methods: structured maternal interview, maternal hair analysis, and meconium analyses. The results of these methods were compared with one another.

- **Results**: The maternal interview showed the lowest sensitivity in detecting cocaine and opiate exposures (65% and 67%, respectively), but it had the highest sensitivity in detecting cannabinoid exposure (58%). Both hair and meconium analyses had high sensitivity for detecting cocaine or opiate exposures. Hair analysis achieved a sensitivity of 100% for cocaine and 80% for opiate detection. However, it had a false-positive rate of 13% for cocaine and 20% for opiate, probably as a result of passive exposure. Meconium analysis had a sensitivity of 87% for cocaine and 77% for opiate detection, but unlike hair analysis, it had no false-positive test results for cocaine. Both hair and meconium analyses had low sensitivity in detecting cannabinoid exposure (21%-22.7%), most likely due to the sporadic use of cannabinoid.

- **Conclusion**: Meconium and hair analyses showed the highest sensitivities for detecting perinatal use of cocaine and opiate, but not for cannabinoid. The principal drawback of hair analysis is its potential for false-positive test results associated with passive exposure to drugs. Maternal interview, on the other hand, is a time-con.

### Lybalvi [^114xFbRY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Interference with laboratory tests for opioid detection**: Lybalvi may cause false positive results with urinary immunoassay methods used for detecting opioids. Use an alternative analytical technique, such as chromatographic methods, to confirm positive opioid urine drug screen results [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Cocaine hydrochloride [^116XQkJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine is primarily metabolized and inactivated through non-enzymatic ester hydrolysis and hepatic carboxylesterase, as well as plasma cholinesterase, hepatic carboxylesterase, and CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The pharmacokinetics of cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity have not been studied.

Genetic abnormalities of plasma cholinesterase, such as those in patients who are heterozygous or homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene, and conditions like malignant tumors, severe liver or kidney disease, decompensated heart disease, infections, burns, anemia, peptic ulcer, myxedema, or physiological states such as pregnancy, may lead to reduced plasma cholinesterase activity. Patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity may experience reduced clearance and increased exposure to plasma cocaine after administration of cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution.

Since cocaine is metabolized by multiple enzymes, the impact of reduced plasma cholinesterase activity on cocaine exposure may be limited. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution is needed for patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity. However, it is essential to monitor these patients for adverse reactions such as headache, epistaxis, and clinically relevant increases in heart rate or blood pressure.

### Contrave extended-release [^113AdyXf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Drug-laboratory test interactions: False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion due to the lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may occur even following the discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will differentiate bupropion from amphetamines.

### Cocaine use during pregnancy assessed by hair analysis in a Canary Islands cohort [^114WgvAR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

The mean age of the 347 mothers was 30 years. Seventeen percent were migrants, 85% from South America. With respect to the level of schooling, 29% had a university degree and 22% had only primary schooling. Regarding obstetric history, 49% were at their first pregnancy, and 22% had previous spontaneous abortions.

- **Parental socioeconomic and demographic characteristics**: In relation to results obtained by hair analysis, parental ethnicity and maternal or paternal socioeconomic status were not associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. However, cocaine use appeared to be more prevalent in Spanish mothers with unskilled jobs. Exposure to cocaine during pregnancy was associated with a significantly higher percentage of active tobacco smoking fathers and the presence of other smokers at home. There were no false negatives in our study population when comparing biomarkers to questionnaires (admission of substance misuse). Finally, cocaine use during pregnancy was associated with antidepressants use.

- **Concentration levels of drugs of abuse in hair from pregnant women**: Of the 347 maternal hair samples (minimum 3 cm long), 9 (2.6%) were positive for cocaine and/or BEG, its principal metabolite. All the samples were negative for other drugs of abuse, including cannabis, amphetamines, methamphetamines, opiates, and MDMA.

### Agreement between self-reports and urine toxicology measures of illicit methamphetamine and cocaine use during early pregnancy [^1126ehpU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This study aimed to assess the agreement between self-report and urine toxicology measures used to assess the use of two illicit stimulants (methamphetamine and cocaine) during early pregnancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 203,053 pregnancies from 169,709 individuals receiving prenatal care at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019. The study assessed agreement (κ, sensitivity, and specificity) between self-reported frequency and urine toxicology measures of methamphetamine and cocaine early in pregnancy.

Prenatal use of the illicit stimulants was rare, according to toxicology (n = 244 [0.12%]) and self-report measures (n = 294 [0.14%]). Agreement between these measures was low (κ 99%), reflecting t

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: Observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^116pgQf4]. Addiction (2021). Low credibility.

The participating countries agreed to share aggregated data from their national monitoring registers for the years 2011 to 2018 to perform trend analysis. To ensure harmonization and robust trend data, countries with less comprehensive national coverage or those who encountered technical changes over time in their TDI monitoring register were requested to provide data collected among a subgroup of centers that have consistently provided stable and reliable data over the years. Otherwise, the TDI data set providing yearly data for all centers included in their TDI monitoring was used. TDI gathers information on the primary and adjunctive substances of use at treatment admission and demographic data and information concerning the treatment history of the client.

Data on the total number of clients in treatment for substance use, the number of clients in treatment for cocaine as the primary substance, and cocaine as a primary or secondary drug were collected. A distinction was also made between the treatment episodes of the specific substances (powder cocaine and crack) and between patients treated previously or for the first time for drug addiction.

The proportion of clients entering treatment for cocaine as a primary substance or as a primary/adjunctive substance between 2011 and 2018 was calculated separately. Proportions were calculated for clients entering treatment for the first time in their life as well as for all clients entering treatment (first-time plus previously treated). The proportion of clients reporting the use of cocaine was used in preference to absolute numbers.

### Cocaine hydrochloride [^111LLHRj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution contains cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

- **Abuse**: GOPRELTO contains cocaine, a substance with a high potential for abuse. Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution can be misused and abused, which can lead to addiction. It may also be diverted for abuse purposes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- Drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use. This includes a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal. Drug abuse of a substance may occur without progression to drug addiction. "Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders.

	- Drug abuse and addiction are conditions that are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance [see Dependence (9.3)]. Health care providers should be aware that abuse and addiction may occur in the absence of symptoms indicative of physical dependence and tolerance.

	- Individuals who abuse stimulants may use cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution for abuse purposes. Adverse events associated with the abuse of cocaine include euphoria, excitation, irritability, restlessness, and anxiety.

### Spectrum of acute kidney injury associated with cocaine use: Report of three cases [^11125oAZ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The deliberate and harmful use of cocaine is currently prevalent worldwide and constitutes a significant public health problem. Despite a drop in cocaine users between 2007 and 2014, the prevalence of users remained significant, with about 18.3 million users worldwide in 2014. In Brazil, the prevalence of consumption is in the hundreds of thousands, positioning it as one of the main countries in the total use of the substance. There is a notable increase in cocaine consumption, despite a reduction in consumption in the United States and relative stability in Europe. The increasing commercialization of cocaine in areas of socioeconomic fragility with limited access to rehabilitation systems is one of the reasons for this rise.

The consequences of cocaine use are multisystemic. For instance, they include renal failure, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity, with renal alterations being the focus of the present study. The use of substances that modify the base composition of cocaine (or adulterants) to potentiate its effects also impacts these manifestations.

This study reports three cases involving different diagnoses of acute kidney injury related to cocaine use.

### Utility of urine drug testing in outpatient addiction evaluations [^113w2UnT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of urine drug testing in addiction settings for accurately establishing diagnoses and informing treatment. Data in this area is limited. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the utility of performing urine drug testing in patients presenting for an outpatient addiction assessment.

- **Methods**: Urine drug testing and patient-reported substance use history were obtained from the medical records of patients who presented for an outpatient addiction evaluation. Patients who denied use of a substance within the window of detection but tested positive were considered to have misrepresented their use. Differences between patients accurately representing versus misrepresenting their use were evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity of drug tests were calculated from self-reports, and changes to treatment recommendations and diagnoses were assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 174 patients (mean age = 43.35 ± 15.68 years) were included, with the majority being male (67%). Ninety-four (54%) patients reported use of a substance within the window of detection. Of 80 patients denying recent use, 14 tested positive (8%). There were no differences in sex (P = 0.78) or age (P = 0.12); however, referral sources differed significantly between correct and incorrect responders (P = 0.01). Specificity varied between 96% and 99%, while sensitivity had a wider range (17%-87%). Treatment recommendations and diagnoses were altered after review of drug testing results in 1 patient (0.5%). In the remainder, all patients were already diagnosed with a severe substance use disorder.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: An evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^116s93S5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A logistic regression model of methamphetamine detection, which includes collection year, US census division, sex, age, and health care specialty as explanatory factors, was highly significant (X² = 121,595, df = 64, LRT P < 2.2e-16, McFadden Pseudo-R² = 0.81). The marginal predicted probability of testing positive for methamphetamine increased from 0.010 [0.010–0.011] in 2014 to 0.044 [0.042–0.046] in 2019, representing a 340% increase in total US methamphetamine positivity over six years. Notably, predicted detection ranged from 0.064 [0.062–0.066] for the West North Central division to 0.007 [0.006–0.008] for the New England division, indicating a wide range of geographical methamphetamine positivity during the study period. Age significantly impacted methamphetamine positivity, with 25- to 34-year-old patients showing the highest predicted positivity. Males were found to have a slightly higher methamphetamine positivity rate than females; however, this was not significant. Patient specimens from SUD treatment centers had the highest predicted positivity (0.050 [0.049–0.051]), while OB/GYN specimens had the lowest (0.008 [0.008–0.009]).

- **Logistic regression results for methamphetamine detection**: The interaction term for collection year and census division in the model was found to be significant, leading to an evaluation of the predicted methamphetamine detection probabilities across divisions and years. The significant interaction suggests that not all divisions are changing at the same rate. For example, positivity in the East South Central division…

### Cocaine hydrochloride [^1123Z8ZA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Seizures**: Cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution may lower the convulsive threshold. Monitor patients for the development of seizures.
	- **Blood pressure and heart rate increases**: Monitor vital signs, including heart rate and rhythm, in patients after receiving cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution. Avoid its use in patients with a recent or active history of uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure.

- **Potential for abuse and dependence**: Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, including cocaine hydrochloride, have a high potential for abuse and dependence [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].

- **Seizures**: It has been reported in the literature that cocaine hydrochloride may lower the convulsive threshold. The risk may be higher in patients with a history of seizures or in patients with prior electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities without seizures. However, it has been reported in patients with no prior history or EEG evidence of seizures. Monitor patients for the development of seizures.

- **Blood pressure and heart rate increases**: As reported in the literature, cocaine hydrochloride causes an increase in observed blood pressure and heart rate. In the Phase 3 clinical study with cocaine hydrochloride nasal solution, increases in blood pressure and heart rate were observed for 60 minutes or longer following pledget removal. Monitor for vital sign changes, including heart rate and rhythm, after administration.

### A positive cocaine urine toxicology test and the effect on intraoperative hemodynamics under general anesthesia [^1127BPTh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

Cocaine has a short biological half-life, but inactive urine metabolites may be detectable for a week following use. It is unclear if patients who test positive for cocaine but have a normal electrocardiogram and vital signs have a greater percentage of hemodynamic events intraoperatively.

- **Methods**: A total of 328 patients with a history of cocaine use who were scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were categorized into cocaine-positive versus cocaine-negative groups based on the results of their urine cocaine toxicology test. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events, defined as (1) a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 105 mm Hg and (2) a heart rate (HR) of 100 beats per minute (bpm), compared to cocaine-negative patients. The study was powered to assess if the two groups had an equivalent mean percent of intraoperative hemodynamic events within specific limits using an equivalence test of means consisting of two one-sided tests.

- **Results**: The cocaine-positive group had a blood pressure (BP) that was outside the set limits 19.4% (standard deviation [SD] 17.7%) of the time versus 23.1% (SD 17.7%) in the cocaine-negative group (95% confidence interval, 0.5–7.0). The cocaine-positive group had a HR outside the set limits 9.6% (SD 16.2%) of the time versus 8.2% (SD 14.9%) in the cocaine-negative group (95% CI, 4.3–1.5).

These results were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.

### The clinical impact of a false-positive urine cocaine screening result on a patient's pain management [^113LWzsZ]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The urine of a patient admitted for chest and epigastric pain tested positive for cocaine using an immunoassay-based drug screening method (positive/negative cutoff concentration 150 ng/mL). Despite the patient's denial of recent cocaine use, this positive cocaine screening result, in conjunction with a remote history of drug misuse, impacted the patient's recommended pain therapy. Specifically, these factors prompted the clinical team to question the appropriateness of opioids and other potentially addictive therapeutics during the treatment of cancer pain from previously undetected advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

Following a pain management and clinical pathology consultation, it was decided that the positive cocaine screening result should be confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) testing. This more sensitive and specific analytical technique revealed that both cocaine and its primary metabolite benzoylecgonine were undetectable (i.e. less than the assay detection limit of 50 ng/mL), thus indicating that the positive urine screening result was falsely positive. With this confirmation, the pain management service team was reassured in offering intrathecal pump (ITP) therapy for pain control. ITP implantation was well tolerated, and the patient eventually achieved excellent pain relief. However, ITP therapy most likely would not have been utilized without the GC-MS confirmation testing unless alternative options failed and extensive vigilant monitoring was initiated.
