## Question

Sound classification & management after repairing an orbital floor blowout fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sound classification and management after repairing an orbital floor blowout fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why classification matters for decision-making. Then, I should verify the most authoritative classification frameworks and how they guide urgency and indications. Next, I will examine timing thresholds and the strength of evidence for early versus delayed repair. After that, I need to check surgical approaches, implant choices, and intraoperative verification steps. Finally, I will review postoperative monitoring, complication prevention, and special scenarios like pediatric trapdoor fractures and combined injuries, and I will synthesize a practical algorithm with explicit risk stratification and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why classification is foundational. Orbital floor blowout fractures are typically isolated, rim-sparing injuries with potential for diplopia, enophthalmos, and ocular motility restriction; classification helps determine urgency, timing, approach, and implant selection, and it standardizes communication across ophthalmology, otolaryngology, maxillofacial surgery, and radiology [^05365a16] [^dc3376bc].

> I will now examine the most authoritative classification framework. The Adult Strabismus Preferred Practice Pattern distinguishes three functional categories: trap-door with muscle entrapment, trap-door with incarcerated tissue, and depressed fragment; this morphology-based scheme directly informs timing and prognosis, with muscle entrapment requiring emergent release to prevent ischemic injury and fibrosis, and incarcerated tissue or depressed fragments typically managed within 1–2 weeks if symptomatic or large [^018ba0e5] [^acc14ffd].

> Wait, let me verify the timing evidence so I don't overstate urgency. Multiple series and a meta-analysis show that repair within about 2 weeks improves odds of complete recovery, reduces persistent diplopia, and lowers enophthalmos risk; for trap-door with incarcerated tissue, outcomes are better when repaired within about 8 days, and for true muscle entrapment, immediate surgery is advised to mitigate ischemia and fibrosis [^10703d40] [^acc14ffd] [^018ba0e5].

> Hold on, I should verify the quantitative thresholds that trigger surgery. Large defects involving more than 50% of the orbital floor or greater than about 1 cm², and volume increases exceeding roughly 1.3 cm³, predict higher risks of enophthalmos and diplopia and favor early repair; the Orbital Index, incorporating size, location, and inferior rectus rounding, provides a reproducible score with a threshold of 4 or higher that stratifies risk for delayed enophthalmos and supports operative planning [^da205cd9] [^54ca4ac4] [^3b243e47].

> Next, I should review surgical approaches and implant choices, and I need to ensure I weigh scar and complication risks. The transconjunctival approach is preferred for isolated floor fractures due to low ectropion risk and absence of a visible scar, while the transcaruncular approach facilitates combined floor and medial wall repairs; endoscopic transmaxillary approaches can aid visualization and reduce eyelid complications in select cases, and implant selection spans titanium mesh, porous polyethylene, and bioresorbable materials, with no clear superiority for motility outcomes but with trade-offs in rigidity, integration, and infection risk [^fbfa3cbc] [^6445ba4d] [^a6e33f35] [^2794d5df].

> I should double-check intraoperative verification steps because persistent diplopia is often preventable. Forced duction testing before and after implant placement is essential to confirm release of restriction and avoid implant impingement; implant sizing and positioning should restore orbital volume without overcorrection or posterior protrusion toward the apex, and using reliable landmarks such as the superior posterior wall of the maxillary sinus helps ensure accurate posterior placement and avoid optic nerve injury [^714e05d8] [^8bb1c1b7] [^42fa8edd].

> Let me consider postoperative management and complication surveillance, and I need to ensure I don't miss vision-threatening events. Overnight observation is reasonable in many centers given the rare but catastrophic risk of retrobulbar hemorrhage, which occurs in about 1–3% and is more likely with delayed repair, larger preoperative enophthalmos, and anticoagulation; patients should be educated to return urgently for pain, proptosis, or vision loss, and protocols for emergent lateral canthotomy and orbital decompression should be in place [^dd11df13] [^4ff462fd] [^3064cfce].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child with a trapdoor fracture and minimal external signs. Pediatric trapdoor or "white-eyed" blowout fractures can present with nausea, bradycardia, or syncope from the oculocardiac reflex and require emergent release of entrapped tissue; delayed repair risks ischemic muscle injury and permanent diplopia, so I should maintain a low threshold for urgent surgery in this phenotype even when the eye looks deceptively quiet [^018ba0e5] [^fbe25d4b] [^360ffbf2].

> I should confirm how to handle combined injuries and complex patterns. When orbital floor fractures accompany zygomaticomaxillary complex or naso-orbito-ethmoidal injuries, orbital floor exploration is often performed at the time of fracture reduction, with implant placement guided by defect size, fragment position, and muscle rounding; endoscopic or transcaruncular approaches can facilitate medial wall and floor visualization in these settings, and sequencing should prioritize restoring outer facial buttresses before finalizing orbital reconstruction [^071f252d] [^6445ba4d] [^5211f2b6].

> Let me reconsider nonoperative management so I don't overcall surgery. Observation is appropriate for small defects without diplopia in primary or downgaze, minimal enophthalmos, and good motility; prisms, occlusion, or botulinum toxin can temporize diplopia, and many cases resolve spontaneously, though persistent restrictive strabismus or enophthalmos beyond 2–3 months may benefit from delayed repair or secondary augmentation [^6f0cbf36] [^018ba0e5].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision algorithm, and I should ensure it aligns with the evidence. Emergent repair is indicated for muscle entrapment with nonresolving oculocardiac reflex, globe displacement into the sinus, or compartment syndromes; urgent repair within about 8 days is advised for trap-door with incarcerated tissue; early repair within about 2 weeks is indicated for symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions or entrapment, large defects, early enophthalmos or hypoglobus, or progressive infraorbital hypesthesia; elective repair after 2 weeks is reasonable for persistent diplopia or enophthalmos, recognizing diminishing returns and greater technical difficulty with delay [^018ba0e5] [^10703d40] [^acc14ffd].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and counseling are explicit. Patients should have serial exams for diplopia, enophthalmos, motility, and infraorbital nerve function, with CT reserved for persistent symptoms or suspected implant issues; long-term vigilance for delayed implant-related inflammation or infection is warranted, particularly with nonabsorbable materials, and any new proptosis, pain, or erythema warrants imaging and prompt evaluation [^d8952d12] [^9807987b].

Orbital floor blowout fractures are classified by **size, location, and tissue entrapment** [^dc3376bc] [^05365a16], which guide management: **immediate surgery** for muscle entrapment or oculocardiac reflex [^018ba0e5], **early repair within 2 weeks** for large defects, persistent diplopia, or enophthalmos risk [^10703d40] [^86dd44c3], and **observation** for small, asymptomatic defects. Post-repair, monitor for diplopia, enophthalmos, implant complications, and infection [^714e05d8]; manage persistent diplopia with prisms or strabismus surgery [^6f0cbf36], and treat complications promptly to preserve vision and function [^3dc007b3].

---

## Classification of orbital floor blowout fractures

Classification is essential for **predicting outcomes and planning treatment** [^7a4eb6ed]. Key parameters include:

- **Size and extent**: Small (< 50% of floor) vs large (> 50% or > 1 cm²) [^da205cd9] [^3afbc7dd].
- **Location**: Medial, lateral, or central floor involvement [^2d820a2f].
- **Tissue entrapment**: Muscle or soft-tissue incarceration [^dc3376bc].
- **Fracture pattern**: Trap-door (greenstick) vs depressed fragment [^acc14ffd].

---

## Indications for surgical repair

Surgical repair is indicated based on **clinical and radiographic findings**:

| **Indication** | **Clinical features** | **Radiographic features** |
|-|-|-|
| Immediate surgery | - Muscle entrapment with restricted motility <br/> - Nonresolving oculocardiac reflex (bradycardia, nausea, syncope) <br/> - Globe displacement into sinus | - Inferior rectus entrapment on CT [^018ba0e5] [^dc3376bc] |
| Early surgery (within 2 weeks) | - Persistent diplopia in primary gaze <br/> - Enophthalmos > 2 mm <br/> - Large defect (> 50% of floor or > 1 cm²) <br/> - Progressive infraorbital nerve hypesthesia | - Large floor defect <br/> - Significant volume increase <br/> - Inferior rectus rounding/displacement [^86dd44c3] [^54ca4ac4] |
| Observation | - Small, asymptomatic defect <br/> - Minimal diplopia not in primary gaze <br/> - No enophthalmos | - Small defect (< 50% of floor) <br/> - No tissue entrapment [^018ba0e5] [^dc3376bc] |

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

Timing significantly affects outcomes: **immediate surgery** is required for entrapment or oculocardiac reflex to prevent ischemia and fibrosis [^018ba0e5] [^360ffbf2], whereas **early repair within 2 weeks** improves recovery of motility and reduces diplopia and enophthalmos [^10703d40] [^acc14ffd]. Delayed repair (> 2 weeks) is reserved for persistent symptoms or late enophthalmos, though outcomes may be less favorable [^018ba0e5] [^3afbc7dd].

---

## Surgical techniques and materials

Common approaches include **transconjunctival** (preferred for low ectropion risk) [^fbfa3cbc], **subciliary** (higher ectropion risk) [^ab0eb94b], and **endoscopic** (improved visualization, hidden incision) [^a6e33f35]. Implants include titanium mesh, porous polyethylene, and bioresorbable materials; selection depends on defect size, location, and surgeon preference [^2794d5df] [^d4dfd299].

---

## Postoperative management and complications

Postoperative care focuses on **monitoring and complication prevention**:

- **Diplopia**: Common initially; persistent cases may need prisms or strabismus surgery [^f5622e2d] [^6f0cbf36].
- **Enophthalmos**: Usually corrected with accurate implant placement; persistent cases may need secondary augmentation [^714e05d8] [^adc49fd9].
- **Implant complications**: Rare infection, extrusion, or migration; delayed inflammation can occur with porous polyethylene [^d8952d12] [^9807987b].
- **Visual complications**: Rare retrobulbar hemorrhage or optic neuropathy; early recognition and decompression are critical [^4ff462fd] [^3064cfce].

---

## Long-term outcomes and follow-up

Long-term outcomes are generally favorable with appropriate timing and technique, though **persistent diplopia** occurs in 7–24% and may require strabismus surgery [^ae3a4cac]. Regular follow-up should assess diplopia, enophthalmos, implant position, and visual function, with CT reserved for persistent symptoms or suspected complications [^notfound].

---

Orbital floor blowout fractures are managed by **classifying size, location, and entrapment** to guide timing and technique, with early surgery for entrapment or large defects and observation for small, asymptomatic injuries. Post-repair care targets diplopia, enophthalmos, and implant-related issues to optimize functional and aesthetic outcomes.

### A consecutive case review of orbital blowout fractures and recommendations for comprehensive management [^ee31240c]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The orbital blowout fracture is a common facial injury, but full consensus has not been reached regarding its optimal management. The authors retrospectively explored consecutive cases of blowout fractures and proposed new recommendations for treatment.

Methods

Two hundred eight newly registered patients were selected from the database of Nagasaki University Hospital over the past 5 years. One hundred nine patients in the authors' department were then reviewed regarding computed tomographic classification of fracture types, preoperative complaints, and outcomes.

Results

Of the 208 patients reviewed, 43 underwent surgical repair: 37 for diplopia and 14 for enophthalmos, including eight patients who were treated for both conditions. Regarding floor fractures, the punched-out type fracture was the most common, but the burst type was associated with the highest likelihood of undergoing surgery. For medial wall fractures, the punched-out type dominated, but the overall operative incidence was lower than that observed for the floor fractures. For diplopia, more than half of the operations were performed within 2 weeks, but only two cases were performed within 3 days. For enophthalmos, over 60 percent of operations were carried out after 1 month. Two cases, later discovered to involve muscle strangulation, continued to demonstrate residual diplopia in ordinary use, and two patients continued to show enophthalmos. However, overall outcomes were considered satisfactory.

Conclusions

If computed tomographic findings disclose a linear fracture with muscular strangulation, urgent surgery must be performed. However, for linear fractures without impaction of the muscle, or punched-out or burst type fractures, close observation for days may be appropriate. In addition, surgical intervention can be performed electively when diplopia persists for several days of observation.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^7a4eb6ed]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fractures of the orbit are common and challenging to manage. They deserve special consideration because surgical or observational management may result in compromise to vision and/or globe position. Most orbital fractures occur in males in their second decade of life. In adults, motor vehicle accidents and assault are the most common mechanisms of injury.–However, in pediatric patients falls and sports-related injuries are more common. Orbital fractures are often broadly referred to as "blowout" fractures; however, not all orbital fractures are isolated orbital injuries. Orbital fractures may be isolated, or combined, with other nonorbital injuries (head, neck, and spine). Many maxillofacial injures involve the orbit, eg: 1) Le Fort II and III fractures, 2) zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures, and 3) nasoorbitoethmoid fractures.

Most surgeons describe the orbital fracture according to the location within the orbit (floor, medial wall, lateral wall, and roof). However, this simplifies the often complex nature of these fractures. Several classification schemes have been proposed to define isolated, multiwalled, and comminuted orbital fractures, as well as, soft tissue displacement.–Essentially, having a classification scheme will improve intersurgeon communication, provide guidelines for surgical management (indications and timing), and establish a standard for research.

Conceptually, management of these injuries has changed little over the years. However, advances in maxillofacial/orbital imaging, introduction of intraoperative navigation systems, better evidence-based surgical indications and timing, and improved implant designs have led to a reappraisal of time-honored techniques and guidance. Although treatment considerations for orbital roof and medial wall fractures will be discussed, this review will primarily focus on challenges and solutions for orbital floor fractures.

### The evolution of research on orbital floor fractures: a bibliometric analysis [^4b3f6804]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Orbital floor fractures present complex functional and aesthetic challenges for surgeons. A review of the most influential literature in this area can help clinicians gain a deeper understanding of current research trends and inform evidence-based treatment strategies.

Methods

The Clarivate Web of Science database was used to identify the 50 most-cited articles on orbital fractures. A bibliometric analysis was conducted to assess publication metrics, including authorship, year of publication, level of evidence classification, and country of origin, as well as to identify emerging research topics.

Results

The top 50 most-cited articles, published between 1957 and 2017, accumulated a total of 5618 citations. "Clinical Recommendations for Repair of Isolated Orbital Floor Fractures-An Evidence-based Analysis" by Burnstine received the highest number of citations (n = 294), followed by "Nonsurgical Management of Blow-out Fractures of Orbital Floor" (n = 211) by Putterman and colleagues, and "Intervention Within Days for Some Orbital Floor Fractures: The White-eyed Blowout" (n = 200) by Jordan and colleagues. Ellis authored the highest number of studies (n = 3), and the United States led in publication output (n = 23).

Conclusion

Bibliometric analysis of influential research on orbital fractures helps clinicians navigate the extensive body of literature on the subject. Furthermore, understanding key research trends enables clinicians to refine their clinical practices and stay informed about evolving research trends.

### Linear-type orbital floor fracture with or without muscle involvement [^6f02b69e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The indications for surgical repair of the orbital blowout fracture are controversial. One reason may be case variation among fracture types. We therefore focused on linear-type blowout fractures in this study. The study included 22 consecutive patients with linear-type floor fractures. Demographics, clinical and computed tomographic (CT) findings, surgical timing, postoperative course, and outcome were evaluated. Surgery was performed in 14 patients with diplopia but not enophthalmos. Five patients with severe vertical diplopia were defined as "missing rectus" by CT findings. Residual diplopia remained in 2 patients with "missing rectus", whereas the other 20 patients completely recovered eye motility. In the 9 patients without muscle entrapment, diplopia disappeared within 4 weeks after operation. However, recovery in patients with "missing rectus" took more than 1 month. Thus, the CT finding with or without muscle involvement was crucial for the linear-type blowout fractures. A comprehensive and timely decision based on clinical and radiologic findings is indispensable for satisfactory management as well as postoperative rehabilitation.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^2894e8ff]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

No specific report has been issued on the risk factors of postoperative RBH, but some have provided descriptions of prominent features in the patients. In a series of 189 orbital floor fractures, Gosau et al. reported that among 6 patients that developed RBH, three were taking anticoagulants. A multisurgeon series on orbitotomy (n = 1665) reported that one of 4 patients that lost visual acuity due to RBH had continued aspirin immediately before and after surgery. In the present study, all anticoagulant agents were stopped for a suitable period before surgery. Considering the risk of RBH, it is important to advise patients to stop any noncrucial anticoagulants before blowout fracture repair.

Extensive destruction of the orbital floor associated with complex midface fracture is another reported feature of postoperative RBH. In general, extensive fractures are the result of more forceful injury mechanisms and may result in more severe cranial nerve and direct muscle injuries and more soft tissue edema. But no difference in fracture size was observed between our two study groups. Since this study excluded complex facial fractures, it is thought that different results from the previous reports came out.

Regarding time between injury and surgery, despite surgical difficulties with soft tissue edema, many surgeons advocate repair of facial fractures as soon as possible after injury to optimize aesthetic outcomes. Recently, Scawn RL et al. reported similar complication rates and good results for early and late orbital fracture repairs. However, several reports suggest that late repairs (beyond 2 to 3 months) result in poorer outcomes, but series were relatively small (n = 20, 145, 51 respectively) and no RBH event was reported. In our study, time from injury to surgery was greater in the RBH group. Despite conflicting reports on the topic, late repair of orbital fractures is technically more challenging due to scarring and adhesion of orbital soft tissues at fracture site, which may increase the risk of RBH. Generally, 3 weeks after trauma, nasal mucosa on sinus and orbital periosteum adhere to each other and are often difficult to dissect. Moreover, excessive handling often causes bleeding and requires additional manipulation to achieve hemostasis.

### Current guidelines and opinions in the management of orbital floor fractures [^da205cd9]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Orbital floor fractures are a common manifestation of facial trauma that is encountered by ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and oral maxillofacial specialists. Surgical intervention is required emergently in cases of tissue entrapment and less urgently in cases of presenting with persistent diplopia, enophthalmos greater than 2 mm, and/or fractures involving greater than 50% of the orbital floor. Surgical management is a debated topic with differing opinions among surgeons regarding timing of repair, type of implant, and surgical approach.

The first and most important goal in treating zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures is to reduce the fracture. The zygomatic bone plays an important role in defining the height and width of the midface, so failure to recognize and treat this fracture can lead to cosmetic deformity. The complexity of the surgical repair will depend on the degree of fracture displacement and comminution, so the radiologist's report should include these points (Fig. 11 c–e).

The extent of orbital involvement will also determine surgical treatment because increased orbital volume is the most common cause of posttraumatic enophthalmos. When more than 50% of the orbital floor is affected, open reconstruction will probably be necessary.

Anyway, these fractures are different than simple orbital blow-out fractures, when considering the size of the floor fragment on pre-surgical CT: when ZMC fractures displaced with internal rotation/malar retrusion are reduced, the defect size must be taken together with the possibility that the defect will further expand with eventually a worsening of the future enophthalmos.

Finally, it is also important to take the status of the orbital apex into account. When the lateral orbital wall is displaced medially, apex involvement is more likely and consequently damage to carotid arteries and cranial nerves (CN) II–VI in the superior orbital fissure is more likely.

Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures can be displaced due to rotational forces on the zygomatic bone from the masseter muscle; in these cases, if the infratemporal fossa is occupied, patients may have difficulties chewing.

### Clinical recommendations for repair of isolated orbital floor fractures: an evidence-based analysis [^86dd44c3]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the quality of information in the literature and suggest guidelines for repair of isolated orbital floor fractures.

Clinical Relevance

Orbital floor fractures are a common result of orbital injury. Enophthalmos, diplopia resulting from extraocular muscle dysfunction, and infraorbital nerve hypesthesia may occur. The indications and timing for fracture repair are still controversial.

Literature Reviewed

A MEDLINE literature review was performed using PubMed. Articles published from 1983 to the present were retrieved using the key words, "orbital floor fracture, orbital trap-door fracture, and orbital blow-out fracture". Suggested indications and timing for repair of isolated orbital floor fractures were extracted from selected articles. Each recommendation was rated according to its importance in the care process and strength of evidence supporting the given recommendation.

Results

No prospective randomized clinical trials on the treatment of orbital floor fractures have been performed. Despite this, most recommendations were rated as most important to patient care (A) and had strong support for treatment (level I).

Conclusions

The timing and treatment indications for orbital floor fractures are evolving. Nonresolving oculocardiac reflex, the "white-eyed" blowout fracture, and early enophthalmos or hypoglobus are indications for immediate surgical repair. Surgery within 2 weeks is recommended in cases of symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions and evidence of orbital soft tissue entrapment on computed tomography examination or large orbital floor fractures that may cause latent enophthalmos or hypo-ophthalmos.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^ee10231b]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is essential to use shared terminology to refer to the pattern of facial fractures in radiology reports. Descriptors such as naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex, zygomaticomaxillary complex, and orbital "blowout" can be extremely useful for surgeons, so they should be used when possible. Surgeons require information about the anatomic landmarks and features of the fracture such as the degree of displacement and comminution so they can plan treatment and predict possible complications.

Pathophysiology

Many hypotheses have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of the "blowout" fracture. One of the oldest is the bone-conduction theory, which suggests that a force, not powerful enough to fracture the rim, will propagate along the bone to fracture the weaker orbital floor (Le Fort). Pfeiffer proposed the "Globe-to-Wall Theory", which is when a force pushes the globe into the orbit and causes the globe to contact the orbital floor, resulting in a floor fracture. A similar and more popular theory is the "hydraulic mechanism", whereby the fracture is the result of increased intra-orbital pressure from the eye entering the orbit and not due to direct contact. The cause is likely a conglomeration or some iteration of all three.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^ecc7cf72]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

The institutional review board of the Yeungnam university medical center approved this study (YUMC 2018–11–010), which was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients treated between January 2008 and December 2016 were eligible for inclusion.

The operation database of the Yeungnam university medical center was searched for orbital wall fracture repair operative codes to identify patients who had undergone blowout fracture repair. Medical records were screened by chart review to identify patients that had experienced solely blowout fracture repair; patients that underwent blowout fracture repair combined another repair of facial bone were excluded. All operations were performed by one surgeon (JH Son) at a single center.

Data collection included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture location, and time elapsed between injury and surgical repair. Preoperative and postoperative clinical findings collected included visual acuity, presence of diplopia, eye motility, and exophthalmometry using a Hertel exophthalmometer. Need for muscle surgery or prisms and postoperative complications were also recorded. All patients taking anticoagulants prior to surgery were checked for medications, and then, after appropriate counselling, medications were discontinued for as long as necessary. In this study, we defined RBH as a posterior orbital hemorrhagic condition requiring additional intervention rather than routine treatment, which involved intravenous antibiotics and steroids (dexamethasone 5 mg) after surgery. The routine patients were discharged1–2 days after surgery, and prescribed oral antibiotics, steroids (prednisolone 20 mg), analgesics, and steroid eye drops for 1 week.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^3064cfce]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The possibility of permanent visual loss after ocular surgery is a serious concern to operators and patients. This study was designed to improve understanding of the prevention and treatment of retrobulbar hemorrhage by investigating the incidence and clinical characteristics of retrobulbar hemorrhage after orbital fracture repair, which is the most common type of orbital surgery.

The literature contains limited data on the incidence of RBH beyond case reports or case series. For RBH due to trauma, a retrospective review of 1386 facial trauma patients at a tertiary care trauma center emergency department reported an overall incidence of 3.6%. A questionnaire-based review of 269,433 blepharoplasty cases found that the incidence of RBH was 0.055% and that of RBH with permanent visual loss was 0.0045%. On the other hand, Gosau et al.in a single center series (n = 189) of orbital floor fracture repair reported an RBH incidence of 3.2%, whereas S. Lee et al. in a series of 170 patients that underwent orbital reconstruction using a porous high-density polyethylene implant found RBH was encountered in one patient (0.6%). In our 426 case series of orbital wall fracture repair performed at one academic tertiary referral center by a single surgeon, 5 patients (1.2%) developed postoperative RBH, and all 5 achieved normal visual acuity (20/20).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^018ba0e5]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Orbital fracture strabismus — timing for repair and observation is outlined as follows: Immediate repair is indicated for patients with CT or MR imaging evidence of an entrapped muscle or periorbital tissue associated with a nonresolving oculocardiac reflex; white-eyed blow-out fracture requires urgent repair; and globe subluxation into the maxillary sinus demands immediate surgical repair. Repair within 2 weeks includes symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions or entrapment on CT and minimal improvement over time that is best repaired within 1 to 2 weeks; large floor fractures, hypoglobus, and progressive infraorbital hypesthesia that are also best addressed within about 2 weeks; and early enophthalmos or hypoglobus causing facial asymmetry that are best addressed within about 2 weeks. Delayed repair (after 2 weeks) may benefit restrictive strabismus and unresolved enophthalmos, while observation may be considered in cases of minimal diplopia (not in primary or downgaze) with good ocular motility without significant enophthalmos or hypoglobus.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^9b6f7c1a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study, preoperative enophthalmos was significantly greater in the RBH group. A large amount of preoperative enophthalmos usually means a wider fracture and greater orbital volume expansion. During the early stage after injury, enophthalmos tends to be undervalued due to tissue edema and hemorrhage. However, over time, gradual fibrosis, contraction of orbital contents, and orbital fat atrophy augment enophthalmos, which cautions that attention be paid to the interpretation of preoperative results. In our study, the RBH group contained a high proportion of secondary repair patients, which probably made the preoperative enophthalmos difference appear more prominent.

No significant visual loss was noted after surgeries in the current study, but several studies have addressed visual loss after orbital surgery and reported incidences that vary widely. A single-surgeon series of 1593 orbitotomy cases for all indications reported an incidence of blindness of 0.44%, whereas an article on orbital cavernous hemangiomas reported a vision loss rate of 7%. In recent multicenter series of 1665 orbital surgeries for all indications, 14 patients (0.84%) experienced postoperative vision loss, and in 4 of the 14 patients (0.24%) vision loss was the result of RBH in fracture repair cases. According to the report by Gosau et al. described above, RBH occurred in 6 of 189 subjects (3.2%) and 2 lost vision (1.06%). Another report concluded that 48% of total vision losses after orbital fracture repair were due to RBH.

### Classification and surgical management of orbital fractures: experience with 111 orbital reconstructions [^3b026160]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Orbital skeletal injuries are frequently associated with other significant injuries and require a substantial surgical effort to correct. The use of a unified classification of orbital injury may better predict the surgical effort required to correct such injuries and help with future comparisons of results. In an attempt to summarize the principles of reconstruction of the orbital skeleton following trauma and introduce a unified classification system for orbital injuries, a retrospective review of all consecutive orbital reconstructions in a tertiary care teaching hospital was conducted. The nasoethmoidal region was involved in 32%, the zygomatic complex in 50%, and the frontal region in 28% of orbital fractures. Of the orbital walls, four walls were involved in 5%, three walls in 17%, two walls in 30%, and one wall in 53%. Associated ocular and neurologic injury was encountered in 33% and 57% of patients, respectively. Regions of fixation ranged from one to eight. Bone grafts were used in 20% and titanium mesh in 34% of the orbits. In general, the authors recommend an aggressive approach to orbital injuries, addressing all associated injuries simultaneously.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^4ff462fd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Retrobulbar hemorrhage (RBH) is a rare complication after orbital surgery but associated with ocular complications including blindness. The aim of this study was to identify clinical characteristics of patients with RBH requiring emergent orbital decompression after blowout fracture repair.

Method

A retrospective review of 426 blowout fracture patients at a tertiary oculoplastic clinic provided data regarding demographics, physical examination findings, and computed tomography (CT) images. Extraocular motility had been recorded in patient charts on a scale from 0 to − 4. Patients requiring emergent orbital decompression due to RBH after surgery (RBH group) were compared with those who did not (Control group), using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Incidences of RBH according to primary or secondary surgery were also investigated, using Fisher's exact test.

Result

Five (1.2%) of the 426 patients who underwent blowout fracture repair developed RBH requiring emergent intervention. All RBH patients fully recovered after the decompression procedure or conservative treatment. Number of days to surgery was significantly longer in the RBH group (97.0 ± 80.1) than in the Control group (29.0 ± 253.0) (p = 0.05). Preoperative enophthalmos was also significantly greater in the RBH group (RBH vs. Control group, 3.6 ± 1.7 mm versus 1.2 ± 1.3 mm (p = 0.003)). The incidence of RBH was significantly higher in patients that underwent secondary surgery (odds ratio = 92.9 [95% confidence interval, 11.16–773.23], p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Surgeons should pay more attention to hemostasis and postoperative care in patients with a large preoperative enophthalmic eye, when time from injury to surgery is long and in revision cases. When RBH occurs, time to intervention and surgical decompression is critical for visual recovery and preventing blindness.

Trial registration

The institutional review board of the Yeungnam University Medical Center approved this study, which was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^3afbc7dd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Delayed repair (within 2 weeks)

The majority of orbital fractures are managed initially with observation, then surgical intervention, if indicated, within 14 days of injury. The delay allows periorbital edema to decrease, which can assist in subsequent examinations and provides a window for concomitant injuries to be addressed. Diplopia is common in orbital fractures, but most improve within the first 2 weeks following the injury. Indications for surgery are enophthalmos (> 2 mm), ocular motility dysfunction, and persistent diplopia in primary gaze or reading position, CT findings of ocular muscle impingement and over 50% of floor involvement, progressive V2 hypesthesia, and abnormal forced duction testing. On initial presentation, these exam findings may be difficult to obtain due to edema, patient cooperation, and equipment limitations. The decision to proceed with surgery should rely on the collection of indications found in both the clinical and radiographic assessments.

Enophthalmos becomes clinically noticeable between eyes at 3 and 4 mm. A 5% increase in orbital volume (1 cm³) may be enough to cause this finding. If enophthalmos is not present clinically, the CT scan is used to subjectively predict volume change based on fracture displacement and fracture size. In general, this has been defined as displacing more than 1 cm² or greater than 50% of the orbital floor. Fracture location is important as well. Burm and Oh found 40% of medial wall fractures result in enophthal-mos. Furthermore, fractures at the junction of the medial wall and orbital floor are particularly prone to development of enophthalmos and chronic diplopia.

The degree of bony disruption may not be the only predictor of developing enophthalmos or persistent diplopia. Harris et al examined the amount of soft tissue herniation in proportion to the size of the bony defect and found that when the amount of soft tissue displaced was greater than the size of the defect, surgery lead to better results. Furthermore, disruption of the periorbital can be seen to result in changes in the inferior rectus on CT. Rounding of the inferior rectus on coronal CT is predictive of postoperative enophthalmos. Thus, when the inferior rectus takes on a more vertical orientation – when the height-to-width ratio is greater than or equal to 1 – it is predictive of late enophthalmos.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^0a591c24]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Timing of repair

Deferring surgery until periorbital edema decreases affords greater exposure and mitigates risk of compartment syndrome. However, delay increases the risk that impinged orbital tissues will develop fibrosis and cause chronic diplopia. In the absence of indications for immediate repair, a 2-week window for repair has been supported in the literature. If there is a question of entrapment based upon CT or forced duction testing, operative intervention within 48 hours, or as soon as possible, should be considered.

### Bony realignment in surgically treated orbital blowout fractures based on computed tomography [^e0597932]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The fate and configuration of the fractured wall repaired with an alloplastic implant have not been described substantially. In this study, we focused on the configuration of the reconstructed wall and underlined the importance of completeness of bony wall reconstruction on the occurrence of complications.

For blowout fractures, the benefits of corrective surgery have been validated by several studies. The purposes of reconstructive surgery for orbital wall fractures are to minimize cosmetic complications associated with enophthalmos by restoring the collapsed orbital tissue to the fractured site and to minimize functional complications such as ocular motility restriction and diplopia by releasing the incarcerated orbital tissue to the fractured site.

There have been few reports of radiological feature changes after orbital blowout fracture surgery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is one report of postoperative bony wall change after conventional open reduction of isolated medial wall fractures, in which an absorbable mesh implant was used. In their report, most bony depressions were improved significantly after surgery, the rough and irregular bony line changed to a smooth bony line as time passed. Fibrosis appeared to fill the defective gap between the reduced medial orbital bone and periosteum. The inserted absorbable mesh simply functioned as a template for bony realignment.

Radiologic changes in untreated blowout fractures of the orbit have been recently described. On comparison of CT scans taken immediately after trauma and after an average of 4.6 months with conservative treatment, a large proportion of patients showed improvement in radiologic findings, with smoothening of bony contour, joining of bony edges, reduction in orbital content herniation, features of neobone formation, and reduction in both orbital and fracture volumes. The connective tissue septa surrounding the eyeball and the extraocular muscles to the orbital walls may predispose conservative healing process.

The healing process after fracture reduction might be different from that via conservative treatment without surgery. In conservatively treated cases, the torn portion of the periosteum, separated bony edges, and sinus mucosa heal with the tissue healing processes at the fractured sites. In surgically managed cases, the prolapsed orbital tissue and the periosteum are restored using an implant, and bony repositioning or regrowth, and sinus mucosal healing are accomplished at the surface of the implant. As shown in Fig. 1, a displaced bony fragment as a hinged type in the sinus at the immediate postoperative period is appropriately repositioned, as seen on the late postoperative CT scan, with the sinus mucosal healing process.

Orbital fractures

Orbital fractures are typically the result of middle third facial traumas with the application of forces that overcome the resistance of the orbital cavity bones.

They can be single-wall or multi-wall, with the latter being the more prevalent. Moreover, there are complex facial fracture patterns with orbital involvement: the zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture, nasoorbitoethmoid fractures, and Le Fort fractures.

Orbital fractures can be classified as blow-out and blow-in. Blowout fractures (BOFs) are orbital wall fractures with orbital rim sparing that are caused by direct trauma to the orbit resulting in a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure, with bone fragments displaced caudally into the maxillary sinus. Blow-in fractures determine a reduction of the intraorbital space due to the internal displacement of bony fragments and are usually associated with proptosis.

The most common clinical signs of orbital fractures are periorbital edema, periorbital ecchymosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema with crepitus, periorbital contusions, hematomas, soft tissue injuries involving the eyelids, and deficits of the infra-orbital tract of the optic nerve.

BOFs are usually associated with injuries to surrounding soft tissues and orbital cavity contents. They may cause entrapment or herniation of orbital fat and extraocular muscles, resulting in limited eye movements and/or enophthalmos due to intra-orbital volume reduction.

The inferior orbital wall is the most commonly involved site, followed by the medial orbital wall.

The indications to orbital repair are still unclear; absolute indications to surgical repair are as follows: a clinically evident enophthalmos and/or hypophthalmos, a severe restriction of ocular motility with CT evidence of muscle entrapment or incarceration of periorbital soft tissue, a "white eye blowout" fracture in children or young adults with strict restriction of ocular motility and vagal symptoms, compartment syndromes (superior orbital fissure and orbital apex syndromes) needing urgent surgical decompression. Relative indications involve the presence of orbital floor defects > 50% of the orbital floor or an affected area of > 1 cm², and persistent diplopia due to entrapment or fibrosis of the extra orbital muscles.

Results

This study comprised 48 orbits (all unilateral cases) of 48 patients (35 males; 73%) who presented at a mean age at surgery of 28.1 ± 15.5 years (range, 7–79 years). The mean time from injury to the initial CT scan was 4.3 days (range, 0–25 days). The types of injuries were assault (n = 13; 27.1%), sports-related trauma (n = 13; 27.1%) followed by fall on level ground (n = 9; 18.8%), other blunt trauma (n = 8; 16.7%), traffic accidents (n = 3; 6.3%), and fall from a height (n = 1; 2.1%). There was one patient (2.1%) with an unknown cause.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^acc14ffd]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the surgical timing postinjury in regard to ocular motility in patients with orbital-floor blowout fractures.

Methods

This study involved 197 eyes (92 right eyes and 105 left eyes) of 197 patients (154 males and 43 females, mean age: 29.0 years, range: 7–85 years) with pure orbital blowout fractures. All patients underwent surgical repair within 30 days postinjury and were followed up for 3 months or more postoperative (mean follow-up period: 8.4 months, range: 3–59 months). Orbital blowout fractures were classified into one of three shapes: (1) trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment, (2) trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue and (3) depressed fragment fracture. Ocular motility was estimated by percentage of Hess area ratio (HAR%) on the Hess chart at the final follow-up examination. In addition, correlations between postinjury surgical timing and HAR% were analysed.

Results

The mean postinjury surgical timing was 10.7 ± 7.8 days (range: 0–30 days). The mean postoperative HAR% (92.9% ± 10.5%) was significantly improved compared with preoperative HAR% (73.5% ± 21.7%) (p < 0.01). The mean postoperative HAR% (98.3% ± 4.4%) of the orbital-floor trap-door fracture patients with incarcerated tissue who underwent surgical repair within 8 days postinjury was significantly better than that of the patients who underwent surgical repair after 8 days (94.2% ± 5.8%) (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with orbital-floor trap-door blowout fractures with incarcerated tissue that were repaired within 8 days postinjury had better outcomes than those repaired after 8 days, and HAR% is a useful method to record orbital fracture surgical outcomes.

### Orbital blowout fractures: a novel CT measurement that can predict the likelihood of surgical management [^d095177e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to identify an accurate and reliable computed tomographic (CT) measurement that can identify those patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with orbital floor fracture (BOF) who require surgical repair to prevent ensuing visually debilitating diplopia and/or enophthalmos.

Methods

In this retrospective institutional review board-approved study, we reviewed 99 patients older than 18 years with orbital fractures treated in a level I trauma center from 2011 through 2015. Thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria of having an isolated BOFs with or without a minimally displaced medial wall fracture. The maxillofacial CT of these patients, which included axial, coronal, and sagittal reconstruction of the face in both soft tissue and bone algorithm, were independently reviewed by a neuroradiologist and an oculoplastic surgeon. Each reviewer analyzed the images to answer the following 3 questions: (1) extent of the fracture fragment; greater than or less than 50%? (2) involvement of the inframedial strut (IMS)? and (3) cranial-caudal discrepancy of the orbits. This novel measurement was defined as the difference between the cranial-caudal dimension (CCD), measured just posterior to the globe, of the fractured orbit minus the CCD of the normal side. Electronic medical record was reviewed to determine the course of recovery, ophthalmologist assessment of the globe, motility, diplopia, and the need for operative repair. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the accuracy of the measured CT parameters for the prediction of those who would ultimately require surgical repair.

Results

Of the 33 patients included in the study, 8 patients required surgical correction of their BOFs. Others were managed conservatively. The accuracy of BOF > 50% for predicting those requiring surgical repair was 48%. The accuracy of IMS involvement was 74%. Using a threshold CCD value of 0.8 cm, the accuracy of CCD was 94%. Cranial-caudal discrepancy had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%. κ Agreement between the 2 readers evaluating the CT images was 0.93.

Conclusion

Initial maxillofacial CT studies obtained in the ED for those with BOF is used to predict which patients may need urgent surgical repair. In this report, we introduce a new CT measurement, called CCD. Cranial-caudal discrepancy greater than 0.8 cm is predictive of the development of diplopia and/or enophthalmos that will require surgical correction. Orbital floor fracture greater than 50% and IMS involvement were much less accurate in making similar predictions. Cranial-caudal discrepancy should be used by the ED physicians to identify those patients who should be referred sooner than later to an oculoplastic surgeon for surgical evaluation and intervention. Correct and timely triaging can prevent the complications of delayed correction including scarring, difficult surgical repair, and/or poor functional and aesthetic outcomes.

### Incidence and management of retrobulbar hemorrhage after blowout fracture repair [^c3cb3e44]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Retrobulbar hemorrhage (RBH) is a rare postoperative complication feared by ophthalmologists, because it can lead to blindness if not appropriately managed. Few studies have addressed the incidence of RBH after ophthalmic surgery, which is considered to have an extremely low incidence. Several case reports have been issued on the occurrence of postoperative RBH after oculoplastic surgery, and incidence rates of 0.055 to 3.2% have been reported, depending on type of surgery.

Orbital fracture is a common consequence of facial trauma, and orbital fracture repair is a common orbital surgery performed in the ophthalmic plastic surgery departments of tertiary hospitals. Although RBH is a potentially fatal complication that can occur after such surgery, research on its incidence and risk factors is limited.

The study was conducted on the incidence, treatment outcomes, and clinical features of RBH in patients after blowout fracture repair. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence and risk factors of RBH after isolated blowout fracture correction. The study was performed on a relatively large number of patients treated at a single tertiary hospital by a single operator using the same technique to improve understanding of the risk factors and management of RBH.

### Still no reliable consensus in management of blow-out fracture [^fe11160c]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Management of blow-out fractures (BOF) is addressed by different specialties. The general agreement is that patients with the potential for late enophthalmus development require early surgical intervention. In this study we wanted to: (i) evaluate the differences in opinions between the specialties that manage BOF and also whether there was a difference between surgeons from different countries, (ii) evaluate if surgeons handle these cases based upon their own individual criteria,(1) (iii) evaluate the correlation between the management of patients with orbital floor fractures and any late sequelae detected upon eye examination.

Materials and Methods

Eleven patients with BOF were selected from the records of the Department of ENT and Head & Neck Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital between 2003 and 2008. The cases were presented with a case history and CT scans to 46 surgeons from different countries and specialties and they were asked to give their opinions regarding the need for surgery, timing of surgery and the risk for late enophthalmus. We considered a group of surgeons to be in agreement if there was ≥ 75% agreement on whether or not to operate, when to operate and on the risk for late enophthalmus.

Result

The surgeons agreed on the choice of management for the patients (whether or not to operate) in only 5 of the 11 cases. Similarly, in only 5 of the 11 cases did the surgeons agree upon the risk for late enophthalmus. There was a greater difference between specialities than between physicians from the participating countries.

Conclusion

There are considerable differences in opinions regarding the management of BOF due to a lack of a reliable consensus. The management of BOF appears to be based on both individual and local traditions. Guidelines based on a randomized prospective study in BOF are required.

### Bony realignment in surgically treated orbital blowout fractures based on computed tomography [^667f74e7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Preoperative CT scans, and early and late postoperative scans (later than 4 months after the surgery) were retrieved for the study. If there were multiple follow-up CT scans after the surgery, the latest CT scan was chosen for analysis. In our practice, postoperative CT scans are taken at an early postoperative period of less than 3 days from the surgery.

Outcome measures included completeness of reduction and composition of the reconstructed wall. For completeness of reduction, the follow-up CT scan was compared with the preoperative CT scan to determine if the herniated orbital tissue at the fractured site was completely repositioned into the orbit after the surgery. In the composition of the reconstructed wall, bony coverage was considered as total when the bone was realigned along with the implant and the joining of bony edges was well-formed. Partial bony coverage referred to a condition in which a portion of the reformed orbital wall consisted of no bony lining on the CT scan. No bony coverage referred to a condition in which a reformed orbital wall did not contain any bony structure.

Two ophthalmologists with extensive experience in oculoplastic surgery (J. W. Park and C. Lee) first evaluated and classified the completeness of the reduction and the composition of the reconstructed wall. Then, two more highly experienced oculoplastic surgeons (Y.-D. Kim or K. I. Woo) convened to perform a follow-up evaluation and reach a consensus on the classification. To minimize subjective evaluations, the evaluations were conducted anonymously.

Cases with complications were collected and grouped separately. To find out the factors associated with the occurrence of complications, the rate of completeness of reduction and the rate of composition of the reconstructed wall were compared between the groups of presence and absence of complications. Further analysis was performed to determine if there was any association between the presence of complications and features of the fractures or the implant type (permanent or bioresorbable). The time-related factors were also analyzed with the rate of complete reduction and the rate of composition of the realignment.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^19675925]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a strong consensus in regard to the timing of surgical repair for a better functional outcome in the trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment. Surgical repair within 48 hours postinjury is recommended for paediatric 'white-eyed blowout' fractures. According to the recommendations stated in previous reports, we performed the surgical repair in four patients with trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment as soon as possible. In those four cases, the mean final follow-up HAR% (100.8% ± 8.0%) was significantly better than that of the initial HAR% (30.4% ± 9.0%) (p < 0.01). We also performed an early surgical repair of trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue.

However, there is no consensus in regard to the timing of surgical repair in patients with orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue. In this study, the mean final follow-up HAR% (98.3% ± 4.4%) in this type of patient who underwent surgical repair within 8 days postinjury was significantly better than the final HAR% (94.2% ± 5.8%) in the patient who underwent surgery after 8 days postinjury (p < 0.01) (figure 6). Patients with orbital-floor trap-door blowout fractures with incarcerated tissue that were repaired within 8 days postinjury had better outcomes than those repaired after 8 days. Thus, our findings might support early surgical repair within 8 days postinjury for the patients with orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^c0765b8a]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The exclusion criteria in this study included patients who underwent surgical repair of the fractures at another hospital and patients who underwent surgical repair more than 1 month postinjury. In addition, patients who had severe eyelid swelling and intraorbital emphysema at the initial examination were also excluded, due to the fact that severe eyelid swelling disturbs normal ocular motility and makes it difficult to obtain correct Hess screen test measurements.

In all patients, the CT images were reviewed by an experienced oculoplastic surgeon (AW) to confirm the diagnosis of orbital fracture. Fractures were classified by region and shape via the multislice CT images, with the regions being classified as orbital floor, medial wall or combined orbital floor and medial wall. Shapes were classified as trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment, trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue or depressed fragment fracture, in accordance with the classifications described by Beigi et al (figure 2). Surgical indications were determined by the presence of symptoms, such as diplopia, pain with ocular movement and limitation of ocular motility.

Figure 2
Corneal CT scan image demonstrating an isolated orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue (left), trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment (middle) and depressed floor-fragment fracture (right).

Two different surgical techniques were used for orbital reconstruction, that is, subciliary transcutaneous incision for orbital floor fractures and medial transcutaneous incision (ie, the Lynch incision) for medial wall fractures. In order to secure a wide surgical field, we used the transcutaneous incision for the orbital floor fractures, as it is necessary to confirm all edges of the fracture site in order to reverse the prolapse orbital soft tissues to the orbit and to insert the reconstruction material; the transcutaneous incision also makes it more easily for us to repair the fractures. All operations were conducted by two experienced oculoplastic surgeons (YY and AW).

For the orbital wall reconstructions, an unsintered hydroxyapatite particles/poly L-lactide composite device (OSTEOTRANS MX; Takiron, Tokyo, Japan), a silicone silastic sheet (Eyeball restraint insert; KOKEN, Tokyo Japan) and hydroxyapatite (Apaceram; HOYA, Tokyo, Japan) were used. The specific materials used for each orbital fracture reconstruction was selected by the surgeon at the time of operation in each case.

### Comprehensive management of orbital fractures [^2f524100]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Orbital fractures are some of the more challenging injuries faced by the plastic surgeon. As such a prominent facial feature, even the most minor asymmetries following trauma can be distressing to the patient. In treating these patients, there are certain crucial aspects of both diagnosis and management that are critical to obtaining an optimal result. These include a careful preparative eye examination focusing on extraocular motility and any evidence of optic nerve compression. Candidates for surgery must be carefully selected based on firm indications such as a large orbital floor defect (> 1 cm²), early enophthalmos, significant hypoglobus, or persistent diplopia in the primary field of gaze. Reconstruction should focus on anatomical restitution of the floor, taking great care to place the implant along the correct superior inclination of the orbit.

### Bony realignment in surgically treated orbital blowout fractures based on computed tomography [^01d0254b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Blunt orbital trauma may result in a blowout fracture of the orbital floor or medial wall by increased orbital pressure or buckling force. The indications and timing of surgical repair are areas of continued interest, and of some controversy with considerable variations among specialists.

There have been many reports on the surgical effects of clinical factors of diplopia or enophthalmos after blowout fracture repair. However, there are few studies solely dedicated to bony alignment after the surgery using an alloplastic implant. In studies using rabbit models, Aral et al. demonstrated that dense connective tissue and bone formation were observed in the group with an alloplastic implant in histologic examination. Kontio et al. reported that the alloplastic implants were surrounded by elastic capsules, which gradually ossified in a sheep model. There was a study in a clinical setting demonstrating bony remodeling in orbital medial wall fractures with computed tomography (CT) evaluation.

In general, long-term follow-up CT scans are not usually taken to check bony realignment after blowout fracture repair unless there is a specific reason such as a patient's request or symptoms. We aimed to evaluate postoperative bony realignment after orbital blowout fracture surgery based on these long-term follow-up CT scans using the outcome measures of completeness of reduction and composition of the reconstructed wall.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^914c70f9]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Isolated orbital fractures are treated for one of three reasons: to free entrapped extraocular muscles, to prevent postoperative malpositioning and resulting complications (diplopia or enophthalmos) in large fractures, and to decompress neural structures in very severe cases where the lateral wall protrudes into the orbital apex or middle cranial fossa. Muscle entrapment (infrequent in adults due to comminution of the floor) is a surgical emergency, so surgeons should be notified immediately when herniation is identified on CT; it is very useful to inform surgeons of the approximate size of the fractures and the degree of displacement of fat and soft tissues. Other complications include intraorbital hemorrhage, globe injury, and infraorbital nerve injury in cases of orbital floor fracture.

### Principles of facial trauma: orbital fracture management [^e49b261d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Often, complex, optimal management of the orbital fracture is directly dependent on thorough initial evaluation, correct injury assessment, and timely initiation of chosen therapy. Most often, secondary to assault or motor vehicle collision, these fractures are frequently associated with additional traumatic injury. With recent advances in imaging, alloplastic materials, and bone fixation technology, the evolution of orbital fracture management now enables reconstruction of even the most severe injuries.

### Orbital fractures: a new classification and staging of 190 patients [^b882fe9f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The orbit is located in the middle third of the face, composed of several bones and surrounded by complex anatomic structures so that orbital fractures (OF) often involve other parts of the face. A staging system for classifying OF is of paramount importance in order to exchange information between trauma centers. Several classifications have been proposed for describing OF but they have not a single method applicable to the whole orbit. Here, a classification for OF that can be summarized with four abbreviations is proposed. Four letters define the localization (F = frontal, N = nasal, M = maxillary and Z = zygomatic bone fracture), two acronyms describe fragment shift (in = blow-in or out = blow-out), four numbers define ocular movement impairment (1 = superior, 2 = internal, 3 = inferior, and 4 = external extrinsic muscular deficit) and two acronyms describe eye position (EX = exophthalmos and ENO = enophthalmos). To evaluate the suitability of the proposed classification a retrospective study on a series of 190 OFs is performed. Age, gender, new stage, clinical diagnosis at admission, type of surgery, and need for graft for orbital reconstruction are considered. A good correlation between the proposed classification and the studied variables is detected. In conclusion, the proposed classification is a simply and precise method to stage OF. It can summarize OF and be used in the daily practice. However, it is our belief that a multi-center study should be performed before the effectiveness of the proposed classification can be clearly stated.

### Updates on the evaluation and treatment of orbital fractures [^d4dfd299]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Orbital fractures, commonly resulting from blunt trauma like accidents or assaults, comprise a significant proportion of facial fractures. Effective management involves a multidisciplinary approach and computed tomography imaging with 3D reconstruction. Surgical repair aims to restore orbital volume and correct visual deficits, with conflicting data to suggest optimal timing for intervention. Implant materials range from autologous grafts to alloplastic options like titanium mesh. Recent advancements include intraoperative navigation and patient-specific implants, improving precision and outcomes in complex orbital fracture repairs. A paucity of prospective studies limits our ability to establish uniform data-driven guidelines for the surgical management of orbital fractures.

Orbital wall "blowout"

There are two main types of orbital fractures: those that form part of a larger fracture pattern (zygomaticomaxillary complex, naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex, or Le Fort fractures) and isolated blowout fractures. The first type occurs when one or more of the bony walls of the orbit are fractured in particular in the setting of a larger fracture; the inferior orbital rim is the most commonly affected part. The second type, known as orbital "blowout" fracture, occurs when direct traumatic impact on the globe is transmitted to the orbital roof, floor, or medial wall, displacing it outward, away from the orbit (Fig. 13), while the orbital rim itself remains intact. Blowout fractures most often affect the inferior part of the orbital wall, followed by the medial part; when one fractured wall is detected, radiologists should look carefully at the other walls.

Two other types of orbital wall fractures are orbital roof fractures and pediatric "trapdoor" fractures. The roof is the only part of the orbital wall that separates the anterior cranial fossa from the contents of the orbit; injury to this structure can result in a dural tear and consequently a cerebrospinal fluid leakage or a brain herniation. The trapdoor fracture is a type of orbital blowout fracture affecting the inferior part of the orbital wall, with the particularity that the inferior rectus muscle bulges into the maxillary sinus and is entrapped when the fractured fragment returns to its original position. Trapdoor fractures typically occur in children. Coronal multidetector CT images show the inferior rectus muscle below the orbital floor, sometimes also showing the fractured fragment of the inferior orbital wall.

### Clinical results according to inferior oblique manipulation in patients with inferomedial blowout fracture involving the orbital strut [^708ccaec]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The floor and medial walls are the most commonly fractured areas of the orbit. Patients with extraocular muscle incarceration, double vision, hypoglobus, and marked orbital volume expansion require treatment. Combined fractures of the orbital floor and medial wall, in particular, those affecting the inferomedial orbital strut (IOS), are more likely to necessitate treatment due to increased risk of enophthalmos, strabismus, and even hypoglobus and diplopia. However, restoring the natural curves of the orbital wall without postoperative sequelae remains challenging, as the inferior oblique muscle (IOM) impedes access to the medial and inferior orbital wall. Although several procedures and techniques have been developed to increase the surgical view and treat these complicated fractures, no consensus on the ideal approach exists, and definite guidelines are lacking.

Nunery et aldescribed the "wraparound" technique for combined fractures in 2008 to span all fracture sites with a single implant. In this technique, IOM was preserved, and the implant was introduced inferiorly and maneuvered through the medial area using a "lariat". The treatment was successful without serious complications. Nevertheless, skin incision, blind insertion, incomplete visualization of the fracture sites, 0.4-mm implant thickness, relatively small implant size to span combined fractures, and the presence or absence of IOS involvement are its limitations. In 2016, a study reporting ocular motility after repairing combined medial and inferior orbital wall fractures with IOM detachment and reattachment for retaining better visualization of fracture sites showed satisfactory results. This study examined 20 patients who underwent surgery with extended conjunctival incision with IOM disinsertion and IOM reattachment for combined orbital wall fractures. On the contrary, Raymond et alstated about surgery of combined orbital fractures involving the IOS with detachment of IOM in 16 patients. There were 5 out of 7 patients who improved diplopia, which was shown preoperatively. They also reported that there were no cases of new or worsened diplopia following surgery but no mentions about IOM functions after surgery.

Regardless of these studies, there is no definite guideline on manipulating IOM. Iatrogenic damage remains a concern to the IOM especially when a combined fracture involving IOS without diplopia or IOM dysfunction is operated.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the results according to the management of IOM in patients with combined medial and floor wall fractures involving IOS. We compared and evaluated the clinical outcomes with and without IOM reattachment in patients who underwent IOM disinsertion during the operation.

### Analysis of readmission and complications after repair of orbital fractures using California's office of statewide health planning and development database [^099b76c8]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Orbital fractures represent one of the most common trauma-related facial fractures and may present with a variety of concomitant injuries. Many factors including age, associated diagnoses, and fracture complications are important in determining surgical candidacy. We used a statewide database to determine the prevalence of orbital fractures, rates of surgical repair during initial admission, and early patient outcomes.

Methods

A longitudinal analysis of patients with orbital fracture was performed using California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development patient discharge database for admissions occurring between January 2015 and December 2018. Patients were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The primary risk factor was surgical management of orbital fractures. The primary outcomes of interest were readmission requiring surgical management and complications of the fracture. Survival models were developed to evaluate the risk of a repair at readmission adjusting for relevant covariates.

Results

Of the 67,408 facial fractures included in our study, 8.7% (n = 5872) were diagnosed with orbital fractures. Among this population, 18.4% (n = 1082) underwent surgical repair during their initial admission. Patients were primarily male (71.1%; n = 4,173) and presented in a nonurgent fashion (93.7%; n = 5501). Less than half (42.8%) of patients with an urgent presentation and 16.8% of patients with a nonurgent presentation underwent repair. Centers of Medicaid & Medicare Services guidelines dictated presentation classification. Repair was associated with a significantly higher survival outcome. Orbital fractures were more frequently repaired in the setting of concomitant zygomatic, nasal, and LeFort I-III fractures. Increased risk in complications was observed in all concomitant fracture groups, and there existed a decreased risk of postsurgical complications in these same cohorts.

Conclusions

Although most orbital fractures were managed nonoperatively, our analysis found that rates of repair for orbital floor, maxillary, and zygomatic fractures were greater than for other facial fractures. Concomitant fractures were associated with an increased hazard ratio for complications. Although low in prevalence overall, the most often observed postoperative complications in this population were diplopia, glaucoma, and blindness/low vision.

### Evolution in diagnosis and repairing of orbital medial wall fractures [^05d82011]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

In the last decades, diagnostical imaging, surgical techniques, alloplastic materials, and surgical instruments development allowed a great progress in management of orbital fractures; the aim of the present study was to focus on the progress and changes in the management of orbital medial wall fractures. Isolated medial wall fractures are not a common clinical evidence, and those necessitating surgery is relatively rare. Diagnostical refinements allowed to detect such fractures more commonly than suspected, and the indications to surgical treatment had been increased by the progresses that minimized morbidity of patients and allowed better restoration of the functional anatomy. Mainly, the endoscopic surgery as an alternative to open reduction allowed to manage such fractures with less unwanted sequelae; endoscopy decreases morbidity and improves the results with respect to open reductions. In literature, currently, it can be noticed that there is an increased trend in surgical treatment of the patients with orbital medial wall fracture because endoscopy decreased perisurgical morbidity and improved long-term results. Endoscopic repair of orbital blowout fractures represents an innovative and highly successful and safe alternative to external repairs owing to its introduction in orbital trauma management; actually, indications for surgical intervention are in the course of revision. New deal is important for the future treatment of patients sustaining orbital trauma. The authors present their experience.

Strabismus after orbital trauma — frequency after blowout fractures and iatrogenic causes indicates that diplopia is very common after blowout fractures, and strabismus surgery was required in 7% to 24% of cases in two series of patients with orbital floor fractures; less commonly, strabismus can occur iatrogenically after sinus surgery or other periocular surgeries, including surgery to the eyelids.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^4696d9de]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Orbital blowout fractures may cause serious complications such as diplopia and enophthalmos, which may be caused by the entrapment of the extraocular tissues, muscles or fat within the fractured bone or the swelling of these intraorbital tissues. Burm et al reported that in 82 patients, 25% of the medial wall fractures, 80% of the orbital floor fractures and 80.9% of the combined orbital floor and medial wall fractures were associated with diplopia. They also reported that limitation of eye movement was observed in 12.5% of medial wall fractures, 73.3% of floor fractures and 47.6% of combined orbital floor and medial wall fractures.

In two previous reports, the effect of the surgical repair was only determined by the presence or absence of diplopia. However, the patient's complaints of diplopia in those studies were too subjective to compare the preoperative and postoperative repair. The objective methods used to evaluate diplopia were a binocular single vision test (BSV) and a Hess screen test. Alhamdani et al reported that improvement of the BSV score in the patients with surgical repair was not found to be significantly correlated with subjective outcome in relation to diplopia. In this study, we used the Hess screen test to evaluate ocular motility. This test helps us easily to monitor changes in ocular motility in patients with orbital blowout fractures. In a previous report from Furuta et al, HAR% was the objective index to compare the surgical outcomes in patients with orbital blowout fractures. Pier et al reported that HAR% was effective for predicting postoperative diplopia in 30 patients undergoing surgical repair for orbital blowout fractures. In those reports, all patients with preoperative HAR > 85% had no postoperative diplopia. In our present study, the mean final follow-up HAR% (92.9% ± 10.5%) was significantly better than that of the initial HAR% (73.5% ± 21.7%) (p < 0.01). The final HAR% in 175 patients (88.8%) improved with surgical repair. Our results show that the appropriate surgical repair improved HAR% and that changes in ocular motility were easily monitored by HAR%.

### Using the endoscopic transconjunctival and transcaruncular approach to repair combined orbital floor and medial wall blowout fractures [^6445ba4d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the endoscopic transcaruncular and transconjunctival approach in the repair of combined medial and inferior orbital wall fractures.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on 160 patients with combined medial and inferior orbital wall fractures. All patients underwent surgery via an endoscopic transcaruncular and transconjunctival approach without lateral canthotomy, performed by a single surgeon. Porous polyethylene sheets (1.0mm in thickness) were implanted to cover the orbital defects. The minimal postoperative follow-up period was 6 months. The authors evaluated enophthalmos, diplopia, and ocular motility pre and postoperatively and report surgical complications.

Results

A total of 160 patients were included, comprising 121 men and 39 women. The mean patient age was 33.9 ± 14.1 years, and the mean postoperative follow-up period was 12 months. The average enophthalmos was 3.20mm preoperatively, and the mean improvement at 6 months after surgery was 2.82mm. One patient suffered a canalicular laceration after surgery, and another retrobulbar hemorrhage; however, both of these complications resolved with appropriate management. Otherwise, there were no significant surgical complications including newly developed diplopia, decreased visual acuity, or cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Conclusions

The endoscopic transcaruncular and transconjunctival approach is a useful and promising technique to repair combined medial and inferior orbital wall fractures.

### Recurrent orbital trauma following repaired orbital floor fracture [^c8e05d2c]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A study of a 22-year-old male who was assaulted and sustained a left orbital floor blowout fracture was presented in this study. The orbital floor was repaired with a titanium-reinforced porous polyethylene implant. Two years postoperatively, the patient sustained repeated left orbital trauma. The orbital floor implant remained stable while the medial wall blew out.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^c826fc44]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

It should be noted that the surgical repair resulted in poor improvement of HAR% in 22 (11.2%) of the 197 patients. Of the 22 cases that attained a worse HAR%, two cases had the same HAR%, three cases who had a preoperative HAR of < 55% had poor improvement of HAR% at final examination, 14 patients (63.6%) had orbital floor fractures and 8 (36.4%) had orbital medial wall fractures. In addition, 15 of the 22 cases had orbital depressed fragment fractures, and 7 cases had orbital trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue. The mean preoperative HAR% of the 22 cases with poor improvement (90.1% ± 18.9%) was significantly better than that of the 175 cases with improvement (71.4% ± 21.2%) (p < 0.001). This finding indicates that the preoperative HAR% in the 22 patients with poor improvement was not severely poor, even though the degree of improvement was poor. Additional possible reasons for those poor results might have been severe displacement of orbital soft tissue and muscle by trauma. With depressed floor-fragment fracture, especially a large size depressed floor-fragment, prolapsed orbital soft tissue and muscle cannot necessarily correlate with a fully normal functional movement. Koornneef reported that the orbital soft tissues are interconnected by a network known as the connective tissue septal system. The surgical repair may cause distortion of this network, and thus affect postoperative ocular motility.

Surgical timing of orbital blowout fracture repair is a subject that remains controversial. Burnstinereported that surgery performed within 2 weeks postinjury is recommended in cases of symptomatic diplopia with positive forced ductions and that evidence of orbital soft tissue entrapment on CT examination or large orbital floor fractures may cause latent enophthalmos or hypo-ophthalmos. In two other previous reports, it was recommended that early surgical repair results in rapid improvement of ocular mortality and diplopia. However, Simon et al reported that the outcome of two groups were equivalent in their study that compared early surgery (20 patients treated within 2 weeks postinjury) with delayed surgery (30 patients treated after 2 weeks postinjury). Moreover, Scawn et al reported that delay of surgical repair beyond 6 weeks postinjury can also improve diplopia and enophthalmos.

### Does early repair of orbital fractures result in superior patient outcomes? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^10703d40]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To date, no clear evidence-based guidelines exist pertaining to the ideal timing to perform surgical treatment of orbital fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine if early treatment of orbital fractures resulted in better patient outcomes.

Materials and Methods

We designed and implemented a systematic review and meta-analysis to test the null hypothesis of no difference in outcomes between different time intervals between orbital injury and surgical intervention. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Elsevier text mining tool database, and clinicaltrials.gov trial registry were queried. The quality of evidence was based on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The predictor variable was the timing of operative repair (early vs late). The outcome variable was complete recovery. Other variables of interest were diplopia, enophthalmos, and preoperative motility restriction. Meta-analyses were performed when definitions of active and control interventions and patient outcomes were deemed similar. In addition, χ² tests were performed to determine differences in clinical outcomes between early and late operative repair.

Results

Of the 1,160 articles reviewed, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Surgery performed less than 2 weeks after injury was significantly associated with greater odds of complete recovery of symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 6.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35–35.06]), as well as a lower incidence of postoperative diplopia (OR, 0.3 [95% CI, 0.1–0.9]) and enophthalmos (OR, 0.2 [95% CI, 0.1–0.9]). Repair performed less than 30 days after injury was associated complete resolution of preoperative motility restriction (OR, 24.6 [95% CI, 1.30–462.34]) as well as diplopia.

Conclusions

Differences in the timing of surgery and definition of patient outcomes, as well as variations in methods of evaluating postoperative outcomes, potentiate the risk of bias and warrant downgrading of the quality of evidence in a study. The timing of repair varied among 2, 4, and 8 weeks after injury. However, a short time to surgical intervention was significantly associated with resolution of vertical dystopia, postoperative enophthalmos, and motility restriction.

### Delayed-onset orbital abscess after orbital blowout fracture repair using porous polyethylene implant [^9807987b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

This study aims at documenting a rare case of delayed-onset orbital abscess following the use of a nonabsorbable porous polyethylene implant in orbital fracture repair, highlighting the potential long-term risks associated with non-biodegradable orbital implants. A 44-year-old man presented with diplopia on down gaze, proptosis, and eyelid edema for 2 weeks. He had undergone repair of an inferior orbital wall fracture with a porous polyethylene implant 5 years ago. Computed tomography (CT) evaluation revealed a significant intraorbital abscess related to implant infection. Surgical interventions included abscess drainage and implant replacement, which led to patient recovery. Nonabsorbable implants, which are beneficial for orbital reconstruction, may pose a risk of occurrence of delayed infections several years following surgery. This report highlights the importance of long-term monitoring to mitigate the risks of potential late complications, which necessitate early diagnosis, appropriate intervention, and management strategies.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^dfc71ee2]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Association between surgical timing and final HAR%

The mean HAR% (98.3% ± 4.4%) of the patients with orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue who underwent surgical repair within 8 days postinjury was significantly better than that of the final follow-up HAR% (94.2% ± 5.8%) of the patients who underwent surgical repair more than 8 days postinjury (p < 0.01). However, the mean preoperative HAR% (74.9% ± 22.5%) of the patients with orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue who underwent surgical repair within 8 days postinjury was not significantly better than that of the preoperative HAR% (78.4% ± 16.2%) of the patients who underwent surgical repair more than 8 days postinjury (p > 0.05).

No significant difference was found in the mean final follow-up HAR% of the patients with either depressed floor-fragment fracture or depressed medial-fragment fracture and combined depressed floor and medial wall-fragment fracture who underwent surgical repair within 1 month postinjury.

This study included three orbital-floor trap-door fracture patients and one patient with medial-wall trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment. All four patients who had trap-door fractures with muscle entrapment underwent surgical repair within 6 days postinjury, and the mean final follow-up HAR% (100.8% ± 8.0%) was significantly better than that of the initial HAR% (30.4% ± 9.0%) (p < 0.01).

The total operation time was within 3 hours for all of the orbital floor fractures and orbital medial wall fractures. In addition, the total operation time was within 3.5 hours for all of the combined orbital floor and medial wall fracture. In all patients, there were no intraoperative complications. However, it should be noted that some postoperative complications were observed at the mean follow-up period of 8.4 months. Postoperative infraorbital nerve dysfunction for dysaesthesia was observed in four patients, and orbital haematoma was observed in two patients. Those two patients complained of postoperative diplopia and severe eyelid swelling 2 days after surgery, and a subsequent CT scan revealed the orbital haematoma. However, the haematomas did not enlarge in those two patients, and CT imaging revealed that they had disappeared at 1 month postoperative and both patients stopped complaining of diplopia and pain.

### Repair of orbital floor fracture with modified transnasal endoscopic approach through anterior space to nasolacrimal duct [^2d820a2f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Classification of Orbital Floor Area

Orbital floor were classified into 2 areas: anterior and posterior areas. Anterior orbital floor meant former from the center, which was divided in front and behind at just same distance using sagittal computed tomography (CT). Posterior orbital floor also meant back from the center. Orbital floor were also classified into 2 areas: lateral and medial area. Lateral orbital floor meant outside the center, which was divided right and left in just same distance using coronal CT. Medial orbital floor meant inside the center (Fig. 4).

### Orbital surgery: state of the art [^863eb8a5]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Much has been written about the repair of orbital fractures, yet some debate still exists among surgeons with regard to indications for and timing of fracture repair and various surgical techniques. Controversies regarding the surgical maneuvers include the incision, surgical approach, and methods of wound closure. More detailed imaging modalities have allowed clinicians to understand the injuries more completely and plan for and execute more ideal reconstructions. Recent advances in orbital implant materials and the role of endoscopy in orbital fracture repair add to this debate about which techniques would be best for particular injuries. This article discusses these issues and provides the most current literature review regarding the management of various orbital fractures.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^fbd2bde2]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Patterns and classifications

To ensure effective communications with surgeons, it is extremely important for radiologists to describe patterns.

The AO group has proposed a system for classifying craniomaxillofacial fractures in adults (AOCMF) in which anatomic modules are arranged into a hierarchy with three levels of precision to describe these injuries in terms of complexity and details. Level 1 is the most basic; it conveys only whether fractures are present in four anatomical units: the mandible, midface, skull base, and cranial vault. Level 2 describes the location of the fractures in detail within specific regions of the mandible, central and lateral midface, internal orbit, endocranial and exocranial skull base, and cranial vault. Level 3 reports even greater detail about the location of the injury, focusing on morphology (fragmentation, displacement, and bone defects) within specific subregions. The AO classification is not widely adopted for now but it is a promising research tool for the future.

Multidetector CT's exquisite depiction of bone has enabled the development of new subunit-specific principles for the management of midfacial fracture that are supplanting the older, more general Le Fort classification system, which does not adequately reflect the complexity of the individual components of the midfacial region. Nevertheless, the Le Fort classification remains relevant because it is well known and is still widely used in clinical practice.

The following discussion of fracture patterns first focuses on those involving more buttresses and then focuses on those that involve fewer buttresses (e.g. orbital "blowout" or mandibular fractures). It is important to keep in mind that various patterns often coexist in the same patient (Table 2).

Table 2
Patterns and classifications of facial fractures

In midface fractures involving multiple buttresses and damage to the pterygoid plates, the three subtypes of Le Fort fractures should be considered. Determining whether the fracture predominantly affects the lateral or medial portion of the midface will help show whether the pattern corresponds to a fracture of the zygomaticomaxillary complex or naso-orbito-ethmoidal complex.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^067ce922]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 6
Images showing final follow-up HAR% of a patient with orbital floor trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue. The mean final follow-up HAR% (98.3% ± 4.4%) of the patient who underwent surgical repair within 8 days postinjury (left) was significantly better than the final follow-up HAR% (94.2% ± 5.8%) of the patient who underwent surgical repair after 8 days postinjury (right) (p < 0.01). HAR, Hess area ratio.

There was no significant difference of the mean final follow-up HAR% of the patients by any surgical timing with either depressed floor-fragment fracture or depressed medial wall-fragment fracture and combined orbital floor, or medial wall fracture who underwent surgical repair within 1 month postinjury. We theorise that this result might be due to the fact that the surgical results in the patients who underwent treatment within 30 days were not significantly influenced by the surgical timing. Thirty days might not be a late timing and also be effective. Simon et al compared the two groups via the enophthalmos and limitation of ocular motility and reported that there were no significant differences in surgical outcome between early (ie, within 2 weeks postinjury) and late surgical repair.

In addition, there was no significant difference of the mean final follow-up HAR% of the patients by each region with either a trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue or a depressed fragment fracture. The HAR% of a patient with a depressed medial wall-fragment fracture tended towards less improvement than that of a patient with a depressed floor-fragment fracture. However, the final HAR% of a patient with a depressed medial wall-fragment fracture and a depressed floor-fragment fracture were significantly better than that of the preoperative HAR% (p < 0.01).

Moreover, the material selected for orbital wall reconstruction may influence the recovery of ocular motility. We compared the surgical results of three reconstruction materials by HAR%. However, there was no significant difference of improvement, regardless of implant material used (table 2).

### A consistent, reliable landmark to assist in placement of orbital floor reconstruction plates after blowout fractures [^42fa8edd]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To define a reliable and consistent landmark, the superior posterior wall of the maxillary sinus, and to describe how this landmark can be used when repairing orbital floor fractures.

Methods

Retrospective chart review. Patients > 18 years old diagnosed with unilateral orbital floor and/or zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures.

Main Outcomes

The distance from the inferior orbital rim to the superior posterior wall of the maxillary sinus (landmark distance), and the distance from the landmark to the entrance of the optic canal were reported.

Results

Eighty patients were included in the study. Each had unilateral isolated orbital floor fractures (n = 46) or unilateral zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures with an orbital floor component (n = 34). The contralateral eye in all patients was uninjured, and was used as an internal control. In orbital floor fractures, the mean landmark distance was 38.8 ± 1.4mm, with a mean distance on the normal side of 38.8 ± 1.6mm (P = 0.49). Distance to the optic canal on the injured side in isolated orbital floor fracture patients was 9.0 ± 0.8mm with the same measurement on the normal side being 8.8 ± 0.7 (P = 0.21). In the setting of zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture, the orbital floor length was 38.2 ± 1.3mm with a mean normal floor length of 37.8 ± 1.1mm (P = 0.18). The mean distance from the superior posterior wall to optic canal in zygomaticomaxillary complex fractured orbits was 9.2 ± 1.1mm with a normal side mean length of 9.5 ± 1.0mm (P = 0.23). No significant difference was found between the measured distances in the fractured orbit and its normal counterpart for both fracture groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

The superior posterior wall of the maxillary sinus is a reliable landmark that can be used to assist in placement of an orbital floor reconstructive plate. The landmark is unchanged despite the presence of an orbital floor or zygomaticomaxillary sinus fracture.

### Refining indications for orbital floor fracture reconstruction: a risk-stratification tool predicting symptom development and need for surgery [^54ca4ac4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Challenges in orbital floor fracture management include delayed symptom onset and controversial surgical indications based on radiographic findings. This study assessed which imaging characteristics most reliably predict symptomatology to generate a tool quantifying individual need for surgery on initial presentation.

Methods

The clinical course for all patients with isolated orbital fractures at a single institution from 2015 to 2017 were reviewed. Trauma mechanism, computed tomographic scan findings, and symptoms necessitating surgery (diplopia, enophthalmos) were noted. Univariable and multivariable regression modeling was used to generate a predictive risk model for operative fractures.

Results

One hundred twenty-one patients with isolated orbital fractures were identified. Mechanism of injury included falls (41 percent), assault (37 percent), and vehicular trauma (17 percent). Patient follow-up averaged 4.4 ± 4.8 months. Average orbital floor fracture area was 2.4 cm² (range, 0.36 to 6.18 cm²), and orbital volume herniation averaged 0.70 cm³ (range, 0.01 to 4.23 cm³). Twenty-one patients (17.3 percent) required surgical intervention for symptomatic fractures. The strongest predictors of symptoms were orbital volume increase greater than 1.3 cm³ (OR, 10.5; p = 0.001) and inferior rectus displacement within/below the fracture line (OR, 3.7; p = 0.049). Mechanical fall was risk-reducing (OR, 0.08; p = 0.005). Symptom risk was stratified from low (3.6 percent) to high risk (71 percent) (C-statistic = 0.90). The volume of herniated orbital contents was significantly more predictive of symptoms than fracture area (C-statistic = 0.81 versus C-statistic = 0.66; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

The proposed risk tool allows highly accurate, early prediction of symptomatic orbital floor fractures. Findings suggest that orbital volume change, not fracture area, more reliably informs operative indications, along with inferior rectus muscle caudal malposition. A simplified stepwise decision algorithm demonstrates the potential utility of this risk-assessment tool.

Surgical management consists of the removal of displaced bone fragments and internal fixation of the fracture through the positioning of mesh materials to restore the original orbital volume and morphology (Fig. 1).

Orbital floor fractures

The orbital floor BOF is the most common fracture and can occur alone (Fig. 2) or in combination with other facial fractures (approximately 50% of cases it is associated with the medial wall fracture). It is often characterized by bone fragments displaced into the maxillary sinus (Figs. 2, 3).

The inferior rectus muscle is dysmorphic, elongated, and also partially herniated caudally into the sinus (arrow). In the lower portion of the herniated tissue, a small hematoma is present (arrowhead). The medial rectus muscle (white asterisk) is swollen and partially entrapped in the fracture of the lamina papyracea (empty arrow)

The most prevalent cause of injury is direct anteroposterior blunt trauma to the globe and orbital boundaries. The potential mechanism for this sort of fracture has been proposed as hydraulic energy and buckling of the floor from impact to the inferior orbital edge.

The approach to the fracture site depends upon the type of injury, surgeon experience, and available equipment. Subciliary, subtarsal, and transconjunctival incisions are the most commonly utilized. The subciliary approach has been associated with a much higher complication rate, with ectropion resulting in approximately 12.9% of cases. The subtarsal approach is associated with less ectropion and if placed appropriately should not result in a conspicuous scar (1%–3%).–Most surgeons prefer the transconjunctival approach to the orbital floor because there is no visible scar and the complication rate is very low – less than 1% in many series.–Medial wall fractures are difficult to repair, though there are many approaches. Some of the most common approaches are the transcutaneous (Lynch incision), transconjunctival inferior fornix, transcaruncular, and endoscopic transethmoidal. The transcaruncular approach is very popular because it easily combines with the transconjunctival approach.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^8bb1c1b7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Surgical technique

Concomitant orbital and maxillofacial fractures are repaired in a particular sequence. The first step is to obtain a baseline ocular motility by a forced duction test. The orbital rim is exposed by one of the approaches mentioned earlier. Repair of an orbital floor defect proceeds in a similar manner regardless of approach. Once the orbital rim is reached, dissection continues in the subperiosteal plane into the orbit and then along the orbital floor in a 20° cephalic direction. Deeper in the orbit a malleable retractor is used to elevate the orbital tissues and improve visibility to identify the orbital fracture defect. Orbital tissue is frequently herniating into the fracture. This tissue should be delicately approached from side-to-side, avoiding inadvertent penetration of the tissue with the freer/elevator. Penetration into the tissue can expose difficult to retract orbital fat, making visibility more cumbersome. Segments of bone limiting elevation of soft tissue can be removed to improve mobility of the orbital tissue back into the orbit. Once the infraorbital nerve is identified, the tissues above and medial to the nerve can be mobilized into the orbit and separated from orbital floor bone fracture segments and the maxillary sinus mucosa. Dissection is continued until the entire orbital fracture ring can be identified and the bone ledges deemed stable to support an implant (especially important is the posterior ledge). The implant is then sized and shaped to cover the fracture ring. The size of the implant should not be significantly larger than the defect as this can affect ocular motility and globe position.

In severe fractures, the posterior floor can be unstable or unidentifiable, which makes implant positioning difficult and increases the risk of postoperative ophthalmic functional deficits. In these cases, it is recommended to use more rigid implants that can be fixated to the infraorbital rim and cantilevered toward the posterior orbital fracture ledge. If the implant is projecting too high, it can cause hyperglobus and ocular motility problems. Additionally, if the implant is positioned too deeply into the orbit, it can impinge the optic nerve at the apex and cause vision loss.

### Delayed repair of lateral orbital wall and orbital floor fracture [^e85e37f5]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Timing of surgical management of facial fractures may differ from the current standard when an associated severe ophthalmologic injury exists; this may necessitate a delay in repair to protect the patient's vision. We set out to demonstrate that good functional and aesthetic outcomes can be achieved in cases where zygoma bone fracture repair had to be delayed for more than 21 days after injury with a specific surgical plan. Using the electronic database from Montreal General Hospital, a level I trauma center, a retrospective review of all facial fractures occurring from 1994 to 2009 was performed. Our review returned a total of 22,727 trauma patients admitted to Montreal General Hospital. Of these, 2672 sustained 1 or more facial fractures. Among the facial trauma patients, 945 patients' injuries included a zygoma fracture, 324 (35.3%) of which were managed operatively. Seven cases had their surgery delayed for more than 21 days after injury, 2 of which were managed using simple osteotomies and plate fixations, without the need for bone grafts. Both patients demonstrated a satisfactory outcome with improvement relative to their preoperative status. We provide a detailed description of our most recent case of a 73-year-old woman in whom the surgical repair of the lateral orbital rim and orbital floor was delayed for 10 weeks to allow healing of her associated traumatic retinal detachment. For patients with associated ocular injuries who cannot undergo orbital fracture repair within 21 days of the trauma, delayed surgery may still result in an acceptable aesthetic result.

### Temporal posttraumatic limited ocular movement with suspected trapdoor fracture [^341a51ab]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Orbital floor fractures, also known as blowout fractures, are fractures in which the orbital bone is isolated from the orbital floor but with an intact orbital rim. These fractures often occur during engagement in sports or play, motor vehicle accidents, or assaults.–The trapdoor fracture, also called a "white-eyed blowout" is a blowout fracture in which a linear orbital wall fracture occurs. A flap of bone then is displaced outwardly, and it immediately returns to its original position. This is caused by muscle entrapment or connective tissue septa after the orbital floor fracture, and without emergent release, the incarcerated muscles may become necrotic because of ischemia.–In the chronic phase, fibrosis may also develop from inflammation, causing permanent ocular movement disorders. For this reason, immediate surgery is often recommended for orbital floor fractures with symptomatic persistent diplopia or clinical evidence of entrapment. We report a case of spontaneous resolution of diplopia in a patient with a high suspicion of trapdoor fracture.

### Endoscopic repair of orbital floor fractures [^a6e33f35]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Significant orbital trauma can result in orbital floor fractures with subsequent prolapse of the orbital contents into the paranasal sinuses. Prolapse of the periorbita can result in extraocular muscle entrapment, diplopia, enophthalmos, and even visual loss. Management of orbital floor fractures traditionally has been accomplished through transconjunctival and subciliary incisions. These approaches provide adequate visualization and cosmetically acceptable scars. Unfortunately, post-operative lid malposition can occur in a small percentage of cases. Another limitation is easy visibility of the posterior orbit, which often is obscured by prolapsed orbital fat. In light of these limitations, some surgeons have begun to evaluate an endoscopic approach to orbital floor fractures. The endoscopic approach offers a hidden incision, improved fracture visualization, and avoidance of post-operative eyelid malposition. This article reviews the indications, technique, and potential complications of endoscopic orbital blow-out fracture repair.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^fbe25d4b]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Orbital and adnexal trauma — Key clinical indicators and management triggers are described. Pain with motility and diplopia can be indicative of orbital trauma. In children, orbital floor fractures are often caused by significant blunt trauma to the face and orbits and, unlike in adults, may present without significant lid edema and ecchymosis. These fractures are often greenstick-type with entrapment of intra-orbital contents leading to restricted vertical ocular movements, and if accompanied by nausea, vomiting, bradycardia and/or syncope (oculocardiac reflex) urgent surgical repair is needed.

### Incisions for orbital floor exploration [^ab0eb94b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Incisions used for orbital floor exploration continues to remain a topic of controversy. Historically, 3 incisions have been used for orbital floor repair: transconjunctival, subciliary, and subtarsal. Past studies have attempted to stratify the superiority of one incision over the others. Insufficient level of evidence and inconsistent methodology have lead to inconclusive data. Our authors performed a systematic review of literature to assess the quality of evidence in literature and recommend guidelines for incisions for repairing orbital fractures. Thirty-one articles were identified, comprising a total of 4688 incisions. Technique along with individual benefits and complication profiles for each incision is reviewed. Objectivity and follow-up time intervals are necessary parameters for evaluating incisions for orbital floor exploration to further define guidelines.

### Closed head injury combined with orbital blowout fracture and displacement of the eyeball into the maxillary sinus in a 14-year-old boy: a case report [^b0e1c6bc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Consequently, instead of seeking the torn end of the inferior rectus muscle, we used sutures anchored at the insertion points of the four rectus muscles to gently guide the eyeball back into position. Examination of the patient's right eye revealed an intact structure, a dilated pupil, and a sluggish light reflex. The diameter of the pupil was 7 mm. An assessment of the bone defects revealed an absence of the orbital floor measuring 3 × 2.5 cm, a 2 cm deficiency in the orbital rim, and a 2 × 1.3 cm gap in the anterior upper part of the maxilla. To address these deficiencies, we implanted a MEDPOR TITAN (ORBITAL FLOOR AND WALL MTB RIGHT) (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) prosthesis, approximately 3.1 × 2.6 cm in size (1.0-mm-thick), into the inferior orbital rim. The graft effectively covered the defect caused by the orbital floor fracture. As for the defect in the superior orbital wall, the brain surgeon convinced that the patient needed a second-stage skull base repair surgery in rid of leakage of cerebrospinal fluid after 6 months to 1 year. Skull base repair is more efficient than orbital roof repair to achieve better stability, so there is no need to repair the supraorbital wall during this operation.

### Differences in common orbital blowout fracture sites by age [^4af134b5]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to compare orbital blowout fracture sites among different age groups.

Methods

This retrospective, observational, comparative study included 671 sides of 663 patients with an orbital blowout fracture. The authors classified patients into five groups based on age (childhood, 0 to 9 years; adolescence, 10 to 18 years; early adulthood, 19 to 44 years; middle adulthood, 45 to 64 years; and late adulthood, 65 years or older); causes of injury into five categories (i.e., sports, traffic accident, assault, fall, and others); and orbital blowout fracture sites into four regions [i.e., the orbital floor lateral (lateral floor) or medial to the infraorbital groove/canal (medial floor); the inferomedial orbital strut (strut); and the medial orbital wall (medial wall)].

Results

A single medial floor fracture was observed in 70.3 percent of patients in the childhood age group. However, the proportion of patients with a single medial wall fracture or multiple fracture sites increased with age. A medial wall fracture was more common than a medial floor fracture in late adulthood. The distribution of orbital blowout fracture sites, the ratio of single or multiple fracture sites, and the causes of injury were statistically different among the age groups (p = 0.005, p = 0.003, and p < 0.001, respectively, Pearson chi-square test).

Conclusions

Common orbital blowout fracture sites varied among age groups. These differences may be attributed to multiple factors, including differences in the morphology of the orbit and paranasal sinuses, composition of the facial bone, and causes of injury among age groups.

### Facial fractures: classification and highlights for a useful report [^5211f2b6]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The outer cardinal lines are composed of the frontal and zygomatic bone processes as well as the maxilla inferiorly. Generally, these outer lines are repaired first in complex injuries and provide the foundation upon which the more central naso-orbito-ethmoidal region can be reconstructed.

The most important point for classification is the displacement and/or comminution of the central fragment of the medial orbital wall, where the medial canthal tendon inserts. Multidetector CT cannot depict the medial canthal tendon itself, but reporting the degree of comminution of the medial orbital wall at the level of the lacrimal fossa can help surgeons plan repair of the tendon.

It is also important to report the degree of comminution of the nasal bones, frontal processes of the maxilla, and nasal processes of the frontal bones to help surgeons decide whether bone grafting is required.

### Safety of outpatient isolated orbital floor fracture repair [^dd11df13]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Orbital fractures are common, accounting for nearly 40% of all facial fractures. Open repair is required to restore preinjury orbital volume and relieve any extra-ocular muscle entrapment. Monitoring for postoperative intraorbital hemorrhage, and its consequent potential for visual impairment, has triggered most surgeons to observe their patients in the hospital overnight postoperatively. The real risk of postoperative hemorrhage in this patient group, however, is uncertain and the need to contain healthcare costs clear. The objective of this study was thus to determine the incidence of emergent postoperative complications in patients undergoing orbital fracture repair to determine the feasibility of performing this operation on an outpatient basis. Patients who sustained isolated orbital fractures and underwent open repair at this level-1 trauma center between January 2002 and January 2012 using International Classification of Disease-9 and Current Procedural Terminology 2012 coding were identified. Demographic data and postoperative complications were identified by reviewing the electronic medical record. Furthermore, critical analysis of available published evidence was performed. Ninety-three patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria were selected. There were no patients of an intraorbital hematoma or other immediate postoperative complications that required operative intervention. Average hospital length of stay was 0.85 days. Repair of orbital fractures on an outpatient basis appears to be safe. The theoretical risk of a complicating intraorbital hematoma seems to be between 0 and 3.2%. This can be minimized through: the use of open surgical access site and perforated floor replacement materials, careful early monitoring, education of patients, and admission of those at potentially elevated risk.

### Reconstruction of orbital floor with auricular concha [^3dac4948]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Orbital floor fractures of varying sizes commonly occur after orbital injuries and remain a serious challenge. Serious complications of such fractures include enopthalmos, restriction of extraocular movement, and diplopia. There is a dearth of literature that can be applied widely, easily, and successfully in all such situations, and therefore there is no consensus on the treatment protocol of this pathology yet. Autogenous grafts and alloplastic and allogenic materials with a wide variety of advantages and disadvantages have been discussed. The value of preoperative and postoperative ophthalmological examination should be standard of care in all orbital fracture patients. An ideal reconstructed orbital floor fracture should accelerate the restoration of orbital function with acceptable cosmetic results. Management parameters of orbital fractures such as timing of surgery, incision type, and implant materials, though widely discussed, remain controversial. In this study, 55 patients with orbital floor fractures surgically reconstructed with conchal cartilage grafts between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Complications and long-time follow-up visit results have been reported with clinical and radiographic findings. The aim of this study was to present the authors' clinical experiences of reconstruction of blow-out fractures with auricular conchal graft and to evaluate the other materials available for use.

### Zygoma fractures: when should you repair the orbital floor? [^071f252d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) is one of the most commonly fractured areas of the midface. As the zygoma is an inherent component of the orbit, any fracture of the ZMC naturally involves the orbital floor. Previous research has focused on the surgical outcomes and complications of zygomatic fractures, but few have explored indications for orbital floor exploration alongside zygoma reduction. This study evaluates whether specific clinical and radiographic parameters predict the need for orbital floor reconstruction.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of all patients with zygoma fractures managed by the plastic surgery service from 2015 to 2023. All patients underwent orbital floor exploration at the time of ZMC reconstruction, with implants placed when determined necessary. Computed tomography imaging was assessed for the presence of co-occurring fracture elements: zygomatic displacement at the infraorbital rim, zygomaticomaxillary buttress, zygomaticofrontal suture, and zygomaticotemporal suture; and orbital floor displacement in the anterior-posterior, inferior-superior, and transverse directions. Logistic regression models were used to assess the adjusted effects of age and sex on implant placement.

Results and Conclusion

Seventy-nine zygomatic fracture cases met the study criteria, with 43 receiving an implant after orbital floor exploration. For every 1 mm increase in zygomatic displacement in the anterior-posterior direction, patients had 1.30 times higher odds of receiving an orbital implant (P = 0.015). Rectus rounding and orbital floor defect volume were similarly among the strongest indications for orbital floor implant placement (P < 0.001).

### Application of three-dimensional printing technology in the orbital blowout fracture reconstruction [^cd05fa66]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of orbital blowout fracture repair by using the three-dimensional (3D) printing-assisted fabrication of individual titanium mesh. Clinical and radiologic data were analyzed for 12 patients with orbital floor and/or medial wall fractures. Lower eyelid incision was used to expose the fractures. Preoperative computed tomographic data were input into an imaging software to rebuild a 3D orbit and mirror the unaffected side into the affected side to replace the demolished orbit. A resin model of the reshaped orbit was generated and used to develop an individual titanium mesh for repairing the fractured orbital. The surgical results were assessed by value of enophthalmos and a comparison of preoperative and postoperative orbital volume difference. All patients had a successful treatment outcome without any complications. Clinical significant enophthalmos were not observed after treatment, and diplopia were solved within 2 weeks postoperative. No extraocular muscle limitation was observed. Postoperative computed tomography scans demonstrated appropriate positioning of titanium mesh and there was no implant displacement. The postoperative orbital volume and enophthalmos difference between the 2 eyes decreased significantly than preoperative (P < 0.001). Three-dimensional printing-assisted fabrication of individual titanium mesh is appropriate for use in orbital blowout fracture.

### Impact of surgical timing of postoperative ocular motility in orbital blowout fractures [^5647e473]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Orbital blowout fractures were first described in 1957 by Smith and Regan, who reported that they are caused by a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure. Blunt trauma to the orbit commonly causes fractures of the orbital floor and/or medial wall. In such cases, there may be trapping or prolapse of orbital soft tissue, and extraocular muscle dysfunction may cause diplopia and ocular motility disturbances.

The surgical timing for the repair of orbital fractures is a topic that is still controversial. Ophthalmologists and many surgical specialists including otolaryngologists, maxillofacial specialists and plastic surgeons treat orbital blowout fractures, so there has not been the common consensus of evaluation of the surgical results. One of the goals of orbital fracture repair is normalisation of ocular motility, and the other is the prevention/management of enophthalmos. Thus, objective methods are needed to evaluate ocular motility presurgery and postsurgery.

Numerous previous studies emphasised the presence of diplopia, but most of those reports did not refer to the objective data of ocular motility. To evaluate ocular motility objectively, we used the Hess screen test, designed by Walter Rudolf Hess in 1908, which helped us to monitor changes in ocular motility of patients with orbital fractures. In cases of orbital fracture, ocular muscle dysfunction within 30 degrees can easily be identified. Furuta et al reported that they evaluated diplopia using the percentage of Hess area ratio (HAR%) based on the Hess chart. In addition, Pier et al reported that HAR% was effective in predicting postoperative diplopia in 30 patients undergoing surgical repair for orbital blowout fractures. The aim of this present study was to elucidate the best timing for surgical repair of orbital blowout fractures by use of HAR% for objective evaluation of ocular motility.

### Delayed onset porous polyethylene implant-related inflammation after orbital blowout fracture repair: four case reports [^d8952b12]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Porous polyethylene implants are commonly used in orbital blowout fracture repair because of purported biocompatibility, durability, and low frequency of complications. However, delayed onset of porous polyethylene implant infection or inflammation may complicate orbital fracture repair. Porous polyethylene sheets may provide an incompetent barrier to sinus infection, and can remain as a foreign body in the fracture site, resulting in an implant-related inflammation.

### Orbital floor fractures: outcomes of reconstruction [^2794d5df]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Since the 1950s, myriad materials have been used to reconstruct orbital floor fractures. Technological advances have afforded new materials for reconstruction. Recent comparisons of materials have not been reported. Retrospective chart review was performed using current procedural terminology coding for orbital floor fractures treated between 1991 and 2009. A total of 510 charts were reviewed; 317 adult patients met criteria. Forty-seven of these patients underwent bilateral floor explorations, yielding 364 orbital floor fractures. Mean age was 33.7 years. Motor vehicle collision, assault, all-terrain vehicles, and falls constituted the majority of injury mechanisms. Impure blowouts were the most common fracture type, and zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures were the most common pattern. Materials included autologous bone, porous polyethylene, titanium, and porous polyethylene with incorporated titanium. Use of bone graft correlated with postoperative orbital dystopia and enophthalmos, as compared with alloplastic implants. Bone rigidity, unpredictable thickness, and resorption may contribute. Once the gold standard of orbital reconstruction, autologous bone may have been eclipsed by modern materials.

### Trauma in facial plastic surgery: frontal sinus fractures [^99bc2897]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The optimal management of frontal sinus fractures remains controversial. Fortunately, the severity of these injuries has diminished with more stringent auto-safety regulations, changing the treatment paradigms used to repair these injuries. Appropriate patient selection and close follow-up may allow for conservative management strategies when dealing with frontal sinus fractures, largely replacing the more morbid and invasive techniques that have been the mainstay for years. Because acute and delayed sequelae can arise after the initial injury, patients should be thoroughly counseled about the importance of follow-up and the need to seek medical care if they develop any concerning signs or symptoms.

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^292e728b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging

CT imaging remains the gold standard for detecting and defining orbital fractures. Imaging of the entire face is recommended as concomitant fractures are commonly encountered. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions (from axial slice thickness < 2 mm), and three-dimensional (3D) rendering is recommended to optimize maxillofacial assessment (Figure 2). The medial wall is best visualized in a bone window axial view. The sagittal view allows for assessment of the orbital floor and availability of the posterior ledge for implant support. Both coronal and sagittal views can be used to assess the orbital soft tissue and evaluate for fat herniation or ocular muscle entrapment.

### Radiographic classification of temporal bone fractures… [^87429a2b]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Setting University trauma center and Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery. Patients Patients with temporal bone fractures. Interventions Clinic records and computed tomographic scans were reviewed to evaluate the clinical predictability of complications of temporal bone fractures. Main Outcome Measures Complications of temporal bone fractures were recorded. Two classification schemes for temporal bone fractures were statistically analyzed and compared as to their ability to predict each complication. Results A total of 234 temporal bone fractures were identified; 30 cases met our strict criteria for inclusion. The traditional classification system of temporal bone fractures did not significantly predict temporal bone complications. On the other hand, the otic capsule–based system did demonstrate statistically significant predictive ability.

Patients with otic capsule–violating fractures were 5 times more likely to have facial nerve injury, 25 times more likely to have sensorineural hearing loss, and 8 times more likely to have cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea than those with otic capsule–sparing fractures. Conclusions The traditional radiographic classification system failed to demonstrate clinical predictability in our series. Furthermore, the newer system of classification demonstrated statistically significant predictive ability for serious clinical outcomes associated with temporal bone fractures. The present study, a retrospective review of temporal bone fractures at a level 1 trauma center, examines a newer classification system for temporal bone fractures based simply on radiographic demonstration of otic capsule involvement.

Our findings provide further support for this newer classification system, a system that is more predictive of clinical sequelae than the traditional system, without losing descriptive ability. Strict inclusion criteria included temporal bone fracture on computed tomographic scan, with a complete medical record documenting facial nerve function and results of pure-tone audiometry. All audiograms were performed with standard air and bone conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz. As proposed by Dahiya et al2 and others, the newer system, based on involvement of the otic capsule, was a far better clinical predictor in our sample population. Otic capsule–violating fractures accounted for 20% of our sample and were found to correlate with statistically significant increases in facial nerve injury, SNHL, and CSF otorrhea.

### Delayed onset porous polyethylene implant-related inflammation after orbital blowout fracture repair: four case reports [^b07c313c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Delayed inflammation related to orbital implantation for orbital fracture repair is very rare. Approximately 350 cases underwent orbital fracture repair using porous polyethylene sheets during the same period from 2007 to 2010 at Samsung Medical Center. Furthermore, there were no other cases out of 1000 patients throughout the entire surgical log of orbital fracture repair at the same institution since 1994. This complication is very rare but should be reported for clinicians who care for orbital fracture patients.

A lack or reduction of fibrovascularization into the implant for orbital fracture repair might play a role in implant infection. Porous polyethylene is susceptible to infection in the early postoperative period before sufficient fibrovascular ingrowth occurs in 3 months. Our patient series showed delayed onset of porous polyethylene sheet-related infection or inflammation after 10 months and up to 8 years, which lagged beyond the duration for fibrovascularization. Mauriello et al. studied 10 patients who developed infections after alloplastic implants with silicone and gelatin film for orbital floor fracture repair, and noted that the predisposing factors were dental surgery, upper respiratory infection, implant extrusion into the maxillary sinus, medial implant migration resulting in dacryocystitis, rhinoplasty, and snorting cocaine. Custer et al. reported small fistulous tracts between the supramid implant capsule and the maxillary sinus that led to infection. In our case series, we speculate that the implanted porous polyethylene sheet and integrated surrounding fibrous tissue adjacent to the paranasal sinuses could still be an incompetent barrier to sinus infection, even after a long postoperative period. In patient 3, the edge of the implant did not cover the whole defect of the medial wall fracture, and which might serve as a precipitating cause of infection (Fig. 3).

### Using the transconjuctival approach alone versus using it… [^4da539fa]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Using the Transconjuctival Approach Alone Versus Using it Together With Lateral Canthotomy in Orbital FracturesClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview All cases will undergo surgery under general anesthesia. Evaluation of patients with suspected orbital fracture should involve radiologic examination, motility test, diplopia field test and exophthalmometry. Plain X-ray films, although rarely used, with the Caldwell and Waters view may be done as a screening evaluation for possible fractures and foreign bodies. An orbital computed tomography, the gold standard in trauma, CT with contiguous thin axial and coronal sections should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and plan for treatment. Postoperative care: Proper postoperative instructions will be given the patient, in addition to the postoperative medications including antibiotics, corticosteroids and analgesics.

This study will be carried out on patients attending the outpatient clinic in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.
10. **Eligibility criteria**:
- **Inclusion criteria**:
- **Age group**: from 15 to 60 years old.
- Patients with pure blow-out fractures. All cases will undergo surgery under general anesthesia. The inferior wall can be easily accessed through transcutaneous or transconjunctival approach. The latter avoids a visible scar and is less likely to result in eyelid retraction. The medial wall can be accessed through transcaruncular approach. Careful exploration under the periosteum allows easy visualization of the fracture boundaries as well as correction of the herniated tissue. Then various implants can be used to support the orbital soft tissue and prevent recurrent herniation. Porous polyethylene sheets are one of most commonly used implant materials.

Other autogenous or alloplastic materials are also available. Periocular fractures are often managed first by the ophthalmologist. With good clinical examination and radiographic imaging, an informed decision can be made whether surgical intervention is required.
- Postoperative care: Proper postoperative instructions will be given the patient, in addition to the postoperative medications including antibiotics, corticosteroids and analgesics. Procedure: orbital fracture

### Management of orbital fractures: challenges and solutions [^c2c46f4e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Many specialists encounter and treat orbital fractures. The management of these fractures is often challenging due to the impact that they can have on vision. Acute treatment involves a thorough clinical examination and management of concomitant ocular injuries. The clinical and radiographic findings for each individual patient must then be analyzed for the need for surgical intervention. Deformity and vision impairment can occur from these injuries, and while surgery is intended to prevent these problems, it can also create them. Therefore, surgical approach and implant selection should be carefully considered. Accurate anatomic reconstruction requires complete assessment of fracture margins and proper implant contouring and positioning. The implementation of new technologies for implant shaping and intraoperative assessment of reconstruction will hopefully lead to improved patient outcomes.

### Orbital floor fractures… [^50339174]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

This report describes a combined ophthalmic and otolaryngologic procedure for early management of orbital floor fractures. The surgeons reappose the fractured orbital rim, moulding and supporting the shattered orbital floor in the desired position under direct visualization. This is made possible by simultaneous use of the Caldwell-Luc approach through the maxillary sinus and a subperiosteal exposure of the orbital floor through an incision in the infraorbital rim. The components of this procedure have been described previously, but the combined ophthalmic and otolaryngologic approach merits re-emphasis as a primary method of treatment. General Considerations The problem of orbital floor fractures and their sequelae have been described in the ophthalmic literature for at least 70 years, and the reader is referred to the papers of Lang, 1 LeGrange, 2 Pfeiffer, 3 Smith and Regan, 4 Converse and Smith, 5, 6 and Schjelderup7 for the development of thought concerning the mechanism of production.

Immediate repair

The oculocardiac reflex may be elicited in an orbital fracture due to entrapment of the extraocular muscles. This can result in pronounced bradycardia, vomiting, syncope, and even asystole. Thus, urgent surgery is necessary to release the incarcerated tissues and relieve the stimulus. The oculocardiac reflex is more commonly encountered with trapdoor-type fractures where a segment of bone is displaced, and then hinges back to a more normal position, entrapping the orbital tissues. This is more common in pediatric patients presumably due to more elastic orbital bone. It is also found to be more commonly associated with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Jordan et al referred to these type of injuries as "white-eyed" fractures, since the child may have a normal-appearing eye until gaze restriction is found on extraocular movement exam. Therefore, it is important to carefully study the CT scans of patients exhibiting these signs and symptoms, as the displaced extraocular muscle on the other side of the bone may be missed on a cursory review of the images.

Studies have shown that early intervention in cases of muscle entrapment resulted in less postoperative diplopia.–It is suggested that the muscle may undergo ischemic injury or become dysfunctional from fibrosis or neuropathic injury. It can be difficult to assess true muscle entrapment in the acute phase as most patients will have some degree of movement restriction as a result of orbital swelling. Forced duction testing can help clarify if entrapment exists. Another relative indication for immediate intervention is significant enophthalmos at the time of injury. Very large bony defects can displace the globe into the maxillary sinus. Certainly, these cases warrant surgical repair to prevent long-term enophthalmos, but some surgeons recommend early intervention for this type of significant displacement.

Complications

The most common postoperative complications are diplopia, enophthalmos, and ectropion. The incidence of the most worrisome complication, vision loss after surgery, has been reported as between 0% and 0.4%. Most of these cases are related to postoperative intraorbital hemorrhage.

Transient diplopia after surgery is common and will typically improve or resolve in a few weeks. However, the reported incidence of persistent diplopia ranges from 8% to 42%.–This degree of occurrence strongly reinforces the need for intraoperative forced duction testing, as implant impingement can certainly be a cause for persistent diplopia. With good implant positioning, it is presumed that trauma to the muscle, fibrosis, or nerve paresis is the reason for diplopia. Hosal and Beatty found postoperative diplopia to be more likely in older patients and those whose fracture repair was delayed. Again, some consideration should be given to earlier repair (immediate or within a few days) in cases where periorbital tissues may be entrapped and damaged.

The reported incidence of enophthalmos following surgical repair ranges from 7% to 27%.–Fat atrophy is speculated as a common reason for this finding, but it may be due to inadequate reconstruction of the orbital cone. Fortunately, this can be corrected with secondary implant augmentation (additional plates or replacement) approximately 3 months after the initial surgery.

Avoiding the use of subciliary incisions may decrease the incidence of postsurgical ectropion. However, more subtle eyelid changes have not been well studied. Raschke et al reviewed over 300 patients who underwent either a transconjunctival or subciliary approach, and noted that subciliary incisions resulted in an increased incidence of scleral show. This finding can result in dry eye issues as well as an aesthetic change.

### The comparison between traditional versus 3D printing combined with computer navigation technique in the management of orbital blowout fractures [^b529ca57]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2018, Kim et alused 3D printing and computer navigation technology to complete the reconstruction of 5 cases of unilateral orbital compound fractures (orbitozygomatic and jaw fractures). In China, Liao et alreported that 28 patients with orbital fractures were operated with 3D printing and computer navigation technology, and achieved ideal surgical results. At present, there are few studies exploring the application of 3D printing technology combined with computer navigation systems to assist in the repair of orbital fractures at home and abroad. The existing studies were often single-arm studies, and the results were not consistent. We used a cohort study to observe the effect of 2 different surgical techniques in the treatment of orbital blowout fracture and found that 3D printing combined with computer navigation technology–assisted orbital fracture repair was significantly better than traditional techniques, while individualized repair was more feasible.

There were no serious complications during and after surgery in this group of patients, especially the optic nerve injury. This was explained by the author's good orbital surgery skills on the basis of standardized orbital surgery training and a track record of hundreds of orbital fracture cases. – However, for some novices, due to the complicated orbital anatomy and narrow operating space, complications are likely to occur when dissecting and exposing orbital wall fractures, especially for patients at a later stage when orbital tissue and periosteum are severely adhered or patients with deep orbital fractures. Navigation reduces the risk of damage to surrounding tissues during fracture repair, and 3D printing can avoid additional risk of iatrogenic trauma due to improper implant trimming and poor implant position.

However, the empirical results reported herein should be considered in the light of some limitations. The number of samples included in this study was limited, and more clinical samples are needed for further in-depth study. Follow-up time should be extended to observe the long-term effect of 3D printing combined with computer navigation technology.

To sum up, orbital fracture repair is an effective method for the treatment of orbital blowout fractures. Compared with traditional techniques, 3D printing combined with computer navigation technology can greatly reduce the surgical risk in the treatment of orbital blowout fractures, improve surgical outcomes, and facilitate precise treatment.

### Closed head injury combined with orbital blowout fracture and displacement of the eyeball into the maxillary sinus in a 14-year-old boy: a case report [^3dbabc7c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to the greater presence of cancellous bone and cartilage in paediatric bones, the facial bones of children exhibit heightened elasticity and flexibility. Therefore, when a child's orbit is subjected to external force, it is more susceptible to fissure-type greenstick fractures or trapdoor fractures, as opposed to extensive defects. As children grow, the patterns of orbital fractures change. Hink et al. suggests that children under 8 years are more prone to orbital roof fractures, whereas children aged 8 years or older predominantly experience orbital floor fractures. Before age 8, the frontal sinus in children is incompletely air-filled, rendering the orbital roof susceptible to fractures from minor impacts. As the maxillary sinus develops and becomes fully aerated, the protection of the orbital floor diminishes, resulting in an increased incidence of orbital floor fractures. The extrusion or entrapment of orbital contents through the fracture gap can manifest as diplopia, restricted eye movement, and even eyeball displacement.

Among the various adverse outcomes of OBF, eyeball displacement and subsequent entrapment in the maxillary sinus are exceptionally rare. A systematic literature search of English-language publications on PubMed revealed only 28 reported cases, with most complications being decreased vision, blurred vision, diplopia, and enophthalmos.

This article reports an extremely rare case involving a 14-year-old adolescent in a car accident with a closed head injury, OBF, and eyeball displacement embedded in the maxillary sinus. After actively stabilising the patient's overall condition, surgical intervention was performed through transconjunctival access to reposition the eyeball and simultaneously reconstruct the orbit.

### The comparison between traditional versus 3D printing combined with computer navigation technique in the management of orbital blowout fractures [^1c3276f0]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Orbital blowout fracture could lead to eye movement disorders, eye displacement, diplopia, eye depression, and ipsilateral facial sensory disturbance. Surgical treatment is the main treatment. However, the orbital anatomy is complex, and the operation is difficult and risky. Traditional orbital fracture repair relies entirely on the experience of the surgeon and cannot guarantee accurate anatomic reduction in every operation. Thus, there is a great need to improve the safety of surgery and the treatment outcome for orbital surgeons. In recent years, digital orbital surgery has developed rapidly as 3D printing technology and computer navigation technology have been gradually applied in orbital surgery. The author has performed hundreds of orbital fracture operations with good results and has published many articles in China's core journals regarding the application of 3D printing materials in orbital fracture. – This study intends to compare the efficacy of traditional orbital fracture repair techniques and 3D printing combined with computer navigation technology–assisted techniques while exploring the surgical effect and complications.

### Orbital index: a novel comprehensive quantitative tool for prediction of delayed enophthalmos in orbital floor fracture management [^3b243e47]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Early identification of surgical indication is critical to optimizing outcomes in orbital floor fracture management. However, identifying those at risk for delayed enophthalmos and requiring subsequent repair has remained a challenge. This study aimed to validate the Orbital Index, a prediction tool using computed tomography to stratify risk for delayed enophthalmos and establish a threshold for repair. The Orbital Index stratifies fractures by size, location, and inferior rectus rounding (a surrogate for fascioligamentous sling disruption) on a scale 0 to 6. A 22-year (1998 to 2020) multi-institution analysis of unilateral isolated orbital floor fractures was performed. Index scores were assigned to each scan, unoperated patients invited for blinded Hertel exophthalmometry assessment, and enophthalmos measurements correlated with Index scores. Interobserver scoring reproducibility was assessed with weighted Cohen kappa. Preintervention and postintervention Likert scale surveys were administered to determine whether this tool improved understanding and communication. The Orbital Index demonstrated high fidelity and interobserver reproducibility and identified a score of four or greater as a surgical threshold. Of 1769 computed tomography scans, 395 met criteria and were included for analysis. Eighty of 395 were managed operatively (operative rate, 20.3 percent). Of 315 patients managed nonoperatively, 41 (13.0 percent) agreed to follow-up evaluation and 28 (68.3 percent) were found to have enophthalmos. Unoperated patients with an Orbital Index score of 4 or higher were more likely to have enophthalmos than those with a score of 3 or less (p = 0.001). The mean weighted Cohen kappa was 0.73, corroborating reproducibility. Communication (p = 0.0003) and ability to correctly identify surgical need (p = 0.01) were improved with use of this tool. The Orbital Index is a reproducible tool to stratify risk for enophthalmos in orbital floor fracture management.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^6f0cbf36]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Nonsurgical management after orbital trauma — waiting 4 to 6 months after orbital trauma is advised because strabismus may resolve on its own unless there is substantial fat and orbital pulley entrapment for which earlier repair is beneficial, and conservative treatment such as occlusion, filters, Fresnel prisms, botulinum toxin injection, and prism glasses may provide temporary or permanent relief of diplopia.

### Naso-orbital-ethmoid fracture repair techniques: a systematic review [^70e75b7e]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Naso-orbital-ethmoid (NOE) complex fractures present a challenge to repair. The classification system used to categorize the fracture type was established in 1991 based off the medial canthal tendon attachment. The primary objective was to systematically review the literature outlining repair techniques for NOE fracture after the adoption of the Markowitz classification system.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify peer-reviewed research. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed articles reporting on operative techniques used to repair NOE fractures in adult patients after 1991. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles and extracted data. Level of evidence was assessed by Oxford Center for Evidence-based Medicine guidelines.

Results

This review identified 16 articles that met inclusion/exclusion criteria representing 517 patients. One article outlined a closed reduction technique with transnasal wiring. The remaining articles discussed open approaches with various exposure techniques, most common being the coronal incision. Miniplates and screws were most often implemented for rigid fixation as well as transnasal wiring to repair disrupted medial canthal tendon and canthal bearing bone in Type 2 and 3 NOE fractures. Ten of the studies included in this review had a level of evidence of 4.

Conclusions

NOE fractures present a complex fracture pattern and challenge to repair. New exposure techniques and multidisciplinary approaches have been described. However, fixation techniques have remained relatively consistent through the years. Surgeon preference and comfort with performing the specific techniques leads to the best patient outcomes. With the low level of evidence referenced, more robust research is needed to evaluate these techniques.

### Delayed onset porous polyethylene implant-related inflammation after orbital blowout fracture repair: four case reports [^9a51f3e2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Porous polyethylene implants are commonly used in orbital blowout fracture repair because of purported biocompatibility, durability, and low frequency of complications. Delayed inflammation related to porous polyethylene sheet implants is very rare and no case series of this condition have been reported.

Case Presentation

This is a retrospective review of clinical presentations, radiographic findings, histopathological findings, treatments, and outcomes of patients who developed delayed complications in orbital blowout fracture repair using porous polyethylene sheets. Four male patients were included with a mean age of 49 years (range 35–69 years). Blowout fracture repair was complicated with implant-related inflammation 10 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 8 years after surgery. Chronic and subacute orbital inflammatory signs were noted in two patients and acute fulminant orbital inflammation was found in two patients. Three patients developed peri-implant abscesses and one patient had a soft tissue mass around the implant. All patients underwent implant removal and two of these patients with paranasal sinusitis had sinus surgery. Histopathological findings revealed chronic inflammatory changes with fibrosis, and one patient had foreign body granuloma with culture positive Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusions

Delayed complications with porous polyethylene sheets used in orbital blowout fracture repair may occur many years following the initial surgery in immunocompetent patients. Low-grade or fulminant inflammation could complicate blowout fracture repair related with the implant.

Results

Patient characteristics

Of the 197 total cases, 145 patients (73.6%) had orbital floor fractures, 29 (14.7%) had orbital medial wall fractures and 23 (11.7%) had combined orbital medial wall and floor fractures. In addition, 133 patients had orbital depressed fragment fractures, 60 patients had orbital trap-door fracture with incarcerated tissue and 4 patients had orbital trap-door fracture with muscle entrapment. The profiles of the 197 patients with orbital blowout fractures of each region and shape are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Profiles of the 197 patients with orbital blowout fractures

The mean elapsed time from initial injury to subsequent surgery was 10.7 ± 7.8 days (range: 0–30 days). The mean postoperative HAR% at final follow-up (92.9% ± 10.5%) was significantly better than the mean preoperative HAR% (73.5% ± 21.7%) (p < 0.01) (figures 3 and 4). Of the 197 total cases, 175 patients (88.8%) attained better HAR%, 2 (1%) had the same HAR% and 20 (10.2%) attained worse HAR%.
