## Question

What monitoring and health maintenance services should I check for a patient with SLE on hydroxychloroquine monotherapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what monitoring and health maintenance services should be checked for a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who is on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals of SLE care and how HCQ fits. Then, I should verify dosing targets and the rationale for dose adjustments. Next, I will examine ocular toxicity monitoring, including baseline, risk stratification, and frequency. After that, I need to check systemic laboratory monitoring and adherence assessment, including the role of HCQ blood levels. Finally, I will integrate disease activity assessment, comorbidity screening, and special populations, and close with a concise, practical schedule and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and why HCQ is foundational. HCQ is strongly recommended for essentially all patients with SLE unless contraindicated because it reduces flares, prevents organ damage, lowers thrombosis risk, and improves survival; it is the anchor therapy on which other treatments are layered, and this applies across adult and pediatric populations, so I need to ensure we are not inadvertently suggesting discontinuation without a compelling reason [^bc0eb531] [^06b62013] [^daa888e7].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing target because this directly affects both efficacy and toxicity. Contemporary guidance favors a long-term average daily HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg actual body weight to minimize retinopathy risk, while acknowledging that short courses at 5–6.5 mg/kg may be needed initially or to maintain control; importantly, there is emerging evidence that doses at or below 5 mg/kg may be associated with higher flare risk, so I should balance ophthalmic safety with disease control and consider therapeutic drug monitoring to individualize dosing rather than reflexively lowering to subtherapeutic levels [^06b62013] [^bc0eb531] [^9f183273].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose alone predicting exposure. I need to check the pharmacokinetic variability and adherence issues. Multiple studies show poor correlation between prescribed mg/kg dose and measured whole-blood HCQ levels, with substantial nonadherence and interindividual variability; low levels associate with higher SLEDAI and flares, whereas levels around 750–1,200 ng/mL correlate with lower disease activity and fewer flares, supporting selective use of HCQ level testing to distinguish nonadherence from underexposure and to titrate therapy when clinically indicated [^beab23de] [^e5405e56] [^39542f07] [^83fa559b].

> Next, I should review ocular toxicity monitoring, since this is the most consequential HCQ-specific risk. I need to ensure baseline documentation and risk stratification: obtain a baseline retinal examination with appropriate imaging before or within the first year, then screen annually after 5 years in low-risk patients, and annually after 1 year in high-risk patients (dose > 5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment with eGFR < 60, concomitant tamoxifen, or chloroquine use), with consideration of more frequent checks if cumulative risk is high; use spectral-domain OCT and widefield fundus autofluorescence as primary screening tools, add 10–2 or 30–2 automated perimetry when structural abnormalities are present, and consider multifocal ERG when results are discordant or to confirm preclinical toxicity [^0c6ddc55] [^07ef000b] [^d59c5d30] [^8d7d9332] [^66a1c785] [^5351a30c] [^b08052c2].

> I should double-check how to classify and act on abnormal results. The RCOphth framework classifies findings as no toxicity, possible toxicity, or definite toxicity; if definite toxicity is confirmed, discontinuation is generally indicated, whereas possible toxicity warrants shared decision-making about dose reduction or continuation with closer surveillance, especially in SLE where alternatives may be limited; I need to ensure written communication to the prescriber and GP and provide patient education materials to support adherence and informed choices [^309dd427] [^a1fb9f56] [^8d2e1afc] [^eae1f79b].

> Let me consider systemic laboratory monitoring beyond the eyes. I should confirm that ACR recommends baseline and periodic CBC with differential, liver enzymes, and creatinine; given renal disease increases retinopathy risk and alters HCQ exposure, I need to check eGFR at baseline and periodically, and if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reduce the HCQ dose by at least 25% to mitigate toxicity; additionally, in men — particularly those of African, Asian, or Middle Eastern descent — I should verify G6PD status before initiation to avoid hemolysis risk, even though this is less commonly emphasized in some rheumatology guidelines [^eda4ed7d] [^bdd456c9] [^d279b486].

> I will now examine adherence and the role of HCQ blood level monitoring. Nonadherence is common and strongly linked to flares and worse outcomes; measuring HCQ levels can reveal subtherapeutic exposure and enable counseling or dose optimization, with several studies suggesting that maintaining levels ≥ 750 ng/mL, and ideally 750–1,200 ng/mL, associates with lower SLEDAI and fewer flares; I should confirm that level-guided strategies are not yet universal standard of care, so I will individualize use based on refractory disease, suspected nonadherence, or dose–response uncertainty [^beab23de] [^39542f07] [^83fa559b] [^e5405e56].

> Next, I should review disease activity and damage assessment. I need to ensure regular assessment of disease activity using validated tools such as SLEDAI or a physician global assessment, with more frequent checks during changes in therapy or clinical status, and at least annual assessment of organ damage; this aligns with treat-to-target principles and helps detect early flares or treatment failure that might otherwise be attributed to HCQ nonresponse [^32fac1a8] [^75663996] [^1d246ad3].

> But wait, what about comorbidities and preventive care that affect outcomes in SLE. I should confirm that patients receive age-appropriate cancer screening, cardiovascular risk assessment and management given elevated CV risk in SLE, infection risk mitigation including vaccination counseling, bone health assessment with DEXA when indicated, and mental health screening; these are integral to comprehensive SLE care and should be embedded in routine follow-up rather than treated as afterthoughts [^a65c2f39] [^f4378e82].

> Let me think about special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy, I should strongly recommend continuation of HCQ and add low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, with antiphospholipid antibody testing early in pregnancy; in advanced CKD or ESRD, I need to weigh ongoing SLE activity against increased retinopathy risk and consider dose reduction or alternative strategies; in older adults with stable, low disease activity, cautious dose reduction may be reasonable, but I should monitor closely for flares and maintain shared decision-making [^a60c24d8] [^6724595a] [^b0d68427] [^ce94a5ee].

> I should double-check that my practical schedule is coherent and reference-aligned. Baseline: establish indication, counsel on benefits and risks, document actual body weight, calculate target dose (aim ≤ 5 mg/kg/day long term), obtain baseline retinal exam with SD-OCT and FAF, baseline CBC, LFTs, and creatinine/eGFR, and consider G6PD in men; annually after 5 years: retinal screening with SD-OCT and FAF, add visual fields and mfERG as indicated, and repeat CBC, LFTs, creatinine/eGFR; high-risk patients: annual screening after 1 year; throughout: assess disease activity at each visit, reinforce adherence, and consider HCQ level testing when disease activity is discordant with expected response or nonadherence is suspected [^0c6ddc55] [^07ef000b] [^d59c5d30] [^eda4ed7d] [^8d7d9332].

> Hold on, I should verify the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. HCQ remains mandatory unless contraindicated, with dosing balanced between ≤ 5 mg/kg/day for ocular safety and the need to maintain therapeutic exposure; ocular monitoring is risk-stratified and technology-enabled; systemic labs focus on hematologic, hepatic, and renal surveillance; adherence is a major modifiable driver of outcomes, and selective HCQ level monitoring can optimize exposure and reduce flares; finally, SLE care is comprehensive, requiring regular disease activity and damage assessment plus preventive health services to reduce morbidity and mortality [^bc0eb531] [^06b62013] [^0c6ddc55] [^beab23de] [^a65c2f39].

For a patient with SLE on hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, **annual retinal screening after 5 years** [^0c6ddc55] is essential for all patients, with earlier annual screening for high-risk patients (dose > 5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment, tamoxifen use, or chloroquine) [^d59c5d30] [^8d7d9332]. Baseline and periodic labs should include **CBC, LFTs, and creatinine** [^eda4ed7d] to detect hematologic, hepatic, and renal effects. Assess disease activity at each visit using SLEDAI or a physician global assessment [^75663996], and monitor for adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset, skin hyperpigmentation, and myopathy. Provide patient education on adherence, ocular symptoms, and the need for regular monitoring [^eae1f79b], and coordinate care with ophthalmology and primary care for comprehensive SLE management [^1d246ad3].

---

## Ophthalmologic monitoring

### Baseline and routine screening

- **Baseline examination**: Obtain a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, and retinal imaging (spectral-domain optical coherence tomography [SD-OCT] and fundus autofluorescence [FAF]) before or shortly after initiating therapy [^66a1c785] [^8d7d9332].

- **Routine screening**: Annual retinal screening is recommended for all patients after 5 years of continuous HCQ use [^0c6ddc55] [^07ef000b].

- **High-risk patients**: Annual screening should begin after 1 year of therapy for patients with additional risk factors, including daily dose > 5 mg/kg, renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), concomitant tamoxifen use, or chloroquine use [^d59c5d30] [^8d7d9332].

---

### Recommended ophthalmologic tests

| **Test** | **Purpose** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Visual acuity | Detect vision changes | Baseline, then annually |
| Slit-lamp examination | Assess cornea and anterior chamber | Baseline, then annually |
| Dilated fundus examination | Visualize retina and macula | Baseline, then annually |
| SD-OCT | Detect early retinal changes | Baseline, then annually |
| FAF | Identify retinal pigment epithelium changes | Baseline, then annually |
| Automated visual fields (10–2 or 30–2) | Detect functional vision loss | If structural abnormalities are detected [^5351a30c] |
| Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) | Confirm retinal toxicity | If structural and functional tests are discordant [^b08052c2] |

---

### Documentation and communication

Ensure **written communication** from the ophthalmologist to the patient, prescribing physician, and general practitioner detailing the results of each monitoring visit [^8d2e1afc] [^43fffa79]. Also provide patients with **written information** about HCQ retinopathy and the importance of regular monitoring [^eae1f79b].

---

## Laboratory monitoring

### Baseline and periodic laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Monitor for hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia [^eda4ed7d].

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Assess for hepatotoxicity, including AST and ALT [^eda4ed7d].

- **Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)**: Monitor renal function, as renal impairment increases the risk of HCQ toxicity [^eda4ed7d] [^964499f6].

---

### Frequency of laboratory monitoring

Obtain **baseline labs** before or shortly after initiating HCQ therapy, then **periodic monitoring** at least annually, or more frequently if clinically indicated (e.g. changes in dose, renal function, or clinical status).

---

## Clinical assessment and patient education

### Regular clinical assessment

Assess **disease activity** at each visit using validated tools such as the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or a physician global assessment [^75663996]. Also monitor for **adverse effects**, including gastrointestinal upset, skin hyperpigmentation, myopathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^8d7dd62d].

---

### Patient education

Emphasize **adherence** to HCQ therapy and regular monitoring appointments [^ebf57705]. Educate patients to recognize **ocular symptoms** (e.g. blurred vision, photophobia, visual field defects) and report them promptly [^eae1f79b]. Discuss potential **adverse effects** and when to seek medical attention [^8d7dd62d].

---

## Coordination of care

Multidisciplinary care involves **coordinating with ophthalmology** for regular retinal screening and with **primary care** for comprehensive SLE management, including cardiovascular risk assessment, vaccination, and bone health monitoring [^a65c2f39].

---

## Summary of monitoring recommendations

| **Monitoring component** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Ophthalmologic examination (SD-OCT, FAF, visual acuity, dilated fundus exam) | Baseline, then annually after 5 years; annually after 1 year for high-risk patients | Essential for early detection of retinopathy [^0c6ddc55] [^d59c5d30] |
| CBC with differential | Baseline, then annually | Monitor for hematologic abnormalities [^eda4ed7d] |
| LFTs (AST, ALT) | Baseline, then annually | Monitor for hepatotoxicity [^eda4ed7d] |
| Serum creatinine and eGFR | Baseline, then annually | Monitor renal function; adjust dose if eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^eda4ed7d] [^bdd456c9] |
| Disease activity assessment (SLEDAI or physician global assessment) | At each visit | Essential for monitoring disease control [^75663996] |
| Patient education on adherence and adverse effects | At each visit | Critical for patient safety and optimal outcomes [^ebf57705] |

---

Regular monitoring for patients with SLE on hydroxychloroquine monotherapy should include **annual retinal screening after 5 years** (earlier for high-risk patients), baseline and periodic laboratory tests (CBC, LFTs, creatinine/eGFR), regular clinical assessment of disease activity, and patient education on adherence and adverse effects. Coordination with ophthalmology and primary care is essential for comprehensive management.

### Clinical significance of monitoring hydroxychloroquine levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^beab23de]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite the pivotal role that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plays in treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), less than 50% of patients take HCQ as prescribed. Measurement of HCQ blood levels can help clinicians distinguish nonadherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ. Our objective was to systematically review publications and perform a meta-analysis to examine the correlation between HCQ levels and 1) nonadherence and 2) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores, in SLE.

Methods

A comprehensive search was performed. We included observational and interventional studies that measured HCQ levels and assessed adherence or SLEDAI scores in adults with SLE. Forest plots compared pooled estimates of correlations between HCQ levels and reported nonadherence or SLEDAI scores.

Results

Among 604 studies screened, 17 were reviewed. We found 3-times higher odds of reported nonadherence in patients with low HCQ levels (odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.63, 5.35], P < 0.001). The mean SLEDAI score was 3.14 points higher in groups with below-threshold HCQ levels on a priori analysis (δ = 3.14 [95% CI -0.05, 6.23], P = 0.053), and 1.4 points higher in groups with HCQ levels of < 500 ng/ml (δ = 1.42 [95% CI 0.07, 2.76], P = 0.039). Among 1,223 patients, those with HCQ levels ≥ 750 ng/ml had a 58% lower risk of active disease, and their SLEDAI score was 3.2 points lower.

Conclusion

We found a strong association between low HCQ levels and reported nonadherence. Our results suggest that HCQ levels of ≥ 750 ng/ml might be a potential therapeutic target.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^61bc476a]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Recently, measurement of HCQ in whole blood was proposed to help clinicians distinguish non-adherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ and eventually adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability. Several studies underline a significant role for routine monitoring of HCQ levels as a measure of non-adherence.

Despite this finding, there is insufficient information on the overall clinical impact of incorporating routine testing of HCQ blood levels and potential benefits of individualising HCQ doses.

Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess if the HCQ dose influenced the risk of SLE flare (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg per day or greater than 5 mg/kg per day). As a secondary analysis, we aimed to: (1) compare HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and (2) evaluate the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^6655eff0]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study suggests that patients who take the HCQ dosage of 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight tend to have more exacerbation, although the differences were not statistically significant. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing the HCQ dose.

However, we found that low HCQ blood levels predicted lupus flares. Our study supports previous published studies reporting that periodical monitoring of HCQ levels might allow identification of early non-adherence, improve subsequent adherence, adjust the daily dosage based on individual pharmacokinetic variability and overall improve outcome in SLE. Further research focused on defining the optimal conditions for HCQ reduction is needed.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: primary care approach to diagnosis and management [^41272b48]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that affects many systems, including the skin, musculoskeletal, renal, neuropsychiatric, hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and reproductive systems. Family physicians should be familiar with the manifestations of lupus to aid in early diagnosis, monitoring patients with mild disease, recognizing warning signs that require referral to a rheumatologist, and helping to monitor disease activity and treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. The American College of Rheumatology has 11 classification criteria for lupus. If a patient meets at least four criteria, lupus can be diagnosed with 95% specificity and 85% sensitivity. All patients with lupus should receive education, counseling, and support. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of treatment because it reduces disease flares and other constitutional symptoms. Low-dose glucocorticoids can be used to treat most manifestations of lupus. The use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents depends on the body systems affected. Patients with mild disease that does not involve major organ systems can be monitored by their family physician. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be referred to a rheumatologist. To optimize treatment, it is important that a rheumatologist coordinate closely with the patient's family physician to improve chronic care as well as preventive health services.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: diagnosis and treatment [^01f68064]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, pulmonary, renal, and reproductive systems. It is a chronic disease and may cause recurrent flare-ups without adequate treatment. The newest clinical criteria proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology in 2019 include an obligatory entry criterion of a positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1: 80 or greater. Management of SLE is directed at complete remission or low disease activity, minimizing the use of glucocorticoids, preventing flare-ups, and improving quality of life. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with SLE to prevent flare-ups, organ damage, and thrombosis and increase long-term survival. Pregnant patients with SLE have an increased risk of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction. Preconception counseling regarding risks, planning the timing of pregnancy, and a multidisciplinary approach play a major role in the management of SLE in patients contemplating pregnancy. All patients with SLE should receive ongoing education, counseling, and support. Those with mild SLE can be monitored by a primary care physician in conjunction with rheumatology. Patients with increased disease activity, complications, or adverse effects from treatment should be managed by a rheumatologist.

### Hydroxychloroquine and CV events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus… [^f4378e82]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this nationwide cohort study of patients with SLE, a protective association was found between the current use of hydroxychloroquine and the occurrence of CV events, but not between remote use of hydroxychloroquine and CV outcomes, highlighting the value of continuous hydroxychloroquine treatment in patients with SLE. develop severe SLE, while discontinuing hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased risk of disease flare-ups in the months after discontinuation. 5–7 In parallel, recent studies8, 9 identified trends in the reduction of myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism among patients with SLE, but lacked statistical power to conclude a significant benefit associated with hydroxychloroquine use. 8 However, data on the protective effects of hydroxychloroquine on individual cardiovascular events, especially arterial events, in patients with SLE, remain scarce.

The case group was patients with a first CV outcome event occurring at least 5 years after entry into the database to guarantee a sufficiently long period without CV outcomes. A secondary analysis allowed that period to be reduced to 2 years. In both analyses, patients also were required to have at least 3 months after entry into the SLE cohort to ensure a reasonably long window of opportunity for hydroxychloroquine treatment. A sensitivity analysis used only 2 years without any CV outcome events after entry into the study. Accordingly, patients who eventually experienced a CV event could serve as controls until their first CV outcome event. Despite improvements in patient survival, patients with SLE have an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis17 facilitated by steroids, antiphospholipid antibodies, and SLE activity itself.

Following the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommendations, 4 patients with SLE should be treated with hydroxychloroquine continuously, as they have a better overall relative survival rate and a lower risk of developing severe SLE and organ damage. 5, 7 The discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine may increase the risk of disease activity.
5. In this cohort study using a nested case-control design and a national health care database, current treatment with hydroxychloroquine in patients with SLE was associated with a significantly reduced risk of MI, stroke, and OTEs compared with untreated patients. This protective association was not observed after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine treatment. These findings support the protective association of hydroxychloroquine against CV events and underscore the importance of continuous hydroxychloroquine therapy for patients diagnosed with SLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy and ophthalmic monitoring: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Dosing guidance notes, "A starting dose of up to 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight (up to 400 mg/d) followed by 4–5 mg/kg/d for maintenance is recommended. We recommend a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/d based on risk of toxicity at higher doses". Ocular safety guidance specifies, "Retinal toxicity is low at 5 and 10 years (1% and 2%, respectively) but increases over time. KDIGO recommends baseline and annual retinal examinations", and, "Yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in high-risk patients (ie, patients with concomitant tamoxifen use, daily doses > 5mg/kg/d, chloroquine use, or eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) and after 5 years of therapy in low-risk patients".

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1d246ad3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 guiding principles — goals, care approach, and assumptions: The goals of SLE treatment are to achieve and maintain SLE remission or low disease activity state, reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize treatment related toxicities; collaborative care between rheumatologists and appropriate specialists should be provided whenever possible, and shared decision-making is essential to respect patient values and preferences and lead to better treatment adherence and outcomes. Healthcare disparities, including racialized and socioeconomic disparities, are crucial factors impacting outcomes of those living with SLE; treatment recommendations are aimed to alleviate health disparities, and evidence-specific guidance is provided when possible. Some therapies are presented without hierarchy when evidence-based data, clinical expertise, and patient-reported experiences do not clearly support the use of one medication over another; treatment decisions should be individualized to the patient's clinical status and preference, and potential limitations to implementing care recommendations may arise due to limitations in access to testing, specialists, procedures, and medications; if recommended therapies are unavailable, are not tolerated, or are not preferred by patients, we encourage discussion of reasonable alternative therapies. Assumptions include that all treatment recommendations assume other appropriate workups have been done to rule out non-SLE etiologies and organ-specific treatment recommendations assume all patients are taking hydroxychloroquine unless there is a contraindication to therapy.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^d279b486]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/lupus nephritis (LN) — implementation, dosing, monitoring, and adjunctive-therapy practice point are detailed. Because of hemolysis risk in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, measurement of G6PD levels is preferred in men before starting hydroxychloroquine, and all patients should have a baseline retinal examination with annual eye testing, especially after 5 years of use; clinicians should be aware antimalarials may be cardiotoxic. The dosing of hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg ideal weight or 400 mg/d and, during maintenance, should be lowered to 4 to 5 mg/kg/d. Data from multiple observational cohorts show reduced flare and organ damage accrual and a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects, including ocular toxicity, providing the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states adjunctive therapies to manage LN and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^ce94a5ee]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, there was no correlation between the prescribed HCQ dose in mg/kg and the HCQ whole blood level. This may due to individual differences in HCQ metabolism or again to patients' compliance. The lack of a correlation between HCQ dose and levels was already reported. Our data clearly indicate the need for personalised HCQ dosing approaches beyond empirical dosing recommendation through routinely HCQ blood level measurements.

In Cox regression analysis, we found that immunosuppressant therapy was associated with SLE exacerbation. Other cohort studies have reported that patients under immunosuppressive agents have higher flare risk. This could be explained as more aggressive treatment is generally required in case of more severe disease course. Moreover, we observed a protective role exerted by older age, consistent with previous evidence of longer periods of remission in elderly patients. This result may suggest that HCQ tapering may be relatively safe in seniors.

Our study is not without limitations. First of all, our population included a small sample size with mostly white patients and only one man. African descent and male patients, however, are known to have higher morbidity and mortality. Moreover, we studied patients in remission at baseline and hence a lower dose of HCQ could be used for maintenance. A bias by indication can be hypothesised, but it is difficult to quantify (are patients who maintained higher dosage more severe than patients in which physician decided to reduce the dosage?). In any case, we did not find any differences between these two groups and blood HCQ levels did not correlate with the dose prescribed in our study. Finally, there is still a lack of consensus on the HCQ level that would balance efficacy against toxicities. We defined 500 ng/mL as the minimal therapeutic level of HCQ, which was considered as the target in other studies. However, other cut-offs have been used based on interviews of the patients for non-adherenceand of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics study for efficacy.

Since the first systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) guidelines published by the American College of Rheumatology in 1999, accumulating data from observational and randomized-controlled studies, including the advent of biological agents, have stimulated the production of recommendations by various committees and task forces. Still, several areas relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of SLE remain uncertain due to limited or inconclusive evidence, therefore emphasizing the role of expert consensus in reaching balanced and informative statements. This review outlines the most recent SLE recommendations highlighting key differences and important challenges that will also need to be considered in future updates.

SLE poses formidable therapeutic challenges due to its heterogeneity and treatment decisions often cannot be guided by data of high quality. In this review, we attempt to provide insights regarding the treatment of SLE in everyday clinical practice, based on contemporary evidence and our own personal experience. We focus on common therapeutic issues and dilemmas arising in routine care, including monitoring for retinal toxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine, handling of glucocorticoid regimens in order to minimise their adverse events, choice of immunosuppressive medications based on prevailing disease manifestations and optimal use of available biological agents (belimumab and rituximab). We also provide our view on the position of calcineurin inhibitors in the management of lupus nephritis and conclude with remarks on the future perspectives for this challenging disease.

### Therapeutic hydroxychloroquine blood levels are associated with fewer hospitalizations and possible reduction of health disparities in lupus [^4d9840a6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the cornerstone of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; or lupus) treatment, is associated with lower incidence of lupus flare, less organ damage, thrombotic events, and prolonged survival in patients with SLE. However, two current gaps preclude optimal HCQ reception. First, > 50% of patients self‐discontinue receiving HCQ by nine months, and 33% do not refill HCQ after the index prescription. This strikingly high rate of nonadherence to receiving HCQ leads to three times higher hospitalization rates (odds ratio 2.9, confidence interval [CI] 1.2–7.1) and six to eight times higher mortality rates in patients with SLE. Patients with social barriers face higher rates of nonadherence to receiving HCQ that could contribute to higher acute care, worse health outcomes, and disparities in patients with lupus. Second, effectiveness of the American Academy of Ophthalmology–recommended HCQ dosage (≤ 5 mg/kg/day), is largely unknown, and the optimal HCQ dosage is currently debated. Melles et alnoted two times higher eye toxicity risk with HCQ dosages > 5 mg/kg/day. However, Melles et alused HCQ calculations from pharmacy refills, which indicates the actual exposure to HCQ, although the prescribed HCQ dosage could have been more owing to high rates of nonadherence to receiving HCQ. This could explain the recent findings highlighting the two to six times higher risk of flares with reductions in HCQ dosage to 5 mg/kg/day or lower. Balancing risks and benefits could be addressed by routinely monitoring HCQ blood levels during lupus visits to individualize HCQ dosing, improve adherence, maximize efficacy, and minimize toxicity.

### Practice variations in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Canada [^c515bda3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Canada.

Methods

A 63-question electronic survey was developed with the Canadian Rheumatology Association and others. Descriptive analyses of responses were performed.

Results

Survey respondents (n = 175) reported varying practices in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of SLE. Performance of laboratory investigations for diagnosis and monitoring varied, with 78% of responders performing them at least every 6 months. Validated measures of SLE disease activity and damage were not commonly used. Most common first-line agents besides steroids for induction therapy for class III or IV lupus nephritis included intravenous cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil. Antimalarial use was common, with 96% of respondents using these in active skin disease. Over 60% of respondents indicated that 80–100% of their patients were taking antimalarials, while another 25% indicated they used these drugs in up to 80% of their patients. There were 71% of responders who reported completing frequent (6–12 mos) ophthalmology screening in patients taking antimalarials. Biologics were infrequently used. Responders were more likely to stop azathioprine and chloroquine than hydroxychloroquine in pregnant patients with SLE. Other aspects of routine care including vaccination and cardiovascular risk management varied considerably. The majority (80%) agreed that a dedicated multidisciplinary care team would improve SLE care.

Conclusion

Considerable practice variation in SLE management was noted. This may help inform future recommendations for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of SLE in Canada.

### Advances in the clinical use of hydroxychloroquine levels [^e5405e56]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent literature exploring hydroxychloroquine levels and their relationship with disease activity and risk of toxicity.

Recent Findings

There is no clear correlation between weight-based dosing of hydroxychloroquine and the resulting blood levels of the medication. Recent studies have shown that increased hydroxychloroquine levels are associated with lower lupus disease activity and likely also increased risk of medication toxicity.

Summary

Mounting evidence supports use of hydroxychloroquine levels in clinical practice to document adherence and ensure safety.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^94a03418]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based and expert guidance for the treatment and management of non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); treatment and management of lupus nephritis are addressed in a separate guideline.

Methods

Clinical questions for treatment and management of SLE were developed in the PICO format (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome). Systematic literature reviews were developed for each PICO question, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess evidence quality and formulate recommendations. The Voting Panel achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% agreement on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation.

Results

We present recommendations and ungraded, consensus-based good practice statements for the treatment and management of SLE that are applicable to pediatric and adult patients. Recommendations emphasize uniform treatment with hydroxychloroquine, limiting duration of glucocorticoid use, and early introduction of conventional and/or biologic immunosuppressive therapies to achieve and maintain control of SLE inflammation (remission or a low level of disease activity), reduce SLE-related morbidity and mortality, and minimize medication-related toxicities.

Conclusion

This guideline presents direction regarding treatment and management of SLE and provides a foundation for well-informed, shared clinician-patient decision-making. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies, as treatment decisions may vary due to the unique clinical situation and personal preferences of each person with SLE.

### The role of antimalarial agents in the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis [^81e51d47]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that affects various organs. Lupus nephritis is one of the most common, and most important, serious manifestations of SLE. Antimalarial agents are part of the immunomodulatory regimen used to treat patients with SLE; however, their role in the treatment of patients with lupus nephritis in particular is less well recognized, especially by nephrologists. Not all antimalarial agents have been used in the treatment of lupus; this Review will focus on studies using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In addition, this Review will briefly describe the history of antimalarial drug use in patients with SLE, the theorized mechanisms of action of the agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, their efficacy in patients with SLE and those with lupus nephritis, their use in pregnancy, and potential adverse effects. The Review will also cover the latest recommendations regarding monitoring for hydroxychloroquine-associated or chloroquine-associated retinopathy. Overall, antimalarial drugs have numerous beneficial effects in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis, and have a good safety profile.

### Hydroxycloroquine blood concentration in lupus nephritis: a determinant of disease outcome? [^9e1f673b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a recommended drug in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has a long terminal half-life, making it an attractive target for therapeutic drug monitoring. The aim of this study was to establish a relationship between blood HCQ concentration and lupus nephritis activity.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study with data collected from clinical and laboratory records. Inclusion criteria were patients followed in the lupus clinic with biopsy-proven International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society Classes III, IV or V lupus nephritis on HCQ for at least 3months (200-400mg daily) and with HCQ levels measured during treatment. Exclusion criteria were patients on renal replacement therapy at baseline or patients lost to follow-up.

Results

In 171 patients, the HCQ level was measured in 1282 samples. The mean HCQ blood level was 0.75 ± 0.54mg/L and it was bimodally distributed. An HCQ level < 0.20mg/L [232 samples (18.1%)] appeared to define a distinct group of abnormally low HCQ levels. For patients in complete or partial remission at baseline compared with those remaining in remission, patients with renal flare during follow-up had a significantly lower average HCQ level (0.59 versus 0.81mg/L; P = 0.005). Our data suggest an HCQ target level to reduce the likelihood of renal flares > 0.6mg/L (600ng/mL) in those patients with lupus nephritis.

Conclusion

HCQ level monitoring may offer a new approach to identify non-adherent patients and support them appropriately. We propose an HCQ minimum target level of at least 0.6mg/L to reduce the renal flare rate, but this will require a prospective study for validation.

Acute, subacute, and chronic cutaneous lupus — mild, ongoing, skin‑predominant disease despite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or topical therapy — "we conditionally recommend adding quinacrine or switching to chloroquine over adding an immunosuppressive agent". Supporting context states "Change in antimalarial therapy is a common dermatology practice, as it may improve mild rash without the need for more aggressive therapy", and "Quinacrine is not associated with increased retinopathy risk and is available through compounding pharmacies at variable cost; addition of quinacrine is preferred over a switch to chloroquine, given that chloroquine has a higher risk for retinal toxicity than HCQ". If chloroquine is chosen, "we suggest every 4–6-month retinal monitoring (Table 5)" and "Chloroquine is an option in patients without major risk factors for retinopathy (Table 5), with the intention to change back to HCQ when rash is better controlled".

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^bdd456c9]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, "We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C)". Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy "has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus". Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with "a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58)", and "Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low". Safety screening notes that "Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine". For ocular monitoring, guidelines "do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment", and "yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; dose of hydroxychloroquine > 5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise". Retinopathy risk is quantified as "affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be > 20% when treatment duration is over 20 years". Dosing guidance states, "The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤ 2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels", and "a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare". Renal adjustment is specified: "In patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥ 25%". Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine "can be an expensive drug in some countries", and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, "but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted".

### Systemic lupus erythematosus activity and hydroxychloroquine use before and after end-stage renal disease [^e08ac920]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, lupus activity may persist after the development of ESRD. Additionally, new onset of arthritis, lupus-related rash, CNS manifestations, elevated anti-dsDNA, and low complement levels may develop. Therefore, careful clinical and serological monitoring for subtle signs of active disease and frequent rheumatology follow up is advised both, pre and post-ESRD. HCQ may be underutilized in patients with active disease. Further studies are needed to determine the risks and benefits of HCQ in SLE ESRD patients.

### The importance of assessing medication exposure to the definition of refractory disease in systemic lupus erythematosus [^4ac79f9d]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) who have active disease refractory to current therapeutic strategies continues to be a real challenge. Here, we propose that the classic definition of refractory SLE patients - failure to achieve adequate response to the standard of care - should be further refined to incorporate the dimension of adequate drug exposure. Inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability may induce insufficient exposure to many drugs used in SLE, leading to both apparent inefficacy of treatments and inappropriate therapeutic escalation. Among others, we have shown that individual assessment of exposure to mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) could be used to determine whether a given patient received adequate doses of MMF. We have also shown that measuring blood concentrations of hydroxychloroquine could be used as an efficient way to assess observance, which is a critical issue since a significant proportion of refractory SLE patients is likely to have poor observance as the primary source of treatment failure. Finally, we have underlined the importance of assessing drug interactions as SLE patients often require, in addition to immunosuppressants, several other drugs to prevent or treat associated conditions, which may result in decreased exposure to immunosuppressants. Considering these data, we believe that refractory SLE patients should not only be defined as the failure to achieve adequate therapeutic response to the standard of care, but should also incorporate the dimension of inadequate pharmacokinetic exposure and include drug blood level, interaction and observance monitoring.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pregnancy management — testing, hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and monitoring — is specified as follows: in women with SLE who are considering pregnancy or are pregnant, the guideline states, "we strongly recommend testing for LAC, aCL, and anti-β2GPI antibodies once before or early in pregnancy, and against repeating these tests during pregnancy". For medication management, it states, "We recommend that all women with SLE take hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during pregnancy if possible", and, "If a patient is already taking HCQ, we strongly recommend continuation of HCQ during pregnancy; if she is not taking HCQ, we conditionally recommend starting it during pregnancy, if there is no contraindication". For preeclampsia prevention it "conditionally recommend treating SLE patients with low-dose aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily), beginning in the first trimester". Because disease activity impacts outcomes, it "strongly suggest, as good practice, monitoring SLE disease activity with clinical history, examination, and laboratory tests at least once per trimester".

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^b8b1d9e1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We carried out this observational study to compare the outcomes in terms of disease flares of a cohort of patients with SLE according to their prescribed dosage of HCQ (≤ 5 mg/kg/day or > 5 mg/kg/day). In our cohort, we did not show significant differences in flare occurrence according to the different oral HCQ doses, even if we observed a tendency to have lower incidence of disease flares in patients taking more than 5 mg/kg/day. On the other hand, we found that stable therapeutic HCQ levels were associated with lower rates of disease flares. The latest guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology and EULARrecommend the use of a lower dose of HCQ (maximum of 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day) than previously used. This maximum dosage is controversial and is largely based on an ophthalmological studyof nearly 2500 patients, mostly with rheumatoid arthritis and older than 50 years, who have used HCQ continuously for more than 5 years. As that study used pharmacy refill data, they evaluated the actual HCQ intake rather than prescribed dosages. However, disparity between the prescribed and actual intake dose is well-known, especially in young patients with SLE. A recent case-crossover study demonstrated that a higher risk of lupus flares was associated with HCQ dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines. Similar results were reported by a recent analysis of the SLICC cohort data showing that patients who reduced any HCQ dose had an increased risk of flaring, irrespective of the specific dose. On the other hand, other studies reported that HCQ dose reduction or withdrawal did not significantly increase the risk of flares. A limitation of those studies was the lack of information on medication adherence. Adherence to treatment is a problem in patients with SLE and is difficult to identify. Monitoring HCQ blood levels can be important to improve medication adherence in patients with lupus. We found that more than half of our patients have suboptimal adherence pattern. Levels of HCQ below 100 ng/mL in blood reflecting long-term non-adherence to the medication were found in 17 (20%) of our patients. Additionally, 32 (48%) patients showed HCQ concentrations < 500 ng/mL in a visit, although it is possible that in this group, there may be individuals who, due to genetic differences in HCQ metabolism, are adherent but achieve lower blood levels. Moreover, HCQ blood levels improved at the second visit, demonstrating that when physicians discuss adherence with patients, it can improve their behaviours.

Figure 1
The multiple therapeutic benefits of hydroxychloroquine in lupus.

To further complicate matters, the recent development of advanced, more sensitive screening techniques for the detection of HCQ-induced retinal toxicity (eg, 10–2 visual fields, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography) suggests that the latter may be more prevalent than previously believed, reaching 10% or more among long-term users. A daily dose of > 5 mg/kg real weight and a duration of use of more than 5 and, especially, more than 10 years, are particularly associated with heightened risk of retinal toxicity. Patients with chronic kidney disease and pre-existing retinal or macular abnormalities comprise a particularly high-risk group. Considering that, (1) recent data were based on prescription practices rather than actual blood concentrations, (2) drug adherence rates are consistently suboptimal in all studies, and (3) SLE is a chronic disease affecting predominantly young individuals, one could be concerned that physician efforts to improve patient compliance rates in the future may have to come at the expense of increased ocular toxicity.

Where do the above data leave us? Undoubtedly, HCQ is indispensable for the treatment of SLE, but a certain degree of caution is needed. The recommended daily dose should not exceed 5 mg/kg real body weight and periodic eye examination (baseline, after 5 years and yearly thereafter, in the absence of retinal findings) should no more be performed by funduscopy, rather by one of the newer screening techniques recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Of note, the comparative efficacy of lower HCQ doses in terms of disease control and prevention of relapses will have to be tested in practice, as all published trials have used the previously common 6.5 mg/kg target dose. In our practice, we also attempt to reduce to a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day in patients with persistent low disease activity (LDA) or remission, although no robust data exist to substantiate this practice. Measuring HCQ concentrations can be helpful to detect complete non-adherence, but more data are needed regarding concentration-adjusted dosing, owing also to its limited availability. Finally, especially in patients with skin manifestations, quinacrine may be used as an alternative antimalarial, given its reported efficacy in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

### Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine retinopathy: recommendations on monitoring [^25092865]. RCOphth (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cutaneous lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to surveillance for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to consider conducting monitoring for hydroxychloroquine in virtual clinics where visual field testing and dilated retinal imaging are undertaken before later being interpreted by either an ophthalmologist or an allied health professional under the supervision of a consultant ophthalmologist.

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^a1fb9f56]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy — treatment continuation decisions emphasize that patients will choose to stop these drugs to eliminate any further risk to their vision, especially those with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis for which other effective medications are available, whereas patients with severe systemic diseases, such as active lupus erythematosus, may not have good therapeutic alternatives and may choose (in consultation with their medical caregivers) to continue HCQ as long as possible. These choices have become more difficult with increasing ability to detect minimal or "pre-clinical" HCQ toxicity, and some of these patients may wish to continue HCQ with cautious observation, perhaps at a lower daily dose, until signs of retinopathy are more definitive and or nearer to a point that would signal visual risk. The ultimate decision should include the patient and the prescribing physician, rather than the ophthalmologist alone.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^54099e8e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune systemic disease of multifactorial aetiology and with an unpredictable course. It can be characterised by the occurrence of flares, eventually leading to organ damage and an impaired quality of life.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), inexpensive and well-tolerated antimalarial drug, is now one of the most important medications for SLE, showing multiple benefits over several outcomes associated with the disease itself, as controlling disease activity, preventing flares and damage accrual, but also to its related comorbidities.HCQ binds strongly to melanin and can deposit in melanin-containing tissues such as the skin and the eyes, which might explain some side effects like retinopathy or skin hyperpigmentation.

Currently, HCQ is prescribed according to body weight. The recommended daily dosage of HCQ has varied during the years. The 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations stated that the safe daily dose of HCQ is no more than 5 mg/kg of actual body weight per day in SLE to decrease retinopathy occurrence. The current 2020 Joint Statement on HCQ and the 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines confirmed the ophthalmological recommendations. An important concern with the current guidelines is that the efficacy of the recently recommended maximum dose (5 mg/kg/day of real body weight) has not been evaluated for patients with SLE. Many past studies evaluating the efficacy of HCQ considered a dosage of at least 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight per day and it is unclear if this change in HCQ dose would be effective in controlling the disease. Moreover, this dosage is based on data from patients who effectively collected their medication. Unfortunately, less than half of the patients are taking HCQ as prescribed. Adherence to HCQ treatment is an unmet need in SLE, particularly for younger patients who may concern about adverse effects such as of retinopathy. Although non-adherence is an important issue, over two-thirds of rheumatologists are unaware of HCQ non-adherence. Low adherence rates to HCQ, if combined with a lower prescribed dose, may potentially lead to HCQ undertreatment.

### Temporal trends in glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in Sweden [^e39cd618]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course involving multiple organs and requiring different and dynamic treatments. Treatment guidelines have been updated over time as more evidence on treatment effectiveness and safety has accumulated. Acknowledging the increased risk of organ damage associated with long-term use of glucocorticoids (GC), the 2019 update of EULAR guidelines recommended a maximum daily dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone-equivalent GC, which was recently updated to a maximum of 5 mg. In general, GC should only be used during periods of increased disease activity and, when possible, be reduced or discontinued. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is recommended for all patients with SLE, considering the individual's risk for flares and retinal toxicity. However, it is not well understood to what extent new guidelines have led to changes in SLE treatment in practice. Immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biologic agents are also important options to be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation.

### Clinical impact of hydroxychloroquine dose adjustment according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines in systemic lupus erythematosus [^6f6cfdf5]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study suggests that the adjustment of HCQ daily dose to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day of actual body weight does not have a significant impact on the short-term and mid-term outcomes of patients with SLE. Nevertheless, further studies including a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are necessary to reach further conclusions.

### Hydroxychloroquine blood levels in systemic lupus erythematosus: clarifying dosing controversies and improving adherence [^2adce21e]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used for its effect on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and longterm benefits. This can be limited by adherence. One way to assess adherence is to measure blood levels. Conflicting data exist regarding blood levels and disease activity. There is disagreement about dosing; rheumatologists recommend weight-based dosing while some other specialists advocate height-based "ideal body weight" dosing.

Methods

Patients were prescribed HCQ not exceeding 6.5 mg/kg (max 400 mg/day). In hemodialysis, the dose was 200 mg after each session, and in renal insufficiency it was 200 mg/day. Levels were measured at each visit with a therapeutic range of 500–2000 ng/ml. Patients were divided according to baseline blood level. To assess the effect of measurement and counseling on adherence, we compared the proportion of patients with a level of 500 ng/ml or higher based on the number of prior assessments.

Results

The proportion of patients with HCQ levels in the therapeutic range differed significantly by age, sex, and Vitamin D level. There was a trend toward lower levels with renal failure. Blood levels were similar regardless of height and ideal body weight. Comparing those with undetectable, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic levels, disease activity decreased (SLE Disease Activity Index 2.92, 2.36, and 2.20, p = 0.04 for trend). At first, 56% were therapeutic, and by the third measurement this increased to 80% (p ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusion

There was a trend toward higher disease activity with lower HCQ levels. Renal failure dosing led to suboptimum levels. We show that weight-based dosing (max 400 mg daily) is appropriate and that height does not appear to influence levels. Measurement, counseling, and repeated testing can increase adherence rates.

### Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^de80254d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complex and variability in practices exists. Guidelines have been developed to help improve the management of SLE patients, but there has been no formal evaluation of these guidelines. This study aims to compare the scope, quality, and consistency of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of patients with SLE.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to April 2014. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and textual synthesis was used to appraise and compare recommendations.

Results

Nine clinical practice guidelines and 5 consensus statements were identified, which covered 7 topics: diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, neuropsychiatric SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and other manifestations of lupus. The methodological quality of the guidelines was variable, with the overall mean AGREE II scores ranging from 31% to 75%, out of a maximum 100%. Scores were consistently low for applicability, with only 1 guideline scoring above 50%. There was substantial variability in the treatments recommended for class II and V lupus nephritis, the recommended duration of maintenance therapy for class III/IV lupus nephritis (from 1 to 4 years), and timing of ophthalmologic examination for patients taking corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Published guidelines on SLE cover a complex area of clinical care, but the methodological quality, scope, and recommendations varied substantially. Collaborative and multidisciplinary efforts to develop comprehensive, high-quality evidence-based guidelines are needed to promote best treatment and health outcomes for patients with SLE.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^06a25928]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health challenge at a global level. 1 As of May 26, 2020, 1 618 757 Americans have tested positive and 96 909 of those patients have succumbed to this illness. 2 In the absence of a vaccine or any proven therapeutic agent, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, often used in combination, have emerged as a potential therapy on the basis of extremely limited clinical evidence. 3 These drugs are currently being prescribed in COVID‐19–positive or COVID‐19–suspected patients in growing numbers across the United States and around the world. 4

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has also been used to treat arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. Both drugs prolong the QT interval by blocking the KCNH2‐encoded hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel, thereby increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. 5, 6, 7 In general, hydroxychloroquine is reasonably well tolerated and used chronically in arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus patients without heart rhythm monitoring. 8 In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning for azithromycin following multiple reported cases of corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation followed by torsades de pointes. 9 Because the use of these drugs in COVID‐19 patients is so recent and based largely on in vitro studies 10 and anecdotal observations, 11 randomized clinical trial data are lacking, and community prescribing practices are as yet unclear. More important, there is no information available about the extent of QTc prolongation with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. From first principles, simultaneous block of the hERG/Kv11.1 cardiac potassium channel with both agents may cause critical QTc prolongation and an elevated risk of torsades de pointes. We therefore evaluated prescribing practices and monitored the QTc in COVID‐19–positive or COVID‐19–suspected patients who received these medications.

Materials and methods

Study patients

Consecutive adult patients admitted to the Rheumatology Unit of the University of Campania 'L Vanvitelli' in Naples in a 24-month period starting in November 2014 were recruited. We selected all patients on HCQ therapy at baseline or during the follow-up.

Each of them signed an informed consent form and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria:

Be adults with a diagnosis of SLE according to the 2012 classification criteria of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC).
State of remission according to the 2021 Definitions of Remission in SLE (DORIS) criteria for at least 1 year.
Have a stable daily dose of HCQ for at least 6 months (200 or 400 mg every day).
Have a stable dose of glucocorticoids during the preceding 4 weeks.
Have had no modification of an immunosuppressant during the previous 2 months.

Exclusion criteria were patients who were pregnant, who planned a pregnancy and who were unable to sign the informed consent, with known or suspected non-adherence to the treatment, retinopathy, a severe cataract that made ophthalmological monitoring impossible, estimated glomerular filtration rate (calculated from serum creatinine according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation) lower than 60 mL/min, chronic alcoholism and liver failure. All participants provided written informed consent. Each patient, on admission, underwent a complete history taking, physical examination and laboratory investigations. We then categorised patients based on HCQ dose as either less than or equal to 5 mg/kg per day or greater than 5 mg/kg per day. The reasons underlying HCQ dose were not recorded, but low HCQ dose may have been due to reflect the 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines, or low SLE activity.

KDIGO 2022 — hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis — states: Recommendation 10.2.1.1, we recommend that patients with SLE, including those with LN, be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C); reported benefits include lower flare (including kidney) rates, higher rates of remission, lower incidence of cardiovascular and thrombotic events in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, less organ damage, improved lipid profile, and better preservation of bone mass; hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus; potential side effects are uncommon but include skin rash, increase in skin pigmentation, muscle weakness, and visual change or loss of vision; moderate-quality data support the benefit of hydroxychloroquine use in patients with SLE, with LN evidence predominantly from observational studies and post hoc analyses, and in a 24-week RCT that included 47 patients the Canadian Hydroxychloroquine Study Group reported a higher incidence of SLE flares in patients who stopped hydroxychloroquine compared to those who continued treatment, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50.

### Hydroxychloroquine dose and the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus flares… [^9f183273]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine prevents systemic lupus erythematosus flares and is recommended for all patients with SLE. 1 However, its long-term toxicity includes retinopathy, particularly at doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. 2 This dose-dependent risk led to 2016 ophthalmology guidelines3 and subsequent rheumatology recommendations1 to avoid prescribing hydroxychloroquine doses greater than 5 mg/kg per day. We assessed the association of this dose threshold on lupus flares. We identified patients with SLE from Massachusetts General Hospital who had 2 or more rheumatology visits and used hydroxychloroquine between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, the 5-year period immediately following the 2016 hydroxychloroquine dosing guidelines. 3 This study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board, which waived informed consent.

We used conditional logistic regression analysis, matched within a patient, to assess the association of hydroxychloroquine dose over the prior 6 months with the risk of lupus flares, adjusting for glucocorticoid use, immunosuppressant use, and disease activity prior to each period. We repeated the analysis limited to moderate or severe flares, with mild flares included as control periods. We conducted subgroup analyses by SLE duration, history of lupus nephritis, and baseline SLEDAI score. To characterize the dose-response trend for the risk of lupus flares, we used restricted cubic splines to generate a smoothed dose odds ratio curve. We used SAS version 9.
4. Statistical significance was set at a 2-sided P <.
05. The mean baseline clinical SLEDAI score was 3. 5; 25 had lupus nephritis, 72 used glucocorticoids, and 80 used oral immunosuppressants. In this case-crossover study within a contemporary SLE cohort, hydroxychloroquine dosing of 5 mg/kg per day or less, in accordance with current ophthalmology and rheumatology guidelines, was associated with a higher risk of lupus flares, including moderate or severe flares. Furthermore, the dose trend analysis also suggested an apparent threshold near 5 mg/kg per day.

### Development of American College of Rheumatology quality measures for systemic lupus erythematosus: a modified Delphi process with rheumatology informatics system for effectiveness (RISE) registry data review [^b534ba4e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to develop readily measurable digital quality measure statements for clinical care in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using a multistep process guided by consensus methods.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) workgroup of SLE experts reviewed all North American and European guidelines from 2000 to 2020 on treatment, monitoring, and phenotyping of patients with lupus. Workgroup members extracted quality constructs from guidelines, rated these by importance and feasibility, and generated evidence-based quality measure statements. The ACR Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) Registry was queried for measurement data availability. In 3 consecutive Delphi sessions, a multidisciplinary Delphi panel voted on the importance and feasibility of each statement. Proposed measures with consensus on feasibility and importance were ranked to identify the top 3 measures.

Results

Review of guidelines and distillation of 57 quality constructs resulted in 15 quality measure statements. Among these, 5 met high consensus for importance and feasibility, including 2 on treatment and 3 on laboratory monitoring measures. The 3 highest-ranked statements were recommended for further measure specification as SLE digital quality measures: 1) hydroxychloroquine use, 2) limiting glucocorticoid use > 7.5 mg/day to < 6 months, and 3) end-organ monitoring of kidney function and urine protein excretion at least every 6 months.

Conclusion

The Delphi process selected 3 quality measures for SLE care on hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoid reduction, and kidney monitoring. Next, measures will undergo specification and validity testing in RISE and US rheumatology practices as the foundation for national implementation and use in quality improvement programs.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^9ccff7d8]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Class V lupus nephritis — prevalence, treatment rationale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, and suggested management: Practice Point 10.2.4.1 states a suggested approach in Figure 94. Class V LN accounts for 5%–10% of all LN cases. Because 10%–30% of patients with Class V LN and nephrotic proteinuria progress to kidney failure during long-term follow-up, heavy proteinuria does not usually spontaneously remit and increases cardiovascular morbidity and thrombosis risk, treatment of Class V patients who have nephrotic-range proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome (NS) is warranted. A small RCT showed remission was more likely with prednisone plus cyclophosphamide (60%) or prednisone plus cyclosporine (84%) than prednisone alone (27%). Figure 94 outlines management: for low-level proteinuria — renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control, immunosuppressive treatment guided by extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and hydroxychloroquine; for nephrotic syndrome — renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control, combined immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoid and one other agent (e.g., mycophenolic acid analogs, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, rituximab, azathioprine), and hydroxychloroquine; additionally, monitor the level of proteinuria and prevent or treat complications (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema), and if proteinuria worsens and/or complications develop, consider immunosuppressive therapy.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^35bcc21b]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Class V lupus nephritis — management of pure Class V disease after kidney biopsy is organized by proteinuria level. For low-level proteinuria, management includes renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control, immunosuppressive treatment guided by extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and hydroxychloroquine, with concurrent monitoring to prevent or treat complications (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema). For nephrotic-range proteinuria, management includes renin-angiotensin system blockade and blood pressure control plus combined immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoid and one other agent (examples: mycophenolic acid analogs, cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitor, rituximab, azathioprine), with the note that there are insufficient data for recommendation of glucocorticoid regimen and that a moderate or reduced dose is preferred; hydroxychloroquine is also listed. If proteinuria worsens and/or complications of proteinuria develop (e.g., thrombosis, dyslipidemia, edema), consider immunosuppressive therapy.

### Predictors of unsuccessful hydroxychloroquine tapering and discontinuation: can we personalize decision-making in systemic lupus erythematosus treatment? [^1c97d002]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To exclude the possibility that the reasons for tapering/stopping HCQ may be biasing our results, we evaluated the effects of the calendar year, considering the date that the AAO guideline was published, and retinal damage in the respective cohorts. Among patients tapering HCQ, 30% had their dose reduced after the AAO guideline was published, and the inclusion of the calendar year variable in the multivariable model for the taper cohort did not yield different estimations. Similarly, among those stopping HCQ, 8% had retinal damage (identified using the SLICC damage index) at baseline, and adjusting for it did not change the multivariable model. Although we did not evaluate adherence, by adjusting the analyses for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and multiple medications, we accounted for factors that are themselves strong predictors of adherence in SLE. At Canadian centers, measurements of HCQ levels are not part of usual care and are rarely obtained. Nevertheless, the literature indicates that approximately 30% of patients with SLE are nonadherent to HCQ treatment, so most patients with active disease at baseline who stopped HCQ probably did so on their own (possibly due to side effects or other concerns), since physicians do not commonly discontinue treatment in patients with active SLE.

Our multivariate analyses suggested that prednisone use and a SLEDAI‐2K score of ≥ 4 at the time of HCQ tapering were associated with a greater risk of a poor outcome, as was Asian race/ethnicity. Among those discontinuing HCQ, the risk of a poor outcome was greater for Black patients and those diagnosed with SLE at age ≤ 25 years. In patients who maintained HCQ therapy, baseline immunosuppressive use and First Nations ethnicity were associated with poor outcomes. The identification of multiple demographic and clinical predictors of poor outcomes after HCQ taper/discontinuation may be useful in personalizing decisions for patients with SLE (and their physicians) around medication de‐escalation or maintenance, as well as monitoring for flares when HCQ tapering or stopping is needed, such as in the current setting of potential HCQ shortages due to interest in this drug as a therapy for COVID‐19.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^ab86062f]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

We identified a combination of clinical criteria — LLDAS/DORIS attainment, hydroxychloroquine use and gradual GC dose reduction over > 6 months — associated with the lowest flare incidence on GC withdrawal, while also minimising damage accrual. This is line with findings from the Toronto Lupus Clinicand the Asia-Pacific Lupus Collaborationdemonstrating that, in patients with clinically inactive SLE, successful GC withdrawal (based on slow prednisone tapering) may also prevent damage. We highlight the importance of a coordinated care plan based on: (1) treat-to-target approach, aiming for remission or low disease activity using conventional and/or biological agents as needed, use of hydroxychloroquine as an 'anchor' drug and (3) regular monitoring and tapering of GC. Prospective studies should verify the effectiveness of combining these criteria in maximising flare-free and damage-free prognosis in patients with SLE who taper and discontinue GCs.

Limitations of our study include its observational nature, although data were collected prospectively. Despite other comparable characteristics, patients who did not discontinue GCs had a higher frequency of serological activity at inclusion compared with those who withdrew, which may have introduced some unmeasured confounding or bias. While the follow-up period was extended to the end of 2022, the use of belimumab was still limited, and newer biologics like anifrolumab were unavailable. Moreover, we did not evaluate factors related to flares such as medication adherence (including monitoring blood hydroxychloroquine levels). Last, the predominance of moderate/severe disease, white race and low prevalence of certain manifestations, such as nephritis, may limit the generalisability of our results.

In conclusion, withdrawing GCs in patients with SLE poses a risk of relapse, highlighting the importance of vigilant clinical monitoring. Nevertheless, this hazard can be lowered in patients who achieve remission or low disease activity, use hydroxychloroquine and follow a gradual GC dose-reduction plan. A strategy incorporating these factors may enable successful tapering and withdrawal, pending confirmation in future studies. Patients with arthritis or mucocutaneous involvement are especially prone to flares and may benefit from such risk-mitigation measures, as well as the early use of novel biologic agents with disease-modifying potential. These findings might be helpful to guide future updates of SLE management recommendations.

### Reference range of hydroxychloroquine blood levels that can reduce odds of active lupus and prevent flares [^39542f07]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent data show that lower hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) doses are associated with a two- to six-fold higher risk of lupus flares. Thus, establishing an effective reference range of HCQ blood levels with upper and lower bounds for efficacy may support individualizing HCQ dosing to prevent flares.

Methods

HCQ levels in whole blood and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were measured during the baseline visit and again during a standard of care routine follow-up visit. Active cross-sectional lupus at baseline was defined as SLEDAI ≥ 6; a within subject flare was defined as a subsequent three-point increase in SLEDAI with clinical symptoms requiring therapy change. We examined associations between active lupus and HCQ blood levels at baseline and flares and HCQ levels during 6 to 12-month routine lupus follow-up visits using mixed regression analysis.

Results

Among 158 baseline patient visits, 19% had active lupus. Odds of active lupus were 71% lower in patients with levels within a 750 to 1,200 ng/mL range (adjusted odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.08–0.96). Using convenience sampling strategy during a pandemic, we longitudinally followed 42 patients. Among those patients, 17% flared during their follow-up visit. Maintaining HCQ levels within 750 to 1,200 ng/mL reduced the odds of a flare by 26% over a nine-month median follow-up.

Conclusion

An effective reference range of HCQ blood levels, 750 to 1,200 ng/mL, was associated with 71% lower odds of active lupus, and maintaining levels within this range reduced odds of flares by 26%. These findings could guide clinicians to individualize HCQ doses to maintain HCQ levels within this range to maximize efficacy.

### Therapeutic hydroxychloroquine blood levels are associated with fewer hospitalizations and possible reduction of health disparities in lupus [^83fa559b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonadherence to receiving hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is associated with a three-fold higher risk of lupus-related hospitalization. Monitoring HCQ blood levels could improve adherence to receiving HCQ and efficacy. Yet, HCQ level monitoring is not routinely done partially due to cost and coverage concerns. To establish HCQ level monitoring cost-effectiveness, we reported the following: (1) risk of acute care by HCQ blood levels, and (2) cost of HCQ monitoring versus acute care visits.

Methods

HCQ blood levels were measured during routine lupus visits. HCQ levels were categorized as follows: (1) subtherapeutic (< 750 ng/mL), (2) therapeutic (750–1,200 ng/mL), or (3) supratherapeutic (> 1,200 ng/mL). All lupus-related acute care visits (emergency room visits/hospitalizations) after the index clinic visit until next follow-up were abstracted. In our primary analysis, we examined associations between HCQ levels and time to first acute care visit in all patients and subgroups with higher rates of acute care.

Results

A total of 39 lupus-related acute care visits were observed in 181 patients. Therapeutic HCQ blood levels were associated with 66% lower rates of acute care. In our cohort, two groups, Black or Hispanic patients and those with public insurance, faced three to four times higher rates of acute care. Levels within 750 to 1,200 ng/mL were associated with 95% lower rates of acute care use in subgroups with higher acute care use.

Conclusion

HCQ blood levels within 750 to 1,200 ng/mL are associated with lower rates of acute care in all patients with lupus, including groups with higher rates of acute care. Future clinical trials should establish the causal association between HCQ level monitoring and acute care in patients with lupus.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus activity and hydroxychloroquine use before and after end-stage renal disease [^b0d68427]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lupus related end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most common complication of lupus nephritis (LN). The estimated mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) related ESRD is four-fold higher than in SLE patients with LN alone, and twice higher than non-SLE ESRD patients.

SLE manifestations after ESRD may be underdiagnosed and undertreated, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Diagnosing active SLE post-ESRD presents a major challenge. Patients who achieve clinical remission often stop following up with rheumatologists, making it difficult to monitor for subsequent flares. Some SLE manifestations, such as cytopenias, serositis, and seizures, are difficult to differentiate from complications of medication side effects or uremia. Prior studies have shown that SLE activity can persist even after progression to ESRD; both clinical symptoms and signs of disease activity have been reported after the development of ESRD. However, most studies to date have focused on evaluating SLE disease activity after ESRD onset, rather than on assessing its evolution before and after ESRD. Understanding whether specific symptoms persist after ESRD or a shift towards new manifestations occurs may aid in the diagnosis of SLE manifestations post-ESRD and move towards individualized treatment decisions.

At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines on how to manage SLE related medications after ESRD. Specifically, there is a great deal of uncertainty among rheumatologists and nephrologists on whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be continued once ESRD develops. HCQ is the cornerstone of treatment in SLE that has been associated with less SLE damage, fewer SLE flares and lower incidence of thrombosis. However, these benefits are less well established among SLE patients with ESRD, especially because of the higher risk of HCQ toxicity in this patient population due to decreased renal clearance. Understanding HCQ prescribing patterns and associated factors is a necessary first step towards the identification of patients who may benefit from continuing HCQ, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes in some while decreasing unnecessary exposure and toxicity in others.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to 1) evaluate how both clinical and serological SLE activity evolves pre-and post-ESRD and 2) study the factors that may influence HCQ prescribing post-ESRD. Knowledge gained from this study may aid in the identification of SLE manifestations and HCQ usage post-ESRD.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data sources

Our study combined data from 5 clinical SLE cohorts in Canada (McGill University Health Centre [MUHC] in Montreal, CHU de Québec–Université Laval in Quebec City, Dalhousie University in Halifax, University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, and the Southern Alberta Registry for Lupus Erythematosus at the University of Calgary). The cohorts enrolled unselected patients age ≥ 18 years who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE at the time that they presented to each center (including both incident and prevalent cases). The enrollment and follow‐up period spanned January 1999 to January 2019.

Data on demographic, medication, and clinical variables were collected in a standardized manner at enrollment as well as annually and were submitted to the coordinating center at the MUHC for data harmonization. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review boards at all participating sites.

### Hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy: a dermatologic perspective [^5d9106dc]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatologists use antimalarials to treat conditions such as cutaneous lupus erythematosus. One potentially serious adverse effect of these agents is irreversible maculopathy. Although there is some evidence that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have similarly narrow therapeutic indices with regard to retinal toxicity, the former is thought to be less damaging to the retina and is thus more widely employed by dermatologists. The current recommended maximal dose for hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg/day, with the weight in kilograms used for this calculation being the ideal bodyweight rather than actual bodyweight. Ophthalmologic follow-up is an important component of monitoring patients taking antimalarials. Recommendations for follow-up frequency have varied, and we present the recent guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Despite dose limitations and ophthalmologic monitoring, irreversible retinal damage can occur. Among the reported cases, there does not seem to be any obvious predictor of the development of maculopathy. The idiosyncratic nature of this adverse effect may be related to interindividual differences in drug metabolism. To understand why only some patients develop retinopathy, better pharmacokinetic models need to be developed, and further elucidation of the precise mechanism of retinal damage is required.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to surveillance for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to classify toxicity as follows:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|No toxicity|- No abnormalities suggestive of toxicity detected on spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence|
|Possible toxicity|- Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence result typical of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, but neither visual fields or multifocal electroretinography abnormal|
|Definite toxicity|- Two tests with corresponding abnormalities consistent with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy - spectral domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence typical of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, or either spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence typical of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, supported by either visual field testing or multifocal electroretinography findings corresponding to the anatomical defect.|

### Adherence to ophthalmologic monitoring for antimalarial toxicity in a lupus cohort [^2e120784]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Antimalarial agents (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) are important in the treatment of various rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although these agents may lead to ocular complications, little is known about adherence to policies for ophthalmologic monitoring. We investigated adherence to the 1996 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines (recommending yearly ophthalmologic assessments) at our clinic, and determined the factors associated with nonadherence.

Methods

Chart review of the Montreal General Hospital lupus clinic cohort.

Results

Of 195 subjects with at least one full year of antimalarial exposure during 1996–2001, 5 refused participation and data on ophthalmology monitoring was incomplete for 42. Of the remaining 148 patients, 47 (32%) had missed at least one annual ophthalmology assessment (were nonadherent) during the interval; almost half of these had missed ≤ 2 assessments. Nonadherence was present in 50% of the 52 patients who had been taking an antimalarial agent for ≤ 5 years. In adjusted logistic regression models, cumulative damage (measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR Damage Index) and antimalarial exposure ≤ 5 years were predictive of nonadherence. Adjusted estimates indicated a 1.2-fold increase (95% CI 1.0, 1.5) in the odds of nonadherence for every point increase in the total Damage Index score. The adjusted OR for individuals exposed to an antimalarial for ≤ 5 years was 5.2 (95% CI 2.1, 13.8).

Conclusion

Our results indicate incomplete adherence to ACR guidelines at our center. Because patients with higher Damage Index scores were more likely to have missed ophthalmology appointments, even after adjusting for pertinent covariates, it suggests that sicker patients may be more at risk of nonadherence. The association of nonadherence with duration of antimalarial exposure, while not surprising, is still an important reminder that adherence to ophthalmologic monitoring may decrease as risk for retinal toxicity is increasing.

### Guidelines on prescribing and monitoring antimalarials in rheumatic diseases: a systematic review [^a2ec7404]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this systematic review was to identify existing guidelines for antimalarial prescribing and monitoring, specifically for hydroxychloroquine, and how these guidelines compare and have evolved over time.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using Embase and Medline to identify guidelines published from 1946–2018. MeSH terms were used and alternative spelling and related words were entered as keywords to broaden results.

Results

243 results were reviewed to obtain 11 recommendations. Ophthalmology sources included the American Academy of Ophthalmology, Royal College of Ophthalmologists and Canadian editorials. The American College of Rheumatology and Canadian Rheumatology Association consensus statements summarised rheumatology recommendations. Recently, American and British guidelines changed from suggesting hydroxychloroquine doses ≤ 6.5 mg/kg/day to ≤ 5 mg/kg/day. American guidelines recommended baseline visual field (VF) testing and annual screening after five years. Visual field (VF) testing evolved from the Amsler grid to current recommendations of 10–2 automated VF and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The 2012 Canadian recommendations suggested initial VF testing every two years, with SD-OCT after 10 years. Older British guidelines advocated for baseline and annual assessment with Amsler grids during rheumatology clinic visits. The 2018 British guidelines supported baseline and annual screening after five years with 10–2 VF, SD-OCT and fundus autofluorescence.

Conclusions

The newest recommendations are heterogeneous suggesting lower hydroxychloroquine dosing. Retinal toxicity is irreversible and the risk increases over time. Annual screening after five years with automated VF and SD-OCT may be warranted to detect early changes and discontinue therapy if necessary.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^fbd5d67a]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines for SLE recommend using a hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dose less than 5.0mg/kg/day to reduce the risk of retinopathy. To determine if this dose reduction would have an impact on the clinical course of SLE, we compared flare incidence in a cohort of patients with SLE treated with two different oral HCQ dosages (≤ 5mg/kg/day or > 5mg/kg/day). As a secondary analysis, we compared HCQ blood levels between the two different oral dosages, and evaluated the frequency of non-adherence in patients with SLE treated with HCQ.

Methods

We identified a cohort of patients with SLE taking HCQ for at least 6 months and followed for 24 months. At study entry and 6 months later, a blood venous sample was taken to measure HCQ blood levels by liquid chromatography. Incidence of new SLE flares after recruitment was put in relation to daily HCQ dose and mean HCQ blood levels. Cox regression analysis served to identify factors associated with SLE flares.

Results

83 patients were enrolled. We observed 11 (16%) flares that developed in mean 14.8 months of follow-up. The difference in terms of flare rate and mean HCQ blood levels between the two oral dosages was not statistically significant. There was a trend (p = 0.08) for high HCQ dose being associated with a lower flare rate. At Cox analysis, higher HCQ blood levels and older age at baseline were protective against flare occurrence, while concomitant immunosuppressant therapy showed significant positive association. HCQ blood levels did not correlate with prescribed HCQ dose.

Conclusion

Patients with low oral HCQ dosage tend to have more flares, although the difference was not statistically significant. Higher HCQ blood levels were protective against flare occurrence. The risks and benefits must be balanced in choosing HCQ dose.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarker response and efficacy of E6742: a dual antagonist of toll-like receptors 7 and 8, in a first in patient, randomised, double-blind, phase I / II study in systemic lupus erythematosus [^d1a2258d]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease characterised by systemic inflammation in various organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys and central nervous system. SLE is more common in young female adults (9:1 ratio of females to males). The reported global prevalence of SLE varies considerably, ranging from 3.2 to 517.5 per 100 000 individuals. According to the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for the management of SLE (2023 update), it should be treated as early as possible and aiming for remission or at least low disease activity to avoid organ damage. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is currently recommended for all patients with SLE unless contraindicated, while the use of glucocorticoids has shifted from mainstay of treatment to a 'bridging therapy' limited to minimal use on the basis of detrimental effects. In patients who do not respond to HCQ (alone or in combination with glucocorticoids) or are unable to reduce glucocorticoids, addition of immunosuppressants and/or biologics should be considered. However, most of these conventional drugs cause serious side effects, leading to the anticipation of development of more targeted therapies.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^102c5d99]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The strengths of the current study include a large number of responses from experienced rheumatologists/lupus experts who regularly prescribe HCQ to their patients, and an estimated cohort of 45 612 patients with SLE. The questionnaire was extensive and used multiple modalities (multiple-choice questions, ranking questions, clinical vignettes) to capture rheumatologists' familiarity with dosing, screening/monitoring and risk factors outlined in the 2016 AAO guidelines.

Limitations of this study included the following: (1) the cross-sectional survey-based data from a convenience sample of self-identified lupus experts may not be representative of the rheumatology community as a whole and thus limit the generalisability of our findings; (2) responses to questions were limited to the options presented to responders in the multiple-choice forms; and (3) the estimation of the occurrence of retinal toxicity did not explore potential associations with blindness (such as cumulative dose of HCQ or comorbidities). Moreover, while the response rate was close to 28%, individuals who chose not to respond may have done so because of their lack of familiarity with the guidelines. The study estimated the occurrence of retinal toxicity and HCQ-associated blindness from reports from rheumatologists. The next steps should include observational data from other large cohorts to confirm the accuracy of the data presented in this study.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^ef37d5f1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The current AAO (2016)and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (2019)recommendations caution against exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual body weight) of HCQ per day. Both guidelines base their recommendations mainly on a single study conducted in the USA in 2014. This study (which only included patients taking HCQ for > 5 years) observed that patients using 4–5 mg/kg HCQ had < 2% risk of retinopathy within the first 10 years of use, while patients exceeding 5 mg/kg had approximately a 10% risk in the same period. In our study, patients had less than 1% risk in the first decade of use. After 10 years, we observed a non-significant trend for higher risk, particularly among patients with a mean daily dose > 5 mg/kg (but the 95% CIs around our estimates were very wide, table 2).

Recommendations from ophthalmology and rheumatology associations include good practices on screening for retinal toxicity, such as annual ophthalmology examination particularly in patients with > 5 years of use and/or other risk factors (dose > 5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment and other factors). Interestingly, three of our patients with retinal toxicity did not have any of these risk factors.

Our univariate analysis suggests that older age at SLE diagnosis may be associated with higher risk of retinopathy. Age was not included as a major risk factor in the 2016 AAO guidelines, but more recent studies also found older age to be a predictor in unadjusted analyses. The loss of retinal neurons with older age may set the stage for the clinical development of antimalarial retinal toxicity. However, the effect observed could be due to confounders. Older patients may be more adherent to drugs (higher exposure) and to ophthalmology monitoring (higher chances of event detection). Older patients may also have additional ocular (including retinal) pathology, and in some cases, this could potentially alter the likelihood of being diagnosed (correctly or incorrectly) with retinal toxicity. Given that there is no easily available replacement for HCQ in SLE, it is important to highlight the importance of collaborating closely with ophthalmology in the setting of retinal changes, particularly when there is some doubt as to the aetiology.

HCQ and SLE flares

Among the 83 patients enrolled, we excluded 17 patients who were severely non-adherent (HCQ concentration ≤ 100 ng/mL value). Out of the remaining 66 patients, we identified 27 (40.9%) patients who had a prescribed HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and 39 (59%) patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. There were no differences in patient characteristics at baseline between the two groups (table 1). Each of the 66 patients attended the scheduled follow-up visits, at least every 3 months for 24 months. We observed 11 (16%) flares that developed in mean 14.8 months of follow-up. A total of 7 of 27 (26%) patients taking an HCQ dose equal or less than 5 mg/kg had a flare (six mild/moderate flares and one severe flare). We registered only 4 of 39 (10%) flares in the other group, all mild/moderate flares, although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.09). There was a trend (p = 0.08) for high HCQ dose being associated with a lower flare rate (12.3 events per 100 person-years, 95% CI 4.98 to 25.5) vs HCQ < 5 mg/kg/day (43.5 events per 100 person-years, 95% CI 11.8 to 111.5). However, comparing patients with and without flare, the former presented a lower mean HCQ blood levels (378.3 ± 185.5 vs 782.7 ± 646.7 ng/mL, p = 0.005). Stable therapeutic HCQ levels above 500 ng/mL (in T0 and T6) were associated with no occurrences of disease flares (mild/moderate or severe). At Cox regression analysis, HCQ blood level was a significant independent risk for flare (HR 0.996, 95% CI 0.993 to 0.999, p = 0.027). Moreover, older age at baseline was protective against flare occurrence (HR 0.93; p = 0.001; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97), while concomitant immunosuppressant therapy showed significant positive association (HR 3.66; p = 0.002; 95% CI 1.59 to 8.43) (table 2). We also observed that longer time on remission was associated with lower flare risk even if it was not significant (p = 0.054). No other significant associations were observed.

### Are the current recommendations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine screening appropriate? [^cd125952]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

### Hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: how much is enough? [^bc407748]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the daily and weight-adjusted dosages of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the effects on long-term remission in the Lupus-Cruces cohort.

Methods

Observational study of routine clinical care data. We selected inception patients treated with HCQ with at least 5 years of follow-up. Prolonged remission was achieved when patients fulfilled deﬁnitions of remission in systemic lupus erythematosus remission criteria in five consecutive yearly visits. The associations between the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ during 5 years and prolonged remission were analysed. We also investigated the associations between prednisone doses, immunosuppressives (IS) and other antimalarial use with HCQ doses.

Results

150 inception patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean starting dose of HCQ was 206mg/day. The mean weight-adjusted starting dose of HCQ was 3.1mg/kg/day with no patients treated with doses ≥ 5mg/kg/day. Treatment with HCQ was maintained during the whole 5-year follow-up time in 147 patients (98%). The mean dose of HCQ during the 5-year follow-up was 194.6mg/day (2.9mg/kg/day). 108 patients (72%) were in prolonged remission. The mean weight-adjusted dose of HCQ per patient did not differ between those who did and did not achieve prolonged remission (2.9 vs 3mg/kg/day, p = 0.5). The dose of prednisone per patient (mean 2.3mg/day during the 5-year follow-up) did not differ according to the weight-adjusted dose of HCQ. The mean weight-adjusted HCQ dose during the whole follow-up was the same in patients treated or not with IS or with mepacrine.

Conclusions

With the use of HCQ at stable doses of 200mg/day (or 3.0–3.5mg/kg/day) as the background therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the majority of patients achieved prolonged remission.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^8d7dd62d]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by bouts of immune-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is the main drug used to treat lupus; HCQ has been shown to reduce flaresand confer a protective effect on survival. Additionally, HCQ use is associated with reduced frequency and severity of organ damage. Recent data show that HCQ reduces SLE flares by 57% and disease activity by 32%.HCQ is classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug due to its ability to alter 'antigen-processing' by antigen-presenting cells. This is thought to decrease SLE activity at a molecular level and has direct anti-inflammatory effects.

HCQ is generally a well-tolerated drug. That said, HCQ use is linked to a number of adverse effects, which may be broadly classified by severity. While more common, gastrointestinal distress, aquagenic pruritus and other dermatological complaints rarely necessitate discontinuation of treatment. On the other hand, retinal, neuromuscular and cardiac effects usually dictate withdrawal and are occasionally irreversible.

### Hydroxychloroquine daily dose, hydroxychloroquine blood levels and the risk of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^7ce5964c]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Non-adherence by HCQ blood levels

Poor therapeutic adherence, reflected by at least one HCQ concentration ≤ 100 ng/mL value, was found in 17 (20%) patients. The proportion of non-adherent patients by drug level was 23% (10 of 42) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of ≤ 5 mg/kg/day and 17% (7 of 41) in patients with a prescribed HCQ dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. Non-adherent patients differed from the other patients only for age at SLE diagnosis (20 ± 8.5 vs 27 ± 11.3 p = 0.01) and concomitant immunosuppressant therapy (13 of 17 vs 10 of 66; p < 0.0001). Patients labelled as non-adherent at study entry showed at T6 a significant higher HCQ blood concentration than baseline (median 0 ng/mL (range 0–99.4 ng/mL) vs median 515 ng/mL (range 0–1682 ng/mL); p < 0.0001). Since our results could be influenced by the lowest non-therapeutic HCQ levels found in non-adherent patients, we excluded such patients from the analysis. Of the 66 patients enrolled, 34 (42%) patients had mean HCQ value in therapeutic range, 31 (37%) were considered partially adherent and patients who had levels greater than 2000 ng/mL considered in supratherapeutic range.

Demographic, clinical and laboratory features of patients

All the remaining 66 patients were Caucasian, mostly female (99%), with a mean age of 42 (± 11.2) years and a mean SLE duration of 15.7 (± 9.02) years. The entire population had a median SLEDAI of 2 (range 0–4) and a median SLICC of 0 (range 0–2). The median time of remission was 2 (1–11) years. Previous renal involvement has been observed in 31 (47%). Glucocorticoid therapy was taken by 33 (50%) patients, while 17 (26%) of them were on immunosuppressants. No one has taken oral or intravenous cyclophosphamide. The median HCQ treatment duration was 5 (0–32) years with median HCQ levels of 512.6 ng/mL (range 104.4–3105.6). Demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of the patients enrolled are illustrated in table 1.
