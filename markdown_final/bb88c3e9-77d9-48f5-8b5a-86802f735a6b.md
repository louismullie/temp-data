## Question

ckd and type 2 DM mortality

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including epidemiology, risk gradients, mechanisms, and the impact of therapies and guidelines on outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and burden of CKD in T2DM. Then, I should verify the magnitude of excess mortality and how it varies by CKD severity. Next, I will examine the underlying pathophysiology and competing risks, especially cardiovascular disease versus kidney failure. After that, I should review the evidence for disease-modifying therapies, particularly SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and confirm guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize practical, risk-stratified management implications and highlight residual risk and uncertainties, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic burden. CKD affects roughly 20–40% of adults with T2DM, and diabetes is the leading cause of CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) globally, with prevalence estimates ranging from about one-quarter to one-half depending on cohorts and definitions, underscoring the scale of the problem and its trajectory as diabetes prevalence rises [^117AZGoK] [^112vzPR6] [^114PkFve] [^117VP3jV].

> Wait, let me verify the mortality signal. Multiple cohorts and meta-analyses consistently show that CKD in T2DM confers a markedly higher all-cause mortality risk, often on the order of a 2–3 fold increase compared with T2DM without CKD, and in some analyses the excess risk exceeds 10-fold in advanced CKD or very high albuminuria categories, with 10-year cumulative mortality around 31% in T2DM with CKD versus about 11.5% in T2DM without CKD in a UK population-based cohort [^117VP3jV] [^112vzPR6] [^113DQckN].

> I need to check how risk scales with CKD severity. Risk rises continuously with lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. For example, in a large meta-analysis, mortality risk at eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m² versus 95 mL/min/1.73 m² was approximately 1.35-fold, and at ACR 30 mg/g versus 5 mg/g was about 1.50-fold, with similar relative risks in people with and without diabetes, even though absolute risks are higher in diabetes, reinforcing the primacy of kidney measures for prognosis [^113KFEv2]. Hold on, I should verify stage-specific mortality. KDOQI-era modeling suggested stage-specific annual death rates that escalate from roughly 1.4% in early CKD to about 19% in advanced CKD, consistent with contemporary risk gradients by eGFR and albuminuria strata [^116fjJej].

> Next, I should review competing risks. Most patients with T2DM and CKD die of cardiovascular disease before reaching dialysis, with cardiovascular mortality accounting for the majority of deaths and CKD acting as an independent driver of cardiovascular events. This pattern persists even as atherosclerotic event rates have declined over time, highlighting heart failure and kidney failure as dominant residual risks [^117VP3jV] [^112agRpw] [^1139g4rs]. Let me consider the cardiorenal syndrome dimension. Coexisting heart failure and CKD in T2DM creates a vicious cycle with substantially higher hospitalization and mortality, and real-world data show that CKD and/or HF often emerge early and drive poor outcomes in incident T2DM, reinforcing the need for early risk detection and intervention [^1163BSn1] [^11343Gww].

> I will now examine mechanisms linking CKD to excess mortality in T2DM. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors cluster in diabetes and CKD, but nontraditional risks such as volume overload, autonomic dysfunction, vascular calcification, mineral metabolism disturbances, and systemic inflammation likely amplify risk beyond conventional risk scores; albuminuria and reduced eGFR independently predict cardiovascular events and death, and their combination confers additive risk, aligning with the observed clinical trajectories [^116fTYdV] [^112agRpw] [^113KFEv2]. But wait, what if glycemic variability contributes? Observational signals suggest eGFR variability may track with mortality, though causality is uncertain and warrants cautious interpretation pending interventional data [^1121jvLv].

> Now, I should review disease-modifying therapies. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD populations with and without diabetes, with consistent relative risk reductions across subgroups; meta-analytic data show about a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality and larger absolute benefits at higher baseline risk, with CREDENCE demonstrating a 30% reduction in a renal composite and DAPA-CKD showing a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality in the overall CKD cohort, including benefits in participants with diabetes [^113M6nP7] [^116Y6FA9] [^114orNkL]. Hold on, I should verify class effects; collaborative meta-analyses confirm robust reductions in kidney disease progression and cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization irrespective of diabetes status, supporting broad implementation in CKD with T2DM when eGFR thresholds are met [^1159w3rq].

> Let me consider GLP-1 receptor agonists. GLP-1 RAs reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and appear to lower all-cause mortality in high-risk T2DM, including those with CKD. Semaglutide showed cardiovascular and mortality benefits in CKD subgroups, and real-world comparative data suggest lower all-cause and infection-related mortality versus DPP-4 inhibitors in advanced CKD, though head-to-head mortality trials in CKD are limited and guideline endorsements emphasize cardiovascular risk reduction rather than kidney-specific mortality endpoints [^115UBQzU] [^115UBQzU] [^116Tg5VT]. I should double-check guideline positioning; ADA and KDIGO endorse GLP-1 RAs for patients with T2DM and CKD to reduce cardiovascular events and slow CKD progression, aligning with their risk-stratified use in higher-risk phenotypes [^113hL7bJ] [^115UBQzU].

> Next, I should review mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism. Finerenone reduces CKD progression and cardiovascular events in T2DM with CKD and albuminuria, with signals for mortality benefit in some analyses. AACE notes benefits on CKD progression, HF events, ASCVD events, and mortality in appropriate candidates, supporting its addition to RAAS blockade in selected patients [^115UrHFq]. Wait, let me verify the strength of mortality evidence. While kidney and cardiovascular composites are robust, adjudicated mortality benefits vary by analysis, so shared decision-making and risk stratification remain essential when considering finerenone [^115UrHFq].

> I need to ensure I address glycemic control nuances. Intensive glycemic control reduces microvascular complications but increases hypoglycemia and may increase mortality in high-risk CKD populations, so A1C targets should be individualized. In advanced CKD, less intensive A1C goals are reasonable, and metformin remains foundational when eGFR permits, with observational and guideline data supporting its mortality benefit down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m², while use in severe CKD is discouraged due to potential lactic acidosis risk [^116fUJKT] [^1154vsNz] [^112eRdjU]. Hold on, I should verify the ACCORD signal; in CKD subgroups, intensive control increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, reinforcing the need to avoid overly aggressive A1C targets in high-risk CKD with T2DM [^112WDM8g].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed comprehensive care. KDIGO and ADA recommend a multifaceted approach including blood pressure control with ACEi/ARB, especially with albuminuria, lifestyle interventions, and layered pharmacotherapy with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs as indicated. Team-based care improves implementation and outcomes, and risk stratification using eGFR and albuminuria guides intensity of monitoring and referral [^113hL7bJ] [^112HgyGD] [^113XH9Hi]. I should confirm SGLT2 thresholds; contemporary guidance supports initiation down to eGFR 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m² depending on the agent and indication, with benefits on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes even when glycemic effects are attenuated at low eGFR [^1113Xymz] [^116Y6FA9].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications. CKD is the primary mediator of excess mortality in T2DM, with risk tracking continuously across eGFR and albuminuria; most patients die from cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, before reaching ESKD, and risk is amplified by the cardiorenal syndrome. Modern therapy shifts the paradigm from glucose-centric management to cardiorenal protection: prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors for most patients with T2DM and CKD, add GLP-1 RAs for additional cardiovascular risk reduction, consider finerenone in albuminuric CKD, and individualize glycemic targets to mitigate hypoglycemia while maintaining comprehensive risk-factor control and team-based follow-up [^115ADSaP] [^113hL7bJ] [^112TtxQw] [^116Y6FA9]. I should double-check that these steps align with mortality data; yes, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs reduce hard outcomes including mortality in appropriate risk strata, supporting early, layered implementation to modify the high mortality burden of CKD in T2DM [^113M6nP7] [^115UBQzU].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge residual risk and uncertainties. Despite optimal care, mortality remains high in advanced CKD with T2DM, reflecting entrenched cardiorenal pathophysiology and competing risks such as infection. Ongoing research into novel antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic strategies is warranted, and pragmatic barriers to guideline-concordant therapy — such as eGFR thresholds, safety concerns, and care fragmentation — must be addressed to realize population-level mortality gains [^117VP3jV] [^112HgyGD] [^113hL7bJ]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal mortality benefits for all agents. Evidence strength varies, and shared decision-making using risk calculators and decision aids helps align therapy with patient values and baseline risk profiles [^112VEpub] [^116Y6FA9].

Patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes have a **2–3-fold higher mortality** than those with diabetes alone, driven primarily by cardiovascular disease and kidney failure [^117VP3jV] [^113KFEv2]. Mortality risk rises with lower eGFR and higher albuminuria, and most patients die from cardiovascular causes before reaching ESRD [^112agRpw]. Intensive glycemic control does not reduce mortality and may increase risk in advanced CKD [^112WDM8g]; instead, **SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists** are first-line to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events [^116Y6FA9] [^115YhUZN]. Early detection and risk-stratified, guideline-directed therapy are essential to improve outcomes [^113hL7bJ].

## Mortality rates and causes of death

- **Mortality rates**: Patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes have significantly higher mortality rates than those with diabetes alone. A UK population-based cohort reported 10-year all-cause mortality of 31.1% in patients with diabetes and CKD versus 11.5% in those with diabetes alone [^117VP3jV].

- **Cardiovascular mortality**: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, accounting for approximately 50% of deaths in this population [^notfound]. CKD independently increases cardiovascular risk, and the combination of CKD and diabetes markedly elevates cardiovascular mortality [^113KFEv2].

- **Kidney failure**: Progression to ESRD significantly increases mortality risk, with cardiovascular complications remaining the primary cause of death even in advanced CKD stages [^112agRpw].

---

## Risk factors influencing mortality

Several factors **significantly influence mortality** in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes:

| **Risk factor** | **Impact on mortality** |
|-|-|
| Lower eGFR | Strongly associated with increased mortality risk [^113KFEv2] |
| Higher albuminuria | Independently predicts higher mortality [^113KFEv2] |
| Poor glycemic control (high HbA1c) | Increases mortality risk [^notfound] |
| Hypertension | Major contributor to cardiovascular mortality [^notfound] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Significantly increases mortality risk [^115BvPwg] |
| Age | Older age independently increases mortality risk [^notfound] |

---

## Impact of glycemic control on mortality

Intensive glycemic control reduces microvascular complications but **does not significantly reduce mortality** in patients with advanced CKD; in fact, it may increase mortality risk due to hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events [^112WDM8g]. Therefore, individualized glycemic targets are recommended, particularly in patients with advanced CKD [^116fUJKT].

---

## Role of antihyperglycemic medications

Recent advances in antihyperglycemic therapy have **significantly impacted mortality** in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes:

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Strongly recommended for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, as they significantly reduce mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure progression [^116Y6FA9] [^1113Xymz].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Recommended for patients with high cardiovascular risk, as they reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^112TtxQw] [^115UBQzU].

- **Metformin**: Continues to be a first-line therapy, with evidence suggesting mortality benefits in patients with CKD stages 1–3 [^1154vsNz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** to managing patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes:

- **Regular monitoring**: Annual assessment of eGFR and albuminuria to detect and monitor CKD progression [^112z3HxX].

- **Blood pressure control**: Target blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line therapy [^notfound].

- **Glycemic control**: Individualized HbA1c targets, avoiding intensive control in advanced CKD stages [^116fUJKT].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Dietary modifications, weight management, and smoking cessation [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes face significantly higher mortality, primarily due to cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. Effective management requires **early detection, risk stratification, and guideline-directed therapy** — particularly SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — to reduce mortality and improve outcomes [^113hL7bJ].

### Manifestation of heart failure and chronic kidney disease are associated with increased mortality risk in early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus: analysis of a Japanese real-world hospital claims database [^113dnb48]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is estimated that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes worldwide with 4 million deaths each year. With aging of the population, the prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase to 578 and 700 million by 2030 and 2045, respectively, which will greatly exacerbate the healthcare burden of diabetes.

The vast majority of patients with diabetes have one or more complications. In a US cross-specialty diabetes registry, only 6% of patients had isolated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), whereas more than 50% of patients had at least three comorbidities, predominantly hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). According to data from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause death in patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes was 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71–1.90) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI). Diabetes was also associated with greater risks of death from cardiovascular causes (HR 2.32; 95% CI 2.11–2.56) and renal diseases (HR 3.02; 95% CI 2.39–3.82). The development of comorbidities and its impact on mortality risk in patients with T2DM without history of cardiovascular or renal complications was recently examined using real-world databases in six countries, which included Japan. It was reported that CKD or heart failure (HF) were more frequent initial manifestations than other comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction (MI), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and stroke. Moreover, a history of CKD or HF was associated with increased mortality risk, suggesting the importance of early management of CKD and HF in patients with T2DM. However, it remains unclear how much the background of diabetes augments the mortality risk and the development of CKD and/or HF (hereafter referred to as CKD/HF) in the early stages of T2DM relative to that in patients without T2DM.

In this study, we compared the cumulative incidence rates of CKD, HF, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVDs; i.e. MI, PAD, and stroke) between patients with T2DM and patients without T2DM having no history of cardiovascular and renal complications, and determined the increase in mortality risk mediated by the background of T2DM. The results will demonstrate the real-world clinical significance of preventive or interventional approaches targeting early comorbidities in patients with T2DM.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^1139g4rs]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally.DKD is characterized by albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which are independent risk factors for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular events, and death. However, some patients with diabetes develop reduced eGFR with minimal or no albuminuria and retain the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moreover, kidney biopsy data among patients with DKD indicate variability in histopathological findings and overlap with non-diabetic disease processes. With advancements in diabetes care and therapeutics, the prevalence of kidney disease among patients with diabetes has stabilized around 35%, and the incidence of acute cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes has decreased by over 50%. Nevertheless, the absolute number of patients with diabetes is rising, with an anticipated global prevalence of 7.7% by 2030. The impending burden of diabetes, in the context of the obesity epidemic, will likely affect younger patients with more time at risk to develop kidney disease and its complications. In this review, we describe the management of type 2 diabetes in CKD, highlight important aspects of clinical practice guidelines, and discuss the evidence that supports modern practice.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for adults with chronic kidney disease: a clinical practice guideline [^116Y6FA9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on survival and on cardiovascular and kidneyoutcomes for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

Current Practice

Few therapies slow kidney disease progression and improve long term prognosis for adults living with CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney benefits in adults with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes. Existing guidance for SGLT-2 inhibitors does not account for the totality of current best evidence for adults with CKD and does not provide fully stratified treatment effects and recommendations across all risk groups based on risk of CKD progression and complications.

Recommendations

The guideline panel considered evidence regarding benefits and harms of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for adults with CKD over a five year period, along with contextual factors, and provided the following recommendations:1. For adults at low risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)2. For adults at moderate risk of CKD progression and complications, we suggest administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (weak recommendation in favour)3. For adults at high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour)4. For adults at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, we recommend administering SGLT-2 inhibitors (strong recommendation in favour). Recommendations are applicable to all adults with CKD, irrespective of type 2 diabetes status.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified typical risk strata of adults with CKD (from low to very high risk of CKD progression and related complications) using the classification system developed by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors were interpreted in absolute terms applicable to different risk strata with varying baseline risks for outcomes of benefit over a five year period. The panel explicitly considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of starting an SGLT-2 inhibitor, incorporating the values and preferences of adults with different risk profiles. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multilayered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that allows reuse and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis (13 trials including 29614 participants) of benefits and harms associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes informed guidance. Among individuals at very high risk of CKD progression and complications, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors (relative to placebo or standard care without SGLT-2 inhibitors) decrease all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, kidney failure, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Among individuals at high risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors result in similar benefits across outcomes except demonstrating little or no effect on hospitalisation for heart failure and kidney failure. Among individuals at moderate and low risk, moderate to high certainty evidence shows SGLT-2 inhibitors probably reduce all-cause mortality and non-fatal stroke, with little or no effect for other outcomes of benefit. Risk-stratified estimates were unavailable for outcomes of harm; the panel therefore considered absolute effects summarised across risk strata. SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with little or no effect on acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, bone fractures, lower limb amputations, ketoacidosis, genital infections, or symptomatic hypovolaemia, although a residual possibility of harms at the individual patient level remains.

Understanding The Recommendation

In order to apply recommendations, clinicians must appropriately identify adults with CKD, consider the underlying aetiology, and risk stratify them based on glomerular filtration rate (estimated or measured) and degree of albuminuria. In addition to classifying individuals into risk strata, further estimation of a given patient's risk based on the extent of their kidney disease and other comorbidities may be warranted to inform individual-level decisions and shared decision making. Available risk calculators may help estimate a given patient's risk of CKD progression and complications.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116fUJKT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes — intensive glucose control has increased risks and delayed renal benefits: adverse effects of intensive management of blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia and mortality) were increased among people with kidney disease at baseline, and there is a lag time of at least 2 years in type 2 diabetes to over 10 years in type 1 diabetes for improved eGFR outcomes to manifest; therefore, in some people with prevalent CKD and substantial comorbidity, treatment may be less intensive (i.e. A1C goals may be higher), and A1C levels are also less reliable at advanced CKD stages.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115UBQzU]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease — preferred agents and eGFR applicability: for individuals with type 2 diabetes and CKD, preferred medications for glucose management are GLP‑1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors (can be initiated if eGFR is above 20 mL/ min/1.73 m²); GLP‑1 RAs are effective in lowering glucose levels regardless of kidney function, with a low risk for hypoglycemia, and recent trial data suggest semaglutide has beneficial effects on CVD, mortality, and kidney outcomes among people with CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

### Change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^117M7XGP]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects one-quarter to one-third of adults with diabetes in the USA. Patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes have an elevated risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and can eventually progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Furthermore, the co-occurrence of type 2 diabetes and CKD accelerates disease progression, with higher mortality than CKD alone.

Albuminuria is an early indicator of CKD that is commonly defined as an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), which measures the level of excreted albumin relative to the creatinine.UACR is used in conjunction with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to diagnose end-stage CKD, as well as to estimate CKD progression risk according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.

Given that elevated UACR is associated with increased risk of kidney failure, CV outcomes, and mortality, it is a key measure to include as part of comprehensive kidney–heart risk management. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends targeting a decrease of ≥ 30% for patients with CKD with UACR ≥ 300 mg/g to slow CKD progression. In 2019, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) published two meta-analyses that supported the surrogacy of UACR change for CKD progression and ESKD. Specifically, in the meta-analysis of 41 randomized clinical trials, a 30% decrease in UACR reduced the risk for ESKD (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or doubling of serum creatinine) by 27%, with stronger association for patients with baseline UACR > 30 mg/g. Similarly, in another meta-analysis of individual-level data from 28 observational study cohorts, a 30% decrease in UACR during a 2-year baseline period was associated with a 22% reduction in the risk of ESKD.

Although the relationship between UACR change and kidney outcomes has been established by these previous studies, less is known about its impact on CV events or all-cause mortality — both of which are more common than kidney failure in patients with CKD. To address this gap in the literature, the present study aimed to assess the association between patterns of UACR change and kidney outcomes, CV outcomes, and mortality in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria.

### Recent advances in diabetic kidney disease [^112z3HxX]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is diabetic kidney disease and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation?

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the USA and worldwide. An estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes globally, and up to 40% of them may develop CKD during their lifetime. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) does not reflect a specific pathological phenotype. In fact, it can be diagnosed clinically based on the presence of persistent albuminuria, sustained reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or both in patients with diabetes. DKD is usually identified after five years of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, while it can be recognized at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy typically correlates with ongoing DKD in patients with albuminuria. Even though a kidney biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of DKD, this procedure is usually considered when an alternative diagnosis suspected.

Albuminuria has more recently been classified into moderate (30 to 300 mg/g) or severe (> 300 mg/g). Nonetheless, any degree of albuminuria has been associated with an increased risk for CKD progression, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and mortality in patients with diabetes. A reduced eGFR in diabetic patients has been observed in the absence of albuminuria; however, the progression of DKD appears to be slower in these individuals. Furthermore, the combined presence of albuminuria and lower eGFR independently increases the risks for cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with diabetes. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend that all diabetic patients undergo annual screening by checking serum creatinine-based eGFR and urine tests to evaluate for albuminuria.

### Impact of chronic kidney disease on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain: PERCEDIME2 study [^113D13rb]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious public health problem that increases the risk of overall mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and progression to end-stage renal disease regardless of the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

The presence of microalbuminuria in diabetes mellitus has been considered one of the first clinical signs of diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria can progress to macroalbuminuria, subsequently leading to a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and finally to end-stage renal disease. This process was originally described for type 1 diabetes and may be different in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Controversy exists regarding the impact of each of the manifestations of CKD on the prevalence of CVD, whether it would be greater with increased urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) or a decreased eGFR. Several epidemiological studies show that increased UACR is associated with a higher prevalence of CVD; this association is observed even with low levels of UACR, and the progression of UACR influences the clinical outcome, particularly regarding cardiovascular complications. It has been found that people with decreased eGFR and normal UACR have a lower CVD risk than individuals with increased UACR and normal eGFR. In some studies in patients with T2DM, it has been observed that increased UACR and decreased eGFR are associated with the same prevalence of CVD, although the increase in UACR seems to relate more strongly to cardiovascular death.

Most clinical practice guidelines advise determining not only UACR but also eGFR, as decreased eGFR with normal UACR is common in T2DM. The decrease in eGFR and increase in UACR are independently associated with increased overall mortality and high prevalence of CVD, which are even higher if they are both present.

This study was designed to determine the relationship of the decrease in eGFR and the increase in UACR with the prevalence of CVD in participants with T2DM being treated in primary care settings in Spain.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Cardiovascular complications in diabetic kidney disease [^116fTYdV]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Due to an explosion in the incidence and the prevalence of Type 2 DM, the burden of CKD is expected to increase proportionately. Both DM and CKD are associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, and it is important to understand the unique nature of CV disease in patients with the combination of these two conditions. In this report, we review the traditional and nontraditional risk factors that underlie the high risk of CV disease in this population, with a particular focus on vascular calcification, mineral metabolism, and therapeutic paradigms for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in this unique and high-risk population.

CLINICAL QUESTION Are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors effective in reducing complications for people with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce the mortality risk in people with any stage CKD and type 2 diabetes. 1 Although it is unclear whether SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce major adverse cardiac events, they reduce the risk of kidney failure and kidney composite outcomes. SGLT-2 inhibitors also may decrease doubling of serum creatinine and albuminuria progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors may be effective in reducing the risk of some other complications for patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes; however, more studies are needed to better inform treatment decisions.

### A synergistic effect of variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate with chronic kidney disease on all-cause mortality prediction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^1121jvLv]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a critical risk factor for death. According to the systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study, approximately 1.23 million people died from CKD in 2017, and the global all-age mortality rate for CKD increased by 41.5% between 1990 and 2017. The global prevalence of CKD between stages 3 and 5 was reported to be approximately 10.6%, and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for CKD. As the number of people with DM has been increasing worldwide, DM has become the most important cause of new-onset CKD. Type 2 DM, the major type of DM, was responsible for more than 400 thousand deaths of CKD and was reported to be the second leading cause of CKD-related death in 2019.

A reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as well as the presence of albuminuria, is an independent predictor for mortality in patients with type 2 DM. Annual assessments of eGFR and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are recommended in the clinical management of patients with DM. In particular, the stage of CKD is recommended to be defined using the eGFR value. However, a meta-analysis reported that mortality risk was not linearly correlated with eGFR in individuals with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². An eGFR higher than the normal range might be associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with type 2 DM. Therefore, it is not sufficient to predict mortality using a single-measurement of eGFR in patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and other associated risk factors for mortality should be assessed in patients with type 2 DM without hypofiltration.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists' impact on cardio-renal outcomes and mortality in T2D with acute kidney disease [^114tMuxt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a global epidemic and a known independent risk factor for AKI and subsequent decline in kidney function –. In various healthcare settings, acute kidney disease (AKD) has seen a rising incidence, with associated heightened risks of all-cause mortality, end-stage kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Notably, type 2 diabetes often accelerates kidney function decline even before the onset of AKI, emphasizing the combined influence on CKD development –. Managing of type 2 diabetes within the context of AKD poses distinctive challenges demanding innovative solutions to alleviate the global CKD burden.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) present a promising avenue for addressing the complex cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health. They stimulate insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon release, and slow gastric emptying, potentially exerting protective effects on renal function. Previous trials have demonstrated that GLP-1 RAs can reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and may have beneficial effects on kidney function –. Notably, the American Diabetes Association advocates for the utilization of GLP-1 RAs with established cardiovascular benefits in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and concurrent cardiovascular disease. While the studies supporting these benefits were not initially focused on kidney health and included patients with low kidney risk, they suggest a link between GLP-1 RAs treatment and kidney protection, especially for type 2 diabetes patients with CKD.

Building upon these findings, we conducted this longitudinal investigation using an extensive global medical records database to explore the associations between GLP-1 RAs and mortality, adverse cardiovascular and kidney-related events in a substantial cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes concomitant with AKD. Our study aims to provide valuable real-world perspectives on the influence of GLP-1 RAs therapy among these patients.

increased rates of infection and cardiovascular events. 3, 4 The high mortality among patients with diabetes and CKD or ESKD is mostly attributable to cardiovascular or infection-related events. 5, 6 Both glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality after the index date during the follow-up period. The secondary outcomes were sepsis- or infection-related mortality and MACCE-related mortality. MACCE included myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, coronary revascularization, coronary artery bypass surgery, thrombolysis therapy, malignant arrhythmia, and stroke. The rates of all-cause mortality, sepsis- or infection-related mortality, and MACCE-related mortality in the 2 study groups are shown in Table 2. The rate of all-cause mortality was
7. 95 per 100 person-years in the DPP-4 inhibitor group and 6.

10 per 100 person-years in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group. The rate of sepsis- or infection-related mortality was 3. 01 per 100 person-years in the DPP-4 inhibitor group and

1. 80 per 100 person-years in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group. The rate of MACCE-related mortality was 2. 56 per 100 person-years in the DPP-4 inhibitor group and
2. 64 per 100 person-years in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group. In this cross-sectional study, in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 5 CKD or ESKD, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with better outcomes, including all-cause mortality and sepsis- and infection-related mortality, compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Additional large-scale, prospective studies are needed to examine our results.

### Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: the size of the problem, addressing residual renal risk and what we have learned from the CREDENCE trial [^112dz9DV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a global challenge; progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with advancing nephropathy are a significant source of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. Until recently, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade was the mainstay of pharmacotherapy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), representing a therapeutic paradigm shift towards interventions that delay disease progression independently of antihypertensive effects. However, a significant residual risk of DKD progression persisted in patients established on RAS blockade, highlighting the need for additional treatment options. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally licensed as glucose-lowering agents in people with T2DM, serendipitously demonstrated beneficial renal and cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials designed primarily to evaluate their cardiovascular safety. The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial was the first to study the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on a primary composite renal endpoint of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, or renal or cardiovascular death in 4401 people with T2DM and CKD established on RAS blockade. The trial was stopped early due to efficacy, demonstrating a 30% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint in the canagliflozin group (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.59–0.82; p = 0.00001). Through discussion of the primary analysis from CREDENCE, and selected post hoc analyses, we review the significant benefits highlighted by this landmark study, its role in shaping clinical guidelines, and in re-establishing interest in interventions that reduce the residual risk of progression of DKD, alongside its interrelation with cardiovascular morbidity and heart failure. We also provide a brief narrative summary of key renal outcome trials since CREDENCE, which indicate emerging avenues for pharmacotherapy beyond SGLT2 inhibition.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^114orNkL]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin reduces the risk of kidney failure and heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes according to presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and according to underlying cause of chronic kidney disease, reported as diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritides, ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause.

Methods

DAPA-CKD was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial done at 386 study sites in 21 countries, in which participants with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–75 mL/min per 1.73 m² were randomly assigned (1:1) to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, as an adjunct to standard care. The primary outcome was a composite of sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related or cardiovascular death. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a kidney-specific composite (the same as the primary outcome but excluding cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. In this study, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD primary and secondary endpoints by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and by aetiology of chronic kidney disease. DAPA-CKD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150.

Findings

The study took place between Feb 2, 2017, and June 12, 2020. 4304 participants were randomly assigned (2152 to dapagliflozin and 2152 to placebo) and were followed up for a median of 2.4 years (IQR 2.0–2.7). Overall, 2906 (68%) participants had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, of whom 396 (14%) had chronic kidney disease ascribed to causes other than diabetic nephropathy. The relative risk reduction for the primary composite outcome with dapagliflozin was consistent in participants with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.79) and those without diabetes (0.50, 0.35–0.72; p interaction = 0.24). Similar findings were seen for the secondary outcomes: kidney-specific composite outcome (0.57 [0.45–0.73] vs 0.51 [0.34–0.75]; P interaction = 0.57), cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure (0.70 [0.53–0.92] vs 0.79 [0.40–1.55]; P interaction = 0.78), and all-cause mortality (0.74 [0.56–0.98] vs 0.52 [0.29–0.93]; P interaction = 0.25). The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was also consistent among patients with diabetic nephropathy (n = 2510; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.78), glomerulonephritides (n = 695; 0.43, 0.26–0.71), ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease (n = 687; 0.75, 0.44–1.26), and chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause (n = 412; 0.58, 0.29–1.19; P interaction = 0.53), with similar consistency seen across the secondary outcomes. The proportions of participants in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups who had serious adverse events or discontinued study drug due to adverse events did not vary between those with and those without type 2 diabetes.

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin reduces the risks of major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112agRpw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — cardiovascular risk burden states that chronic kidney disease (CKD) "imparts an extremely high risk of CVD", with the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and American Heart Association (AHA) "recommending that people with CKD be considered in the highest risk category for CVD". In people with both diabetes and CKD, "the outlook is far worse than for either condition alone because this combination is a powerful predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events and death". Risk tracks severity, as "The relationship between CKD severity and risk is continuous", and among patients with diabetes, "People with diabetes and microalbuminuria have twice the CVD risk of those with normoalbuminuria", with risk rising "as albuminuria increases and GFR decreases". The page also notes practice recommendations from diabetes societies: "recommendations from both the ADA and the American Heart Association (AHA) for intensive cardiovascular risk factor management in people with diabetes". Prognosis in moderate CKD is highlighted: "More people who reach CKD stage 3 will die, primarily of CVD, than progress to kidney failure, especially if they also have diabetes".

### Prediction of new onset of end stage renal disease in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus-a population-based retrospective cohort study [^114QbeTk]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevalence of diabetes mellitus is one in 11 adults, affecting 415 million people, and it is estimated to increase to 642 million all over the world. Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is an irreversible loss of renal function and is fatal without receiving renal replacement therapy. The coexistence of diabetes and ESRD elevate the risk of mortality significantly. Although the number of patients with ESRD account for only 0.1%–0.2% of the total population in developed countries, health spending on renal failure was 2–3% of the total healthcare expenditure. Given available effective treatments in reduction of development and progression of diabetic kidney disease, identification of diabetic patients who are at high risk of ESRD is needed to allow target delivery of proper healthcare and facilitate service policy planning.

Introduction

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves the gradual loss of kidney function, characterized by a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or the presence of albuminuria for > 3 months. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization provide a classification system for determining CKD risk based on cause, GFR, and albuminuria (Fig. 1). Of the complications that arise from T2DM, CKD is among the most common, affecting approximately 20–40% of people. Within 10 years of T2DM diagnosis, 24.9% of people develop microalbuminuria, 5.3% develop macroalbuminuria, and 0.8% develop advanced CKD that includes persistently elevated plasma creatinine or the need for renal replacement therapy. The progression of CKD can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), increasing the risk of kidney failure with a need for renal replacement therapy involving dialysis or renal transplant. The predominance of CKD accounts for the increased mortality observed in people living with T2DM. Despite advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, and the increased availability of treatment options, the prevalence of ESRD continues to rise in people living with T2DM. With diabetes and CKD projected to be the seventh and fifth leading cause of premature mortality worldwide by 2040, respectively, novel and effective treatment options are critical.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease and intensive glycemic control increase cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112WDM8g]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Results of the main Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial indicate that intensive glucose lowering increases cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. As the contribution of mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) to these risks is not known, we assessed the impact on cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Renal function data were available on 10,136 patients of the original ACCORD cohort. Of those, 6,506 were free of CKD at baseline and 3,636 met the criteria for CKD. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment strategy of either intensive or standard glycemic goal. The primary outcome, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and prespecified secondary outcomes were evaluated. Risk for the primary outcome was 87% higher in patients with than in those without CKD (hazard ratio of 1.866; 95% CI: 1.651–2.110). All prespecified secondary outcomes were 1.5 to 3 times more frequent in patients with than in those without CKD. In patients with CKD, compared with standard therapy, intensive glucose lowering was significantly associated with both 31% higher all-cause mortality (1.306: 1.065–1.600) and 41% higher cardiovascular mortality (1.412: 1.052–1.892). No significant effects were found in patients without CKD. Thus, in high-risk patients with type II diabetes, mild and moderate CKD is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Intensive glycemic control significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in this population.

### Impact of chronic kidney disease on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes in Spain: PERCEDIME2 study [^111VPQ38]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The decrease in eGFR and increase in UACR are independent risk factors that increase the prevalence of CVD in patients with T2DM. In our study the impact of mild decreased GFR in T2DM on CVD was lower than the impact of increased UACR. These results suggest that it is necessary to determine both had higher likelihood of having CVD and UACR for all patients with T2DM — at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up — to identify patients at high risk of cardiovascular complications, to establish the proper preventive measures, and to intensify control in patients with T2DM and CKD, in an effort to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^1159w3rq]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Large trials have shown that sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease, or with type 2 diabetes and high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. None of the trials recruiting patients with and without diabetes were designed to assess outcomes separately in patients without diabetes.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor trials. We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for trials published from database inception to Sept 5, 2022. SGLT2 inhibitor trials that were double-blind, placebo-controlled, performed in adults (age ≥ 18 years), large (≥ 500 participants per group), and at least 6 months in duration were included. Summary-level data used for analysis were extracted from published reports or provided by trial investigators, and inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to estimate treatment effects. The main efficacy outcomes were kidney disease progression (standardised to a definition of a sustained ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from randomisation, a sustained low eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, or death from kidney failure), acute kidney injury, and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. Other outcomes were death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease considered separately, and the main safety outcomes were ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022351618.

Findings

We identified 13 trials involving 90413 participants. After exclusion of four participants with uncertain diabetes status, we analysed 90409 participants (74804 [82.7%] participants with diabetes [> 99% with type 2 diabetes] and 15605 [17.3%] without diabetes; trial-level mean baseline eGFR range 37–85 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). Compared with placebo, allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 37% (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.58–0.69) with similar RRs in patients with and without diabetes. In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RRs were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0.77, 0.70–0.84) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure by 23% (0.77, 0.74–0.81), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0.86, 0.81–0.92) but did not significantly reduce the risk of non-cardiovascular death (0.94, 0.88–1.02). For these mortality outcomes, RRs were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of trial mean baseline eGFR. Based on estimates of absolute effects, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibition outweighed any serious hazards of ketoacidosis or amputation.

Interpretation

In addition to the established cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, the randomised data support their use for modifying risk of kidney disease progression and acute kidney injury, not only in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but also in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure irrespective of diabetes status, primary kidney disease, or kidney function.

### Efficacy and durability of multifactorial intervention on mortality and MACEs: a randomized clinical trial in type-2 diabetic kidney disease [^111Ns4U6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at high risk of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke compared to the general population. More important, onset of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remarkably worsens cardiovascular prognosis, as demonstrated by a very large meta-analysis showing that hazards for cardiovascular mortality at a given eGFR/albuminuria are higher among T2DM patients throughout the whole spectrum of disease. The major role of DKD on cardiovascular outcome has also been supported by an observational study on 1.3 million of patients reporting a higher incidence rate of MI in DKD patients versus diabetes or chronic kidney disease alone. Of note, this finding is enhanced by the coexistence of proteinuria; indeed, albuminuria and low eGFR per se accelerate atherosclerosis process. Such a marked cardiovascular risk significantly modifies the outcome of DKD patients who often do not survive long enough to reach the natural fate of end-stage kidney disease.

The importance of a multifactorial approach in T2DM has been emphasized by the analysis of Swedish National Diabetes Register comparing prognosis of ~ 270,000 T2DM patients versus ~ 1,300,000 age- and gender-matched controls. In particular, T2DM patients with five risk-factors within target range showed either a small or any excess risk of death, MI or stroke, as compared with controls. However, DKD was either mild or absent in the vast majority of patients (mean GFR 84 mL/min and 4.9% with macroalbuminuria). Furthermore, achievement of targets for multiple risk factors was uncommon (5%).

As for observational studies, also multi-target interventional trials in DKD are lacking. The Steno-2 is the only study evaluating the effects of multifactorial approach in 160 microalbuminuric patients. The trial disclosed a significant reduction of both mortality and cardiovascular risk after implementing an intensified approach to multiple targets. However, Steno-2 was a single-centre study, carried out in patients with preserved renal function (mean GFR 118 mL/min) and mostly without diabetic retinopathy (DR) (74%), that is, a sign of microangiopathy strictly associated with cardiovascular risk besides being a recognized marker of DKD.

Aim of the present trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a multifactorial intensive therapy (MT) versus Standard-of-Care (SoC) on major fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events (MACEs) in a population with DKD patients with albuminuria and retinopathy. Durability of the effect of intensified treatment was tested by extending follow-up to several years after the end of intervention phase.

Finerenone for chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — indications and outcomes — has supporting evidence for benefits on CKD progression, HF, ASCVD events, and mortality in persons with microalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g), macroalbuminuria, or moderate-to-advanced CKD with an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m². Although finerenone can modestly reduce systolic BP, its effects are independent of pretreatment BP levels, and regulatory approval is for risk reduction for eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, nonfatal MI, and hospitalization for HF in persons with CKD and T2D. The text also notes a small BP reduction may occur when starting GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i.

### Nocturnal hypoxemic burden is associated with worsening prognosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117HMLw5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. It is highly prevalent, affecting 529 million people worldwide in 2021, with rising numbers globally. T2D is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) initiative as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, persisting ≥ 3 months, with implications for health. CKD is projected to be the fifth leading cause of death by 2040. Over 40% of individuals with diabetes develop CKD, many progressing to kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation, contributing to a substantial global health and economic burden.

CKD severity is classified by kidney excretory capacity (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) and albuminuria. A recent meta-analysis of 114 cohorts (> 27 million individuals) demonstrated that lower eGFR and higher urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) are independently associated with 10 adverse outcomes such as mortality, kidney, cardiovascular, and other health outcomes, with risks increasing progressively across worsening categories. The KDIGO 2024 guideline visualized these risks using "heatmaps", color-coding the escalating risk for the above-named outcomes (Fig. 1). Understanding risk factors contributing to CKD progression is therefore crucial to identify high-risk patients early.

Fig. 1
Heatmap indicating risk prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by eGFR and albuminuria categories. Risk prognosis includes risk with worsening CKD for 10 adverse outcomes: kidney outcomes such as kidney failure requiring replacement therapy and acute kidney injury, cardiovascular outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease, and other health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, and any hospitalization. Figure adapted from the KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease

Nocturnal hypoxemia has been proposed as one such risk factor. Experimental studies indicate that chronic intermittent hypoxia contributes to renal damage and dysfunction by promoting renal hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia during wakefulness and sleep. In animal models, long-term hypoxia reduced eGFR, and in humans, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been linked to a higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease. However, clinical evidence on the impact of nocturnal hypoxemia on the prognosis of CKD in T2D is scarce and limited to small populations including participants with and without T2D with limited follow-up time.

The aim of the analysis was to evaluate whether nocturnal hypoxemic burden (NHB) is associated with worsening prognosis of CKD in a large population with T2D.

### Kidney disease progression and all-cause mortality across estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria categories among patients with vs. without type 2 diabetes [^1134Y7ou]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, the pattern of decline of kidney function was similar for a population-based cohort of patients with and without T2D in a routine care setting. T2D was associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of CKD, and an accelerated and increased risk of kidney disease progression despite much greater use of RAAS blockers. For all KDIGO risk categories, the mortality risk was about two-fold higher in patients with T2D vs. without T2D, including patients in the lowest risk category. The subgroup of patients with CKD and normal or mildly increased albuminuria showed a remarkably increased risk for kidney disease progression or all-cause mortality compared to the respective group with no CKD independent of diabetes status. Though the risks for adverse outcomes were significantly smaller compared with patients with moderately or severely increased albuminuria, the risk should not be neglected in clinical practice. To date, there are no specific treatment options beyond optimization of risk factors for the management of CKD patients with normal or mildly increased albuminuria, accentuating the high unmet medical need for new treatment options. In secondary analyses of cardiovascular outcome trials, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated renoprotection among people with type 2 diabetes. However, most clinical trials examining interventions to slow kidney disease progression are limited to individuals with T2D and/or those with CKD and severely increased albuminuria levels, yet our findings suggest that most patients with CKD have normal to mildly increased albuminuria levels. More evidence from clinical trials among patients without as well as with diabetes is urgently needed to advance treatment across the broad range of CKD phenotypes.

### One risk assessment tool for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^114p8jd7]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), are leading causes of comorbidity and premature death. Moreover, these diseases have a heavy impact on the quality of life and generate high health care costs. Another shared aspect of these chronic cardiometabolic diseases is that early treatment of people at high risk reduces disease burden and is cost-effective. In addition, the three chronic cardiometabolic diseases — CVD, type 2 diabetes, and CKD — do share many risk factors. Therefore, common opportunities for prevention have been acknowledged. A joint prevention program may be more effective because it stresses the importance of multiple risk factor assessment and control in those at high risk. Furthermore, a joint program will reduce time and financial burden.

A risk score is a helpful tool to identify individuals at high risk. A growing number of single outcome risk scores for identification of people at risk for either future CVD, type 2 diabetes, or CKD have been developed. Next to these evidence-based identification methods, an increasing amount of self-assessment health checks are available, especially on the Internet. We considered that the use of several risk-assessment tools for separate related diseases can be inefficient and confusing. A single risk score that predicts risk for a combination of chronic metabolic diseases is still lacking.

Furthermore, simple risk scores comprising information that do not require blood testing are especially useful for primary prevention and public health initiatives. Untrained people can therefore assess their risk, and only those at high risk can then be referred to health care for more extensive risk factor measurement. For the single outcome of CVD, a nonlaboratory-based risk score has been published, and for type 2 diabetes, such a risk questionnaire also exists. However, to date, no risk score that predicts the combined end points of these diseases has been developed. In light of this, we sought to develop a simple risk stratification tool for identification of people at high risk of CVD morbidity and/or mortality, type 2 diabetes, and/or CKD.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113M6nP7]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Objective

To examine cardiovascular and kidney benefits and harms of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors stratified by risk in adults with chronic kidney disease regardless of diabetes status.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central from database inception to 15 June 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials that compared SGLT-2 inhibitors with placebo or standard care with no SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with chronic kidney disease with a follow-up duration of ≥ 12 weeks were eligible. Secondary analyses based on subpopulations from randomised controlled trials and publications not in English language were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were conducted, with effect estimates presented as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Absolute treatment effects were estimated over a fiveyear duration for individuals with varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) risk stratification system. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.

Results

Evidence from 13 randomised controlled trials (29614 patients) informed treatment effect estimates. In relative terms, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced all cause death (risk ratio 0.85 (95%CI 0.74 to 0.98)), cardiovascular death (0.84 (0.74 to 0.96)), kidney failure (0.68 (0.60 to 0.77)), non-fatal stroke (0.73 (0.57 to 0.94)), non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.75 (0.60 to 0.93)), and admission to hospital for heart failure (0.68 (0.60 to 0.78)). No credible subgroup effects were found from diabetes status, heart failure status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and follow-up duration. Absolute effect estimates across these outcomes over a fiveyear period varied across risk groups based on baseline risks of cardiovascular and kidney events. Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the group at low risk included seven fewer all- cause deaths, four fewer admissions to hospital for heart failure per 1000 individuals, and no effects on kidney failure. Effects in the higher risk group included 48 fewer all cause deaths, 58 fewer kidney failures, and 25 fewer admissions to hospital for heart failure per 1000 individuals. Although SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with a relative increase in the risk of harms, including genital infection (2.66 (95%CI 2.07 to 3.42)), ketoacidosis (2.27 (1.30 to 3.95)), and symptomatic hypovolaemia (1.29 (1.15 to 1.44)), absolute differences for all harm outcomes were small.

Conclusions

Among people who have chronic kidney disease either with type 2 diabetes or not, SGLT-2 inhibitors improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with varying degrees of absolute benefit depending on an individual's baseline risks of cardiovascular and kidney-related sequelae. Absolute benefits and harms stratified by risk and associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors should inform individual decision making at the patient level.

### Current management of chronic kidney disease in type-2 diabetes – A tiered approach: an overview of the joint association of British clinical diabetologists and UK kidney association (ABCD-UKKA) guidelines [^113Sv9hy]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A growing and significant number of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diabetes-related CKD is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and people with diabetes and CKD have high morbidity and mortality, predominantly related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite advances in care over the recent decades, most people with CKD and type 2 diabetes are likely to die of CVD before developing ESKD. Hyperglycaemia and hypertension are modifiable risk factors to prevent onset and progression of CKD and related CVD. People with type 2 diabetes often have dyslipidaemia and CKD per se is an independent risk factor for CVD, therefore people with CKD and type 2 diabetes require intensive lipid lowering to reduce burden of CVD. Recent clinical trials of people with type 2 diabetes and CKD have demonstrated a reduction in composite kidney end point events (significant decline in kidney function, need for kidney replacement therapy and kidney death) with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. The Association of British Clinical Diabetologists (ABCD) and UK Kidney Association (UKKA) Diabetic Kidney Disease Clinical Speciality Group have previously undertaken a narrative review and critical appraisal of the available evidence to inform clinical practice guidelines for the management of hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. This 2024 abbreviated updated guidance summarises the recommendations and the implications for clinical practice for healthcare professionals who treat people with diabetes and CKD in primary, community and secondary care settings.

### Determinants of early chronic kidney disease in patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective study from the Taiwan diabetes registry [^113udiKk]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a common metabolic disorder, has been increasing rapidly in recent years. As a result, the comprehensive care and prevention of diabetic complications, including microvascular and macrovascular complications, have become a major challenge that requires more attention. Asymptomatic dysglycemia can persist for months to years before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is established. During this period, even low-grade hyperglycemia can contribute to vascular damage and cause microvascular or macrovascular events. By the time of diagnosis, patients may have already developed some diabetic complications. Previous studies have shown that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has the highest prevalence among diabetic complications when type 2 diabetes mellitus is diagnosed. DKD is also a leading cause of diabetes-related cardiovascular disease and mortality, resulting in high medical costs and healthcare burdens. Therefore, DKD is an crucial complication that needs to be considered in the care of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

A study conducted by the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium found that the hazard ratios for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels of 60, 45, and 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² were 4, 29, and 454, respectively, compared with an eGFR of 95 ml/min per 1.73 m². In the same study, hazard ratios for ESRD at urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios (UACR) of 30, 300, and 1000 mg/g were 5, 13, and 28, respectively, compared with a UACR of 5 mg/g. Other studies have also shown that lower eGFR and higher albuminuria are associated with higher adverse events. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has categorized chronic kidney disease (CKD) into different stages using eGFR and UACR. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and early CKD, studies have demonstrated that multifactorial intervention has long-term benefits for complications and mortality. Therefore, the detection and management of early stage CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been proposed and emphasized.

### Incremental risk of cardiovascular disease and / or chronic kidney disease for future ASCVD and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: ACCORD trial [^115BvPwg]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Current cholesterol guidelines recommend the same prevention strategy for patients with DM alone as patients with DM + CKD. However, the incremental risk of these common complications for incident cardiovascular disease and mortality has not been well studied.

Methods

We compared the incremental risk of having DM + CKD, DM + CVD and DM + CVD + CKD in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial participants for incident CVD as the primary outcome and all-cause mortality.

Results

After a mean (SD) follow up of 4.7(1.4) years, 1,046(10%) participants developed CVD. DM +vCKD, DM + CVD, and DM + CKD + CVD had a significantly increased risk of the primary outcome compared to DM alone [adjusted hazard ratio(95%CI): 1.41 (1.06–1.89), p = 0.02; 2.20 (1.92–2.53), p < 0.001); 2.35 (1.81–3.04), p < 0.001), respectively]. All-cause mortality had a graded increased risk compared to the reference group [adjusted hazard ratio(95%CI): 1.39 (1.01–1.90), p = 0.04; 1.29 (1.51–2.12), p < 0.0001; 2.36 (1.75–3.13), p < 0.0001), respectively].

Conclusion

Our post hoc analysis shows an incremental graded risk for CVD outcomes and all-cause mortality with the development of CKD and/or CVD in individuals with DM.

### Empagliflozin and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease [^111bj58s]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

Methods

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻² at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (< 45, 45- < 60, 60- < 90, ≥ 90 mL·min⁻¹·1.73 m⁻²) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (> 300, 30- ≤ 300, < 30 mg/g).

Results

Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for > 10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR < 60 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 was consistent with the overall trial population.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.

### Changing epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and associated chronic kidney disease [^114PkFve]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and both conditions are increasing in prevalence. CKD is estimated to affect ∼50% patients with T2DM globally, and its presence and severity markedly influences disease prognosis. CKD is more common in certain patient populations, including the elderly, those with youth-onset diabetes mellitus, those who are obese, certain ethnic groups, and disadvantaged populations. These same settings have also seen the greatest increase in the prevalence of T2DM, as exemplified by the increasing prevalence of T2DM in low-to- middle income countries. Patients from low-to-middle income countries are often the least able to deal with the burden of T2DM and CKD and the health-care facilities of these countries least able to deal with the demand for equitable access to renal replacement therapies. The increasing prevalence of younger individuals with T2DM, in whom an accelerated course of complications can be observed, further adds to the global burden of CKD. Paradoxically, improvements in cardiovascular survival in patients with T2DM have contributed to patients surviving longer, allowing sufficient time to develop renal impairment. This Review explores how the changing epidemiology of T2DM has influenced the prevalence and incidence of associated CKD across different populations and clinical settings.

### Risk factors, outcomes and healthcare utilisation in individuals with multimorbidity including heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a national electronic health record study [^111zmVhm]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multimorbidity, defined as co-occurrence of two or more long-term conditions, affects over a quarter of adults in the UKand is projected to affect over two-thirds of individuals over the age of 65 years. With growing multimorbidity globally, single-disease approaches are increasingly inadequate whether in real-world clinical practice, in evidence-based management guidelines or in research. Diseases need to be studied together so prevention, treatment and healthcare delivery can be planned and implemented in holistic, patient-centred and effective ways.

Heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwideand throughout the life course, and commonly coexist. In a study of nearly 500 000 individuals with T2D, among those free from cardiovascular and renal disease, lifetime risks of CKD and HF were 54% and 29%, respectively. Individually and together, HF, CKD and T2D have high impact on individuals, populations, healthcare utilisation and economies. These diseases (increasingly referred to as 'CaReMe' diseases — 'Cardiovascular–Renal–Metabolic') are important not only as a component of multimorbidity, but also in development of integrated models of care. Earlier, effective prevention strategies require better knowledge of risk factors in individuals with overlapping HF, CKD and T2D, but such epidemiological studies are currently lacking.

The burden of adverse cardiovascular and renal events could be reduced by 'ideal cardiovascular health', by attaining target levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, physical activity, diet and body mass index (BMI) (ie, modifiable risk factors). For example, in individuals with T2D, achieving ideal cardiovascular health could reduce adverse cardiovascular and renal events by 42%, 24% and 17% for those with one or more, less than three, and three or more modifiable health behaviours, respectively. As well as behaviour modification, there are effective, evidence-based therapies to improve clinical outcomes for HF, CKD and T2D, with similarities in approaches across the individual diseases, whether statins, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Behavioural and drug recommendations could be informed and optimised by better characterisation of risk factor profile, trajectory and prognosis of overlapping conditions, with benefits and synergies across diseases. Moreover, such research will provide individualised information to patients and health professionals, facilitating shared decision-making.

### Kidney disease progression and all-cause mortality across estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria categories among patients with vs. without type 2 diabetes [^114dT2Mg]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study of routine clinical care of 31,931 people with T2D and 33,201 people of similar age and sex without T2D, we found (unsurprisingly) that T2D and presence of albuminuria were strongly associated with kidney disease progression and mortality. Despite differences in risk rates, we found similarities in risk associated with albuminuria and the patterns of eGFR decline independent of T2D. We also found a high risk of adverse outcomes in patients with low eGFR and normal to mildly increased albuminuria.

T2D appeared to be a precipitating factor for incident CKD and for the deterioration of kidney function and for all-cause mortality. This is consistent with an Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study showing an almost twice as rapid decline in eGFR among those with vs. without diabetes. Our data indicate this relationship holds true across all categories of baseline eGFR as well as categories of albuminuria/proteinuria despite much greater use of RAAS blockers among T2D patients. The accelerated progression of eGFR associated with T2D was observed at all stages of baseline eGFR in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Given the greater mortality risk observed among patients with T2D at earlier eGFR stages, their risk of progression may be understated. Thus, as life expectancy of people with diabetes lengthens, the incidence of CKD and ESKD can be expected to increase.

The independent role of albuminuria/proteinuria in predicting risk of progression to ESKD and mortality is well-recognized. Our data underscore the powerful impact of albuminuria/proteinuria on these outcomes, regardless of T2D. The Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKDPC) conducted 5 meta-analyses of progression to ESKD or mortality comparing people in general, with and without diabetes, with and without hypertension, and among patients with prevalent chronic kidney disease. The results of these meta-analyses were reported as adjusted rates or hazard ratios with different categorizations, making direct comparisons to our results difficult. Consistent with our results, each of the CKDPC meta-analyses found progressively increased risk of CKD progression, ESKD, and mortality at each successive baseline category of eGFR as well as each successive albuminuria/proteinuria category. Also consistent with our results, patients with diabetes were more likely to progress to ESKD. In addition, the rates of eGFR decline we report are similar to a recent report from the Steno Diabetes Center and consistent with their findings that albuminuria status affects eGFR decline with the steepest decline among persons with macroalbuminuria.

### Impact of cardio-renal-metabolic comorbidities on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Dco5x]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We evaluated the incremental contribution of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE), heart failure (HF), and all-cause mortality (ACM) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and its importance relative to the presence of other cardio-renal-metabolic (CaReMe) comorbidities.

Methods

Patients (≥ 40 years) were identified at the time of T2DM diagnosis from US (Humedica/Optum) and UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) databases. Patients were monitored post-diagnosis for modified MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, ACM), HF, and ACM. Adjusted hazard ratios were obtained using Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the relative risk of modified MACE, HF, and ACM due to CKD. Patients were stratified by the presence or absence of atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) and age.

Results

Between 2011 and 2015, of 227,224 patients identified with incident T2DM, 40,063 (17.64%) had CKD. Regardless of prior ASCVD, CKD was associated with higher risk of modified MACE, HF, and ACM; this excess hazard was more pronounced in older patients with prior ASCVD. In time-to-event analyses in the overall cohort, patients with T2DM + CKD or T2DM + CKD + hypertension + hyperlipidemia had increased risks for modified MACE, HF, and ACM versus patients with T2DM and no CaReMe comorbidities. Patients with CKD had higher risks for and shorter times to modified MACE, HF, and ACM than those without CKD.

Conclusion

In T2DM patients, CKD presence was associated with higher risk of modified MACE, HF, and ACM. This may have risk-stratification implications for T2DM patients based on background CKD and highlights the potential importance of novel renoprotective strategies.

### Modeling chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic literature review of models, data sources, and derivation cohorts [^113UwHzZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic conditions such as obesity and diabetes are among the main risk factors for CKD and increase the risk of non-CKD sequelae in patients with CKD. Diabetes, in particular, is an independent risk factor for kidney damage, prevalent in almost two-thirds of patients with CKD, and will contribute substantially to the projected increase in worldwide CKD cases.

The treatment of CKD in T2DM has recently advanced, after a prolonged period with limited progress in therapeutic options, by the availability of novel drug classes including sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, such as canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, and mineralocorticoid receptor agonists, such as finerenone.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have cardio- and renoprotective effects, as evaluated by improvements in eGFR and albuminuria and in clinically relevant endpoints, and they reduce mortality in patients with T2DM and at different stages of CKD. A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials for empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM showed that the risk of dialysis, transplant, and death due to kidney disease was reduced by 33%, and risk of ESKD was reduced by 35% with SGLT2 inhibitors relative to placebo, with benefits observed across eGFR subgroups and albuminuria levels at baseline. A similar analysis of cardiovascular outcomes trials in T2DM showed that use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with reductions in worsening eGFR, ESKD, or renal death risk of between 36% and 52%. Similarly, an additional meta-analysis of six placebo-controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, including five trials conducted in populations with T2DM, showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduced risk of worsening kidney function, ESKD, or kidney death as well as reduced all-cause mortality, irrespective of metformin use.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

### Coronary artery disease is a predictor of progression to dialysis in patients with chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and anemia: an analysis of the trial to reduce cardiovascular events with aranesp therapy (TREAT) [^116uynoJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 1, 2 and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 3 T2DM and CKD are known independent risk factors for cardiovascular death, and patients with CKD are more likely to die from cardiovascular causes than to progress to end‐stage renal disease (ESRD). 3 The association between kidney disease and poor cardiovascular outcomes has been demonstrated in several populations, 4, 5, 6 and a meta‐analysis showed that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² had higher all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with patients with an eGFR > 90 mL/min per 1.73 m². Furthermore, mortality increased with each incremental decrease in eGFR. 4

Diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, peripheral artery disease, and heart failure (HF). 7 Several studies have demonstrated that having diabetes alone is a cardiovascular risk equivalent in terms of cardiovascular event rates. 8, 9 In addition, diabetic patients with evidence of microalbuminuria have a 2‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular death, even in the absence of nephropathy. 10 Patients with CKD also have higher rates of stroke, HF, and myocardial infarction 3 as well as cardiovascular death independent of diabetes status. 11 The National Kidney Foundation task force recognizes that patients with both T2DM and CKD are at the highest risk for the development of cardiovascular disease 6 and advocates aggressive cardiovascular risk management of these patients.

Although clear evidence shows that CKD is a predictor of cardiovascular events and death 3, 11 and is associated with accelerated CAD progression, 12 the reverse has not been examined. Specifically, it is not known whether CAD is an independent predictor of progression of CKD to ESRD in patients with T2DM. We compared renal outcomes and mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) according to history of known CAD. 13

### Heart failure and chronic kidney disease manifestation and mortality risk associations in type 2 diabetes: a large multinational cohort study [^1163BSn1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects more than 425 million patients worldwide, 1 with a high prevalence of cardiorenal disease, heart failure (HF) 6%–27% 2, 3 and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 4%–20%. 2, 4 Hence, HF and CKD are becoming pandemic complications in T2D. 2, 5, 6, 7 HF and CKD are severe conditions that, separately and in combination, are associated with high symptom burden and cardiovascular risk, mortality risk and healthcare costs, particularly in patients with T2D. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The seriousness of these diseases is further accentuated because a failing heart could lead to kidney failure, and vice versa, through multifaceted inter‐organ crosstalk 16 driving a vicious cycle resulting in cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). 17

Residual risks of HF and CKD in T2D have been reported despite established preventive and cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment strategies. One recent study reported that optimal management of CVD risk factors in T2D might neutralize the excess risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke; but not the risk of HF, which remained high when compared to patients without T2D. 18 Other reports showed that the prevalence of and mortality risk associated with CKD in clinical practice remains high despite use of renin‐angiotensin inhibition, this being the most commonly used treatment to slow renal function decline in T2D. 19, 20 Consequently, optimization of classic CVD risk factor treatment may ameliorate the risk of atherosclerotic diseases, 21 but less effectively control risk of HF and CKD in T2D. 22

Sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors belong to a novel glucose‐lowering drug class, for which cardiovascular outcome trials have shown consistent risk‐reducing effects on hospitalization for and worsening of HF 23, 24, 25, 26 and CKD, 27, 28, 29 even in patients with T2D who have no history of established CVD. 28, 30, 31 The high HF and CKD prevalence and associated risks 18, 19, 20 show an important unmet clinical need that might be considered when choosing preventive strategies in early stages of T2D, taking recent paradigm‐shifting results into account. 22, 28, 30 However, current knowledge of the temporal development of HF and CKD, hereafter referred to as cardiorenal disease, in patients with T2D is scarce, but critically important to understand when deciding future cardiovascular preventive strategies.

### Outcome trends in people with heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in the UK over twenty years [^114YBnAU]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) together with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major pandemics of the twenty first century. It is not known in people with new onset HF, what the distinct and combined associations are between T2D and CKD comorbidities and cause-specific hospital admissions and death, over the past 20 years.

Methods

An observational study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics in England (1998–2017). Participants were people aged ≥ 30 years with new onset HF. Exposure groups were HF with: (i) no T2D and no CKD (reference group); (ii) CKD-only (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2); (iii) T2D-only; (iv) T2D and CKD. CKD severity groups were: CKD-3a (eGFR 45–59); CKD-3b (30–44); CKD-4 (15–29); CKD-5 (< 15). Outcomes were cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular hospitalisations and all-cause death.

Findings

In 87,709 HF patients (mean age, 78 years; 49% female), 40% had CKD-only, 12% T2D-only, and 16% both. Age-standardised first-year CVD hospitalisation rates were significantly higher in HF patients with CKD-only (46.4; 95% CI 44.9,47.9 per 100 person years) and T2D-only (49.2; 46.7,58.8) than in the reference group (35.1; 34.0,36.1); the highest rate was in patients with T2D-CKD-5: 89.1 (65.8,112.4). Similar patterns were observed for non-CVD hospitalisations and deaths. Group differences remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Median survival was highest in the reference (4.4 years) and HF-T2D-only (4.1 years) groups, compared to HF-CKD-only (2.2 years). HF-T2D-CKD group survival ranged from 2.8 (CKD-3a) to 0.7 years (CKD-5). Over time, CVD hospitalisation rates significantly increased for HF-CKD-only (+26%) and reduced (-24%) for HF-T2D-only groups; no reductions were observed in any of the HF-T2D-CKD groups. Trends were similar for non-CVD hospitalisations and death: whilst death rates significantly reduced for HF-T2D-only (-37%), improvement was not observed in any of the T2D-CKD groups.

Interpretation

In a cohort of people with new onset HF, hospitalisations and deaths are high in patients with T2D or CKD, and worst in those with both comorbidities. Whilst outcomes have improved over time for patients with HF and comorbid T2D, similar trends were not seen in those with comorbid CKD. Strategies to prevent and manage CKD in people with HF are urgently needed.

### Associations of kidney disease measures with mortality and end-stage renal disease in individuals with and without diabetes: a meta-analysis [^113KFEv2]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease is characterised by low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and high albuminuria, and is associated with adverse outcomes. Whether these risks are modified by diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis of studies selected according to Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium criteria. Data transfer and analyses were done between March, 2011, and June, 2012. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with eGFR and albuminuria in individuals with and without diabetes.

Findings

We analysed data for 1,024,977 participants (128,505 with diabetes) from 30 general population and high-risk cardiovascular cohorts and 13 chronic kidney disease cohorts. In the combined general population and high-risk cohorts with data for all-cause mortality, 75,306 deaths occurred during a mean follow-up of 8.5 years (SD 5.0). In the 23 studies with data for cardiovascular mortality, 21,237 deaths occurred from cardiovascular disease during a mean follow-up of 9.2 years (SD 4.9). In the general and high-risk cohorts, mortality risks were 1.2–1.9 times higher for participants with diabetes than for those without diabetes across the ranges of eGFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). With fixed eGFR and ACR reference points in the diabetes and no diabetes groups, HR of mortality outcomes according to lower eGFR and higher ACR were much the same in participants with and without diabetes (eg, for all-cause mortality at eGFR 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) [vs 95 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)], HR 1.35; 95% CI 1.18–1.55; vs 1.33; 1.19–1.48 and at ACR 30 mg/g [vs 5 mg/g], 1.50; 1.35–1.65 vs 1.52; 1.38–1.67). The overall interactions were not significant. We identified much the same findings for ESRD in the chronic kidney disease cohorts.

Interpretation

Despite higher risks for mortality and ESRD in diabetes, the relative risks of these outcomes by eGFR and ACR are much the same irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes, emphasising the importance of kidney disease as a predictor of clinical outcomes.

### Pillar risk-based treatment for chronic kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^115ADSaP]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing, with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often presenting as a complication. CKD affected over 840 million people in 2017 and is expected to be the fifth leading cause of life-years lost in 2040. Approximately up to 50% of all people with T2D develop CKD, with a greater chance of development in those over 65 years of age. Older individuals with CKD have an elevated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with age-matched individuals without CKD. CKD has been identified as the primary mediating factor of the increased risk for mortality in people with T2D. There is a need for primary care practitioners to efficiently diagnose CKD and implement effective treatment strategies to reduce the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular complications in individuals with T2D and CKD.

### A synergistic effect of variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate with chronic kidney disease on all-cause mortality prediction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^111x6Gn5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the present study, the HbA1c level was significantly associated with CKD at enrollment, but an HbA1c ≥ 7% was not an independent predictor for all-cause mortality. High HbA1c levels have been reported to be associated with CKD in patients with type 2 DM. However, intensive glucose control did not decrease all-cause mortality in a median 10-years follow-up in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Although the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced during an additional 10 years of the UKPDS posttrial observation, a baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% could not significantly predict mortality during a median follow-up of 19 months in the present study. Notably, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was an independent protector against mortality in the present study. It has been reported that SGLT2 inhibitors have a glucose-independent benefit on mortality reduction, and protection occurred early in the EMPA-REG outcome trial. In line with our study, Schechter et al. reported that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality based on real-world practice data. It has been reported that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors depend on body weight based on the medical datasets from a multicenter health care system in Taiwan. Furthermore, there are sex-specific effects of DM on mortality. The effect of structured personal diabetes care on the reduction of all-cause mortality risk was worse in men than in women. Consistently, male sex was an independent predictor for all-cause mortality in the present study.

### Prevalence and predictors of chronic kidney disease among type 2 diabetic patients worldwide, systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cKLTS]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease among type 2 diabetes mellites patients was high based on the included 20 articles. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease varies across country with the highest in USA and the lowest in Ethiopia. The review reported that old age, hypertension, having cardiac disease, smoking, obesity, having history of type 2 diabetes mellitus were predictor variables for chronic kidney disease among diabetic patients. Patients with CKD have an elevated risk of severe renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, in order to lower the morbidity and mortality from chronic kidney disease among type 2 diabetic patients, it is advised to develop both preventive and curative intervention strategies, such as raising awareness, creating a supportive environment and prescribing appropriate medication at an early stage.

### Incidence and risk factors for mortality and end-stage renal disease in people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease: a population-based cohort study in the UK [^117VP3jV]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase with projections of a rise from 9.3% in 2019 to 10.9% by 2045, largely driven by ageing populations and lifestyle changes. About 30%–40% of people with diabetes will develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — kidney disease caused by diabetes itself, and the leading cause of overall chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition, about 30% of people with type 2 diabetes will progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and renal replacement therapy among these persons estimated to account for 3%–5% of national European healthcare budgets.

Cardiovascular (CV) complications are a major cause of mortality in people with diabetes, and those with DKD have a particularly high risk of these complications. Ten-year cumulative all-cause mortality in people with diabetes and CKD has been estimated to be 31.1%, compared with 11.5% in people with diabetes but without CKD, and 7.7% in people without either condition. There is mounting evidence that people with DKD face an increased risk of death, which does not seem to depend on the DKD subphenotype. While last two decades have seen a significant decline in the development of CV disease (CVD) and associated death among people with diabetes, reductions in progression to ESRD have been much smaller. Moreover, because of the high prevalence of diabetes, the burden of both diabetes-related CVD and renal complications remains high, and despite the effectiveness of current DKD management strategies, mortality among people with DKD remains strikingly high. Among the literature on this topic, relatively few studies have focused on the incidence and risk factors of major clinical outcomes specifically among the DKD population. There is therefore a need to better understand the epidemiology of CV/renal outcomes and mortality among this high-risk group of people with diabetes. We aimed to determine the incidence of, and risk factors for all-cause and CV mortality, and development of stage 5 CKD/ESRD in a population-based cohort study of people with type 2 diabetes with/without DKD.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^115tnt21]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30 000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, renal and safety outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113WvR3w]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

The use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been limited, primarily because glycaemic efficacy is dependent on kidney function. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library until 7 August 2018 and websites of the US, European and Japanese regulatory authorities until 27 July 2018 for data from randomized controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors that included reporting of effects on biomarkers, cardiovascular, renal or safety outcomes in individuals with T2DM and CKD. Random effects models and inverse variance weighting were used to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Data were obtained from 27 studies with up to 7363 participants involved. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors lowered glycated haemoglobin (-0.29%; 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.19) as well as blood pressure, body weight and albuminuria. SGLT2 inhibition reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.94) and heart failure (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48–0.78), without a clear effect on all-cause mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73–1.01). These agents also attenuated the annual decline in eGFR slope (placebo-subtracted difference of 1.35 mL/1.73 m 2 /y; 95% CI, 0.78–1.93) and reduced the risk of the composite renal outcome (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53–0.95). There was no evidence of additional risks with SGLT2 inhibition in CKD beyond those already known for the class, although heterogeneity was observed across individual agents for some safety outcomes.

Conclusion

Currently available data suggest that, despite only modest reductions in glycated haemoglobin, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with T2DM and CKD, without clear evidence of additional safety concerns.

### Dialysis in end-stage renal… [^112enros]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

- Treating type 2 diabetes with metformin in CKD reduces mortality and can be continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m
2. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists also improve outcomes in CKD. From the AFP Editors. Table 1, which is most often calculated from serum creatinine. If screening or stratifying CKD risk, physicians should use urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio testing with eGFR to improve risk prediction. The recommendations suggest a single eGFR based on a cystatin-C measurement, if available, because it is less affected by age, sex, and muscle mass than creatinine in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL per minute per 1. 73 m
2. Blood Pressure Management One meta-analysis suggests reduced mortality in CKD when systolic blood pressure is maintained below 140 mm Hg. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be used to treat patients who have CKD with albuminuria and diabetes mellitus.

For CKD with albuminuria but no diabetes, an ACE inhibitor is preferred because of a 31% reduction in end-stage renal disease. Treatment of Diabetes with CKD Metformin is considered first-line therapy to decrease mortality in type 2 diabetes with CKD. Metformin can be started above an eGFR of 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m² and safely continued until eGFR drops to 30 mL per minute per

1.73 m². Consider additional treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to reduce CKD progression. SGLT-2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce hospitalization for heart failure, with uncertain effect on mortality. Based on a post-hoc trial analysis, GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to reduce major cardiovascular events and mortality in CKD and may slightly reduce CKD progression. Conversely, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors do not improve outcomes in CKD.

### Heart failure and chronic kidney disease manifestation and mortality risk associations in type 2 diabetes: a large multinational cohort study [^114EPxRN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease was, next to HF, the other most frequent first CVRD manifestation in initially CVRD‐free patients with T2D across all countries. To our knowledge little is known about the development of incident CKD in a real‐world CVRD‐free T2D population, also in comparison to development of other CVD events. The association between poor kidney function, for example, low eGFR or high albuminuria, and CVD or mortality risk has been firmly established in previous reports. 10, 15 We have shown that presence of CKD is associated with increased CVD and mortality risks in a T2D population across several countries. These findings support that CKD is strongly associated with CVD 10 and that the combination with T2D is associated with severe consequences, which require improved treatment strategies. 54, 55

Finally, we have shown that HF in T2D is associated with a high (twofold) risk of CKD and vice versa, confirming that multifaceted crosstalk forms a vicious circle between the failing cardiorenal organs. 16, 17, 56 To our knowledge, few epidemiological data on CRS and its associations with CVD and death risk have been reported. We have shown that single presence of CRS is associated with very high (three‐ to fourfold) CVD and mortality risks compared to CVRD‐free with T2D status. This shows that all components of cardiorenal disease, HF, CKD and especially CRS, are associated with serious risks. While the increased complication risks of HF and CKD are known, little has been reported about the associated risks in patients with T2D who are otherwise free from cardiovascular and renal disease. The gravity of cardiorenal diseases has been underlined by Ronco et al, 57 who suggest a novel outcome, major adverse renal and cardiac events (MARCE), to include cardiorenal disease for future trials and observational studies. This was also reinforced in the cardiorenal scientific statement from the American Heart Association in 2019. 17

### Management of patients with diabetes and CKD: conclusions from a "Kidney disease: improving global outcomes" (KDIGO) controversies conference [^116W3Mxf]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes around the world has reached epidemic proportions and is projected to increase to 642 million people by 2040. Diabetes is already the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in most developed countries, and the growth in the number of people with ESKD around the world parallels the increase in diabetes. The presence of kidney disease is associated with a markedly elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and death in people with diabetes. Several new therapies and novel investigational agents targeting chronic kidney disease patients with diabetes are now under development. This conference was convened to assess our current state of knowledge regarding optimal glycemic control, current antidiabetic agents and their safety, and new therapies being developed to improve kidney function and cardiovascular outcomes for this vulnerable population.

### Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the MADIABETES cohort study: association with chronic kidney disease [^113DQckN]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the prevalence of stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline and to identify associated risk factors. To determine the effect of CKD and CKD stage according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria categories on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality after a 5-year follow-up.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of 3443 outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Results

The prevalence of CKD was 28.32% (95% CI, 26.84–29.86); and variables most strongly associated were: age > 74 years (OR, 19.88; 95% CI, 12.89–30.68) and albuminuria (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.72–3.00). During follow-up, 221 CKD patients (22.90%) died compared with 203 non-CKD patients (8.31%) (p < 0.01). The adjusted HR of CKD for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.36–2.44) and 2.11 (95% CI, 1.61–2.76) for those with LDL cholesterol = 135 mg/dl, respectively. The adjusted HR of very-high-risk CKD for all-cause mortality was 4.44 (95% CI, 2.31–8.53) in aged < 75 years and 1.80 (95% CI, 1.19–2.72) in aged ≥ 75 years.

Conclusions

CKD at baseline is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the overall cohort, men and women, or in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Albuminuria is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality only in primary prevention.

### Making an impact on kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the importance of screening for albuminuria [^112vzPR6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). More than one-third of people with T2D also have CKD, and this population is associated with a 10-fold or greater increase in all-cause mortality compared with T2D alone. Furthermore, CKD progression leads to ESKD, which is irreversible and fatal in the absence of kidney replacement therapy.CKD and ESKD are associated with high economic burden, accounting for 22.3% (US$81.8 billion) and 7.2% (US$36.6 billion), respectively, of all Medicare fee-for-service spending in 2018. Medicare expenditures for people with CKD have risen at a rate higher than expenditures for the general Medicare population and have been found costlier for people with CKD and comorbid heart failure or diabetes (type 1 or 2), highlighting clear clinical and economic rationales for early identification and treatment intervention to limit CKD progression in all populations, particularly in people with T2D and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Dapagliflozin, advanced chronic kidney disease, and mortality: new insights from the DAPA-CKD trial [^113PKZzB]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients without diabetes, non-cardiovascular death occurred more often than cardiovascular death (54% vs. 30%), a result not observed in subjects with diabetes (38% vs. 39%), underscoring epidemiological data showing that diabetes is an additional cardiovascular risk promoter in CKD patients.DAPA-CKD enrolled two-thirds of all patients with diabetes and one-third without a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but dapagliflozin led to a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in both subgroups. The second important message is therefore that in DAPA-CKD, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, a therapy originally developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, was life-saving in all CKD patients — irrespective of their diabetes status.

In a very large cohort study on non-cardiovascular mortality in advancing CKD, the relative importance of malignancy diminished, whereas infectious and diabetic complications increasingly contributed to deaths. While these Canadian data mostly have been reproduced in subsequent studies, it is important to note that such studies are all based on ICD-9 or -10 codes, and causes of death have hardly ever been adjudicated in an independent fashion. The more important are the adjudicated DAPA-CKD non-cardiovascular deaths (41% of the overall mortality). The beneficial effect of dapagliflozin on deaths due to infections raises the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors may exhibit modulatory effects on inflammatory processes and immune function beyond the cardiovascular system and the kidney.

A limitation of the present post-hoc analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial is that the findings are based on a relatively low number of events, in particular in non-diabetic patients, as 80% of deaths were clustered in the subgroup with diabetes. Thus, in non-diabetic patients in particular, the effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on infection- or cancer-related mortality can at best be hypothesis generating but deserve further evaluation in clinical studies and experimental approaches. While the authors propose potential mechanisms by which dapagliflozin or, more probably, SGLT2 inhibitors in general might contribute to such benefits, there is a significant likelihood for chance findings given the low event rates. Finally, as with all large clinical trials, a common limitation is that 'healthier' patients tend to be included, which renders an extrapolation to all patients with advanced CKD difficult. Nevertheless, we eagerly await subgroup analyses of particular, more homogeneous, DAPA-CKD patients, such as the 270 patients with IgA nephropathy.

What's new?

Diabetes is the commonest cause of CKD and ESKD globally and these people have a very high risk of CVD and death.
Trial data confirm that the rate of progression to ESKD, CVD and mortality in people with with CKD due to type‐2 diabetes can be can be effectively mitigated by established and newer interventions.
Recent studies demonstrate stark inadequacies and inequities in the management of diabetic CKD in the UK and elsewhere.

### Outcome trends in people with heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in the UK over twenty years [^116ibCTn]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Globally, heart failure (HF) affects at least 26 million people and is increasing in prevalence. HF is diagnosed in 1–2% of the general population, increasing to 5–10% in people over 65 years. Even with improved therapies for HF, the mortality rate remains high, with approximately 50% mortality within 5 years of diagnosis. HF together with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) are major pandemics of the twenty first century. These chronic diseases often occur together, with complex inter-relations, which calls for more clarity on the relative associations between each of the three conditions and adverse outcomes.

Due to the system based specialisation in the medical model of care, current strategies for managing most chronic diseases such as HF, CKD and T2D, encourage clinicians to adopt evidence-based guidelines for these conditions separately. In recent years however, due to improvements in diagnosis and treatments resulting in more people living longer with these chronic long-term conditions, strategies that are more complex are often needed. The emergence of therapeutic agents that provide cardio-reno-protective benefits. are shifting the treatment paradigm to a broader goal of reducing morbidity, mortality and end-organ complications in these chronic conditions. Despite this knowledge, little contemporary information is available on mortality or cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular hospitalisation trends in people with HF in relation to the presence of T2D and CKD.

In a recent large multi-national population-based study, it was shown that HF and renal disease manifestation were the first reasons for admission in people with prior diabetes and no cardio-renal disease. In another study using registry data of people with T2D, CKD was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.

The aim of the current analysis was to build on the findings of these previous studies, to investigate the distinct and combined associations between T2D and CKD comorbidities and cause-specific hospital admissions and death in people with HF in England between 1998 and 2017.

### Kidney and cardiovascular-protective benefits of combination drug therapies in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes [^115xPAz1]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) globally. In the United States between 2017 and 2020, approximately one in three people with T2D had chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of both T2D and CKD poses a major public health challenge because patients are at an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and related mortality compared with patients with either condition alone. For example, results from an observational cohort study involving 3211 people from the Jackson Heart Study showed that the combination of T2D and CKD was associated with a greater excess risk for incident stroke, coronary heart disease, and CV mortality versus those with T2D or CKD alone.

The global burden of CKD resulting from T2D has increased substantially over the last three decades. While CKD was the 19th leading cause of death globally in 1990, it is now the 11th leading cause of death, due to an increasing incidence of T2D and hypertension that together contribute to > 50% of deaths in patients with CKD. The burden of CKD was demonstrated by 2017 data, which showed that CKD associated with T2D accounted for one-third of all disability-adjusted life years globally. Having both these conditions is also associated with a considerable economic burden, particularly in those in the moderate/high-risk categories. Medicare reported spending more than $135 billion on CKD in 2020, with greater rates of spending for patients with CKD plus comorbid T2D or heart failure.

### Thiazolidinediones for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes [^1114sMd7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it affects quality of life and contributes to substantial costs for healthcare systems. Approximately a third of people with type 2 diabetes develop CKD. Thiazolidinediones are associated with improved glucose management and a lower risk of progression to kidney failure, requiring long-term dialysis. However, evidence of safety in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes is still lacking and is based on low-certainty studies.

Objectives

This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of thiazolidinediones in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies was searched up to October 2024 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if they compared treatment with thiazolidinediones against placebo, usual medical care or another glucose-lowering agent in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We included all CKD stages (from 1 to 5), including people treated with dialysis.

Outcomes

The critical outcomes included cardiovascular death and severe hypoglycaemia. The important outcomes included death (any cause), 3-point and 4-point major cardiovascular events (MACE), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT), and adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Risk of Bias 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Included Studies

Eighty-five studies involving 3044 participants were included. The median age was 62 years, and the median follow-up was 24 weeks; one study included children. Five studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1 and 2, six studies in people with CKD stages 3 to 5, seven studies in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1 and 2 and CKD stages 3 to 5. Overall, the risks of bias in the included studies for all critical outcomes in studies that compared thiazolidinediones to placebo or standard care alone were high due to concerns about blinding. The overall risk of bias for cardiovascular death reported in studies that compared thiazolidinediones to placebo or standard care alone was assessed as low or uncertain, except for two studies that were considered at high risk of bias due to concerns about lack of blinding, whilst other domains seemed to be free from other sources of bias. Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia: one study was assessed as unclear risk of bias for all the risk of bias domains, while the other study was considered at high risk of bias due to concerns about lack of blinding. Other critical outcomes, including 3-and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT were not reported in the included studies.

Synthesis Of Results

Compared to placebo or standard care alone, thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.97; 4 studies, 226 participants; low-certainty evidence), whilst the effect of severe hypoglycaemia was not estimable (2 studies, 107 participants) in people with all CKD stages and type 2 diabetes. No study evaluated the effects of 3- and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT. Compared to sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 2.78, 95% CI 0.11 to 67.92; 4 studies, 483 participants; low-certainty evidence) in people with CKD stages 1 and 2 and type 2 diabetes, but no study evaluated the effects of severe hypoglycaemia, 3- and 4-point MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or kidney failure requiring KRT. The effects of thiazolidinediones compared to other hypoglycaemic agents or different doses of thiazolidinediones were uncertain. The risk of bias in the included studies was high or unclear, leading to low to very low-certainty evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

Thiazolidinediones may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death, whilst the effects of severe hypoglycaemia or other cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were uncertain in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. The effects of thiazolidinediones in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes are insufficient to provide firm conclusions. Future studies will address the benefits and harms of thiazolidinediones in this setting, reporting the core outcomes as prioritised by stakeholders to better inform decision-making.

### Diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: a consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^113hL7bJ]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

People with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for kidney failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and premature mortality. Recent clinical trials support new approaches to treat diabetes and CKD. The 2022 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease each provide evidence-based recommendations for management. A joint group of ADA and KDIGO representatives reviewed and developed a series of consensus statements to guide clinical care from the ADA and KDIGO guidelines. The published guidelines are aligned in the areas of CKD screening and diagnosis, glycemia monitoring, lifestyle therapies, treatment goals, and pharmacologic management. Recommendations include comprehensive care in which pharmacotherapy that is proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is layered on a foundation of healthy lifestyle. Consensus statements provide specific guidance on use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. These areas of consensus provide clear direction for implementation of care to improve clinical outcomes of people with diabetes and CKD.

### Effects of liraglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease [^115vkwrj]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are closely associated. Diabetic kidney disease is the most common cause of CKD and affects ≈40% of patients with T2DM. Patients with diabetic kidney disease are at substantially increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, and most die from CV disease before reaching end-stage kidney disease or requiring renal replacement therapy. Low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or presence of albuminuria independently predict CV outcomes such as CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with T2DM. – Current standard CV treatment for these patients broadly aligns with current guidelines for patients with normal kidney function. However, a beneficial effect shown in patients with normal kidney function does not necessarily apply to patients with CKD, for example, as has been seen with statins in patients with advanced CKD. –

In previous landmark trials, intensive glycemic control limited the risk of microvascular complications of T2DMbut did not demonstrate CV benefits. Results from recent CV outcome trials with basal insulin, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors – ensured CV safety, whereas CV benefits were reported for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, thus suggesting CV-protective effects at least partly independent of glycemic control.

There are no dedicated controlled trials that have examined interventions or medications to lower the excessive CV risk of CKD in association with T2DM. Subgroup analyses of the recent CV outcome trials in T2DM with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. and SGLT-2 inhibitors, showed no different effects of the antihyperglycemic medications on major CV outcomes in those with and without CKD. Many antihyperglycemic medications exhibit altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when kidney function is reduced, which may potentially affect safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the dose of many of those medications needs to be reduced in the presence of CKD, which may affect their impact on CV disease. The metabolism and elimination of liraglutide is mostly unaffected with decreasing kidney function, and it has been approved for use in patients with severe renal impairment without dose adjustment.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1124MLyW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease — glycemic management and cardiovascular risk: Emerging data indicate that intensive glycemic control reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and death, with benefits primarily in long-term intensive glycemia management; in type 2 diabetes, insulin‑sensitizing agents may be beneficial for reducing CVD event rates, although prospective controlled trials should confirm these observations. Observational signals include that pioglitazone may reduce all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in type 2 diabetes, and metformin use was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction and death in people with type 2 diabetes; however, caution is advised with use of metformin in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although studies regarding intensive glycemic control and CVD in people with diabetes and CKD are nonexistent, patients with diabetes and CKD should strive to achieve glucose control as close to normal as possible without excessive episodes of hypoglycemia.

### Metformin use and mortality in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: national, retrospective, observational, cohort study [^112eRdjU]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin is recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, use of this drug has been contraindicated in individuals with impaired kidney function because of the perceived risk of lactic acidosis. Evidence now supports cautious use of metformin in people with mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease. However, studies examining the use of metformin in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are lacking. We aimed to assess the safety of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced (approximately stage 5) chronic kidney disease.

Methods

We did a retrospective, observational, cohort study of patients with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance research database between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. We included individuals with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L, which is approximately equivalent to stage 5 chronic kidney disease. From a consecutive sample of 12350 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, 1005 used metformin and 11345 were non-users. We matched users and non-users of metformin by propensity score in a 1:3 ratio. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Findings

813 metformin users were matched by propensity score to 2439 non-users. The two groups of patients did not differ significantly by 30 baseline clinical and socioeconomic variables. Median follow-up in the matched cohort was 2.1 years (range 0.3–9.8). All-cause mortality was reported in 434 (53%) of 813 metformin users and in 1012 (41%) of 2439 non-users. After multivariate adjustment, metformin use was an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.51; p < 0.0001). The increased mortality risk was dose-dependent and was consistent across all subgroup analyses. However, metformin use compared with no use was associated with a higher but non-significant risk of metabolic acidosis (1.6 vs 1.3 events per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio 1.30, 95% CI 0.88–1.93; p = 0.19).

Interpretation

Use of metformin in people with type 2 diabetes and a serum creatinine concentration greater than 530 μmol/L is associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality compared with non-users. Metformin use should not be encouraged in this patient group.

### Role of physical activity in reducing diabetic kidney disease risk in adults: data from the national health and nutrition examination survey, 2017–2018 [^115kKdwc]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is showing a dramatic rise in incidence and prevalence worldwide that is largely driven by an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. In 2021, diabetes afflicted about 537 million people globally, or 11% of the world population, and this value is expected to reach 783 million, or 12%, by 2045. During their lifetime, nearly half of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and one‐third of those with type 1 diabetes mellitus are at risk of developing diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Among the long‐term complications associated with diabetes mellitus, DKD is one of the most common and severe.

DKD accounts for approximately 50% of such cases worldwide, severely impacts patients' quality of life, and is also linked with high rates of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Chronic kidney disease affects around 700 million people, or 9% of the global population, with nearly four million requiring kidney replacement therapy. Although chronic kidney disease is more prevalent in women, men with chronic kidney disease are more likely to progress to end‐stage kidney disease, thus requiring kidney replacement therapy. These statistics highlight the urgent need to deepen our understanding of DKD in order to alleviate the significant global health burden imposed by this disease.

### Impact of type 2 diabetes on life expectancy and role of kidney disease among inpatients with heart failure in Switzerland: an ambispective cohort study [^116WVoEQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Global trends on the burden of diabetes and heart failure (HF) continue to increase, thus highlighting the need for more effective preventive strategies. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and HF individually confer considerable burden that are multiplied when these diseases co-exist, further decreasing patient's quality of life and increasing healthcare costs. In Switzerland, 500,000 (6%) of the population is estimated to have T2D and about 30–40% of them have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Meanwhile, cardiovascular diseases are main cause of mortality accounting for 27% of all deaths in 2020, likely preceded by heart failure.

Hospitalised patients with HF represent advanced stages of disease with poor prognosis: high risk of in-hospital mortality from 4 to 7%, rehospitalisation from 25 to 30%, and mortality from 7 to 11%, with shorter life expectancy. While T2D is expected to worsen the prognosis of patients with HF, the evidence from observational studies has been inconsistent, with some studies showing adverse impact, and some other studies reporting no impact on mortality. Moreover, these studies have mostly described short- and intermediate-term outcomes (i.e. up to 1-year). Meanwhile, CKD is prevalent among patients with T2D, and HF patients with CKD show higher risks for mortality than those without CKD. Whether co-existence of both T2D and CKD in inpatients with HF would pose a higher burden on long-term mortality and life expectancy is not yet fully explored.

Studies that have explored the association between diabetes and mortality in HF patients did not estimate life expectancy of inpatients with HF, nor compare life expectancy between those with or without diabetes. Previous studies limited their findings to hazard ratio estimates (instead of absolute risk estimates), that limits bed-side interpretability. Similarly, some studies adjusted for presence of CKD, and but did not estimate the added mortality risk of CKD among inpatients with HF.

Therefore, by using data of inpatients with HF at the largest tertiary cardiovascular referral hospital in Switzerland, we compared mortality outcomes among patients with or without T2D and estimated the differences in life expectancy between groups. Additionally, we explored whether co-existence of T2D and CKD was associated with worse prognosis.

### Management of the 'wicked' combination of heart failure and chronic kidney disease in the patient with diabetes [^115sAw5S]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing heart failure and chronic kidney disease. The presence of these co-morbidities substantially increases the risk of morbidity as well as mortality in patients with diabetes. The clinical focus has historically centred around reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease by targeting hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension. Nonetheless, patients with type 2 diabetes who have well-controlled blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels may still go on to develop heart failure, kidney disease or both. Major diabetes and cardiovascular societies are now recommending the use of treatments such as sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, in addition to currently recommended therapies, to promote cardiorenal protection through alternative pathways as early as possible in individuals with diabetes and cardiorenal manifestations. This review examines the most recent recommendations for managing the risk of cardiorenal progression in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^1119vw2p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Prognostic models for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes: living systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^1145hQpj]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus affects approximately 537 million adults worldwide, and this number is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030, and 783 million by 2045. Diabetes related healthcare expenditures represent a significant economic burden, costing US$966 billion annually worldwide. In 2021, diabetes was the cause of 6.7 million deaths globally, accounting for 12.2% of all deaths in individuals aged 20–79 years old. Furthermore, individuals living with diabetes have high rates of comorbidity, with approximately 32% of people also having cardiovascular disease and 27% having chronic kidney disease.

However, substantial variation exists in prognoses across patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus; factors such as age, sex, glycaemic control, obesity, and pre-existing cardiovascular and kidney diseases affect an individuals' risk of future cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. To account for the impact of these variables, many risk prediction models incorporating multiple risk factors have been developed and validated for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These models show great promise: clinicians can use them to prognosticate patients and in clinical decision making, or they can be used by researchers and policy makers to better understand the risk of events across different groups of patients. However, these prognostic models need to yield valid and reliable risk estimates to inform decision making.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^115Cxoto]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — definitions and scope for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) specify that "Definitions of DKD by albuminuria and stage are shown in Table 6", and that "we included studies of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 5 regardless of whether kidney biopsies were performed", while "Studies of kidney transplant recipients were excluded". Terminology is clarified: "the term DKD refers to a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes", and "The term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes". Practice context notes that "Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes", although "there are no conclusive data that early intervention and treatment of microalbuminuria prevents CKD stage 5 or mortality in such patients".

Methods

Study design and population

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations.

This study used five cycles of NHANES data between the years 2005–2014. 2014 is the latest survey available with linked mortality from the National Death Index (NDI). The start date for each individual was the date they completed the NHANES survey. Death date was set at as the date included in the linked National Death Index data file and individuals who were not deceased were censored at the end of the study follow-up date (December 31st, 2015). The study population was limited to adults 20 years of age and older, who 1) participated both in the interview and physical examination, 2) had both CKD and diabetes, and 3) had linked mortality data from NDI. In total, 1652 participants were included in the analysis.

Measurements and definitions

Diabetes definition

Diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes, or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5% per 2016 American Diabetes Association guidelines. Self-reported diabetes were based on individuals answering "yes" to any of the following three questions: "Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?", "Are you now taking insulin?", or "Are you now taking diabetic pills to lower your blood sugar?"

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition

CKD was defined based on Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories (G1-G5) and albuminuria/urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio categories (A1-A3) according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Urinary albumin and urinary creatinine were measured from a random urine sample collected in the Mobile Exam Center. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was calculated based on the measured values. eGFR was calculated using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology equation, the recommended formulae for eGFR per the KDIGO guidelines. Creatinine from the serum specimen collected in the Mobile Exam Center was used to calculate eGFR. The Jaffe rate method was used to determine the concentration of creatinine in serum for NHANES 2005–2006. As such, a correction of the NHANES 2005–2006 serum creatinine was done while no correction was required for NHANES 2007–2014 since serum creatinine were standardized for these years.

### Manifestation of heart failure and chronic kidney disease are associated with increased mortality risk in early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus: analysis of a Japanese real-world hospital claims database [^11343Gww]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To assess the initial manifestation of comorbidities and their impact on mortality risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without a history of cardiovascular or renal complications (i.e. in the early stages of T2DM) compared with patients without T2DM.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using a Japanese hospital claims database. The incidence rates of comorbidities (chronic kidney disease [CKD], heart failure [HF], myocardial infarction [MI], peripheral arterial disease [PAD], and stroke) and mortality risk were compared between patients with T2DM and age-/sex-matched patients without T2DM (matched 1:2).

Results

Among the comorbidities assessed in this study, CKD and/or HF was the most frequent initial manifestation in the patients with T2DM (n = 426,186) with an incidence rate 2.02 times greater than that in matched patients without T2DM (n = 1,018,609). The mortality risk was also greater in patients with T2DM than in patients without T2DM with a hazard ratio of 1.73. In both patients with and without T2DM, the presence of CKD or HF was associated with greater mortality risks compared with the presence of MI, PAD, or stroke.

Conclusions

The high incidence of CKD or HF manifestation can contribute to the augmented mortality risk in patients in the early stages of T2DM compared with patients without T2DM. These findings highlight the importance of early interventions for preventing/treating CKD and HF to improve the prognosis of patients with T2DM.
