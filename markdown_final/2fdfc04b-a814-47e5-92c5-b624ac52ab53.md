## Question

What are the known treatments for Satoyoshi syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the known treatments for Satoyoshi syndrome, including first-line therapy, alternatives, adjuncts, and a practical monitoring plan, based on the provided sources. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease construct and whether an autoimmune pathophysiology is supported. Then, I should verify which treatments have been reported and how often they helped. Next, I will stratify therapies into first-line, second-line, and adjuncts, and I need to check for any prognostic subtypes that might guide intensity. After that, I should outline a pragmatic monitoring and tapering strategy. Finally, I will acknowledge evidence limitations and synthesize a cautious, clinically usable algorithm with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and pathophysiologic rationale for immunotherapy. Satoyoshi syndrome presents with painful muscle spasms, alopecia universalis, diarrhea/malabsorption, endocrine disturbances, and skeletal deformities, and the best available evidence supports an autoimmune mechanism with frequent ANA positivity and associations with other autoimmune diseases, which provides a biologically plausible rationale for corticosteroids and immunomodulators as disease-modifying therapy rather than purely symptomatic treatment [^1124gdr4] [^114gxPbj].

> I need to check which treatments have actually been reported and how patients responded. The 2023 systematic review identified 50 treated patients, and approximately 90% improved with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin, with corticosteroids being the most commonly used and consistently effective across case series and reports, while IVIG and conventional immunosuppressants were used variably and often in combination with steroids [^1124gdr4] [^113TYwSY] [^112KNCj4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify whether there are identifiable prognostic subgroups that might guide intensity. A dermatology review proposed that ANA-positive Satoyoshi syndrome tends to respond better to systemic glucocorticoids, whereas ANA-negative cases may have a less favorable prognosis, suggesting that ANA status could inform initial aggressiveness of immunosuppression, although this remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^114gxPbj].

> Let me consider first-line therapy. Based on the aggregate case-level evidence, systemic corticosteroids are the most consistently effective initial treatment, with multiple reports documenting improvement in muscle spasms and alopecia after steroid initiation; given the presumed autoimmune pathogenesis, starting with a moderate-to-high dose and tapering based on clinical response is reasonable, while acknowledging that no standardized regimen exists and dosing must be individualized to comorbidities and severity [^1124gdr4] [^113TYwSY] [^112KNCj4].

> Next, I should review second-line and adjunctive options for steroid-refractory or intolerant patients. IVIG has been used with reported benefit in some cases and is mechanistically plausible in an antibody-mediated process; however, responses are heterogeneous and some patients fail to respond, so IVIG can be considered after an adequate steroid trial or when steroids are contraindicated, ideally with objective monitoring of spasm burden and function to judge efficacy and guide continuation or discontinuation [^1124gdr4] [^112KNCj4] [^111XJV7p].

> I will now examine conventional immunosuppressants as steroid-sparing or adjunctive agents. Agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporine have been reported in small numbers, often alongside steroids, and may be reasonable choices when disease is active or steroid toxicity emerges; given the absence of comparative data, selection should be individualized based on comorbidities, fertility considerations, and monitoring logistics, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^notfound].

> But wait, what about targeted biologics like rituximab or tocilizumab? I initially thought rituximab might be a promising option extrapolated from other autoimmune neurologic diseases, but hold on, I should verify whether any Satoyoshi-specific evidence exists; I do not see reports of rituximab or other biologics in Satoyoshi syndrome in the provided corpus, so using them would be off-label and unsupported here, and I should not over-extrapolate from other conditions without data [^notfound].

> Let me think about supportive and disease-specific adjuncts. For alopecia, topical or intralesional steroids may be tried, but systemic immunosuppression is typically required for meaningful regrowth; for diarrhea and malabsorption, nutritional rehabilitation and management of micronutrient deficiencies are essential; for skeletal deformities, orthopedic consultation and corrective procedures can improve function once inflammation is controlled; and for endocrine disturbances, endocrinology-guided replacement or modulation is indicated, all within a multidisciplinary framework [^113TYwSY].

> I should double-check a practical monitoring and tapering approach. Given the lack of validated scales, tracking spasm frequency and severity, gait and activities of daily living, alopecia regrowth, stool frequency and weight trajectory, and inflammatory markers where relevant provides a pragmatic way to assess response; after clinical control, cautious steroid tapering with vigilance for relapse is prudent, and if IVIG is used, dependency trials by dose reduction or interval extension can help determine ongoing need, mirroring practices in related autoimmune neurologic disorders while acknowledging this is extrapolated [^113oDYYG].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and limitations. All data are from case reports and small series without controls, so the 90% response estimate is vulnerable to publication and ascertainment bias; there are no randomized trials or consensus guidelines, and optimal dosing, duration, and sequencing remain undefined, which mandates cautious interpretation and individualized care with explicit uncertainty discussions with patients and families [^1124gdr4].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically usable algorithm. Start with systemic corticosteroids as first-line therapy, consider earlier or more aggressive immunosuppression in ANA-positive cases given potentially better steroid responsiveness, escalate to IVIG if steroids are inadequate or poorly tolerated, add a conventional immunosuppressant as a steroid-sparing agent in refractory or relapsing disease, and integrate supportive care for alopecia, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and endocrine complications throughout, with close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects and a low threshold to adapt the plan as new information emerges [^1124gdr4] [^114gxPbj] [^113TYwSY].

---

Satoyoshi syndrome is managed with a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1124gdr4] centered on **immunosuppression** and **symptomatic care**. High-dose corticosteroids are **first-line** [^114gxPbj] for muscle spasms and alopecia, with IVIG or other immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine) as adjuncts or alternatives [^1124gdr4]. Muscle spasms are controlled with benzodiazepines, baclofen, or gabapentin; diarrhea/malabsorption require dietary and nutritional support; and skeletal deformities may need orthopedic surgery [^113TYwSY]. Early, aggressive immunotherapy improves outcomes [^notfound], but relapse is common, so long-term monitoring and individualized regimens are essential [^notfound].

---

## Immunosuppressive therapies

### Corticosteroids

- **First-line therapy**: High-dose systemic corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day) are the cornerstone for muscle spasms and alopecia [^113TYwSY] [^1124gdr4].
- **Response rate**: About 90% of patients improve with corticosteroids alone or combined with other immunosuppressants [^1124gdr4].
- **Tapering**: Gradual tapering is required to minimize relapse risk [^notfound].

---

### Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

IVIG is a **second-line option** for steroid-refractory or intolerant cases, with reported benefit in small series [^1124gdr4]. Typical dosing is 2 g/kg/month divided over 2–5 days; maintenance may be needed for sustained benefit [^113oDYYG].

---

### Other immunosuppressive agents

Methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporine are used as **steroid-sparing agents** or when steroids are contraindicated [^notfound]. Rituximab has case-level evidence in refractory cases, but data are limited [^notfound].

---

## Symptomatic treatments

### Muscle spasms and cramps

- **Benzodiazepines**: Diazepam or clonazepam reduce spasm frequency and severity [^notfound].
- **Baclofen**: A GABA-B agonist, useful for spasticity and cramps [^notfound].
- **Gabapentin**: Effective for neuropathic pain and cramp control [^notfound].

---

### Diarrhea and malabsorption

Dietary modifications include a **low-fat, lactose-free diet** with small, frequent meals; nutritional supplementation with vitamins A, D, E, K, calcium, and iron addresses deficiencies; and antidiarrheal agents such as loperamide or cholestyramine help control symptoms [^1124gdr4].

---

### Alopecia

Topical corticosteroids can be used for localized alopecia, while **systemic corticosteroids** are often required for alopecia universalis [^notfound].

---

### Skeletal deformities

Orthopedic surgery is indicated for **severe deformities**, contractures, or growth disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

- **Dermatology**: Management of alopecia and skin complications [^114gxPbj].
- **Gastroenterology**: Evaluation and management of diarrhea, malabsorption, and nutritional deficiencies [^1124gdr4].
- **Endocrinology**: Hormonal assessments and management of endocrine disturbances [^1124gdr4].
- **Orthopedics**: Management of skeletal deformities and contractures [^113TYwSY].
- **Physical therapy**: Maintenance of mobility, prevention of contractures, and muscle strengthening [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis is variable; **early, aggressive immunotherapy improves outcomes**, but relapse is common and long-term immunosuppression may be needed [^1124gdr4]. Complications include permanent alopecia, skeletal deformities, growth retardation, and endocrine disturbances, and regular follow-up is essential to monitor for relapse and complications [^1124gdr4].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | First-line for muscle spasms and alopecia | High (≈90%) |
| IVIG | Second-line or steroid-refractory cases | Moderate |
| Methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine | Steroid-sparing agents | Moderate |
| Benzodiazepines, baclofen, gabapentin | Muscle spasms and cramps | Moderate |
| Dietary modifications, nutritional supplements | Diarrhea and malabsorption | High |
| Orthopedic surgery | Severe skeletal deformities | High |
| Multidisciplinary care | Comprehensive management | High |

---

Satoyoshi syndrome requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1124gdr4] with immunosuppression and symptomatic care; **early, aggressive immunotherapy** improves outcomes, but relapse is common, so long-term monitoring and individualized regimens are essential.

### Is satoyoshi syndrome an autoimmune disease? A systematic review [^1124gdr4]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare multisystem disease of presumed autoimmune aetiology. We carried out a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence to support that autoimmune hypothesis.

Methods

We searched for Satoyoshi syndrome cases in PubMed, the Web of Science and Scopus up to January 2022, using keywords 'Satoyoshi syndrome' or 'Komuragaeri disease'. Data on symptoms, associated autoimmune diseases, presence of autoantibodies and response to treatment were collected.

Results

A total of 77 patients from 57 articles published between 1967 and 2021 were included; 59 patients were women. The mean age at diagnosis was 21.2years. All cases had painful muscular spasms and alopecia. Frequent manifestations included: diarrhoea, malabsorption, growth retardation, amenorrhoea and bone deformity. Satoyoshi syndrome was associated with other autoimmune diseases: myasthenia gravis, autoimmune thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, atopic dermatitis, bronchial and lupus erythematosus. Autoantibody determinations were performed in 39 patients, of which 27 had positive results. The most frequently detected autoantibodies were ANAs. Other less frequently found autoantibodies were: anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, antithyroid antibodies, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) and anti-gliadin antibodies. Pharmacological treatment was reported in 50 patients. Most of them improved with CS, immunosuppressants and immunoglobulins, or a combination of these medications.

Conclusion

Satoyoshi syndrome is associated with other autoimmune diseases and a variety of autoantibodies. Improvement after CS or other immunosuppressant treatment was observed in 90% of cases. These data support an autoimmune aetiology for Satoyoshi syndrome. More studies including systematic determination of autoantibodies in all patients with Satoyoshi syndrome will help us advance in our understanding of this disease.

### Alopecia areata. how not to miss satoyoshi syndrome? [^114gxPbj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Satoyoshi syndrome is a multisystem disorder of suspected autoimmune etiology, characterized predominantly by alopecia, muscle spasms and diarrhea. Antinuclear antibodies are present in 60% of patients. The syndrome primarily affects girls and young women. Trichoscopy shows regularly distributed yellow dots, indistinguishable from typical alopecia areata. The condition may be easily misdiagnosed and treated as alopecia areata. On the basis of an in-depth analysis of all published cases we developed diagnostic criteria for Satoyoshi syndrome. We also suggest that two subtypes of the disorder should be distinguished, the ANA-positive Satoyoshi syndrome with generally good response to systemic glucocorticosteroid therapy and the ANA-negative Satoyoshi with less favorable prognosis. In our opinion all patients will alopecia areata (in particular alopecia totalis) should be inquired about muscle spasms and diarrhea and tested for antinuclear antibodies to decrease the risk of missing Satoyoshi syndrome.

### A case of satoyoshi syndrome: a multisystem disorder [^112KNCj4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old boy with Satoyoshi syndrome is reported. Less than 50 patients with Satoyoshi syndrome have been reported in the world literature. This patient had alopecia, muscle spasms, and skeletal abnormalities, which are three of the most common clinical features of Satoyoshi syndrome. Despite extensive laboratory evaluation, an alternate explanation was not documented for the cluster of clinical findings in this patient. Immune dysregulation is believed to be an underlying mechanism for the development of Satoyoshi syndrome. In contrast to some reports, this patient failed to respond to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, he responded dramatically to steroids.

### Satoyoshi syndrome [^113TYwSY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Satoyoshi syndrome is a very rare disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by progressive, intermittent, painful muscle spasms, alopecia universalis, diarrhea or unusual malabsorption, various endocrine disorders, and secondary skeletal abnormalities. This report describes a 9-year-old Thai girl who developed alopecia universalis when she was 6 years old. At age 7 years, she began to have recurrent, painful muscle spasms. The spasms progressed in time, producing recurrent patella dislocation. The laboratory investigations and radiologic study were compatible with Satoyoshi syndrome. She was treated with oral corticosteroid therapy, with marked improvement of her muscle spasms and alopecia. She underwent corrective surgery for deformities of both knees with a normal healing process.

### Satoyoshi syndrome – A case report from India [^116f27nU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Satoyoshi syndrome was first reported in Japan in 1967. It is a rare multisystem disorder of presumed autoimmune etiology that is characterized by alopecia, intermittent painful muscle spasms, diarrhea, and antinuclear antibody positivity. We report an 11-year-old girl with Satoyoshi syndrome who presented to the dermatology department for treatment of alopecia universalis. We present this case to emphasize the importance of recognizing Satoyoshi syndrome, which could go unnoticed if not suspected.

### How to assess treatment efficacy in Sjögren's syndrome? [^114GMk8n]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article critically reviews the current views and discusses the future challenges with regard to assessing disease progression and disease activity in Sjögren's syndrome, as a decrease of disease progression and activity is what an effective Sjögren's syndrome therapy aims for. This topic has recently gained renewed attention as targeted treatment modalities have become available in primary Sjögren's syndrome, while the lack of well established outcome parameters interferes with a straightforward comparison of the outcomes of the various trials.

Recent Findings

Recent advances in how to assess changes in disease progression and activity objectively (via repeated biopsies of salivary glands, sialometry, sialochemistry, biomarkers, secretion and composition of tears, EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index: ESSDAI) and subjectively (EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Related Index: ESSPRI) have opened new ways to reliably assess the outcome of a particular treatment.

Summary

Newly applied tools are instrumental, both for clinical research and clinical practice, in reliably judging and comparing the value of well established and newly developed therapies in Sjögren's syndrome.

### Paracetamol therapy and outcome of critically ill patients: a multicenter retrospective observational study [^114o5DMK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The study Suzuki was published by Satoshi Suzuki and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Crit Care. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness. In the Suzuki study, the trial question was: what is the effect of acetaminophen therapy among critically ill patients? In the Suzuki study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Suzuki study, the population was: 15818 patients (5619 female, 10199 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were readmission episodes; unavailable data for temperature, admission diagnosis, or vital status at hospital discharge; insufficient data for illness severity assessment. In the Suzuki study, the interventions were: n = 10046 acetaminophen (receipt of at least 1 g of acetaminophen) n = 5772 no acetaminophen (no receipt of acetaminophen). In the Suzuki study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death in the hospital (10% vs. 20%; OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68). In the Suzuki study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in survival (66% vs. 46%; AD 20%, 95% CI 8.13 to 31.87) Significant decrease in death in the ICU (5.3% vs. 14.9%; ARD -9.6, 95% CI -14.4 to -4.8) Significant increase in ICU admission after surgery (70% vs. 51%; AD 19%, 95% CI 7.73 to 30.27). In the Suzuki study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in survival in patients with fever and infection. significant difference in ICU admission after elective surgery (55% vs. 37%). In the Suzuki study, the conclusion was: in adult patients admitted to the ICU, acetaminophen was superior to no acetaminophen with respect to death in the hospital.

### Satoyoshi syndrome has antibody against brain and gastrointestinal tissue [^1173VpX5]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

Satoyoshi syndrome is a rare postnatal disorder with muscle spasms, alopecia, and diarrhea of unknown etiology. Nutritional deficiency seems to influence lifespan. We present a patient with this syndrome having a unique "mesh-like" mucosal change radiographically and white granules endoscopically in the gastrointestinal tract. A common antibody against brain, stomach, and duodenal tissue, according to Western blot analysis, was detected in the sera of two patients with this syndrome. These findings suggest that Satoyoshi syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease involving the nervous, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems.

### Involuntary painful muscle contractions in satoyoshi syndrome: a surface electromyographic study [^114gHQib]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

We report a child with Satoyoshi syndrome manifested by involuntary painful muscle contractions and alopecia. Although an autoimmune origin of Satoyoshi syndrome seems likely, its exact etiology remains as yet unknown, as is the origin of the involuntary contractions. To gain a better understanding of the electrophysiological characteristics of the involuntary contractions, we performed a surface electromyographic (EMG) study. We investigated muscle contractions in the legs using two noninvasive techniques: high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) recordings on one muscle, and polymyographic surface EMG (sEMG) recordings on various muscles. During the involuntary contractions, HD-sEMG showed a fourfold increase in amplitude compared to maximal voluntary contractions. These high potentials were widely distributed across the whole muscle and showed a pronounced oscillatory behavior with a frequency around 45 Hz. Polymyographic sEMG revealed that the involuntary contractions often occur simultaneously in various muscles or showed a switch of activity from one muscle to another. These findings point to hyperactivity or a disinhibition at the alpha motor neuron level, originating probably at that level, although a central origin cannot be excluded.

### Optimal diagnostic and treatment practices for facial dysostosis syndromes: a clinical consensus statement among European experts [^11246AAs]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, it is crucial to note the specific challenge posed by Miller syndrome within our study. Unlike Treacher Collins and Nager syndromes, literature on Miller syndrome primarily comprises case reports and small case series, accounting for ∼40 cases in total. This scarcity of evidence not only highlights the need for a cautious interpretation of some of our recommendations for Miller syndrome, but also underscored a broader issue encountered in the field. Given that many advances in genetics are recent, such as the discovery of the causative DHODH gene for Miller syndrome around 2010, misdiagnoses may be common in studies lacking genetic confirmations for FDS patients. The scarcity of evidence and likelihood of misdiagnoses both emphasize the necessity for further research on these syndromes with special attention to diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, given the overlap in phenotypical characteristics and treatments, our recommendations are still considered valuable for patients with Miller syndrome.

A final point of discussion included the strict consensus criteria that allowed for only one outlier response, making it challenging to reach a consensus on statements with numerous responses. However, the strict criteria enhance the credibility and reliability of the resulting statements, providing clinicians with trustworthy recommendations for the management of FDS. Hence, these strict criteria were rather considered a strength. Simultaneously, this resulted in a lack of consensus on some topics.

Orbitozygomatic Reconstruction

One of the challenges encountered in our study was the lack of sufficient evidence to agree on the value of specific approaches for orbitozygomatic reconstruction. The field appears divided on this topic, with varying opinions and surgical approaches among experts. While some experts advocate for techniques employing (full thickness) bone grafts, others remain skeptical about their predictability and efficacy. Future research efforts should prioritize investigating these different approaches, seeking to provide clinicians with clearer recommendations on the most effective and stable ones.

### Clinical and molecular consequences of disease-associated de novo mutations in SATB2 [^117LTqMf]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

It is likely that the number of individuals with SATB2 -associated disorder will increase dramatically over the next few years with the wider use of diagnostic sequencing. In addition to the obvious benefits to our understanding of the clinical consequences of SATB2 loss of function, the variants themselves should provide useful information that will aid in understanding the basic biology of SATB2 function.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^111XJV7p]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on these 2 large short-term and long-term studies, IVIg is effective in SPS and remains a key immunomodulatory therapy with proven benefit requiring, however, a judicious use for chronic maintenance to avoid overuse and conditioning effects. Accordingly, we advise to (1) stop IVIg if after the first 3 monthly infusions, there is no objective benefit; (2) continue with 1–2 g/kg monthly infusions, if there is a clearly objective improvement and good tolerance after the first 3 months; (3) perform periodic dependency tests by either reducing the total monthly IVIg dose (from 2 to 1 g/kg) or prolonging infusion intervals (from 4 weeks to 5 or 6) to objectively assess for signs of regression in the frequency and severity of spasms, gait, and stiffness (preferably documented in a daily diary) to determine the need to continue at the most beneficial dose; and (4) if no objective worsening is documented during the dependency trials, may stop IVIg for a few months to assess worsening before its continuation is justified.

Combination therapies

Except for inebilizumab, other monoclonal antibody therapies (eculizumab, ravulizumab, satralizumab, rituximab) for NMOSD have been evaluated in combination with immunosuppressive therapies, including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and oral glucocorticoids. Thus far, studies have not shown a clear benefit in using combination therapies (i.e. antibody therapy combined with immunosuppressive therapies) over monotherapy with monoclonal antibodies for NMOSD. For patients suffering exclusively from NMOSD, monotherapy with monoclonal antibodies may be favored as the first-line treatment, as there is a risk of additional adverse events with combination therapy. However, immunosuppressive therapy may be offered as add-on therapy to patients refractory after treatment with > 2 monoclonal antibodies in succession — or in countries where alternative monoclonal antibodies are not available. Immunosuppressive drugs may also be added if necessary to treat comorbidities, such as SLE and Sjögren's syndrome. In countries where monoclonal antibodies are not available at all, a combination of azathioprine/mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids may be used. Inebilizumab has not been tested in combination with other immunosuppressants and is approved by the European Medicines Agency only as a monotherapy. If it is combined with another immunosuppressive therapy, the potential for increased immunosuppressive effects and side effects should be considered.

On the other hand, in patients with breakthrough disease during a course of classical immunosuppressive drugs, it is recommended to switch to antibody therapy immediately and continue immunosuppressive treatment at least temporarily or to bridge with oral glucocorticoids, to minimize the risk of a (severe) attack during the transition. Nevertheless, due to a lack of data, it remains a matter of debate when and how to stop background immunosuppressive therapies in patients who stabilize after starting antibody therapy. Data from the OLE of eculizumab showed that 37% of patients were able to stop or decrease their immunosuppressive therapies and remain stable, while data from the OLE of the SAkuraSky trial evaluating satralizumab in combination with immunosuppressive therapies showed that 16 out of 36 patients were able to taper their glucocorticoid dose, 3 stopped it entirely and remained attack-free, while 2 experienced three attacks during tapering. Interactions between the various treatment modalities need to be considered. As mentioned above, for example co-treatment with IVIG can diminish the efficacy of eculizumab.

### Muscle cramps and contractures: causes and treatment [^113vmQiY]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Muscle cramps are painful, sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that are generally self-limiting. They are often part of the spectrum of normal human physiology and can be associated with a wide range of acquired and inherited causes. Cramps are only infrequently due to progressive systemic or neuromuscular diseases. Contractures can mimic cramps and are defined as shortenings of the muscle resulting in an inability of the muscle to relax normally, and are generally myogenic. General practitioners and neurologists frequently encounter patients with muscle cramps but more rarely those with contractures. The main questions for clinicians are: (1) Is this a muscle cramp, a contracture or a mimic? (2) Are the cramps exercise induced, idiopathic or symptomatic? (3) What is/are the presumed cause(s) of symptomatic muscle cramps or contractures? (4) What should be the diagnostic approach? and (5) How should we advise and treat patients with muscle cramps or contractures? We consider these questions and present a practical approach to muscle cramps and contractures, including their causes, pathophysiology and treatment options.

### Treatment of boerhaave syndrome: experience from a tertiary center [^11393P5j]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

This study underscores the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in managing Boerhaave syndrome. Based on our findings, we developed a treatment algorithm to guide clinical practice, recommending the prioritization of source control (defect closure) combined with surgical drainage, regardless of whether the diagnosis is early or late. Minimally invasive techniques should be employed whenever possible. Future multicenter studies are required to standardize treatment protocols, minimize bias, and provide robust data that can further guide clinical decision-making in the management of Boerhaave syndrome.

Tracheostomy and Decannulation

Some patients may require a tracheostomy to facilitate breathing. However, the average duration of tracheostomy requirement in tracheostomized patients remains undetermined at this point because of differences in underlying pathology (212). According to the experts, patients and/or parent(s) should, therefore, be informed that decannulation is not always possible (210). If decannulation is considered, patients and/or parent(s) should be informed that this is not always successful, and reinsertion may be necessary.

The experts concurred that decannulation of FDS patients can be considered if the cannula can be capped during the day and in case a sleep study in the hospital with a capped cannula and airway endoscopy do not reveal significant obstructions and only if the patient is discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting (108a). During this meeting, it is necessary to at least discuss the safety of swallowing, outcomes of the sleep study and endoscopy (including the significance of remaining obstructions), ease of intubation, and the patient's and parents' preference concerning decannulation (108b).

Autoimmunity targeting voltage-gated potassium channel complexes have not been systematically documented in children. Identified in the Neuroimmunology Laboratory records of Mayo Clinic were 12 seropositive children, 7 among 252 Mayo Clinic pediatric patients tested on a service basis for serologic evidence of neurologic autoimmunity (June 2008-April 2010), 4 during the assay's preimplementation validation (before June 2008) and 1 non-Mayo patient with available clinical information. Neurologic manifestations were subacute and multifocal. Three had global developmental regression, 6 movement disorders, 4 dysarthria, 3 seizures, 1 Satoyoshi syndrome, 1 painful red feet, 2 insomnia, 2 gastrointestinal dysmotility, and 2 small fiber neuropathy. Neoplasia was found in 1 child. Treating physicians recorded improvement in all 7 children who received immunotherapy. Neurologic symptom relapse occurred in 3 of 6 children after ceasing immunotherapy. These findings highlight a diverse clinical spectrum of neuronal potassium channel complex autoimmunity in children, and they illustrate benefit from early initiated immunotherapy, with a tendency to relapse when therapy ceases. Diagnosis is generally delayed in the process of eliminating neurodegenerative causes. Currently 2.7% of pediatric sera evaluated for neurologic autoimmunity are positive for neuronal potassium channel complex-reactive immunoglobulin G. The frequency and full spectrum of neurologic accompaniments remains to be determined.

### New perspectives on the treatment of skeletal dysplasia [^113tuBPS]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The development of genomic technology leads to a dramatic improvement of the pathophysiological understanding of rare genetic conditions, including skeletal disorders. This permits the definition of new therapeutic targets such as a cell type, a cell deficiency or a signaling pathway and, thus, aids the development of new therapeutic strategies with real benefit for patients. Moreover, skeletal dysplasia represents a good model for clinical trials repurposing drugs already in clinical use. These advances provide real hope for significant positive life changes for patients and their families. Because these very rare conditions have a limited number of patients, the optimal therapy, timing, and dosage is still to be documented for most of these treatments. In addition, natural history studies are essential before all clinical trials to evaluate the benefits of each treatment. The next few years represent an exciting time in genetic disease healthcare, with the potential for a real transformation of prognosis and management through these new treatments.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1128D1oo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment goals for Cushing's syndrome — recommendations: In patients with overt CS, we recommend normalizing cortisol levels or action at its receptors to eliminate the signs and symptoms of CS and treating comorbidities associated with hypercortisolism. We recommend against treatment to reduce cortisol levels or action if there is not an established diagnosis of CS. We suggest against treatments designed to normalize cortisol or its action when there is only borderline biochemical abnormality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis without any specific signs of CS, and the benefit of treating to normalize cortisol is not established in this setting.

Susac's syndrome (SS) is an immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. SS responds well to immunosuppressive therapies when treatment is prompt, aggressive, and sustained. Striking similarities exist between SS and dermatomyositis (DM), regarding immunopathogenesis, natural history, and treatment needs. We apply lessons learned from study of DM to SS, and offer our current treatment protocol for SS. Since these treatment guidelines are based mainly on anecdotal evidence, they represent only preliminary recommendations.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / ASSH clinical practice guideline summary management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^114Z2ZvB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Therapeutic ultrasound for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is summarized as follows: evidence suggests therapeutic ultrasound does not provide long-term improvement of carpal tunnel syndrome, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Option: Limited (Downgraded). The option is based on evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention and was downgraded based on the EtD framework. Rationale notes limited standardization and inconsistency and heterogeneity of both treatments and outcomes; the only long-term follow up study showed no significant difference between therapeutic ultrasound and sham ultrasound therapy, and across comparative studies ultrasound was not clearly superior. Regarding benefits and harms, therapeutic ultrasound does not show any significant difference from placebo and, although it does not have direct biological adverse reactions, it adds to the time and cost of treatment without established benefit to patients. For resources and uptake, given the lack of effectiveness it is not cost effective to use it as a therapy for CTS, the guidance is anticipated to be accepted by surgeons, patients, and therapists, and it is readily available and feasible to not use this modality. Future work calls for more long-term follow up studies to confirm the lack of effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of CTS.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^116pm9mJ]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Suggestions for future research in tic treatment for Tourette syndrome (TS) include behavioral and pharmacologic priorities. Future research on behavioral interventions for tics should include comparisons of the relative efficacy of CBIT vs pharmacotherapy, and additional research should be conducted on treatment sequencing and decision-making and of how particular sequences of treatments are most effective. Further research should continue to test the efficacy of other behavioral treatments, including exposure and response prevention, mindfulness-based treatments, or more global tic-related interventions. The evidence is insufficient at present to conclude that CBIT delivered by teleconference is as effective as face-to-face treatment, but well-designed studies with adequate sample sizes are needed to establish noninferiority. Future research on medications for tics should include noninferiority trials of agents commonly used for the treatment of tics for which limited evidence from randomized controlled trials is available; agents for which evidence is promising but limited include the first-generation antipsychotic fluphenazine, and trials are currently underway with the selective D1 antagonist ecopipam and evidence on the efficacy of this drug is expected soon. The dopamine depletors, tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine, act by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2).

### Diagnostic criteria for susac syndrome [^115roEf6]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome is characterised by the triad of encephalopathy with or without focal neurological signs, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss. Establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed because the triad is complete only in a minority of patients at disease onset. This leads to a critical delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment. Our objective was to establish criteria for diagnosis of either definite or probable Susac syndrome.

Method

The establishment of diagnostic criteria was based on the following three steps: (1) Definition of a reference group of 32 patients with an unambiguous diagnosis of Susac syndrome as assessed by all interdisciplinary experts of the European Susac Consortium (EuSaC) team (EuSaC cohort); (2) selection of diagnostic criteria, based on common clinical and paraclinical findings in the EuSaC cohort and on a review of the literature; and (3) validation of the proposed criteria in the previously published cohort of all Susac cases reported until 2012.

Results

Integrating the clinical presentation and paraclinical findings, we propose formal criteria and recommend a diagnostic workup to facilitate the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. More than 90% of the cases in the literature fulfilled the proposed criteria for probable or definite Susac syndrome. We surmise that more patients could have been diagnosed with the recommended diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

We propose diagnostic criteria for Susac syndrome that may help both experts and physicians not familiar with Susac syndrome to make a correct diagnosis and to prevent delayed treatment initiation.

### What is the best first-line treatment for POEMS syndrome: autologous transplantation, melphalan and dexamethasone, or lenalidomide and dexamethasone? [^11533Lmf]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There are currently no standard treatments for patients with POEMS syndrome. ASCT, LDex, and MDex are all effective, but the question "what is the best treatment for POEMS syndrome?" has not been answered. The rarity of POEMS syndrome makes it difficult to conduct randomized double-blind-controlled trials. Consequently, most have been retrospective analyses of single regimens or single-arm prospective studies. This retrospective analysis of 347 patients compared the three most common treatment options in POEMS syndrome, each with a different therapeutic basis. In this patient series, ASCT had the highest response and PFS rates of the three regimens, especially for patients at medium-to-high risk. One explanation is that ASCT eradicates the underlying plasma cell clones more completely than LDex or MDex. However, there were fewer high-risk patients and more patients with mild clinical manifestations in the ASCT group than in the MDex and LDex groups, which included patients with severe organ dysfunction. OS was not significantly better in ASCT patients than in the other groups, possibly because of treatment-related mortality (1.2%), and long-term complications, such as secondary malignancy (0.6%). On the other hand, OS can be improved with second-line treatments for patients with suboptimal responses. Good responses have been achieved with a wide range of treatment choices for refractory POEMS syndrome patients, which partly compensates for deficits in maintaining long-term PFS with first-line treatment. Salvage treatment with lenalidomide or bortezomib-based regimens have both shown promising response rates. Novel regimens including daratumumab may further broaden the treatment options for multidrug-resistant patients.

### European consensus-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Kawasaki disease-the SHARE initiative [^1174WCuj]. Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kawasaki disease, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using the following regimens for corticosteroid treatment:

- IV methylprednisolone 0.8 mg/kg BID for 5–7 days or until CRP normalizes, followed by oral prednisone/prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day, then weaned off over next 2–3 weeks

- IV methylprednisolone 10–30 mg/kg (up to maximum of 1 g/day) once daily for 3 days, followed by oral prednisone/prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day until day 7 or until CRP normalizes, then weaned off over next 2–3 weeks.

### Neurological complications of Sturge-Weber syndrome: current status and unmet needs [^114AJoVV]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to identify the current status and major unmet needs in the management of neurological complications in Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Methods

An expert panel consisting of neurologists convened during the Sturge-Weber Foundation Clinical Care Network conference in September 2018. Literature regarding current treatment strategies for neurological complications was reviewed.

Results

Although strong evidence-based standards are lacking, the implementation of consensus-based standards of care and outcome measures to be shared across all Sturge-Weber Foundation Clinical Care Network Centers are needed. Each patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome should have an individualized seizure action plan. There is a need to determine the appropriate abortive and preventive treatment of migraine headaches in Sturge-Weber syndrome. Likewise, a better understanding and better diagnostic modalities and treatments are needed for stroke-like episodes. As behavioral problems are common, the appropriate screening tools for mental illnesses and the timing for screening should be established. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preferably done after age one year is the primary imaging modality of choice to establish the diagnosis, although advances in MRI techniques can improve presymptomatic diagnosis to identify patients eligible for preventive drug trials.

Conclusion

We identified the unmet needs in the management of neurological complications in Sturge-Weber syndrome. We define a minimum standard brain MRI protocol to be used by Sturge-Weber syndrome centers. Future multicenter clinical trials on specific treatments of Sturge-Weber syndrome-associated neurological complications are needed. An improved national clinical database is critically needed to understand its natural course, and for retrospective and prospective measures of treatment efficacy.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^114ygpWT]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Management of HyperPP

Acute Management

Acute management may include mild exercise at attack onset and a carbohydrate snack. Beta agonists can be an effective acute potassium‐lowering therapy for HyperPP. 1 In case reports, salbutamol 1–2 puffs (0.1 mg) and other beta‐agonists have shown benefits. 62, 63, 64 While severe hyperkalemia during attacks is typically not seen, the treatment for acute hyperkalemia which is severe or life‐threatening should match institutions' established protocols.

Prevention

In individuals with HyperPP, consider recommending consumption of multiple small carbohydrate snacks and avoid potassium‐rich foods. 10

Dichlorphenamide can be effective for chronic treatment and is approved for HyperPP. 22, 53 In randomized, placebo‐controlled studies, dichlorphenamide reduced attack frequency and severity among patients. 22, 53 The initial dose is 50 mg twice daily, which may be increased or decreased at weekly intervals based on individual response or the occurrence of adverse events. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg daily. 22, 53 Acetazolamide 125–1000 mg/day may be effective for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 15, 23

Thiazide diuretics are an option for chronic treatment of HyperPP. 1, 42 The drug of choice is hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg to 75 mg daily. 41, 54 Potassium‐sparing diuretics should be avoided.

There are no rigorously controlled data on the treatment of PMC, normokalemic PP, and other atypical PPs, but in general, the same treatment strategies used for HyperPP are appropriate.

Management of Andersen‐Tawil Syndrome

Management of individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome requires the coordinated input of a neurologist familiar with the treatment of periodic paralysis and a cardiologist familiar with the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment for acute attacks of weakness or for chronic suppression of attacks of weakness in individuals with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome depends on whether the attack is associated with high or low levels of potassium, and treatment needs to be individualized for each patient (see sections above for HypoPP and HyperPP for specific recommendations). 10 Evaluations recommended to establish the extent of disease and needs in a patient diagnosed with Andersen‐Tawil syndrome are summarized in Table 6. 65 For asymptomatic patients with a KCNJ2 mutation, annual screening should include a 12‐lead ECG and 24‐h Holter monitoring.

### Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: current treatments, novel therapeutics, and future directions [^115wjf9q]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe drug-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with slow spike and wave on EEG (DEE-SSW) composing about 1–2% of epilepsy patients. Seizures in DEE-SSW are caused by a variety of etiologies, and there is a large unmet treatment need as seizures are usually treatment-resistant and individuals are often unable to function independently. The updated definition by the International League Against Epilepsy has established formal diagnostic criteria allowing for more uniform diagnosis. This article provides a review of typical medication management and treatment strategies, including new and developing surgical approaches. Future directions in treatment include expanding genetic testing with the potential for gene therapy and continuously improving surgical options with the goal to prevent progression to DEE-SSW.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^113oDYYG]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

In practice, IVIg is given in a monthly dose of 2 g/kg (based on the ideal-body weight), divided in 2–3 consecutive days taking into account the patient's age, other comorbidities, and tolerance; if poor tolerance or allergic reaction is noticed to one brand of IVIg, it is prudent to try another company's product. If there is benefit after each monthly IVIg infusion, IVIG is continued for 3–6 more consecutive months at the same dose. From there on, there is a need to assess maintenance schedule by either prolonging the monthly infusion intervals to every 5 or 6 weeks or reducing the minimum required dose from 2 to 1 g/kg by performing dependency trials, as explained below, to avoid overuse, considering the commonly seen conditioning effects with chronic IVIg therapy. Most of the patients may continue to require 2 g/kg but at somewhat longer monthly intervals.

Subcutaneous immunoglobulin may also be an option for maintenance therapy in those patients with poor venous access or systemic comorbidities such as history of thromboembolic events. Because subcutaneous immunoglobulin given weekly provides a steady-state serum IgG level, it is especially useful for those patients with an early wearing-off effect to ensure sustained benefit.

### Therapies in stiff-person syndrome: advances and future prospects based on disease pathophysiology [^113Uz7V7]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rituximab

If the benefit of IVIg is not sufficient after 3 months or it is poorly tolerated, one may consider to proceed to rituximab which anecdotally had been promising. In the largest placebo-controlled trial we performed in 24 patients with SPS, using the same scales as we used in the effective IVIg controlled study, no statistically significant benefit of rituximab compared to placebo was demonstated because of a strong placebo effect. In spite of lack of statistically significant data, however, 7 patients (58%) objectively improved in all clinical parameters, while 4 of them (33%) who had severe disease exhibited dramatic improvements from using 2 canes to being able to walk unassisted or even go skiing, as shown for one of these patients (Figure 4, C and D). We retrospectively identified that one reason contributing to the statistically negative data and placebo effects might have been the inclusion of some patients with not clinically severe disease because in such patients, the scales are not sensitive enough to capture small changes. The argument that this was a small series and a 6-month study period was not sufficient to capture benefitis not correct because this was the largest controlled study, and like most trials with rituximab in other neurologic diseases, the benefit is always seen after the first 6 months but needs subsequent infusions for maintenance. On this basis, rituximab is a very liable option for a subset of patients with significant symptoms (benefiting close to half of them in the large controlled study), who do not sufficiently respond to IVIg and the GABA-enhancing drugs.

The Need to Therapeutically Target the Impaired Reciprocal GABAergic Inhibition

Reciprocal inhibition is a fundamental process of our normal physiology ensuring, when one muscle (i.e. the biceps) contracts, the automatic relaxation of its antagonist muscle (i.e. the triceps). This process occurs because when the alpha motor neurons send messages to the agonist muscles to contract, the gamma neurons of its antagonist's muscle do not discharge, being silenced by the inhibitory GABA interneurons (Figure 1, A and B), as described more than 20 years ago with detailed electrophysiologic studies, and has been recently elaborated diagrammatically. In SPS, these inhibitory GABAergic signals are inhibited allowing the gamma motor neurons to fire uncontrollably resulting in the motor unit firing at rest concurrently by the agonists and antagonists, in spite of muscle relaxation, because of failing to silence the antagonist muscle when its agonist contracts (Figure 1C). Such a continuous motor unit activity is clinically expressed as muscle stiffness and painful muscle spasms due to concurrent contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, as seen in typical patients (Figure 2).

Figure 1
Reciprocal Inhibition and Its Electrophysiology

(A) When the brain sends a message to the alpha motor neurons of the agonist to contract (1), its antagonist (2) automatically relaxes because the inhibitory GABAergic gamma interneurons of the antagonist muscle do not discharge, preventing the opposing alpha motor neurons from firing. Originally published in Dalakas M. Stiff-person Syndrome and GAD Antibody-spectrum Disorders: GABAergic Neuronal Excitability, Immunopathogenesis and Update on Antibody Therapies. Neurotherapeutics 2022;19:832. (B) Electrophysiologically, the normal muscle at rest does not fire and no motor unit action potentials (MUPs) are recorded from the agonist (a) and its antagonist (b). During voluntary muscle contraction of the agonist (c), no MUPs are recorded from the antagonist (d) because this muscle is silenced by its inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. (C) Impaired reciprocal GABAergic inhibition in SPS. In SPS, the a-motor neurons fire continuously, even at rest and in spite of relaxation efforts, with MUP electrophysiologically recorded in both the agonist and its antagonist (a, b). When the agonist muscle contracts (c), its antagonist is not silenced or relaxed but contracted with firing MUP (d) leading to simultaneous contraction of the agonist and its antagonist. GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid; SPS = stiff-person syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome in children: an international perspective [^111YRHLT]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

There remains uncertainty as to the optimal management of children presenting with OMAS with or without neuroblastoma, and where data from well-controlled studies are lacking, the consensus of expert opinion has allowed several key points to be established:
Early diagnosis is important
Clinical severity scales are important to help evaluate and monitor OMAS (Tables 4 and 7)
Investigations are important, but biomarkers still do not have an established role in management (Tables 1 and 2)
Initiation of treatment to establish disease remission and prevent relapses is crucial (Tables 3, 5 and 6; Figure 1)
Children with OMAS must have long-term follow-up (Table 7)

Recommendations have been made to support clinicians in the investigation, treatment, and long-term support of children and families with OMAS. No one optimal treatment strategy has been established, but whether an upfront or escalating approach is taken, adherence to the key principles of rapidly establishing remission and preventing relapses is key, with informed decisions around the risk and benefit of more aggressive initial immune suppression. International collaboration will remain crucial in answering the ongoing uncertainty around this rare disease.

### Spinal muscular atrophy-insights and challenges in the treatment era [^1174NQzc]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by deletion or mutation of SMN1. Four subtypes exist, characterized by different clinical severities. New therapeutic approaches have become available in the past few years, dramatically changing the natural history of all SMA subtypes, including substantial clinical improvement with the severe and advanced SMA type 1 variant. Trials have now demonstrated that phenotypic rescue is even more dramatic when pre-symptomatic patients are treated, and emerging real-world data are demonstrating the benefits of intervention even in the chronic phase of the condition. Here, we critically review how the field is rapidly evolving in response to the new therapies and questions that the new treatments have posed, including the effects of treatment at different ages and stages of disease, new phenotypes and long-term outcomes in patients who would not have survived without treatment, and decisions of who to treat and when. We also discuss how the outcomes associated with different timing of therapeutic intervention are contributing to our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of SMA.

### Long-term weekly ACTH therapy for relapsed west syndrome [^112aDPxk]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) therapy is an established treatment for West syndrome. However, some patients may relapse after this therapy, for whom there is no established treatment. We describe 3 patients with symptomatic West syndrome and multiple, poor prognostic factors who relapsed after initial ACTH therapy. They were treated with a second round of ACTH therapy, i.e., daily intramuscular injection for 2–3 weeks and subsequent withdrawal, alternative days for 1 or 2 weeks, every 3 days for 1 or 2 weeks, followed by weekly or biweekly for ≥ 1 year. Clinical seizures and hypsarrhythmia resolved in all 3 patients within 4 weeks, and these clinical improvements continued through a second round of ACTH therapy. Two patients developed other types of seizures and aggravation of paroxysms on electroencephalography, but no hypsarrhythmia, soon after termination of ACTH therapy. In the other patient, although electroencephalographic findings remained normal during weekly ACTH therapy, focal sharp waves with irregular slow waves appeared after the injection interval became biweekly. After a second round of ACTH therapy, all patients exhibited developmental progress, particularly in gross motor development and visual functions. No serious adverse events occurred during treatment. Long-term weekly ACTH therapy is a potentially effective treatment option for relapsed West syndrome.

### Long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for chronic pain: a systematic review [^1174uayU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of muscle relaxant medications for the treatment of chronic pain?

Findings

In this systematic review of 44 studies including 2482 participants, 9 unique muscle relaxant medications were assessed. Muscle relaxants may be more beneficial than placebo for treating trigeminal neuralgia, painful cramps, and neck pain, but for fibromyalgia, low back pain, and other syndromes, they did not appear to be beneficial.

Meaning

These findings suggest that long-term use of muscle relaxants may only be beneficial for certain syndromes; clinicians should consider deprescribing if pain-related goals are not met.

### Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Controversies in the diagnosis and management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113EkxN3]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common disorder responsible for considerable patient suffering and cost to health services. Despite extensive research, controversies still exist with regards to best practice in diagnosis, treatment, and service provision. Current best practise would support the use of history, examination and electro-diagnostic studies. The role for ultrasound scanning in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is yet to be proven. It appears magnetic resonance image scanning has a role where a rare cause for carpal tunnel syndrome may be suspected and also in the detailed reconstruction of the anatomy to aid endoscopic procedures. Treatment options can be surgical or non-surgical and patient choice will dictate the decision. For non-surgical interventions many options have been trialled but until now only steroid use, acupuncture, and splinting have shown discernable benefits. Open surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel appears to be more simple and cost-effective than minimally invasive interventions. For those patients who reject surgery, splinting, acupuncture, and steroid injection can play a role. Recent work looking at different service delivery options has shown some positive results in terms of decreasing patient waiting time for definitive treatment. However, no formal cost-effectiveness analysis has been published and concerns exist about the impact of a stream-lined service on surgical training. In this review, we look at the different diagnostic and treatment options for managing carpal tunnel syndrome. We then consider the different service delivery options and finally the cost-effectiveness evidence.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^116ejcZD]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS) — no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IVIG were identified; in a retrospective series of 92 patients, there was no significant difference in 1-year outcomes among IVIG (n = 28), PLEX (n = 23), or supportive care (n = 41), though median recovery for ophthalmoplegia (p = .04) and ataxia (p = .027) was slightly faster with IVIG. A 2007 Cochrane review found no studies to conclude on MFS treatment, and the guideline states there is insufficient evidence to recommend IVIG, although it may be considered in cases with severe ataxia, bulbar palsy, or GBS overlap with respiratory or limb involvement.

### Consensus statement: the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of neuromuscular conditions report of the AANEM ad hoc committee [^116vT4tw]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) — efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): There is one Class I study evaluating the use of IVIG in SPS; in a double-blinded crossover trial, patients were randomized to IVIG 2 g/kg over 2 consecutive days or placebo for 3 mo, and those receiving IVIG had improvement in reduced stiffness (p = .01) and sensitivity to spasms (p = .03) compared to placebo, with 11 of 16 patients improving in gait and activities of daily living. A retrospective study of maintenance IVIG reported long-term effectiveness in 36 patients with SPS over a 40 mo period, with Twenty-four of 36 (67%) patients showing a beneficial response; based on one Class I study, IVIG is effective in treating SPS.

### Trends in steroid therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Japan [^112BFG97]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Prednisolone has been approved for pharmaceutical use in DMD patients since 2013, and domestic guidelines for DMD were published in 2014. 13 These innovations should raise the awareness of steroid therapy among clinicians, patients, and their families nationwide. This study analyzed prescribing behaviors before publication of the domestic guideline, and the surveys should be repeated to monitor trends in steroid therapy and to consider adherence to the guidelines, as noted by Fox et al. 25

Prospective studies comparing the effect and safety of frequent and recommended regimens have recently been conducted in western countries. Escolar et al. 6 reported a randomized blinded clinical trial comparing high‐dose weekend prednisone (10 mg/kg/week) with the recommendation (prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day) and concluded that the high‐dose weekend regimen was as effective and safe as the daily regimen. Ricotti et al. 28 performed a 4‐year prospective longitudinal observational study comparing prednisolone 10 days on, 10 days off with prednisolone daily. They found no significant difference in the median age at loss of ambulation, though there were differences in the severity of side effects. A 5‐year international, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, controlled clinical trial has been started (FOR‐DMD) to evaluate efficacy and safety among the 3 most frequent regimens in western countries: prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day daily, deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day daily, and prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day for 10 days on, 10 days off.

The effects of prednisolone every other day regimens have been reported in 2 Japanese studies. Sato et al. 29 evaluated the effects of prednisolone on intellectual ability and motor function in 20 patients using prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg every other day (0.12–0.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 years in comparison with 9 controls. Intelligence quotient scores improved, and motor function was preserved in the treated group. Ishigaki et al. 30 compared longitudinal clinical data between 7 steroid treated (prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg, every other day) and 10 nontreated patients over age 15 years. Ages at loss of ambulation and initiation of noninvasive ventilation did not differ. There was an earlier onset of cardiomyopathy in 2 treated patients than in the nontreated, and the ratio of cardiomyopathy development differed significantly (29% vs. 90%; P = 0.018). We need to assess efficacy and safety between daily and every other day regimens, as evidence for this is limited worldwide 8.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115Lvq8c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Periodic limb movement disorder in adults — evidence gaps and conditional recommendations. PLMD is a controversial diagnosis in adults; higher-quality treatment studies were limited to the 1990s to early 2000s, leading to conditional recommendations against triazolam and valproic acid. The literature is devoid of treatment studies for PLMD within the past 2 decades, the value of independent treatment of periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) in the context of restless legs syndrome is of unclear significance, and PLMS associations with age and diverse medical and neurological conditions leave the indication for treatment uncertain.

### Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome [^113SciwN]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

In September 2008, the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons approved a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. This guideline was subsequently endorsed by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The guideline makes nine specific recommendations: A course of nonsurgical treatment is an option in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Early surgery is an option with clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or when the patient so elects. Another nonsurgical treatment or surgery is suggested when the current treatment fails to resolve symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Sufficient evidence is not available to provide specific treatment recommendations for carpal tunnel syndrome associated with such conditions as diabetes mellitus and coexistent cervical radiculopathy. Local steroid injection or splinting is suggested before considering surgery. Oral steroids or ultrasound are options. Carpal tunnel release is recommended as treatment. Heat therapy is not among the options to be used. Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome by complete division of the flexor retinaculum is recommended. Routine use of skin nerve preservation and epineurotomy is not suggested when carpal tunnel release is performed. Prescribing preoperative antibiotics for carpal tunnel surgery is an option. It is suggested that the wrist not be immobilized postoperatively after routine carpal tunnel surgery. It is suggested that instruments such as the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire be used to assess patient responses to carpal tunnel syndrome treatment for research.

### Management guidelines for mucopolysaccharidosis VI [^1136LqN9]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disease that is characterized by systemic clinical manifestations and significant functional impairment. Diagnosis and management are often challenging because of the considerable variability in symptom presentation and rate of progression. The optimal standard of care should be based on evidence from randomized, controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. In support of this goal, comprehensive management guidelines have been drafted by an international group of experts in the management of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis VI. The guidelines provide a detailed outline of disease manifestations by body system, recommendations for regular assessments, and an overview of current treatment options.

Muscle cramps — evidence-based treatment conclusions and recommendation: On the basis of single Class II studies, Naftidrofuryl, vitamin E, and diltiazem are possibly effective in the treatment of muscle cramps, whereas data regarding magnesium preparations (2 Class II studies) and gabapentin (1 study in ALS) show that these agents are probably not effective in the treatment of muscle cramps. Recommendation: Naftidrofuryl, diltiazem, and vitamin B complex may be considered for the treatment of muscle cramps (Level C).

### Expanding clinical profiles and prognostic markers in stiff person syndrome spectrum disorders [^116R9GSp]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study also showed that earlier initiation of immunotherapy is associated with either stabilization or improvement in the clinical course of SPSD. Other studies have shown immunotherapy in general are associated with better outcomes. For example, positive responses to immunotherapy were shown in a recent survey study from Japan which reviewed 29 individuals with anti-GAD65 SPS and in a single center cohort study from Detroit which reviewed 23 individuals with SPS. However, currently, there is no consensus on the approach to the timing of immunotherapy. Although, growing literature (including the aforementioned studies) does support the use of immunotherapy in SPSD, particularly IVIg. This includes clinical trial data of IVIg benefit in SPS, retrospective cohort data of individuals with SPS treated with IVIg, and data from the US Veterans Affairs Health Administration records. There are less robust data on the use of other types of immunotherapies in SPSD. However, there are some case series and studies that provide supportive evidence for the use of corticosteroids, subcutaneous immunoglobulins (SCIg), plasmapheresis/plasma exchange, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and even possibly (though controversially) autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The treatment approach to individuals with SPSD is more varied in practice. Additionally, there is literature supporting that SPS — in the absence of immunotherapy — is a progressive disorder that leads to accumulating physical disability over time. Therefore, if the goal were to be the stabilization or prevention of such disease progression, the role of immunotherapies and the timing of initiation in achieving this goal should be better elucidated. Early initiation of immunotherapy after symptom onset versus later has the potential to prevent long-term disability as shown in the current study. However, further studies are needed in order to replicate these findings.

### Clinical features, epidemiology, and treatment of shwachman-diamond syndrome: a systematic review [^112MGKj7]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of SDS

Data concerning hematological abnormalities are shown in Table 2. In total. 151 cases (96.8%,151/156) had peripheral blood cytopenia; neutropenia (88.1%,133/151), other thrombocytopenia (85 cases, 56.3%,85/151) and anemia (51.0%,77/151) accounted for more than 50%. Neutropenia was the most common hematological abnormality among SDS patients. In the enrolled patients, we identified 51 cases (33.8%, 51/151) of cytopenia in three lineages, 48 cases (31.8%, 48/151) of cytopenia in two lineages, and 46 cases (30.5%, 46/151) of cytopenia in only one lineage.

### TAFRO syndrome with renal biopsy successfully treated with steroids and cyclosporine: a case report [^113aeQPU]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the ideal treatment strategy for patients with TAFRO syndrome has not been established. High-dose steroids, cyclosporine, tocilizumab, and rituximab are commonly used, but these therapies often result in treatment failure and relapse. Shimada et al. reported a case series of the treatment of three patients with TAFRO syndrome who underwent renal biopsy. All patients had TMA, as revealed by renal pathology findings; two patients were treated with steroids or cyclosporine, while the steroid-refractory patient was refractory to tocilizumab despite high serum IL-6 levels. Similar cases of patients resistant to tocilizumab therapy have been reported previously. While the use of tocilizumab in TAFRO syndrome with high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 seems appropriate, humoral factors other than IL-6 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of TAFRO syndrome, as some patients are refractory even to treatment with tocilizumab.

In our case, cyclosporine was added to the steroids because of the marked thrombocytopenia in addition to renal impairment. The platelet count normalized with the addition of cyclosporine. Allegra et al. reported the efficacy of cyclosporine for thrombocytopenia in TAFRO syndrome. Cyclosporine, which inhibits T-cell function by inhibiting IL-2, is one of the treatment options for patients with TAFRO syndrome who are resistant to tocilizumab. IL-2 as well as IL-6 may contribute to the inflammatory cytokines involved in TAFRO syndrome. When IL-2 is used in cancer treatment, it reportedly may induce symptoms similar to TAFRO syndrome, such as microangiopathy, renal dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. However, there are few reports on the treatment of TAFRO syndrome with steroids and cyclosporine, and therefore further accumulation of data is needed.

### Carpenter syndrome: a review for the craniofacial surgeon [^116YiEEu]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

As of now, there is no review of Carpenter syndrome (CS) for the craniofacial surgeon. This article seeks to unify salient recent studies to provide a resource for surgical planning and overview of this challenging syndrome.

Objectives

The phenotypic characteristics of CS are diverse, and the molecular underpinnings are equally complex. To date, the surgical management of this syndrome has not been fully elucidated, with only a number of selected case studies illustrating proper approach to treatment. This article summarizes treatment approaches from selected CS literature, analyzes craniofacial reconstruction techniques used in related syndromes, and discusses their possible role in CS.

Design

Articles from 1901 to 2013 were selected and reviewed by 5 researchers using the most recent literature of the genetics, pathophysiology, phenotype, and management of CS.

Results

Mutations in RAB23 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CS. The RAB23 is a small, 35.43-kb gene with 1 noncoding and 6 coding regions that encode a guanosine triphosphatase responsible for regulating intracellular vesicular trafficking. Given the scarcity of CS cases, an algorithm for CS management has not been established. However, early release of craniosynostoses with fronto-orbital advancement is clearly indicated in the CS literature, particularly in cases of elevated intracranial pressure. Management of other craniofacial malformations is less clear. Literature from other craniofacial syndromes, including Apert syndrome and craniofacial microsomia, was helpful in establishing a putative timeline for craniofacial intervention.

Conclusions

This study collates surgical management data from CS and other related syndromes as a means of establishing a cohesive approach to the surgical treatment of CS.

### Using immunoglobulins in muscular disease treatment [^112Y99xz]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been proven in the past two decades to be potent immunomodulators. This led to the licensing and recommendation of IVIg as first-line treatment for Kawasaki disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Objective

To review the evidence and indications for the use of IVIg in the treatment of muscular diseases.

Methods

Literature search in PubMed and of further literature cited in these articles.

Results/Conclusion

There are small randomised controlled trials that demonstrate the efficacy of IVIg in dermatomyositis, myasthenic crisis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and stiff-person syndrome. However, since there are also alternative treatments IVIgs are mostly used in these diseases as alternatives when other therapeutic approaches have failed.

### Congenital myasthenic syndromes: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^111KTRjg]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a diverse group of genetic disorders caused by abnormal signal transmission at the motor endplate, a special synaptic contact between motor axons and each skeletal muscle fibre. Most CMS stem from molecular defects in the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, but they can also be caused by mutations in presynaptic proteins, mutations in proteins associated with the synaptic basal lamina, defects in endplate development and maintenance, or defects in protein glycosylation. The specific diagnosis of some CMS can sometimes be reached by phenotypic clues pointing to the mutated gene. In the absence of such clues, exome sequencing is a useful technique for finding the disease gene. Greater understanding of the mechanisms of CMS have been obtained from structural and electrophysiological studies of the endplate, and from biochemical studies. Present therapies for the CMS include cholinergic agonists, long-lived open-channel blockers of the acetylcholine receptor ion channel, and adrenergic agonists. Although most CMS are treatable, caution should be exercised as some drugs that are beneficial in one syndrome can be detrimental in another.

### Treatment and monitoring of SAPHO syndrome: a systematic review [^112F55dv]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

A potential limitation of this review relates to inconsistent nomenclature across the literature, which may have led to the exclusion of studies. Because of the broad clinical spectrum and inconsistent nomenclature (including 'adult CNO/CRMO', 'PAO', 'sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCCH)', etc, which may be limited forms of SAPHO or related disorders), only manuscripts reporting cohorts of 'complete' SAPHO patients were considered. Notably, manuscripts reporting CNO/CRMO were not included because it is currently under debate whether CNO and SAPHO are distinct entities. Although the authors argue that CNO/CRMO and SAPHO may be considered 'extremes' on a spectrum of inflammatory bone diseases, and SAPHO may represent a 'late stage' presentation of CNO/CRMO, this systematic review focused on 'complete' SAPHO syndrome. Indeed, in a recent review, Leerling et al described adult CNO/CRMO as a subtype within a wider disease spectrum. Authors report that the presence of joint and skin pathology increases the likelihood for physicians to distinguish SAPHO from CNO. Because approximately 50% of physicians managing adult CNO/CRMO distinguish between CNO/CRMO and SAPHO, some SAPHO patients in the literature may have been missed in the systematic review presented here. Therapeutic approaches to CNO/CRMO are summarised and discussed elsewhere, and similarities exist in the treatment across the CNO/CRMO/SAPHO spectrum usually with NSAIDs considered first-line treatment options, and cDMARDs (eg, methotrexate or sulfasalazine), bisphosphonates and TNFi reserved for severe and/or treatment-refractory cases. Similarly, opinions vary whether SAPHO and PAO constitute the same disease. Proposed PAO criteria (Sonozaki et al) differ from commonly used SAPHO criteria (summarised in table 1) in that PAO can be limited to PPP and CNO. This supports the proposal of PAO being a subset within SAPHO, with patients with only PPP and arthralgia sometimes being treated as SAPHO. These clinical differences were a key argument for Yamamoto when suggesting to distinguish PAO and SAPHO. Notably, the term PAO has primarily been used in reports from Japan, potentially suggesting contrasting presentations of CNO/CRMO/SAPHO spectrum disorders between Western and East Asian cohorts. Notably, PAO patients (other than CNO/CRMO and SAPHO patients reported in Western cohorts) frequently experience concurrent focal infections, such as tonsillitis and/or arthro-osteitis, which results in surgical approaches to treatment, for example, tonsillectomy. Distinct treatments included potassium iodide, granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis. Despite this, treatment similarities are seen, with a multicentre study showing many receiving NSAIDs, cDMARDs and antimicrobials. This is reflected in other papers treating with cyclosporineand adalimumab. An IL-23 inhibitor, guselkumab, has also been reported. Similar arguments have been made around SCCH being a SAPHO subset and part of the CNO spectrum, and two cases have been reported with success in pain and functional improvement.

### Management of acute compartment syndrome [^1153qYNJ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline — acute compartment syndrome (ACS) management highlights that fasciotomy is "accepted as the treatment for ACS" and is "commonly done for prophylaxis (in cases of so-called 'impending' compartment syndrome), and perhaps even for medicolegal reasons". The text states "there is no diagnostic standard for ACS", with fasciotomy becoming "a surrogate for the diagnosis of ACS", creating "a significant bias" and reflecting "the strong bias that surgeons have for performing fasciotomy in order to avoid a 'missed case'". Research priorities are explicitly outlined: "Future research should be aimed at defining medical treatments that mitigate the pathophysiologic effects of sustained elevations in compartment pressure so that there are options other than surgical fasciotomy", including developing "diagnostic tests that are physiologically-based" to indicate whether "fasciotomy must be done urgently, or whether the patient can be followed with some form of medical management initiated", and establishing methods "to tell whether fasciotomy would be beneficial in the late-presenting compartment syndrome".

### POEMS syndrome: clinical update [^114yCsQQ]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

POEMS syndrome is a rare, but treatable cause of neuropathy. Further work is required to establish its exact underlying pathophysiology. Current treatment approaches afford good prognosis. Moving forward, randomised-controlled studies, though difficult given the rarity of POEMS syndrome, and the development of prognostic tools, will be important in establishing individualised approaches to patient care.

### Long-term effectiveness of IVIg maintenance therapy in 36 patients with GAD antibody-positive stiff-person syndrome [^113cd9XY]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fourth, long-term high-dose IVIg tolerance was very good with only 3 of the 24 responders discontinuing therapy prematurely due to IVIg-related side effects or other medical comorbidities. Two of the nonresponders also had IVIg-related side effects or medical comorbidities preventing continued use.

Despite some study limitations, mainly the lack of a control group due to obvious difficulties in giving placebo for long periods in a rare disease and the constraints of a retrospective chart review, this study has conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of IVIg as chronic maintenance therapy while highlighting the need for new or novel therapies for the chronic management of SPS. Promising immunotherapies should be, however, tested in a randomized controlled design, as done with the rituximab trial, but in a larger number of patients involving many centers, or as concluded from the results of the large but uncontrolled hematopoietic stem cell transplantation study that led to early termination. Although both of these studies failed to show efficacy, rituximab and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can still provide benefit in some patients with SPS over a long time period.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: an update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1133CcKW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Treatment

7.1 Pharmacological Treatment

7.1.1 Muscle Relaxants

Several muscle relaxants have been investigated for their effectiveness in treating MPS, including cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen, and thiocolchicoside. These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce muscle tone and disrupt reflexes that contribute to muscle contraction, thereby providing pain relief and improving functional mobility. While muscle relaxants are well‐studied in populations with general musculoskeletal pain, evidence specific to their use in MPS patients is limited.

7.1.1.1 Cyclobenzaprine

Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants and is used to relieve skeletal muscle spasms without impairing muscle function. One Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclobenzaprine for the treatment of MPS. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) on orofacial MPS included in this review reported that cyclobenzaprine significantly improved short‐term pain compared to clonazepam and placebo, but not sleep quality. Conversely, a more recent RCT on orofacial MPS found no significant differences between cyclobenzaprine and placebo for both pain and sleep quality. Cyclobenzaprine may provide potential benefits for short‐term MPS‐related pain; however, the evidence is insufficient compared to placebo and alternative therapies.

7.1.1.2 Tizanidine

Tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha‐2 adrenergic receptor agonist with both antispastic and antispasmodic properties. One RCT on orofacial MPS reported no significant differences in pain or sleep quality between tizanidine and placebo. In contrast, a cohort study involving females with MPS found that 5 weeks of tizanidine treatment improved pain intensity, disability, pain pressure threshold (PPT), and sleep quality. Another cohort study on patients with myofascial pain of the masticatory muscles reported only slight improvements in pain after 2 weeks of tizanidine treatment, with many painful sites persisting. While tizanidine may offer potential benefits for MPS‐related pain, disability, and sleep quality, the evidence remains insufficient to determine its effectiveness compared to placebo, as conclusions are drawn from only one RCT and mixed findings from observational studies.

### Two-stage surgical approach with dermofat graft and lipofilling for the treatment of established frey syndrome and facial depression deformity [^116j3QBr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Frey syndrome and facial contour deformity commonly occur after parotid surgery. Although the treatment of established Frey syndrome has focused on medical solutions, surgical solutions to established Frey syndrome have been less reported. Moreover, these methods may not resolve the facial depression. In the presented case here, we used 2-stage surgical approach with dermofat graft and lipofilling for the treatment of established Frey syndrome and facial depression deformity. We considered that this technique provides the easiest, most practical, satisfying, and effective solution for Frey syndrome that develops in the late follow-up period after superficial parotidectomy.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of Kawasaki disease [^114b69xm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary thrombus

Only Newburger 1986 reported the incidence of acute coronary syndromes. At 30 months, no adverse sequelae were reported in the 7 participants in the IVIG group followed up to this point. Two of 17 participants in the ASA group had a coronary artery thrombus. Matsushima 1985 provided additional information upon request and confirmed that no acute coronary events had occurred. No other studies reported this outcome. We assessed this evidence to be of low certainty.

Duration of fever (days)

Eight studies reported duration of fever (Furusho 1984; Matsushima 1985; Nagashima 1987; Newburger 1986; Ogawa 1987; Ogino 1987; Onouchi 1988; Yabiku 1989). Four studies reported duration from onset of disease (Furusho 1984; Ogawa 1987; Ogino 1987; Yabiku 1989). Three studies reported duration both from disease onset and onset of treatment (Matsushima 1985; Nagashima 1987; Onouchi 1988). Newburger 1986 reported the average fall in temperature and maximum temperature in hospitalised children.

We combined the data from studies reporting duration of fever from treatment onset. Overall, the duration of fever in the IVIG group was shorter than in the ASA group (mean difference (MD) −4.00 days, 95% CI −5.06 to −2.93; P < 0.001; 3 studies, 307 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). See Analysis 1.4.

We also combined the data from studies reporting duration from disease onset. Overall, the duration of fever in the IVIG group was shorter than in the ASA group (MD −1.60 days, 95% CI −2.69 to −0.52; P = 0.004; 7 studies, 693 participants). See Analysis 1.5.

Newburger 1986 also reported data from centres where participants were hospitalised for at least two days to prevent bias from home reporting. Between day 1 and 2, the average temperature (± standard error, SE) of the IVIG group fell by 1.3 ± 0.16 ˚C compared to 0.42 ± 0.11 ˚C in the ASA group. At day 2, the number of participants with a maximum temperature ≥ 38 ˚C was 16/35 in IVIG group compared to 30/35 in the ASA group.

### Antiepileptic drug treatment of rolandic epilepsy and panayiotopoulos syndrome: clinical practice survey and clinical trial feasibility [^111vmCkM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

UK management of rolandic epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome are not well known and there is limited scientific basis for drug treatment or non-treatment.
Paediatric opinion towards clinical trial designs is also unknown and important to assess prior to further planning.

What this study adds?

There are suggested patterns of underuse of EEG and neuropsychological assessment and overuse of brain MRI; 40% of patients are routinely untreated.
Half the respondents would be open to head-to-head or active versus non-active design or placebo-controlled clinical trials with carbamazepine and levetiracetam as the preferred active treatments.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113hp2Js]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ATS guideline) — updating and adaptation: New evidence should inform future revisions of these recommendations, and the next update will be determined by the ATS not later than in 2021. For local implementation, we suggest that responsible parties use the GRADE process, a combination of direct adoption, adaptation, and de novo development of recommendations, preferably in collaboration with the authors of this document; the panel also emphasizes future research opportunities, including the need for randomized controlled trials to assess the safety and efficacy of various bariatric interventions in patients with OHS.

### Benefit of IVIG for long-standing ataxic sensory neuronopathy with Sjögren's syndrome. IV immunoglobulin [^115EmZ8k]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Ataxic sensory neuronopathy with Sjögren's syndrome is a devastating neurologic complication for which there is no established treatment. IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given to five patients with severe disabilities for an average of 12 years. Four patients showed remarkable improvement, two of whom responded after the first course. The authors conclude that IVIG is safe and effective to treat even chronically debilitated patients who have the disease, presumably because it ameliorates smoldering inflammation.

### Differentiating lower motor neuron syndromes [^113YrLqW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

LMN syndromes represent a spectrum of disorders with a variety of underlying aetiologies and presentations. Clinical assessment combined with neurophysiology are often adequate to establish a diagnosis, but advances in genetic and imaging techniques are further diagnostic tools becoming increasingly accessible to clinicians. Although establishing an accurate diagnosis in LMN presentations can be clinically challenging at times, it is important due to prognostic and treatment implications.

### Muscle cramps [^115jNZbu]. Muscle & Nerve (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps are a common problem characterized by a sudden, painful, involuntary contraction of muscle. These true cramps, which originate from peripheral nerves, may be distinguished from other muscle pain or spasm. Medical history, physical examination, and a limited laboratory screen help to determine the various causes of muscle cramps. Despite the "benign" nature of cramps, many patients find the symptom very uncomfortable. Treatment options are guided both by experience and by a limited number of therapeutic trials. Quinine sulfate is an effective medication, but the side-effect profile is worrisome, and other membrane-stabilizing drugs are probably just as effective. Patients will benefit from further studies to better define the pathophysiology of muscle cramps and to find more effective medications with fewer side-effects.

### Effect of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin on quality of life in patients with stiff-person syndrome [^117JJB6y]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

The therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the stiff-person syndrome (SPS) have been described exclusively in case reports or open-label studies in terms of clinical outcomes. We investigate whether IVIG improves quality of life (QoL) in the SPS. Six patients with the classic form of SPS completed a generic QoL instrument, the SF-36, and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before treatment as well as 2 weeks after completion of a course of IVIG. There was significant improvement in the SF-36 subscores for pain, social functioning, general mental health, and energy-vitality with treatment. The VAS also improved significantly. We conclude that treatment with IVIG improves QoL in the SPS.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / ASSH clinical practice guideline summary management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^116svB7T]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Risk factors: keyboarding, clerical work — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that there is no association between high keyboard use and carpal tunnel syndrome, with Quality of Evidence: Very Low and Strength of Option: Consensus. Under the Options heading, the guideline states that low quality evidence, no evidence, or conflicting supporting evidence lead these statements to be listed as options, and that future research may upgrade them to strong or moderate recommendations for treatment. The rationale notes that no high- or moderate-quality studies were identified to address the association, and the benefits/harms section highlights potential harm in the lack of recognition of keyboard use as a strong risk factor or causative variable, which has implications for worker's compensation cases and physicians evaluating causation.

### Diagnosis and new treatment in muscle channelopathies [^113XjSgL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The skeletal muscle fibre membrane plays a major role in muscle contraction by generating and propagating action potentials, and linking the latter to the release of intracellular calcium stores which triggers mechanical contraction. This function relies on the proper functioning of ion channels. In the last two decades, diseases caused by mutations in muscle ion channel genes have been identified, the so-called muscle channelopathies. Even though the pathophysiology of muscle channelopathies is not completely elucidated, major advances have been made in their understanding, thus linking patient symptoms and neurophysiology with abnormal functioning of the muscle membrane. This has facilitated significant progress both in the diagnosis of these disorders and in the rationale for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we will focus on diagnosis and treatments of muscle channelopathies of relevance to the clinical neurologist.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113J4ApD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) — medical treatment options: We recommend steroidogenesis inhibitors as second-line treatment after TSS in patients with CD (with or without RT/radiosurgery), as primary treatment of ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) in patients with occult or metastatic EAS, and as adjunctive treatment to reduce cortisol levels in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC); we suggest pituitary-directed medical treatments for CD when patients are not surgical candidates or have persistent disease after TSS; we suggest administering a glucocorticoid antagonist in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after TSS; and we suggest targeted therapies to treat ectopic ACTH syndrome.

### Long-term treatment of restless legs syndrome with dopamine agonists… [^1151Wvao]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Restless legs syndrome, as defined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group criteria, 1 may occur in more than 10% of predominately Caucasian populations. 2–4 Historically, numerous treatments have been used with varying degrees of success, yet evidence-based medicine most consistently supports the efficacy of levodopa and dopamine agonists. 5 These studies, however, mostly involve short treatment periods. This is most notable with levodopa, which has the shortest half-life of any dopaminergic treatment. 9 Augmentation, however, is also reported with pergolide6, 10, 11 and pramipexole12, 13 but, to date, not with cabergoline. 14, 15 No report has ever evaluated the longitudinal use of multiple dopaminergic medications concurrently to make efficacy and tolerability comparisons. Furthermore, factors that might predict problems with continued DA treatment for RLS have not been systematically evaluated.

Efficacy was rated with the following scale: 5, essentially complete relief of RLS symptoms and excellent nocturnal sleep; 4, essentially complete relief but continued subjective sleep problems of any cause; 3, 75% to 99% improvement; 2, 25% to 74% improvement; 1, 1% to 24% improvement; and 0, no improvement. Previously, these 83 subjects had also tried and discontinued benzodiazepines, levodopa, opioids, and other medications. By the second follow-up visit after starting a DA, levodopa was discontinued in 19 of 22 subjects, opioids in 5 of 6, benzodiazepines in 11 of 23, and gabapentin in 2 of 3 subjects. Our results demonstrate that DA effectively treat RLS for more than 6 months. Efficacy is generally maintained across time but at the cost of a moderate but significant dose augmentation. The medications are very well tolerated, and adverse events are uncommon after the dose initiation.

Modest augmentation, as defined by an earlier onset of symptoms, occurs frequently, but severe augmentation that increases symptom intensity is uncommon and usually managed by dose adjustments. Finally, RLS intensity and duration of symptoms generally increase across time, so the earlier onset may in part represent natural progression of the disease.

### Treatment… [^114LYyLq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rapidly progressing infection involving shock and multi-organ failure.
- Diagnosing STSS can be difficult and patients are often misdiagnosed.
- Treatment focuses on addressing issues with shock and specific organs that are failing.
- Treatment includes antibiotics and frequently surgery to remove the source of infection.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with STSS. Strains that produce certain virulence factors and exotoxins, particularly streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, are more likely to cause severe infections, including STSS. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread Incubation period The incubation period for STSS varies depending on site of entry. Once initial symptoms occur, hypotension generally develops within 24 to 48 hours. Treatment Hospitalization STSS requires hospitalization.

Standard treatment of shock and organ failure, such as fluid resuscitation, is imperative as the first step in treatment. Antibiotics Know your facility's existing guidance for diagnosing and managing sepsis. Suspect sepsis
- Start antibiotics as soon as possible, and other needed therapies.
- Check patient progress frequently.
- Reassess antibiotic therapy within 24–48 hours.
- Stop or change therapy as needed.
- Once STSS is confirmed, antibiotics can be tailored. Penicillin and clindamycin are used in conjunction as first-line antibiotic choices for STSS. Surgery Removal of the source of infection, if possible, is important in the management of STSS. Surgical debridement of deep tissue infection may be necessary. Other treatment options Use of intravenous immunoglobulin can be considered for severely ill patients early in the clinical course although efficacy hasn't been proven.

Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Antibiotic prophylaxis For household contacts of people with a confirmed invasive group A streptococcal infection, CDC doesn't routinely recommend:

- Antibiotic prophylaxis
- Routine screening Special considerations Healthcare providers may choose to offer prophylaxis to all household members of a confirmed case if the household includes someone
- Aged 65 years or older
- At increased risk of invasive group A strep disease.
