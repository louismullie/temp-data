## Question

for patient with A1C of 5.8 with normal fasting glucose, what are next steps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an HbA1c of 5.8% when fasting glucose is normal, and what the next steps should be for diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of prediabetes, including when to consider additional testing or metformin, monitoring, and counseling, in line with current guidelines and data, Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether 5.8% meets ADA prediabetes criteria and whether a normal fasting glucose changes that. Then, I should verify the implications of discordance between A1c and fasting glucose and whether this is expected or concerning. Next, I will confirm test validity and consider repeat testing or alternative tests if interference is possible. After that, I will assess overall cardiometabolic risk, decide on optional further testing such as OGTT or CGM, initiate lifestyle therapy, consider metformin in high-risk scenarios, and set up monitoring and documentation with shared decision-making, I should keep checking each step against ADA 2025 and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework: ADA 2025 defines prediabetes as HbA1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL, or 2-hour OGTT 140–199 mg/dL, so an HbA1c of 5.8% meets prediabetes by A1c criterion regardless of fasting glucose status [^114V3E6i] [^115bQfZz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the normal fasting glucose negating this; I initially thought a normal FPG might exclude prediabetes, but that's not correct because ADA allows diagnosis by any one of the acceptable tests and recognizes discordance between tests, so the A1c-defined prediabetes stands unless there is a validity concern [^114V3E6i] [^113RwGrs].

> Next, I should review discordance between A1c and fasting glucose; let me think about population overlap: multiple studies show limited overlap among A1c-defined, IFG-defined, and IGT-defined prediabetes, with A1c often identifying individuals with higher BMI and adverse lipids and potentially greater postprandial dysglycemia, so normal FPG with elevated A1c is expected in many cases and does not negate risk [^1118hANQ] [^117Ef2SU] [^116Aj6wd].

> Wait, let me verify that discordance itself prompts evaluation for test interference rather than dismissal of the result; ADA advises evaluating for a problem with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance, which means I should verify A1c validity and consider repeating it before concluding anything definitive [^1167MvKp].

> I need to check test validity now: I should confirm the A1c was performed in an NGSP-certified, DCCT-standardized lab and consider repeating the A1c given it is near the threshold, and I should screen for conditions that alter the A1c–glycemia relationship such as hemoglobinopathies, CKD, anemia, recent transfusion, pregnancy, HIV, hemolysis, G6PD deficiency, or EPO, in which case glucose-based tests are preferred, and if discordance persists, repeating the abnormal test or using an alternate modality is prudent [^113RwGrs] [^112bAriw] [^117VZPG4].

> Let me consider comprehensive risk assessment next because prediabetes is a risk state: I should assess BMI and central adiposity, blood pressure, lipids, family history, activity, history of gestational diabetes or PCOS, and medications that increase risk such as glucocorticoids and atypical antipsychotics, with particular attention to olanzapine and related agents given their metabolic effects and recommended baseline and periodic glucose and lipid monitoring [^112Y2Ggc] [^115gZ4Kh] [^114j3ncc].

> But wait, what if fasting glucose is normal and we want to further phenotype glycemia; I should confirm that OGTT is an acceptable option to detect impaired glucose tolerance that fasting glucose can miss, ensure 3 days of adequate carbohydrate intake before testing, and consider CGM in select cases to characterize postprandial excursions and variability when A1c is questioned or when richer glycemic profiling would change management, recognizing that CGM in non-diabetic individuals shows very high time-in-range as a reference point [^115bQfZz] [^114RqarK] [^1134KEgu].

> I will now examine initial management; lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone and should start now: target 5–10% weight loss if overweight or obese, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity plus resistance training, nutrition emphasizing reduced saturated fat and refined carbohydrates with higher fiber, and structured behavioral support to improve adherence and outcomes, which collectively reduce progression to diabetes and improve cardiometabolic risk [^112Y2Ggc] [^113vAJuh].

> Hold on, I should verify when to consider metformin; ADA historically supports metformin for high-risk prediabetes, especially age under 60, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², history of gestational diabetes, progressive hyperglycemia, or strong family history, and while A1c 5.8% alone is moderate risk, metformin becomes reasonable if additional high-risk features are present after shared decision-making [^112Y2Ggc] [^115gZ4Kh].

> I need to ensure we address global cardiometabolic risk in parallel; that means optimizing blood pressure and lipid management per risk profile, smoking cessation support, and screening where appropriate for sleep apnea in those with obesity, given the linkage between prediabetes phenotypes and adverse CVD risk factors [^112Y2Ggc] [^1118hANQ].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence; ADA recommends at least annual monitoring for people with prediabetes, with consideration of 6-month intervals if risk is higher or A1c is rising, and I should plan to follow A1c primarily while considering periodic FPG or OGTT if the clinical picture is discordant or evolving, especially after any therapy changes or new risk exposures [^112Y2Ggc].

> I will now outline documentation and communication; I should clearly document "Prediabetes by A1c 5.8%" with confirmation strategy, record risk factors, specify lifestyle prescriptions with measurable goals, discuss the optional role of OGTT or CGM if indicated, and set a specific follow-up interval with return precautions for hyperglycemic symptoms, using shared decision-making if pharmacotherapy is considered [^112Y2Ggc].

> Let me reconsider edge cases: if I uncover an A1c interference condition, I should pivot to glucose-based diagnosis with FPG and OGTT and avoid relying on A1c for monitoring, whereas if A1c is confirmed and discordance persists without interference, I should accept the A1c-defined prediabetes and proceed with prevention and surveillance as above [^113RwGrs] [^1167MvKp].

> Final check and clinical decision: the patient has prediabetes by A1c 5.8% even with normal fasting glucose, so I will confirm A1c validity and repeat if needed, assess cardiometabolic risk comprehensively, initiate intensive lifestyle intervention now, consider OGTT for further risk stratification and metformin only if high-risk features emerge, and monitor at least annually, sooner if risk rises or results change [^114V3E6i] [^112Y2Ggc] [^115bQfZz] [^112Y2Ggc].

For a patient with an A1C of 5.8% and normal fasting glucose, next steps include: **confirm prediabetes with a 2-hour OGTT** [^114V3E6i] to detect isolated impaired glucose tolerance, as A1C and fasting glucose alone can miss postprandial dysglycemia [^116wsxHr]. If the OGTT is normal, **repeat A1C in 6–12 months**; if it shows IGT, initiate structured lifestyle intervention (5–10% weight loss, ≥ 150 min/week of activity) [^114BoucV] and monitor A1C annually [^112Y2Ggc]. Evaluate for **A1C assay interference** (anemia, hemoglobinopathies, CKD, liver disease) [^1167MvKp] and use glucose-based tests if suspected [^113RwGrs]. Pharmacotherapy is **not indicated** unless multiple risk factors are present or progression occurs [^114BoucV].

---

## Confirmatory testing

Perform a **75-g OGTT** [^114V3E6i] [^115bQfZz] to detect isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [^117Ef2SU], which A1C and fasting glucose may miss [^113L7Xdj]. If the OGTT is normal, **repeat A1C** in 6–12 months to monitor progression [^112Y2Ggc].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss to reduce diabetes risk [^114BoucV].

- **Physical activity**: Encourage ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity [^113vAJuh].

- **Dietary changes**: Emphasize whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and reduced refined carbohydrates [^114dK8ee].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess A1C and fasting glucose **annually** [^112Y2Ggc], and **address hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity** [^111HCFZq].

---

## Evaluation for assay interference

Assess for **A1C assay interference** — anemia, hemoglobinopathies, CKD, or liver disease that may affect accuracy [^113RwGrs] [^1167MvKp]. If interference is suspected, **use glucose-based tests** [^113Rmpb9].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is **not indicated** unless multiple risk factors are present or there is evidence of progression [^117LPkzm].

---

## Patient education

Provide **education** about prediabetes, lifestyle changes, and the need for regular monitoring [^112Y2Ggc].

---

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to indications for screening, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with prediabetes (HbA1c ≥ 5.7%, ≥ 39 mmol/mol; impaired glucose tolerance; or impaired fasting glucose) for the development of T2DM at least annually. The frequency of testing should be modified based on individual risk assessment.

### Hemoglobin a1c testing alone does not sufficiently identify patients with prediabetes [^113rTcpK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Whether hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) values are suitable for diagnosing diabetes has been debated. We sought to assess the prevalence of elevated HbA(1c) levels in a prediabetes patient population. Oral glucose tolerance tests and HbA(1c) levels were analyzed for patients entering a diabetes prevention program between January 1, 2007, and September 13, 2009. We calculated the percentage of patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who had HbA(1c) values in the 6.0% to 6.4% range or in the 5.7% to 6.4% range. The mean age of the 242 patients was 62 years; 64.0% were women, and 88.0% were white. Isolated IFG was detected in about 56.2% of patients, and combined IFG and IGT in about 37.2%. Only 28.5% of patients had HbA(1c) values in the 6.0% to 6.4% range, whereas 65.3% had values in the 5.7% to 6.4% range. Our data suggest that reliance on HbA(1c) testing alone to identify candidates for a diabetes prevention program would miss a substantial number of eligible patients.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113Rmpb9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Glucose measurement**
	- When glucose is used to establish the diagnosis of diabetes, it should be measured in venous plasma A (high). For screening of high-risk individuals, it should be measured in venous plasma B (moderate). Plasma glucose should be measured in an accredited laboratory when used for diagnosis or screening for diabetes [Good Practice Point (GPP)]. Outcome studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of screening C (moderate).

- **Diagnosis/screening**: The diagnosis of diabetes is established by identifying the presence of hyperglycemia. Traditionally, the diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating hyperglycemia through increased glucose concentrations in plasma. In 1979, criteria based on the distribution of glucose concentrations in high-risk populations were established, which the WHO endorsed. In 1997, the criteria were modified to better identify individuals at risk of retinopathy and nephropathy. The revised criteria include: 1) FPG value ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL); 2) a 2-hour postload glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) during an OGTT; or 3) symptoms of diabetes and a casual plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). Confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day is necessary to establish the diagnosis.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^113kB1GY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended glycemic goals for nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 9. The recommendations are based on those for A1C, with listed blood glucose levels that appear to correlate with the achievement of an A1C of < 7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) targets is complex. Elevated post-challenge (2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, some surrogate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia.

It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels closer to 7%. However, outcome studies have clearly shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complications, and landmark glycemic control trials such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) relied overwhelmingly on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial presented at the 68th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2008 found no cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose.

A reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets is that for individuals who have premeal glucose values within target but have A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1–2 hours after the start of the meal and treatment aimed at reducing PPG values to < 180 mg/dl may help lower A1C.

### Egrifa SV [^117GK4P8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Egrifa SV treatment can result in glucose intolerance. During clinical trials, the percentages of patients with elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) from baseline to week 26 were 5% and 1% in the Egrifa and placebo groups, respectively. An increased risk of developing diabetes with Egrifa (HbA1c level ≥ 6.5%) relative to placebo was observed, with an intent-to-treat hazard odds ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6).

Evaluate glucose status prior to initiating Egrifa SV. Monitor all patients treated with Egrifa SV periodically to diagnose those who develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. If patients treated with Egrifa SV develop glucose intolerance or diabetes, consider discontinuing Egrifa SV in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response. Egrifa SV increases IGF-1; therefore, monitor patients with diabetes who are receiving treatment with Egrifa SV at regular intervals for potential development or worsening of retinopathy.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 4% of patients treated with Egrifa in clinical trials. Reactions included pruritus, erythema, flushing, urticaria, and rash. In cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions, advise patients to seek prompt medical attention and immediately discontinue treatment with Egrifa SV.

- **Injection site reactions**: Egrifa SV treatment may cause injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, irritation, and bruising. The incidence of injection site reactions was 25% in Egrifa-treated patients and 14% in placebo-treated patients.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning the indications for screening (choice of test), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or HbA1c to screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake of at least 150 g/day for 3 days before obtaining an OGTT.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 1, especially in pregnant patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring to achieve optimal glucose levels. The set glucose goals include fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^1118hANQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The comparison of the prevalences of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH) diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) shows that isolated forms of prediabetes are common at the population level. Differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were observed between the isolated A1C (i-A1C), isolated IFG (i-IFG), and isolated IGT (i-IGT) groups. Individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% who had normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results were characterized by a higher body mass index (BMI), central obesity, and a more adverse lipid profile.

The comparability of A1C 5.7–6.4% with IFG and IGT as a marker of IH, particularly regarding associated CVD risk factors, is not well known. Data from previous studies using A1C and OGTT for diagnosing type 2 diabetes have been controversial regarding the cardiovascular risk profile. In the Telde Study, Spanish subjects diagnosed with A1C were characterized by higher BMI and waist circumference and lower levels of HDL cholesterol compared with the OGTT group. In contrast, in the Danish Inter99 study population, which had a high prevalence of male smokers, individuals with A1C-defined diabetes were leaner and had a higher prevalence of lipid abnormalities compared with the OGTT group. Our results agree with those of the Telde Study, showing that individuals classified with a prediabetic A1C of 5.7–6.4% were characterized by higher BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Further studies in different populations are required to evaluate the finding that the different markers seem to identify, in part, different individuals.

The advantage of using A1C is less day-to-day variability compared with OGTT. The 2-hour glucose levels have higher variability.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^116Aj6wd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) at a range of 5.7–6.4% was proposed as an indicator of increased risk for type 2 diabetes, in addition to the currently used criteria of intermediate hyperglycemia (IH): impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Use of A1C in a nondiabetic range may detect a different prevalence of IH compared with IFG or IGT. However, the degree of overlap between these markers is not well reported. Recent studies from diabetic populations have yielded conflicting data regarding differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor profiles among those diagnosed by A1C ≥ 6.5% and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Studies comparing CVD risk factor profiles among individuals with IH diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4% and OGTT are lacking.

We hypothesized that these three different markers of IH, in part, detect different individuals and that individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% would be characterized by a more unfavorable CVD risk profile than individuals diagnosed by OGTT. To this aim, we conducted a population-based observational study to compare: 1) diagnosis of IH based on A1C 5.7–6.4% with OGTT, and 2) differences in CVD risk factors among the three groups.

### Evaluation of reference metrics for continuous glucose monitoring in persons without diabetes and prediabetes [^1134KEgu]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines have been developed for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics in persons with diabetes. To understand what glucose profiles should be judged as normal in clinical practice and glucose-lowering trials, we examined the glucose profile of healthy individuals using CGM.

- **Methods**: Persons without diabetes or prediabetes were included after passing a normal oral glucose tolerance test, with a two-hour value of < 8.9 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), fasting glucose < 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL), and HbA1c < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol). CGM metrics were evaluated using the Dexcom G4 Platinum.

- **Results**: In total, 60 persons were included. The mean age was 43.0 years, 70.0% were women, the mean HbA1c was 5.3% (34 mmol/mol), and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m². Median and mean percent times in hypoglycemia (< 3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]) were 1.6% (IQR 0.6–3.2) and 3.2% (95% CI 2.0; 4.3), respectively. For glucose levels < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), the corresponding estimates were 0.0% (IQR 0.0–0.4) and 0.5% (95% CI 0.2; 0.8). Median and mean time-in-range (3.9–10.0 mmol/L [70–180 mg/dL]) was 97.3% (IQR 95.4–98.7) and 95.4% (95% CI 94.0; 96.8), respectively. Median and mean standard deviations were 1.04 mmol/L (IQR 0.92–1.29) and 1.15 mmol/L (95% CI 1.05; 1.24), respectively. Measures of glycemic variability (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions) were significantly greater during daytime compared with nighttime, whereas others did not differ.

- **Conclusions**: People without prediabetes or diabetes show a non-negligible percentage time in hypoglycemia, median 1.6% and mean 3.2%.

### Position statement executive summary: Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114wiHZW]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Glucose meters**: There are insufficient published data to support a role for portable meters and skin-prick (finger-stick) blood samples in the diagnosis of diabetes or for population screening.

- **Imprecision of results**: The imprecision of the results, coupled with substantial differences among meters, precludes the use of glucose meters for the diagnosis of diabetes and limits their usefulness in screening for diabetes.

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: SMBG is recommended for all insulin-treated patients with diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with diet and oral agents, SMBG may help achieve better control, particularly when therapy is initiated or changed. However, data are insufficient to claim an associated improvement of health outcomes. The role of SMBG in patients with stable type 2 diabetes controlled by diet alone is not known. Patients should be instructed in the correct use of glucose meters, including quality control. Comparison between SMBG and laboratory glucose analysis should be performed at regular intervals to evaluate the performance of the meters in the patient's hands.

- **Performance goals**: Multiple performance goals for portable glucose meters have been proposed. These targets vary widely and are highly controversial. Manufacturers should work to improve the imprecision of meters, with an intermediate goal of limiting total error for 95% of samples to ≤ 15% at glucose concentrations ≥ 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and to < 0.8 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) at glucose concentrations < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL).

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Is it feasible [^113vAJuh]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) necessitates the implementation of preventive strategies tailored to the specific needs of individual regions. Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM. In some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal.

Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, thereby improving cardiovascular risk profiles and reducing the risk of T2DM development. These consistent observations have led to large-scale randomized controlled trials utilizing lifestyle interventions, including behavioral strategies for reinforcing prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity, or both, with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated.

### One-step or 2-step testing for gestational diabetes: Which is better [^116adgqe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

In the United States, the common approach to detecting gestational diabetes mellitus is the 2-step protocol recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A 50 g, 1-hour glucose challenge at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation is followed by a 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test when a screening test threshold is exceeded. Notably, 2 or more elevated values diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 2-step screening test is administered without regard to the time of the last meal, providing convenience by eliminating the requirement for fasting.

However, depending upon the cutoff used and population risk factors, approximately 15% to 20% of screened women require the 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommends a protocol of no screening test but rather a diagnostic 75 g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. One or more values above threshold diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 1-step approach requires that women be fasting for the test but does not require a second visit and lasts 2 hours rather than 3.

Primarily because of needing only a single elevated value, the 1-step approach identifies 18% to 20% of pregnant women as having gestational diabetes mellitus, 2 to 3 times the rate with the 2-step procedure, but lower than the United States prediabetes rate of 24% in reproductive aged women. The resources needed for the increase in gestational diabetes mellitus are parallel to the resources needed for the increased prediabetes and diabetes in the nonpregnant population.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: Are we making progress [^112bvCUs]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

HbA1c stands for glycated hemoglobin.

- **Introduction**: This review examines current strategies for managing type 2 diabetes and assesses whether significant progress has been made in treatment protocols. The discussion focuses on how effectively these strategies have controlled HbA1c levels, reduced complications, and improved patient quality of life.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature review was conducted involving recent studies and clinical guidelines to evaluate advancements in type 2 diabetes management. The analysis includes randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that measure outcomes related to glycemic control and associated risk factors.

- **Results**: Emerging therapies and technologies have shown potential in enhancing diabetes care. However, despite these advancements, achieving optimal HbA1c targets remains a challenge for many patients. New medications and continuous glucose monitoring systems have made significant strides in personalizing treatment plans, yet the integration of these innovations into everyday practice still encounters barriers.

- **Conclusion**: While progress has been made in the management of type 2 diabetes, the full potential of current advances has not been realized universally. Ongoing efforts are required to overcome existing challenges, such as accessibility, education, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Continued research and collaboration among healthcare providers are essential to improve outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^116FCnUd]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). They are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.

As is the case with glucose measures, several prospective studies have used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes and demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C levels and subsequent diabetes development. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes, with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% was associated with a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 to 50%, and a relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of Black and White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that in the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying individuals with prediabetes.

### Screening for type 2 diabetes [^112GygHE]. Diabetes Care (2000). Low credibility.

Definitive studies on the effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes are currently not available. RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials) would be the best means to assess effectiveness, but several barriers prevent these studies from being conducted. Prospective observational studies may characterize some of the benefits of screening by creating screened and unscreened groups for comparison. The availability of better data systems and health services research techniques will facilitate such comparisons, though interpretation of the results of such studies is extremely problematic.

Several screening tests have been evaluated:

- **Biochemical tests**: Screening with biochemical tests generally performs better than other methods.
- **Glucose measurements**: Venous and capillary glucose measurements may be more favorable than urinary glucose or HbA(1c) measurements. Measuring postprandial glucose levels might have an advantage over fasting levels. The performance of all screening tests is dependent on the cutoff point selected, and unfortunately, there are no well-defined and validated cutoff points to define positive tests.

- **Two-stage screening strategy**: While a two-stage screening test strategy may assist with more efficient use of resources, such approaches have not been rigorously tested.

The optimal interval for screening remains unknown. Even though periodic, targeted, and opportunistic screening within the existing health care system seems to offer the greatest yield and likelihood of appropriate follow-up and treatment, much of the reported experience with screening appears to be episodic and poorly targeted.

### Detection of abnormal glucose tolerance in Africans is improved by combining A1C with fasting glucose: The Africans in America study [^116wsxHr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormal glucose tolerance is rising in sub-Saharan Africa. Hemoglobin A1C, both alone and in combination with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), is used to diagnose abnormal glucose tolerance. The diagnostic ability of A1C in Africans with heterozygous variant hemoglobin, such as sickle cell trait or hemoglobin C trait, has not been rigorously evaluated. In U.S.-based Africans, we determined by hemoglobin status the sensitivities of: 1) FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, 2) A1C ≥ 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), and 3) FPG combined with A1C (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and/or A1C ≥ 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) for the detection of abnormal glucose tolerance.

- **Research design and methods**: An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 216 African immigrants (68% male, age 37 ± 10 years [mean ± SD], range 20–64 years). Abnormal glucose tolerance was defined as 2-h glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/L.

- **Results**: Variant hemoglobin was identified in 21% (46 of 216) of participants. Abnormal glucose tolerance occurred in 33% (72 of 216). When determining abnormal glucose tolerance from the OGTT (2-h glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/L), sensitivities of FPG for the total, normal, and variant hemoglobin groups were 32%, 32%, and 33%, respectively. Sensitivities for A1C were 53%, 54%, and 47%. For FPG and A1C combined, sensitivities were 64%, 63%, and 67%. Sensitivities for FPG and A1C and the combination did not vary by hemoglobin status (all P > 0.6). For the entire cohort, sensitivity was higher for A1C than FPG, and for both tests combined than for either test alone (all P values ≤ 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of A1C by variant hemoglobin status.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^117Ef2SU]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by a hemoglobin A1C of 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

- **Research design and methods**: Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0%, 13.2%, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT, and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^1143rrnA]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

**Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes**: A1C ≥ 6.5%. The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay; or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours; or 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, the result should be confirmed by repeat testing.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1C-based diagnostic criteria [^113L7Xdj]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

An International Expert Committee (IEC) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed diagnostic criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes based on A1C levels. We hypothesized that screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with A1C measurements would differ from using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT).

- **Research design and methods**: We compared pre-diabetes, dysglycemia (diabetes or pre-diabetes), and diabetes identified by the proposed criteria (A1C ≥ 6.5% for diabetes and 6.0–6.4% [IEC] or 5.7–6.4% [ADA] for high risk/pre-diabetes) with standard OGTT diagnoses in three datasets. Non-Hispanic white or black adults without known diabetes who had A1C and 75-g OGTT measurements were included from the prospective Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance study (n = 1,581), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (n = 2,014), and NHANES 2005–2006 (n = 1,111).

- **Results**: OGTTs revealed pre-diabetes in 35.8% and diabetes in 5.2% of combined study subjects. A1C provided receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas for diabetes of 0.79–0.83, but ROC curve areas were ≤ 0.70 for dysglycemia or pre-diabetes. The proposed criteria missed 70% of individuals with diabetes, 71–84% with dysglycemia, and 82–94% with pre-diabetes. Compared with the IEC criteria, the ADA criteria for pre-diabetes resulted in fewer false-negative and more false-positive results. There were also racial differences, with false-positive results being more common in black subjects and false-negative results being more common in white subjects.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^116Li4vD]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Recommended glycemic goals for many nonpregnant adults are based on A1C values, with listed blood glucose levels that correlate with achieving an A1C of < 7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial SMBG targets is complex. Elevated postchallenge (2-hour OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, some surrogate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia.

Postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels closer to 7%. However, outcome studies have shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complications, and landmark glycemic control trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied on preprandial SMBG. An RCT in patients with known CVD found no CVD benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose.

For individuals with premeal glucose values within target but A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1–2 hours after the start of the meal and treatment aimed at reducing PPG values to < 180 mg/dL may help lower A1C. This is a reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets. Glycemic goals for children are provided in section VII. A.1.a. Glycemic Control.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^114BoucV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. This group was defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-hour OGTT values of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l).

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having pre-diabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Structured lifestyle interventions, aimed at increasing physical activity and achieving a 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents, have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT (see Table 7).

It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to make the prevalence of IFG more similar to that of IGT. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, particularly concerning glycemic targets in pregnant patients, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring in pregnancy to achieve optimal glucose levels. The following glucose goals are set: fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L), and either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Itovebi [^114cVAUt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG), HbA1C levels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, or in patients who experience hyperglycemia after initiating treatment, monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels once every 3 days for the first week (Day 1 to 7), then once every week for the next 3 weeks (Day 8 to 28), then once every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks, then once every 4 weeks thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1C every 3 months and as clinically indicated.

Manage hyperglycemia with anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. During treatment with anti-hyperglycemic medication, continue monitoring fasting glucose levels. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

Consider consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of hyperglycemia and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, ITOVEBI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Stomatitis**: Severe stomatitis can occur in patients treated with ITOVEBI. Stomatitis occurred in 51% of patients treated with ITOVEBI in combination with palbociclib and fu.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly with respect to indications for screening (T1DM), the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with presymptomatic T1DM for disease progression. This should be done using HbA1c approximately every 6 months and a 75-g OGTT (fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose) annually. The frequency of monitoring should be modified based on individual risk assessments, which take into account age, the number and type of autoantibodies, and glycemic metrics.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114RqarK]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically about monitoring glycemic status, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing glycemic status by HbA1c and/or appropriate continuous glucose monitoring metrics, such as time in range, time above range, and time below range. Consider obtaining fructosamine or continuous glucose monitoring for glycemic monitoring when an alternative to HbA1c is required.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

These interventions represent the best established, most effective, and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

- **Step 1: Lifestyle intervention and metformin**: Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased activity levels are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by healthcare professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used.

For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes.

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals.

### International consensus on use of continuous glucose monitoring [^111mMJV5]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been the traditional method for assessing glycemic control. However, it does not reflect intra- and interday glycemic excursions that may lead to acute events, such as hypoglycemia, or postprandial hyperglycemia, which have been linked to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), from either real-time use (rtCGM) or intermittently viewed (iCGM), addresses many limitations inherent in HbA1c testing and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Although both provide the means to move beyond HbA1c measurement as the sole marker of glycemic control, standardized metrics for analyzing CGM data are lacking.

Moreover, clear criteria for matching people with diabetes to the most appropriate glucose monitoring methodologies, as well as standardized advice about how best to use the new information they provide, have yet to be established. In February 2017, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are experts in CGM technologies to address these issues. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations and represents the understanding of how CGM results can affect outcomes.

### Contributions of glucose and hemoglobin A1c measurements in diabetes screening [^1178QS3D]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Given the long-term consequences of untreated diabetes, patients benefit from timely diagnoses. Payer policies often recognize glucose but not hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for diabetes screening. This study evaluates the different information that glucose and HbA1c provide for diabetes screening.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of national clinical laboratory testing during 2020 when glucose and HbA1c were ordered for routine diabetes screening, excluding patients with known diabetes, out-of-range glucose, or metabolic syndrome.

- **Results**: Of 15.47 million glucose and HbA1c tests ordered simultaneously, 672,467 (4.35%) met screening inclusion criteria; 116,585 (17.3%) were excluded because of diabetes-related conditions or the specimen was nonfasting, leaving 555,882 result pairs. More than 1 in 4 patients 60 years of age or older with glucose within range had an elevated HbA1c level. HbA1c claims were denied more often for Medicare beneficiaries (38,918/65,273 [59.6%]) than for other health plans combined (23,234/291,764 [8.0%]).

- **Conclusions**: Although many health plans do not cover HbA1c testing for diabetes screening, more than 1 in 4 glucose screening patients 60 years of age or older with an in-range glucose result had an elevated HbA1c result. Guideline developers and health plans should explicitly recognize that glucose and HbA1c provide complementary information and together offer improved clinical utility for diabetes screening.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2013 [^111hSNEo]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals and have stable glycemic control. Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or are not meeting glycemic goals. The use of point-of-care testing for A1C provides the opportunity for more timely treatment changes.

### Impact of A1C screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^115iYHtN]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The revised 2010 ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes includes three options for identifying patients at high risk for diabetes: FPG, A1C, and OGTT. Previously, IFG had been far preferred over IGT due to its logistical advantages. However, because A1C offers significant practical advantages over IFG, it is likely to become the preferred test among primary care providers for diagnosing pre-diabetes. The clinical impact of this change is not yet known, but the analysis suggests that it will substantially alter the population identified as having pre-diabetes, with tens of millions of Americans who would have been considered to have pre-diabetes previously being classified as not having pre-diabetes. This subgroup of individuals includes a substantial number with fasting glucose levels of 110–125 mg/dl and a burden of cardiovascular risk factors similar to that of their counterparts with pre-diabetes by A1C and IFG. The impact of not identifying these individuals is unclear. Policymakers and clinicians will need to consider the trade-offs between performing both FPG and A1C testing alone or in combination.

### Impact of active versus usual algorithmic titration of basal insulin and point-of-care versus laboratory measurement of HbA1c on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: the Glycemic Optimization with Algorithms and Labs at Point of Care (GOAL A1C) trial [^112tY5pG]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of active versus usual monitoring of algorithmic insulin titration and point-of-care (POC) versus laboratory HbA1c (A1C) measurement on glycemic control in primary care.

- **Research design and methods**: The Glycemic Optimization with Algorithms and Labs at Point of Care (GOAL A1C) study was a 24-week, randomized, parallel-group, four-arm, open-label study of 7,893 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by oral antidiabetic agents and requiring insulin. Patients were randomly assigned by investigators from 2,164 sites in the U.S. to insulin glargine with either 1) usual (no unsolicited contact between visits) insulin titration using a simple algorithm with laboratory A1C testing, 2) usual titration with POC A1C testing, 3) active (weekly monitored) titration with laboratory A1C testing, or 4) active titration with POC A1C testing. Outcome measures included a change in A1C and fasting self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) levels, percentage of patients achieving A1C < 7.0%, and hypoglycemia frequency.

- **Results**: Significant A1C and SMBG reductions were observed in all arms (P < 0.0001). Compared with usual insulin titration, active titration achieved greater A1C reduction (1.5 vs. 1.3%; P < 0.0001), SMBG reduction (88 vs. 79 mg/dl; P < 0.0001), and proportion of patients achieving A1C < 7.0% (38 vs. 30%; P < 0.0001). Among patients receiving active titration, POC A1C testing was associated with an increase in the proportion achieving an A1C < 7.0% (41% for POC vs. 36% for laboratory; P < 0.0001).

### Empirically establishing blood glucose targets to achieve HbA1c goals [^113JUWaC]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the average fasting, postprandial, and bedtime self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) concentrations associated with specified HbA1c levels using data from the A1c-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study. The research design and methods involved a multicenter observational study that used continuous glucose monitoring and SMBG testing to determine the relationship between mean average glucose and HbA1c.

SMBG data from 470 of the ADAG study participants (237 with type 1 diabetes and 147 with type 2 diabetes) were used to determine the average fasting, premeal, 90-minute postmeal, and bedtime blood glucose (BG) for predefined target HbA1c groups between 5.5 and 8.5% (37–69 mmol/mol). t-Tests were used to compare mean BG values between type 1 and type 2 diabetes groups.

- **Results**: The average fasting BG needed to achieve predefined HbA1c target levels were as follows:
	- 5.5–6.49% (37–47 mmol/mol): 122 mg/dL with 95% CI 117–127
	- 6.5–6.99% (48–52 mmol/mol): 142 mg/dL (135–150)
	- 7.0–7.49% (52–58 mmol/mol): 152 mg/dL (143–162)
	- 7.5–7.99% (58–64 mmol/mol): 167 mg/dL (157–177)
	- 8.0–8.5% (64–69 mmol/mol): 178 mg/dL (164–192)

	- **Postmeal BG to achieve the HbA1c level of**:
	- 6.5–6.99% (48–52 mmol/mol): 139 mg/dL (134–144)
	- 7.0–7.49% (52–58 mmol/mol): 152 mg/dL (147–157)

	- **Bedtime BG was**:
	- 153 mg/dL (145–161)
	- 177 mg/dL (166–188)

- **Conclusions**: The study determined the average BG at premeal, postmeal, and bedtime to achieve a variety of HbA1c targets. These results, based on empirical data, will help patients and providers set realistic goals for blood glucose management.

### Monitoring glycemic control: The importance of self-monitoring of blood glucose [^113DERQS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Several methods, each with differing utility and limitations, exist for monitoring glycemic control. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the standard measure of long-term glycemic control, and HbA1c levels are strongly associated with complications of diabetes. However, HbA1c does not provide "real-time" information about individual hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic excursions.

Urine glucose testing is noninvasive and inexpensive, but it is dependent on the patient's individual renal threshold and can only detect glucose concentrations above this threshold. As such, urine testing cannot be recommended for diabetes management that aims for near-normoglycemia.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) complements HbA1c by providing real-time blood glucose data. It is an educational tool for both patients and their healthcare providers to understand the effects of diet, exercise, and medications on day-to-day glycemic control. However, guidelines from various international diabetes organizations vary in their level of specificity regarding the frequency and timing of self-monitoring. SMBG should be implemented for all patients as part of an overall diabetes management plan that includes specific instruction on how, when, and why to test.

### Prediabetes in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs [^117LPkzm]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed that individuals with a fasting glucose level of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) or a glucose level of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) two hours following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, or hemoglobin A(1c) of 5.7%-6.4%, be classified as prediabetic, indicating an increased risk for the emergence of diabetes mellitus. At the same time, the ADA formulated guidelines for the use of metformin for the treatment of prediabetes.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of prediabetes in a cohort of psychiatrically ill adults receiving antipsychotics and to compare the clinical and metabolic features of prediabetic patients with those of patients with normal glucose tolerance and those with diabetes mellitus.

- **Method**: The 2010 ADA criteria were applied to a large, consecutive, single-site European cohort of 783 adult psychiatric inpatients (mean age: 37.6 years) without a history of diabetes who were receiving antipsychotics. All patients in this cross-sectional study underwent measurements of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting insulin and lipids from November 2003 through July 2007.

- **Results**: 413 patients (52.8%) had normal glucose tolerance, 290 (37.0%) had prediabetes, and 80 (10.2%) had diabetes mellitus. The fasting glucose and/or hemoglobin A(1c) criteria were met by 89.7% of prediabetic patients. A statistically significant intergroup gradient from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus was observed for waist circumference and triglycerides.

### Executive summary: Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^114cysUG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Testing for pre-diabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic patients should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals.

To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 75-g glucose load, or both, are appropriate. An OGTT may be considered in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better define the risk of diabetes. In those identified with pre-diabetes, it is important to identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116wB592]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, specifically in relation to indications for screening, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for early abnormal glucose metabolism with dysglycemia. This screening should use fasting glucose levels between 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or HbA1c levels between 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol).

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^111BjbF3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by a hemoglobin A1C of 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

- **Research design and methods**: Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0%, 13.2%, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.

### Can 'personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes and cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. The effectiveness, safety, and simplicity of first-line therapies make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^111HCFZq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather as risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). They are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.

Several prospective studies that used A1C to predict progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9% to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0 to 6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% to 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of Black and White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).

Therefore, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7 to 6.4% as identifying individuals with a high risk for future diabetes, a state that may be referred to as prediabetes.

### Who should return for an oral glucose tolerance test? A proposed clinical pathway based on retrospective analysis of 332 children [^113DKcEw]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the traditional diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, fasting is required, and implementing this test for all overweight or obese subjects is not practical. This study aimed to formulate a clinical pathway to stratify subjects according to their risk of abnormal OGTT.

This retrospective study included patients with overweight or obesity who had undergone OGTT in a tertiary pediatric unit from 2012 to 2018. The optimal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) cutoff that predicts abnormal OGTT was evaluated. Other non-fasting parameters, in combination with this HbA1c cutoff, were also explored as predictors of abnormal OGTT.

Three hundred and thirty-two patients (boys: 54.2%, Chinese: 97.3%) were included for analysis, of which 272 (81.9%) patients had normal OGTT, while 60 (18.0%) patients had abnormal OGTT (prediabetes or T2DM). The optimal HbA1c predicting abnormal OGTT was 5.5% (AUC 0.71; sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 71%). When HbA1c ≥ 5.5% was combined with a positive family history and abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) level, the positive predictive value for abnormal OGTT increased from 33.6 to 61.6%.

HbA1c, family history of T2DM, and ALT level could be used to derive a clinical pathway to stratify children who have a high risk of abnormal OGTT.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^115gZ4Kh]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see IV. PREVENTION/DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES). Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear. As A1C rises, the risk of diabetes increases disproportionately. Therefore, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with an A1C > 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk. Nevertheless, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dL (5.4 mmol/L) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with an A1C < 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on additional factors such as obesity and family history.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2012 [^111V9Zig]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value may fall below the diagnostic cut point. This occurrence is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-hour PG. Without laboratory error, such patients are likely to have results near the margins of the diagnostic threshold. Health care professionals might choose to closely monitor these patients and repeat the testing in 3–6 months. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in a table not included here.

- **Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)**: In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus identified an intermediate group of individuals. These individuals have glucose levels that, while not fulfilling the criteria for diabetes, are too high to be considered normal. These individuals are defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG), with FPG levels between 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with 2-hour values in the OGTT between 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L). It is important to note that the World Health Organization (WHO) and several other diabetes organizations define the cutoff for IFG at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).

### TruQAP [^1163Jtxu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with TruQAP, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG), HbA1C levels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with TruQAP, monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels on Day 3 or 4 of the dosing week during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8; then monthly while on treatment with TruQAP; and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1C levels every 3 months during treatment with TruQAP and as clinically indicated. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

For patients who experience hyperglycemia during treatment with TruQAP, monitor fasting glucose at least twice weekly, on days on and off TruQAP, until fasting glucose decreases to baseline levels. During treatment with anti-diabetic medications, monitor fasting glucose at least once a week for 2 months, followed by once every 2 weeks, or as clinically indicated.

Consider consultation with a healthcare practitioner with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycemia and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Withhold TruQAP immediately when ketoacidosis is suspected. If ketoacidosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue TruQAP. Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue TruQAP [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Mode of onset of type 2 diabetes from normal or impaired glucose tolerance [^1158oaHv]. Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose concentrations (FPG) predict the development of type 2 diabetes. Whether hyperglycemia evolves from normoglycemia gradually over time or as a step increase is not known. We measured plasma glucose and insulin levels during oral glucose testing in 35- to 64-year-old men and nonpregnant women from a population-based survey (Mexico City Diabetes Study) at baseline (n = 2,279) and after 3.25 (n = 1,740) and 7 years (n = 1,711) of follow-up. In subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) on all three occasions (nonconverters; n = 911), FPG increased only slightly (0.23 ± 0.79 mmol/l, mean ± SD; P < 0.0001) over 7 years. In contrast, conversion to diabetes among NGT subjects (n = 98) was marked by a large step-up in FPG regardless of the time of conversion (3.06 ± 2.57 and 2.94 ± 3.11 mmol/l, respectively, at 3.25 and 7 years; P < 0.0001 vs. nonconverters). Likewise, in subjects who converted to diabetes from impaired glucose tolerance (n = 75), FPG rose by 3.14 ± 3.83 and 3.12 ± 3.61 mmol/l (P < 0.0001 vs. nonconverters). Three-quarters of converters had increments in FPG above the 90th percentile of the corresponding increments in nonconverters. Converters had higher baseline BMI (30.4 ± 4.9 vs. 27.3 ± 4.0 kg/m²; P < 0.001) and fasting plasma insulin values (120 ± 78 vs. 84 ± 84 pmol/l; P < 0.02) than nonconverters; however, no consistent change in either parameter had occurred before conversion. In contrast, changes in 2-hour postglucose insulin levels between the time of conversion and the preceding measurement were significantly (P < 0.0001) related.

### A1c predicts type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance in a population at risk: The community diabetes prevention project [^113PeXqL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2009). Low credibility.

In a population at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), we assessed early physical and metabolic markers that predict progression from normal to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM. A total of 388 individuals (22% male, age 46 ± 11 years) at risk for T2DM were randomized to either Standard (n = 182) or Intervention (n = 206) care. Participants were evaluated at baseline and during 5 annual follow-up visits. Evaluations included assessments of blood pressure, BMI, A1C, lipids, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, VO2max, fasting glucose, insulin, and C-peptide.

The Standard group received results from annual lab tests and quarterly newsletters, while the Intervention group received quarterly newsletters, detailed discussions of lab results, routine self-directed activities, semi-annual group meetings, and monthly telephone calls for ongoing support.

Overall, 359 (93%) returned for at least one follow-up visit, and 272 (70%) completed the final 5-year assessment. Return rates, changes in measures, and the incidence of IGT/T2DM were similar between the groups. Low cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was the most prevalent baseline abnormality. A1C and BMI were significant predictors of IGT/T2DM after controlling for other factors. The risk of developing IGT/T2DM within 5 years was 17.16 times greater (95% CL: 6.169, 47.736) for those with baseline A1C ≥ 5.8% compared to those with lower levels. A1C is routinely performed among patients with diabetes; however, these data and other evidence suggest that it is a significant predictor of IGT/T2DM within 5 years in a population at high risk for T2DM.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large about the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A significant barrier to improved detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests that are somewhat inconvenient for patients and clinicians, and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by any of the associations or other organizations, it represents a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), convenient, and ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been hindered by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state, as most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state, or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, such as the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test.

### Considerations on blood glucose management in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116ecBXT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the benefits of more intensive management in preventing or delaying the development and progression of diabetic complications have been well documented. What is not as well documented is how to motivate the person with diabetes to manage the condition, how to set, assess, and quantify glucose goals, and the glucose variables that should be routinely measured. This review discusses the importance of setting targets and communicating them in a way that the patient understands.

- **Setting glucose targets**: When aiming for a glycaemia target, balance is required between achieving reduction of complications and causing an increased degree of hypoglycaemia. Additionally, it is essential to find a balance between what is achievable and what degree of benefit is gained. Target values given in guidelines should be adapted by the clinician to consider the patient's susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, stage and type of complications, age and life expectancy, co-morbidity, social environment, understanding of the steps required, and level of commitment to the treatment.

- **Suggested improvements**: Several suggestions are given regarding possible improvements and amendments to existing guidelines for diabetes management in treating to glucose goal. For example, attention should be drawn to the need to individualize goals and to consider education, long-term support, patient needs, and treatment outcome when formulating diabetes management plans.

- **Glucose variables**: The review emphasizes the relative properties of different glucose variables such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and glycated protein. These variables are discussed in terms of their convenience of measurement and relevance to treatment outcomes.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for type 1 diabetes mellitus, particularly in monitoring glycemic status, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend encouraging blood glucose checks appropriate to the insulin therapy. These checks should be done when fasting, before meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, before, during, and after exercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected, after treating low blood glucose levels until normoglycemic status is achieved, when hyperglycemia is suspected, and before and while performing critical tasks such as driving.

### International diabetes federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: A review of recommendations [^111UJ6ES]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

- **Question 4: What are the targets for postmeal glycaemic control and how should they be assessed**: A 2-hour postmeal goal of < 7.8 mmol/L (< 140 mg/dL) is recommended, aligning with targets from guidelines by other associations. These guidelines define normal glucose tolerance (NGT) as post-challenge values of < 7.8 mmol/L two hours after ingesting a 75-g glucose load, corresponding to postmeal values of healthy individuals. The two-hour timeframe for testing is consistent with published guidelines and reflects the return of postmeal hyperglycaemia to basal levels in individuals with normal glucose tolerance within 2 to 3 hours.

- **Glucose monitoring recommendations**: The guideline encourages performing glucose monitoring as frequently as necessary to guide therapy towards achieving postmeal glucose (PMG) targets. Specifically, the guideline suggests considering self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), as it is the only method to directly assess PMG. However, controversy surrounds SMBG use, particularly regarding the frequency of monitoring in non-insulin requiring diabetes. Most professional diabetes organizations continue to advocate for its use, generally recommending self-monitoring at least three times daily for individuals treated with insulin. The recommendation depends on the treatment regimen and level of glycaemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Additionally, the use of structured SMBG appears to result in a significant reduction in HbA1c, even in individuals with non-insulin requiring diabetes, supporting its implementation as part of structured diabetes management.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^112QRAq9]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

- **Testing for pre-diabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic patients**: Testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes. In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 75-g glucose load, or both, are appropriate. An OGTT may be considered in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better define the risk of diabetes. In those identified with pre-diabetes, it is important to identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

For many illnesses, there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes, the same tests are used for both screening and diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual whom the provider tests due to a high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. This discussion is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in those without symptoms, which will also detect individuals with pre-diabetes.

- **Testing for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults**: Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with a hyperglycemic crisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, if two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed.

On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dL or 7.0 mmol/L), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-hour PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis.
