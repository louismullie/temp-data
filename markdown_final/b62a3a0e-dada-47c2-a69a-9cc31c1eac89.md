## Question

Can Monas I got it twins be dichorionic diamniotic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether monozygotic twins can be dichorionic diamniotic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definitions of monozygosity and dichorionic diamniotic placentation. Then, I should verify the classic embryologic timing model that links timing of zygotic splitting to chorionicity and amnionicity. Next, I will check contemporary evidence for exceptions, especially with assisted reproductive technology, and look for case series or reports of monozygotic dichorionic diamniotic twins. After that, I should review mechanistic explanations and reconcile them with the traditional model. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note the clinical implications for counseling and testing.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate zygosity with chorionicity. Monozygotic twins arise from a single fertilized ovum that splits, whereas dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins have two separate placentas and two amniotic cavities, a configuration most commonly seen in dizygotic twinning but also possible in a subset of monozygotic twins depending on when splitting occurs [^115tqtBK] [^113vuWrQ].

> Now, I need to verify the classic timing model. Traditionally, very early splitting within about 3 days post-fertilization yields dichorionic diamniotic twins, splitting between days 4–8 yields monochorionic diamniotic twins, and splitting between days 9–12 yields monochorionic monoamniotic twins; later splitting can lead to conjoined twins, so the model predicts that monozygotic twins can indeed be dichorionic if the split is sufficiently early [^115tqtBK] [^1169E5TJ].

> Wait, let me verify the proportion of monozygotic twins that are dichorionic, because I initially thought "most" monozygotic twins were dichorionic. That would contradict the usual teaching that most are monochorionic. Hold on, I should verify this against contemporary data. The Nature Communications epigenetic study indicates that dichorionic monozygotic twins represent roughly one-third of monozygotic twins, whereas monochorionic diamniotic twins comprise about two-thirds, which aligns with the timing model and corrects my initial overestimate of dichorionic monozygotic frequency [^112VfJNH].

> Next, I should review real-world evidence that monozygotic DCDA twins actually occur. I will now examine ART case series and reports where zygosity was confirmed. Multiple case series document monozygotic dichorionic diamniotic twins after single blastocyst transfer, with confirmed monozygosity by DNA analysis, including reports of asymmetric development and collections of 13 cases, which directly demonstrates that monozygotic DCDA twins are not just theoretical [^1173VoDN] [^1169E5TJ] [^115tqtBK].

> But wait, what if the traditional timing model fails to explain these ART-associated DCDA monozygotic twins? I need to check mechanistic hypotheses. Proposed contributors include zona pellucida manipulation (ICSI, assisted hatching, biopsy), extended culture to the blastocyst stage, and altered inner cell mass dynamics or decompaction, any of which could perturb normal developmental timing and promote earlier or atypical splitting that results in dichorionic placentation despite monozygosity [^1169E5TJ] [^1139GbTv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathophysiology without acknowledging exceptions outside ART. I should confirm whether spontaneous monozygotic DCDA twins are also described. Yes, case literature includes spontaneous monozygotic DCDA twins, including examples such as discordant monozygotic twin sisters with fragile X, reinforcing that ART is not a prerequisite for this phenotype and that early zygotic splitting can produce dichorionic monozygotic twins in spontaneous conceptions as well [^113Dm1y7].

> I should double-check the clinical implications because chorionicity drives surveillance and counseling. Even when twins are dichorionic, if they are monozygotic, parents may assume risks are "lower" like dizygotic DCDA twins; however, some risks remain elevated in twins overall, and accurate early determination of chorionicity and zygosity informs prenatal diagnosis strategies, selective reduction techniques, and surveillance planning, so confirming zygosity when clinically relevant remains important [^115tqtBK] [^112rsHzb].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, monozygotic twins can be dichorionic diamniotic. This occurs when splitting happens very early, typically within the first 3 days post-fertilization, yielding separate chorions and amnions, and this accounts for roughly one-third of monozygotic twins in contemporary cohorts, with supportive evidence from both spontaneous and ART-associated cases confirmed by genetic testing [^112VfJNH] [^1169E5TJ] [^1173VoDN].

---

Yes, **monozygotic twins can be dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA)** [^115tqtBK] when the embryo splits within the first 3 days after fertilization, before chorion formation, resulting in separate placentas and amniotic sacs [^1169E5TJ] [^114BiAT9]. This early split accounts for about 25–30% of monozygotic twins and is more common with assisted reproductive technologies, especially blastocyst transfer and ICSI [^1169E5TJ] [^1153YQJQ]. DCDA monozygotic twins are genetically identical but have lower risks than monochorionic twins, though they still require standard twin surveillance [^1116KKoN] [^111niXQr].

---

## Embryological basis of dichorionic diamniotic monozygotic twins

- **Timing of embryo splitting**: If the embryo splits within 3 days after fertilization (before chorion formation), each twin develops its own placenta and amniotic sac, resulting in DCDA monozygotic twins [^1169E5TJ].

- **Placental development**: Separate placentas and amniotic sacs reflect early separation before chorionic villi fuse, distinguishing them from monochorionic twins that share a placenta [^114BiAT9].

- **Incidence**: Early splitting accounts for ~25–30% of monozygotic twins; most are monochorionic due to later splitting [^115tqtBK] [^112VfJNH].

---

## Factors influencing dichorionic diamniotic monozygotic twinning

Several factors **increase the likelihood** of DCDA monozygotic twinning:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Assisted reproductive technology (ART) | - ART, particularly blastocyst transfer and ICSI, increases monozygotic twinning, including DCDA [^1169E5TJ] [^1153YQJQ] [^114HkVkL] |
| Embryo manipulation | - Procedures such as assisted hatching and embryo biopsy may promote early splitting [^1169E5TJ] [^111ddQ5k] |
| Genetic predisposition | - Familial clustering suggests genetic influences on monozygotic twinning |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Prenatal diagnosis**: Early ultrasound (10–14 weeks) is essential to determine chorionicity and amnionicity, guiding management and counseling [^1116KKoN] [^111L3Hg3].

- **Prenatal care**: DCDA monozygotic twins generally have lower risks than monochorionic twins (e.g. no TTTS), but still require routine twin surveillance for growth, anomalies, and preterm birth [^1116KKoN] [^117UAdzf] [^115tqtBK].

- **Delivery**: Mode and timing follow standard DCDA guidance, with planned delivery often at 37–38 weeks if uncomplicated [^11598zxg] [^115LDuhK].

---

## Risks and complications

DCDA monozygotic twins have fewer complications than monochorionic twins but still face **increased risks** compared with singletons:

- **Preterm birth**: Higher risk than singletons, necessitating close monitoring [^111niXQr].

- **Growth discordance**: Occurs in ~10–20% and warrants surveillance [^1116KKoN].

- **Congenital anomalies**: Slightly higher risk than singletons, though lower than monochorionic twins [^116DFMq9].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate determination of chorionicity and zygosity relies on:

- **First-trimester ultrasound**: Highly accurate for chorionicity and amnionicity; look for two separate placentas and a thick dividing membrane [^111L3Hg3] [^115LXN1Q].

- **Zygosity testing**: DNA analysis (e.g. STR profiling) confirms monozygosity when needed [^1173VoDN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **early chorionicity assessment**, structured surveillance, and patient counseling tailored to chorionicity and zygosity [^1116KKoN] [^111niXQr]. They also recommend planned delivery at 37–38 weeks for uncomplicated DCDA twins to balance stillbirth and neonatal risks [^11598zxg] [^115LDuhK].

---

Monozygotic twins can be **dichorionic diamniotic** when the embryo splits very early, producing separate placentas and amniotic sacs. This configuration is less common than monochorionic twinning and is strongly associated with ART; management follows standard DCDA protocols with early ultrasound and routine twin surveillance.

### Monochorionic diamniotic in vitro fertilization twins have a decreased incidence of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome [^115J8rt7]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in spontaneous versus IVF-conceived twin pregnancies.

Design

Retrospective multicenter study.

Setting

University-affiliated tertiary medical centers.

Patient(S)

Women admitted for 11–14 week's scan between January 1997 and July 2013 who were diagnosed with monochorionic (MC) diamniotic twin pregnancies.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Mode of conception, TTTS.

Result(S)

The study cohort included 327 pregnant women with live MC diamniotic twins. Of them, 284 (86.9%) and 43 (13.1%) were spontaneous and IVF conceived, respectively. The mean maternal age was significantly higher in IVF compared with in spontaneously conceived pregnancies (33.8 ± 5.5 vs. 31.6 ± 5.4, respectively). Thirty-seven twins (11.3%) had TTTS, of whom 36/284 (12.7%) versus 1/43 (2.3%) were spontaneously and IVF conceived, respectively. The mean week of delivery was significantly lower in MC twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without TTTS (32.7 ± 3.3 vs. 35.5 ± 2.5, respectively). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher birthweight discordancy in twins diagnosed with TTTS compared with those without (20.6% vs. 11%, respectively).

Conclusion(S)

The significantly lower proportion of TTTS found in IVF-conceived twins may suggest a different embryological process that lies at the core of IVF conception of monozygotic twinning.

### Outcomes in twin pregnancies reduced to singleton pregnancies compared with ongoing twin pregnancies [^116mLPP8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Multifetal pregnancy reduction has been shown to improve outcomes in triplet and higher-order multiple pregnancies. The data for fetal reduction of twin pregnancies are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare adverse pregnancy outcomes in ongoing twin pregnancies compared with twin pregnancies reduced to singletons.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study comparing dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies reduced to singleton gestations between 11 and 24 weeks' gestation in a single maternal-fetal medicine practice over a 9 year period. Adverse pregnancy outcomes after 24 weeks were compared, with a value of P < .05 used for significance.

Results

Five hundred one ongoing twin pregnancies and 63 twin pregnancies reduced to singletons were included. Patients with reductions to singletons had a significantly lower risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks' gestation (10% vs 43%; P < .001) but no difference in the risk of preterm delivery before 34 weeks' or 28 weeks' gestation. Patients with reductions to singletons also had a lower risk of infant birthweight less than the 10% (23% vs 49%; P < .001) but no difference in the risk of infant birthweight less than the 5%. There was no difference in the risk of fetal demise after 24 weeks' gestation.

Conclusion

Fetal reduction of twin pregnancies decreases the risk of late preterm birth and birthweight less than the 10% but not the risks of more severe complications such as early preterm birth or birthweight less than the 5%.

### Incidence and clinicopathologic correlation of fetal vessel thrombosis in mono-and dichorionic twin placentas [^115ciw1B]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incidence of fetal vessel thrombosis in monochorionic-diamniotic and dichorionic-diamniotic twin placentas, and its association with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), fetal vascular anastomoses, chorangiosis, and chorioamnionitis.

Study Design

Histologic slides from 80 pairs of monochorionic and 80 pairs of dichorionic twin placentas were reviewed for evidence of fetal vessel thrombosis (≥ 5 adjacent avascular terminal villi with upstream intravascular fibrin thrombi). Associations with clinical and other pathologic variables were analyzed by χ² tests.

Result

Thrombosis occurred in 7.5% of monochorionic and 3.1% of dichorionic twin placentas (P = 0.090). It was associated with IUGR among the monochorionic twins (P = < 0.0001) and with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among the dichorionic twins (P = 0.018). Vascular anastomoses, TTTS, chorangiosis, and chorioamnionitis were not associated with fetal vessel thrombosis.

Conclusion

Fetal vessel thrombosis was identified more frequently in monochorionic twins, but this difference was not statistically significant. It is associated with IUGR in monochorionic twins, but not with TTTS or fetal vascular anastomoses at the chorionic surface.

### Correlation between FMR1 expression and clinical phenotype in discordant dichorionic-diamniotic monozygotic twin sisters with the fragile X mutation [^113Dm1y7]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical phenotypes of females with fragile X full mutations vary drastically. Comparisons of discordant monozygotic twins provide opportunities to ascertain crucial factors that influence disease phenotype penetrance.

Objective

To identify crucial factors influencing the phenotypic expression of fragile X syndrome (FXS).

Methods and Results

We describe a pair of discordant monozygotic female twins (dichorionic-diamniotic, Di-Di) with full mutation. The degrees of their phenotypic discordance regarding physical, psychiatric and behavioural features were quantified in a series of neuropsychological tests that varied significantly. Their FMR1 expression levels and whole genome DNA methylation profiling in blood were similar. Their similar life experiences also suggested that environmental factors had limited influence. However, the skewed inactivation of the normal X chromosome in the hair roots of twin A, resulting in large reduction in FMR1 expression compared to that of twin B, could adequately explain their widely variable phenotypes.

Conclusions

The sixfold variation in hair root FMR1 expression, which reflected FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) expression in the brain, accounted for the disparate phenotypes in IQ, cognition, and social capability between the twins. Additionally, considering the Di-Di type twinning and different CGG repeat sizes, CGG expansion should occur before splitting at day 3 of gestation.

### Diagnosis-related group weight and derived case mix index to assess the complexity among twins [^111BUD2w]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are used to summarize hospital morbidity and mortality. Each DRG has a weight which is important in calculating the case mix index (CMI), a numeric summary of disease complexity in a population of patients. We utilized DRG weight and resultant CMI to compare postnatal outcomes among singletons versus monochorionic and monoamniotic, monochorionic diamniotic, and dichorionic diamniotic twins.

Study Design

This single-center and retrospective cohort study evaluated DRGs assigned by the investigators, birth weight, gestational age, length of stay (LOS), NICU admission rate, and mortality in twin births between 2014 and 2016. Twins were analyzed depending on chorionicity and amnionicity. Overall, 3 months of singleton births served as the control. The CMI derived from DRG weights were compared across groups.

Results

Twins (n = 288) had lower gestational ages and birth weights and higher mortality, LOS, NICU admission rates and DRG weights/CMI compared with singletons (n = 327; p < 0.001 for each). The LOS was no different between twin subtypes; monochorionic monoamniotic twins had the highest mortality and DRG weight (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

DRG weight and CMI values summarize in-hospital complexity and can be a useful tool to evaluate differences in care complexity among groups of patients.

Key Points

· Using diagnosis-related group and case mix index to assess morbidities. · Morbidities of twins are monochorionic-monoamniotic versus monochorionic-diamniotic versus dichorionic-diamniotic twins. · Only seven diagnosis-related group in neonatology make it a valuable tool for clinicians.

### Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome in one of the dichorionic-diamniotic twin: a case report and literature review [^113kfFUP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) is a rare X-linked overgrowth syndrome. The main clinical manifestations are overgrowth and multiple malformations.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old Chinese woman was pregnant with dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA) twins after in-vitro fertilization. Series of ultrasound examinations indicated that the measurements (abdominal circumference and estimated foetal weight) of one twin were significantly greater than those of the other one. The genetic testing results of the larger baby indicated of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.

Conclusion

SGBS is difficult to diagnose due to different clinical manifestations. Clinicians need to be more aware of typical SGBS's clinical findings and choose genetic testing methods individually to improve its prenatal diagnosis.

### Monozygotic twins discordant for monosomy 21 detected by first-trimester nuchal translucency screening [^114PFHu5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chromosomal abnormality in one fetus of a monozygotic twin pregnancy is rare, and discussion of prenatal detection of such a case offers some insight into this clinical problem.

Case

A 28-year-old gravida 1 had ultrasound screening at 11 weeks of gestation that revealed a monochorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancy with increased nuchal translucency (7.7 mm) in one fetus. Subsequent evaluation showed one 45, XY,-21 karyotype and one normal male karyotype. The pregnancy was monozygous by DNA analysis. The affected neonate died 5 minutes after delivery of both twins by cesarean.

Conclusion

Monochorionic twins discordant for fetal abnormalities can be evaluated with molecular analysis. Study of such cases may reveal the extent to which an early diagnosis can lead to therapeutic interventions to support survival of the viable twin.

### Monozygotic dichorionic-diamniotic pregnancies following single frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer: a retrospective case series [^1153YQJQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Five thousand four hundred fifteen single blastocyst FET cycles were performed between June 2013 and December 2018 at our infertility center and 2510 (46.4%) resulted in a clinical pregnancy. From the 1510 clinical pregnancies, 43 (2.8%) were monozygotic twinning (MZT) pregnancies. 14 (0.9%) of total pregnancies were monozygotic DC-DA pregnancies which had two gestational sacs on 6–7 gestational weeks' ultrasound examination. 29 (1.9%) of total clinical pregnancies were monozygotic monochorionic pregnancies. Excluding one natural cycle FET, finally we included 13 women who were in down-regulated controlled FET or hormone replacement therapy FET (with FET cycle ultrasound documenting absence of spontaneous ovulation), in which concomitant spontaneous pregnancy could not happen. The incidence rate of monozygotic DC-DA pregnancies was 0.5% (13/2510) after single blastocyst FET.

Demographic data about these 13 patients are showed in Table 1. ART treatment information are showed in Table 2. Pregnancy outcomes are showed in Table 3. Demographic and IVF-FET cycle characteristics between monochorionic and dichorionic twining group were comparable, which was showed in Table 4. All the included thirteen patients had at least one reported risk factors associated with monozygotic twinning, including the procedure of ICSI (9/13), assisted hatching (5/13), and blastocyst transfer (13/13). PGT was performed in 5/13 patients. Figure 1 shows the initial ultrasound confirming dichorionic-diamniotic twinning at 6 to 7 weeks of gestation.

### Delayed interval delivery in a quadruplet pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^115oA4cR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Most cases reported in the available literature are DID in dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies. It is currently considered that DID is considered contraindicated in monochorionic twins because of the increased risk of chorioamnionitis and placental vascular anastomosis between the two fetuses, which may lead to severe complications in the undelivered fetus. However, there have been a few case reports of successful DID in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. Therefore, whether monochorionic is a contraindication to DID in multiple pregnancies needs further exploration and confirmation.

In our case, the quadruplet was four chorions and amniotic sacs, and the first fetus was delivered at 25 6/7 weeks of gestation. So, we performed DID on this quadruple pregnancy after the exclusion of contraindications. The second fetus was born four days later, and the third and fourth fetuses were delivered ten days later. All four infants were generally stable after neonatal treatment and the length of hospitalization was significantly shorter for the third and fourth infants, demonstrating that implementation of DID after the exclusion of contraindications effectively improves neonates' prognosis in multiple gestations.

### Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy: a report of three cases and literature review [^113ezxCQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, due to the rarity of triplet pregnancies with conjoined twins, experience with the treatment is limited. Obstetricians and ultrasound specialists must be aware of the rare complications and focus on early ultrasound diagnosis. Early antenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins and determination of chorionicity of triplet gestations are critical for individualized management options and the prognosis of the normal fetus. Expecting parents should be extensively counseled by a multidisciplinary team. Early selective termination of the conjoined twins by intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride may be a procedure in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancies to improve the perinatal outcomes of the normal fetus in triplets.

### Delivery of monochorionic twins: lessons learned from the twin birth study [^116bCtH2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The current literature regarding the recommended mode of delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins is limited to small numbers, retrospective studies, and comparisons of outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies with those of dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies instead of outcomes of trial of labor vs elective cesarean delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins.

Objective

This study aimed to compare perinatal and maternal outcomes of planned cesarean delivery and planned vaginal delivery of monochorionic-diamniotic twins using the Twin Birth Study data.

Study Design

This study is a secondary analysis of the Twin Birth Study. Women were randomized from 32 weeks and 0 days gestation to 38 weeks and 6 days gestation to planned cesarean delivery or planned vaginal delivery. Twin A in the cephalic presentation and estimated weight of each twin between 1500 and 4000 grams were the inclusion criteria. Pregnancies complicated by fetal reduction after 13 weeks of gestation, lethal fetal anomaly, or contraindication to vaginal delivery were excluded. Elective delivery was planned between 37 weeks and 5 to 7 days of gestation and 38 weeks and 6 to 7 days of gestation. Perinatal and maternal outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies were compared between those randomized for planned cesarean delivery and those randomized for planned vaginal delivery. In addition, outcomes of monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies were compared with those of dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies.

Results

Out of the 1393 women in each arm, 346 (24.9%) women in the planned cesarean delivery arm and 324 (23.3%) women in the planned vaginal delivery arm had monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies and were eligible for the first analysis. The rate of cesarean delivery was 39.2% in the planned vaginal delivery arm and was 91.3% in the planned cesarean delivery arm. There was no significant difference in gestational age at delivery between the groups (34.4 ± 1.8 weeks vs 34.5 ± 1.8 weeks; p = 0.78). No difference was found in maternal outcomes. As for perinatal outcomes, the rate of the primary adverse neonatal composite outcomes in twins A or twins B was similar in both the planned vaginal delivery and the planned cesarean delivery arms (twins A, 1.2% vs 1.2% [P = 0.92]; twins B, 1.2% vs 3.2% [P = 0.09]). Within the planned cesarean delivery arm, the rate of primary adverse neonatal composite outcome was higher in twins B than twins A (3.2% vs 1.2%; p = 0.03). There was no difference in the primary adverse neonatal composite outcome between twins A in the monochorionic-diamniotic group and the dichorionic-diamniotic group (1.2% vs 1.3%; p = 0.89) or between twins B in similar groups (2.3% vs 2.7%; p = 0.47).

Conclusion

In monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy between 32 weeks and 0 to 7 days of gestation and 38 weeks and 6 to 7 days of gestation, with twin A in a cephalic presentation, planned cesarean delivery did not decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity, as compared with planned vaginal delivery.

### Limb body wall complex complicating a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy: MRI for demonstration of fetal morphology [^111LADJP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Limb body wall complex (LBWC) is a rare, lethal malformation characterised by body wall defects, craniofacial and limb anomalies with or without various other organ anomalies. We report a case of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy discordant for LBWC, diagnosed by ultrasound (US) and confirmed by MRI at 21 weeks' gestation, managed expectantly and delivered at 35 weeks by emergency caesarean section with a favourable outcome of the unaffected twin. The anomalous twin, who died soon after birth, had a sizeable thoracoabdominal wall defect, eviscerated liver and bowel loops attached to the placenta, short cord, ectopia cordis, lung hypoplasia, kyphoscoliosis, right upper limb amelia and left clubfoot with polydactyly. MRI helps to demonstrate the fetal morphology better when there are limitations to the US due to unfavourable fetal position, multifetal gestation, maternal obesity or reduced liquor. In twin pregnancies, the management will depend on ensuring the survival of the unaffected twin.

### Guideline no. 428: management of dichorionic twin pregnancies [^115dSayS]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to management of delivery (dichorionic twins), SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support either vaginal or Cesarean delivery as a safer option in patients delivering dichorionic twins at a very preterm gestation (or estimated fetal weight < 1,500 g) or with significant (> 25%) growth discordance.

### Mode of delivery in monochorionic compared with dichorionic twin pregnancies [^112gbfjD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare mode of delivery between monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of women undergoing delivery of diamniotic twins in a single maternal-fetal medicine practice in New York City between 2005 and 2021. We compared baseline characteristics and delivery outcomes between monochorionic and dichorionic gestations. The primary outcome was mode of delivery. For monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies at or after 34 weeks of gestation, we also compared neonatal outcomes between women who did and did not attempt vaginal delivery. Data were analyzed using the χ² test, Fisher exact test, and t test when appropriate.

Results

A total of 1,121 diamniotic twin pregnancies were identified, of which 202 (18%) were monochorionic and 919 (82%) were dichorionic. Mode of delivery did not differ between monochorionic and dichorionic pregnancies, both in the overall cohort (cesarean delivery rate 61% vs 63%, P = 0.54) and in the subgroup of women who attempted vaginal delivery (cesarean delivery rate 22% vs 21%, P = 0.80). For patients with a vaginal delivery of twin A, the mode of delivery for twin B did not differ between the groups. Among the patients with monochorionic pregnancies at or after 34 weeks of gestation, neonatal outcomes did not differ between women who did and did not attempt vaginal delivery.

Conclusion

Monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies are not at an increased risk of cesarean delivery when compared with their dichorionic-diamniotic counterparts.

### Delivery of monochorionic twins in the absence of complications: analysis of neonatal outcomes and costs [^114feBnj]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to estimate the optimal time to deliver uncomplicated monochorionic-diamnionic (MCDA) twins.

Study Design

Data were retrospectively obtained from twin pregnancies from 2000 through 2009. The gestational week-specific prospective perinatal mortality risk was calculated. A cohort of MCDA twins with nonindicated deliveries was analyzed separately. Neonatal outcomes and costs were compared between MCDA twins with nonindicated deliveries born at specific weeks of gestation, and those born the subsequent week.

Results

There were 5894 dichorionic-diamnionic twins and 1704 MCDA twins. After 28 weeks, the gestational week-specific prospective risk of perinatal mortality did not differ between groups. There were 948 MCDA twins with nonindicated deliveries. Until 37 weeks, the risk of severe neonatal morbidity, perinatal mortality, and hospital costs were greater for fetuses delivered compared to fetuses born in a subsequent week.

Conclusion

To optimize neonatal outcome and decrease hospital costs, MCDA twins should not be delivered < 37 weeks unless medically indicated.

### Contemporary management of monochorionic diamniotic twins: outcomes and delivery recommendations revisited [^113Va3pM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to investigate outcomes of contemporaneously managed monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins, stratified by pregnancy complication.

Study Design

Four hundred eighteen MCDA pregnancies from 2001 through 2008 were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

There were 236 ongoing pregnancies at 24 weeks' gestation. The likelihood of progressing from 24 weeks to 2 live births was 98.7% in uncomplicated pregnancies, 89.7% with twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and 100% with growth discordance, increasing at 32 weeks to 99.5%, 93.8%, and 100%, respectively. The relative risk (RR) of birth < 32 weeks was significantly greater in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (RR, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.7–6.1) and growth discordant (RR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–3.8) pregnancies than in uncomplicated pregnancies (P < .0001).

Conclusion

This represents one of the largest cohorts of MCDA twins. The risk of third-trimester fetal loss was low. The likelihood of both intrauterine fetal demise and preterm birth were greater in complicated pregnancies. In the absence of a clinical indication for delivery, these data do not support elective preterm delivery for prevention of intrauterine fetal demise in uncomplicated MCDA twins.

### Selective feticide in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins complicated with previable premature rupture of membrane before 24 weeks may be a safe therapeutic alternative to ongoing pregnancy [^112XuRhC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, in DCDA twins complicated with PV-ROM of upper sac, selective feticide seems to be an adequate option leading to favorable obstetric outcomes compared with expectant management, since the gestational age at delivery was higher when patients underwent selective feticide. The chance of survival of both fetuses by expectant management seems to be higher if the ROM occurs in the lower sac but seems to be associated with high risk of neonatal complications. Like the multifetal reduction of high-risk multiple, selective feticide in PV-ROM represents a difficult choice of sacrificing one fetus to benefit the other. Therefore, selective feticide might be an option to be considered for DCDA twins with PV-ROM who wish to maintain pregnancy, especially in cases with ROM of the upper sac. A larger cohort studies of selective feticide for PV-ROM DCDA twins to further explore.

### Pregnancy outcomes of dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer: multifoetal pregnancy reduction versus expectant management [^116n68w9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of multifoetal pregnancies (MFPs) due to advancing maternal age, the widespread application of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the use of ovulation induction drugs. As a result of restrictions on the number of embryos transferred in women undergoing ART, a decline in MFPs has been observed in recent years. However, the splitting of one embryo into two embryos may lead to higher-order multiple pregnancies (HOMPs), including triplet pregnancies containing monochorionic (MC) twins.

Compared with singleton and twin pregnancies, HOMPs are associated with a higher risk of maternal-perinatal and long-term complications and increased hospital costs. Compared with singleton and twin pregnancies, triplet pregnancies are at a higher risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. To reduce the risks associated with triplet pregnancies and HOMPs, multifoetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) has been performed in recent years, and several methods have been described. There is ample evidence that reducing quadruplet-or-higher pregnancies to twins is associated with more favourable outcomes, including advanced gestational age (GA) at delivery. A meta-analysis showed that trichorionic triplet pregnancy reduction to a twin pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery with no significant increase in the miscarriage rate. However, data on the perinatal outcomes of women with dichorionic triamniotic (DCTA) triplet pregnancies who undergo MFPR are lacking, and two meta-analyses on this subject reported that the numbers are insufficient to recommend one technique over another or to draw clear conclusions on the perinatal outcomes of DCTA pregnancies.

The aim of this study was to investigate the pregnancy and obstetric outcomes of women with DCTA pregnancies conceived by IVF-ET that were managed expectantly or were reduced to singleton pregnancies (foetus with a separate placenta) or monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies at 11–13 + 6 gestational weeks.

### Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy: a report of three cases and literature review [^117L7yhz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Conjoined twins are a rare and serious complication of monochorionic twins. The total incidence is 1.5 per 100,000 births, and about 50% are liveborn. The survival rate of conjoined twins is low, and the prognosis is generally poor. Common triplet pregnancies are monochorionic triamniotic, trichorionic triamniotic, and dichorionic triamniotic, and only 2% are dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancies. Conjoined twins in a triplet pregnancy are rare, and the incidence is less than one in a million deliveries. Conjoined twins in a dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) triplet pregnancy are extremely rare. So far, there are only a few published articles relevant to conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies, and the majority of them are case reports. We have only found 10 cases of conjoined twins reported in DCDA triplet pregnancies.

Here, we reported three cases of conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancies, in which selective fetal reduction by intracardiac injection of potassium chloride was performed. As a result, another fetus continued to grow and develop in the uterus and was delivered at full term, which was a good pregnancy outcome. Additionally, we used a list of keywords including "conjoined twins", "triplets", "triplet pregnancy", and "multiple pregnancy" to perform an extensive Medline search and conducted a literature review in English and Chinese about conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies. Written informed consent was obtained from the couples before the procedure and manuscript publication. The treatment procedure followed ethical principles, and all data was collected from chart reviews. This study was approved by the ethical committees at the West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University.

### Twin chorionicity and the risk of stillbirth [^1144N7QK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of chorionicity on the risk of stillbirth in twins.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of all twin deliveries of at least 24 weeks of gestation at a single tertiary care center from December 2000 to May 2007. The risk of fetal death with advancing gestation was calculated for monochorionic-diamniotic twins and for dichorionic-diamniotic twins. Overall in utero survival was compared by using Kaplan-Meier analysis and a hazards ratio with 95% confidence intervals estimated to assess the degree of difference. Pregnancies affected by growth abnormalities, anomalies, or twin-twin transfusion syndrome were subsequently excluded and survival by chorionicity similarly compared within these "apparently normal" gestations.

Results

Data from 1,000 consecutive twin pairs (196 monochorionic-diamniotic twins and 804 dichorionic-diamniotic twins) were analyzed. Stillbirths occurred in seven (3.6%) monochorionic-diamniotic and nine (1.1%) dichorionic-diamniotic twin pairs. Monochorionic-diamniotic twins had a higher risk of stillbirth compared with dichorionic-diamniotic twins, both overall (log-rank P = 0.004) and at each gestational age after 24 weeks, with this risk persisting in the subset of 771 (130 monochorionic-diamniotic twins and 641 dichorionic-diamniotic twins) "apparently normal" twins (log-rank P = 0.039).

Conclusion

Monochorionicity has a negative effect on the in utero survival of twins, even among monochorionic-diamniotic twins without abnormalities.

Level Of Evidence

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^111niXQr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Twin pregnancies comprised 1.8% of all births in Ireland in 2019 and the twinning rate was 17.8 per 1,000 maternities. There has been no significant change in the rate of twin pregnancies in Ireland since 2012, however, epidemiological data from the UK and US indicate a decline in multiple pregnancies, owing to improvements in assisted reproductive therapies (ART) and the implementation of single embryo transfer policies. Despite this decline twins accounted for 32.1 per 1000 births in the US and 15.3 per 1000 births in the UK in 2019. Twin pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of maternal complications such as hypertensive disorders, and they contribute to an increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, thereby causing significant resource implications for both healthcare providers and maternity services. Given the increased risk associated with twin pregnancies, there is a need for evidenced-based and up-to-date recommendations for clinical care.

One of the most important factors influencing perinatal outcomes of twin pregnancies is chorionicity. Twin pregnancies can be dichorionic (70%) or monochorionic (30%), and should be managed differently according to this. Monochorionic twin pregnancies have a higher rate of perinatal morbidity and mortality compared to dichorionic twin pregnancies, due to the presence of vascular anastomoses, resulting in specific conditions such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Monochorionic twin pregnancies are also associated with higher rates of preterm birth and low birthweight. In recognition of these risk factors, specific monochorionic international clinical practice guidelines exist for their management. Dichorionic twin pregnancies have an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity compared to singleton pregnancies, which is largely attributed to increased rates of fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies. Therefore, increased fetal surveillance and recognition of risk factors is also warranted in these pregnancies. This systematic review focuses on dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies as they are high risk pregnancies compared to singletons, no guideline, to our knowledge, focuses solely on DCDA twin pregnancies, despite being the most prevalent type, and existing research supports the management of twin pregnancies according to chorionicity.

### Prevalence of common aneuploidy in twin pregnancies [^116o59BK]. Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The study cohort included 120,927 deliveries from 57 facilities across Japan, among which 4921 (4.1%) were twin pregnancies. A total of 114 cases were excluded from the analysis, of which 68 cases were of MM twins and of unknown chorionicity, 22 cases were of ovum donation, 8 cases were of unknown age at the time of ovum collection, 5 cases were of vanishing twins, and 11 cases were of reduced fetuses. Of the 4807 included twin pregnancies, 2899 (60.3%) were DD twins and 1908 (39.7%) were MD twins (Fig. 1).

### A long-term competent chimeric immune system in a dizygotic dichorionic twin [^1136ukY9]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

We present here a rare case that involved the long-term coexistence of 2 mature, functional, and equilibrated immune systems in a single child after fetofetal transfusion between dizygotic twins. A dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy complicated by twin anemia-polycythemia sequence resulted in the demise of 1 twin. The detection of abnormal vessels on the dichorionic plate strongly suggested the existence of functional vascular anastomoses leading to blood chimerism in the survivor. Genetic, phenotypic, and immunologic analyses at 2 years revealed chimeric lymphoid and myeloid cells in the surviving twin, although no tissue mosaicism was detected, which indicates that early transfusion led to mutual immune tolerance.

### Mode of birth in monochorionic versus dichorionic twin pregnancies: a retrospective study from a large tertiary centre in Germany [^113RqA3Z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal mode of birth for twins, in particular monochorionic twins, has been the subject of much debate. This retrospective study compared maternal and newborn outcomes after vaginal birth in monochorionic and dichorionic twins, utilizing a large institutional database.

Methods

Retrospective analysis focusing on 98 monochorionic-diamniotic (MC-DA) and 540 dichorionic-diamniotic (DC-DA) twin births extracted from the perinatal database of a large German hospital. Pregnancies ≥ 36weeks of gestation with two viable foetuses born between 2004 and 2014 divided into planned vaginal and planned caesarean delivery were included. Descriptive analysis was performed for maternal characteristics. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidences intervals (CI) tested the predictive effect of vaginal birth on neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Results

51.0% MC-DA and 46.7% DC-DA twin pregnancies were planned vaginal births and 44.0% MC-DA mothers and 43.7% DC-DA mothers actually gave birth vaginally. The overall rate of caesarean section (CS) during the years under observation was 79.6% for MC-DA and 77.0% for DC-DA pregnancies. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcome between the subsamples, although acidosis was observed more often in the second DC-DA twin and Apgar scores < 7 were observed more often in MC-DA twins.

Conclusion

Vaginal birth may be recommended as an option to women with monochorionic twins as no significant differences in outcomes were found between MC-DA and DC-DA twins. However, over half of planned vaginal twin births resulted in CS.

### Screening for preterm birth in twin pregnancies [^113gCDX5]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Twins represent 3.2% of all live births. However, they account for 20% of all preterm deliveries, with 60% delivered before 37 weeks and 10.7% before 32 weeks of gestation. Twin pregnancies have a 5 times higher risk of early neonatal and infant death related to prematurity. Monochorionic twins have a higher incidence of both indicated and spontaneous preterm delivery than dichorionic twins. Additional risk factors include a history of preterm delivery and cervical surgery. The transvaginal cervical length before 24 weeks is the best factor to predict preterm birth, independent of other risk factors.

### Difference in nuchal translucency between monozygotic and dizygotic spontaneously conceived twins [^1133oczc]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess nuchal translucency (NT) thickness and differences in inter-twin NT thickness among naturally conceived monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

Methods

Enrolled women prospectively underwent NT measurement for both twins between 11 and 14 weeks of gestational age. NT thickness and inter-twin NT difference were recorded and compared among dizygotic twins, monozygotic dichorionic twins, and monozygotic monochorionic twins.

Results

This study obtained analyzable data for 174 monozygotic twins and 107 dizygotic twins. Of the 174 monozygotic twins, 105 were monochorionic, and 69 were dichorionic. Monozygotic monochorionic twin pregnancies had a significantly higher mean fetal NT thickness (1.48 ± 0.62 mm) than either dizygotic twin pregnancies (1.34 ± 0.50 mm) or monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies (1.31 ± 0.48 mm). Mean inter-twin NT difference was significantly lower in monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies (0.37 ± 0.19 mm) than in dizygotic twin pregnancies (0.57 ± 0.22 mm) or monochorionic twin pregnancies (0.65 ± 0.43 mm). Irrespective of twin zygosity, NT thickness and inter-twin NT difference were larger in monochorionic twins than in dichorionic twins (1.48 ± 0.62 mm versus 1.33 ± 0.49 mm, and 0.65 ± 0.43 mm versus 0.49 ± 0.23 mm, respectively).

Conclusion

During first-trimester ultrasonographic screening for Down syndrome, monochorionic twin pregnancies have the greatest NT thickness and monozygotic dichorionic twin pregnancies have the lowest inter-twin NT difference.

### Guideline no. 428: management of dichorionic twin pregnancies [^115xdZnj]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to management of delivery (dichorionic twins), SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to offer vaginal delivery when the first twin is presenting cephalic and is not significantly smaller than the second twin and when a care provider skilled in managing labor and delivery of a second twin with a non-cephalic presentation is available, regardless of the presentation of the second twin.

### Fetal intervention for complications of monochorionic twinning [^111KrYqi]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

All multiple gestation pregnancies have a significantly higher risk of fetal morbidity and mortality than singleton pregnancies. The risks become progressively greater as the number of fetuses increases. Among twin pregnancies, there is a greater danger of an adverse outcome when the twins share a single placenta (monochorionic), than if each has a separate placenta (dichorionic). A still greater danger exists when monochorionic twins also share a single amniotic sac. Fetal surgical interventions now exist to treat many of the complications associated with twin gestation pregnancies.

### Prenatal diagnosis of spontaneous septostomy in dichorionic diamniotic twins and review of the literature [^113MqE3Z]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We present 2 cases of spontaneous septostomy in dichorionic diamniotic twins and review the literature regarding the incidence, etiology, and complications of this condition.

Methods

The following key words were used in the literature search: "rupture dividing membrane twin", "disruption dividing membrane twin", "pseudomonoamniotic twin", "spontaneous septostomy twin", "interfetal membrane disruption", "intertwin membrane rupture", and "intertwin membrane disruption".

Results

We present 2 cases in which an intertwin membrane defect was found prenatally in dichorionic diamniotic twins. In both cases, a portion of one twin's body was found traversing the spontaneous septostomy and in the sac of its cotwin. Umbilical cord Doppler studies showed no abnormalities in either case as the cord crossed the membrane disruption. In both cases, the fetuses had no notable sequelae from the ruptured intertwin membrane. The literature review revealed no cases of spontaneous septostomy in dichorionic diamniotic twins but 15 cases in monochorionic diamniotic twins. Possible etiologies include chorioamnionitis, trauma or physical rupture by the fetuses, developmental disturbances represented by amniotic plica, and polyhydramnios. In cases of monozygotic twins, a vascular etiology could explain this rare defect with formation of anastomoses of the outer embryonic vasculature. Complications of the spontaneous septostomy cases identified in the literature included cord entanglement (8 cases), preterm delivery (9 cases), and death (8 cases), although our 2 cases had minimal complications.

Conclusions

Spontaneous septostomy in dichorionic diamniotic twins has not previously been reported.

### Safety of vaginal delivery among dichorionic diamniotic twins over 10 years in a UK teaching hospital [^116nRZdu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether vaginal delivery among dichorionic diamniotic twins remains a safe option following full implementation of the European Working Time Directive in the UK.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted using data for women with dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies who attended a teaching hospital in London, UK, for delivery between January 4, 2000, and December 23, 2010.

Results

Among 892 women, 474 (53.1%) attempted vaginal delivery, 220 (46.4%) of whom achieved spontaneous vaginal delivery of both twins. Instrumental vaginal delivery was performed among 89 women (18.8%), and 165 (34.8%) women underwent emergency cesarean delivery. Delivery of the second twin by emergency cesarean (n = 31) was predominantly for fetal distress (13 [41.9%]) or abnormal lie (10 [32.3%]). A 5-minute Apgar score of 9 or 10 was recorded for 384 (83.7%) of 459 first twins and 369 (82.9%) of 445 second twins, irrespective of the mode of delivery.

Conclusion

Vaginal delivery among dichorionic diamniotic twins had a good success rate and a low intrapartum emergency cesarean delivery rate. Training in cardiotocography and intrapartum procedures might further reduce the need for emergency cesarean delivery.

### Monochorionic diamniotic twins: what do I tell the prospective parents? [^116NaSvP]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Monochorionic diamniotic twins occur in about 1 in 300 pregnancies. Compared with dichorionic twins, they face increased risks because of the shared circulation. In about 15%, an imbalance in blood exchange occurs, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome and twin anemia polycythemia sequence. In this review, we summarize the latest evidence on the management of monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies and their specific complications, with a focus on information that is relevant for prospective parents.

### Prenatal diagnosis in twin gestations [^116DFMq9]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Twin gestations face an increased risk of structural abnormalities compared with singleton gestations, as well as an increased risk of aneuploidy. Accordingly, there is a need for accurate prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic disorders and structural anomalies in twin gestations. Given the increased risk of congenital anomalies, a detailed sonographic survey of fetal anatomy is recommended in the early second trimester of twin gestations. In addition, fetal echocardiography should be considered in monochorionic twin gestations and in dichorionic twin pregnancies conceived using assisted reproductive technologies given the increased risk of congenital heart disease in these populations. Although first- and second-trimester aneuploidy screening in twin gestations is available, screening is less accurate than in singleton gestations. Invasive prenatal diagnosis in twin pregnancies is associated with a risk of pregnancy loss that is higher than the baseline risk of loss among twin gestations. Precise procedure-related loss rates in twin gestations undergoing chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, however, remain unclear because of methodological differences between published studies investigating diagnostic procedures in twins.

### The sonographic diagnosis of chorionicity [^111L3Hg3]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

The differentiation between mono- and dichorionic placentation in twin pregnancies is of clinical importance because of the significant difference in perinatal morbidity and mortality between the two, and the increased surveillance indicated in monochorionic gestations. Application of ultrasonography has enabled very precise prenatal determination of chorionicity. While this is best performed in the first trimester when accuracy approaches 100%, even in the third trimester, using a composite cascade of available sonographic features, accuracy has been reported to approach 97%. While two clearly separate placentae or discordant fetal gender conform to dichorionicity, in most twin pregnancies other features need to be assessed to determine chorionicity. The presence of the 'lambda' or the 'T' sign in the presence of a single placenta, best determined in the first trimester, is the most reliable indicator of chorionicity, with measurements of the inter-twin membrane thickness and counting of the membrane layers being less reliable. In this article, we review the sonographic features that help in the accurate depiction of chorionicity.

### Ultrasound diagnosis of first trimester umbilical cord entanglement in monochorionic monoamniotic twins-case report and review of the literature [^111Jf9Fb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twin pregnancy occurs when more than one fetus shares a single placenta and a single amniotic cavity. It results from a single fertilized egg and embryo splitting between 9 and 13 days after fertilization. It is a rare event, with an estimated incidence of 8 per 100,000 pregnancies, constituting approximately 1% of all twin pregnancies and approximately 5% of all monochorionic pregnancies.

The pregnancies of MCMA twins are associated with significantly increased complication rates compared to dichorionic or monochorionic diamniotic pregnancies. The risk of congenital anomalies in MCMA twins ranges between 15% and 25%, with a predominance of cardiac anomalies accounting for approximately one-third of all anomalies observed. The high incidence of anomalies is explained by the delayed splitting of the embryo and hemodynamic fluctuations through extensive placental anastomoses.

MCMA twin pregnancy presents an enormous challenge following its accurate diagnosis, where the absence of an intertwin membrane results in a consistently fluctuating fetal position. This results in an almost impossible task to label each of the two specific fetuses to provide continuity in assessments, especially in the absence of discordant growth or anomalies. Although only 2–4% of MCMA twin pregnancies will develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, it is hard to diagnose since, in this case, the typical combination of oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios is not present. The rate of preterm labor is high, and over 55% of all MCMA pregnancies will deliver before 34 W.

The fetal loss in MCMA twins is high, reaching 30–40%. Most fetal deaths occur in the first and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy. Nevertheless, even after 24 weeks gestation, the risk of fetal death is nine times higher in MCMA twin pregnancies (9%) than in dichorionic twin pregnancies (1%). In a prospective observational study of 18 MCMA pregnancies, the overall perinatal loss after excluding conjoined twins, twin reversed arterial perfusion, and twins with discordant anomalies - was 11.1% after 16 weeks and 5.9% after 20 weeks of gestation. When fetal death occurs in MCMA twin pregnancies, both twins usually die. 80% of pregnancies complicated by spontaneous fetal death have a double death, whereas 20% involve a single death. In the presence of a single death, the risk of severe brain injury to the surviving twin is very high (57%).

### Does chorionicity or zygosity predict adverse perinatal outcomes in twins? [^117UAdzf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate chorionicity and zygosity as risk factors for adverse perinatal outcomes in twins.

Study Design

A population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted of all twin deliveries in Nova Scotia, Canada, from 1988 to 1997. Chorionicity was established by histologic examination. Zygosity was determined by chorionicity, sex, and infant blood group. Three groups were established: monochorionic/monozygotic twins, dichorionic/dizygotic twins, and dichorionic/majority monozygotic twins.

Results

Outcomes from 1008 twin pregnancies were analyzed. Monochorionic/monozygotic twins had lower mean birth weights compared with dichorionic/dizygotic twins. Rates of perinatal mortality of at least 1 twin were significantly higher among monochorionic/monozygotic twins relative to dichorionic/dizygotic twins (relative risk, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Dichorionic/majority monozygotic twins had similar perinatal outcomes compared with dichorionic/dizygotic twins.

Conclusion

Monochorionicity increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcome, whereas the effect of zygosity is less clear. Because chorionicity can be determined by prenatal ultrasound scanning, this information should be considered in the prenatal care of twin pregnancies.

### Ankyloglossia in monochorionic diamniotic and dichorionic diamniotic twins: a cross-sectional study [^117DDSfM]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of ankyloglossia in diamniotic monochorionic and diamniotic dichorionic twins, as well as to verify the relationship between gender and type of pregnancy. Study Design: A cross-sectional observational study, carried out with 52 pairs of dichorionic/diamniotic twins and 49 monochorionic/diamniotic pairs. The data collection was carried out through the analysis of medical records and the results of the Neonatal Screening of the Tongue Frenulum Assessment Protocol in Babies, and corresponded to the period of 2 years (2020–2022). Statistical analysis of data was performed, considering the significance value of 5%. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the institution. Results: The statistical analysis of multiple logistic regression between the two groups of twins (Mono/Di and Di/Di) according to the socioeconomic, demographic, and clinical-epidemiological profile was statistically significant for some variables. The prevalence of ankyloglossia, according to the type of twin pregnancy, showed a statistically significant difference. There was no statistical difference in relation to sex and ankyloglossia, or between couples diagnosed with ankyloglossia according to the type of pregnancy. Conclusion: Monochorionic/diamniotic twins had a higher prevalence of ankyloglossia, regardless of gender.

### Repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins following assisted reproduction: a case report and literature review [^115SSUzL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Dichorionic triplets were diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound, two gestational sacs (GSs, red arrowhead) and three germs (green arrowhead) were detected inside the uterus. A) Ultrasound image of first pregnancy at 5 weeks post-transfer. B) Ultrasound image of second pregnancy on day 37 post-transfer

When China's two-child policy was loosened, the patient requested a frozen embryo transfer when she was 33 years old. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was used in the first frozen cycle. A single blastocyst (Gardner's classification: 4AA) was transferred, and the transfer failed. During the next cycle, two day 6 embryos (Gardner's classification: 4CB*2) was transferred, but the transfer failed again. The woman successfully conceived in the following cycle after two cleavage embryos (8 cells grade 2 and 9 cells grade 2) were transferred. We first suspected dizygotic twins, as two gestational sacs (GSs) was detected with transvaginal US on day 30 post-transfer. However, the US showed two GSs with three fetuses one week later, and another dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy was suspected (Fig. 1 B). The heartbeat of one of the monozygotic twins stopped suddenly on day 43 post-transfer, resulting in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. Two healthy boys were delivered by emergency caesarean section at 35 weeks and 2 days of gestation due to premature rupture of membrane (PROM). Their birth weight and Apgar scores at 1 min and 5 min were 1900 g, 9–10 and 2800 g, 10–10, respectively. The lighter baby was sent to the neonatal care unit and was discharged 3 weeks after birth.

### Dichorionic pregnancy complicated by a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome [^114FH7DT]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a serious complication typical of monochorionic pregnancies. Cases in dichorionic pregnancies have been described. The authors present a case report of a presumed TTTS in a dichorionic pregnancy followed at our institution in which the patient presented to the emergency department at 31 4/7 weeks' gestation complaining of lack of fetal movements. Both fetuses did not show any cardiac activity. On the first twin, an oligohydramnios was present and his bladder was not visualised and, on the second twin, a polyhydramnios and an augmented bladder were visualised. Pathological findings of the fetuses were compatible with a diagnosis of TTTS and placental study confirmed the presence of a dichorionic/diamniotic placenta, with superficial vessels crossing the dividing membrane.

### Identical twins carry a persistent epigenetic signature of early genome programming [^112VfJNH]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We next compared DNA methylation in buccal cells from dichorionic MZ twins (believed to be the earliest splitting type of identical twinning representing 1/3 of all MZ twins), monochorionic diamniotic MZ twins (the most common form of MZ twins representing 2/3 of all cases) and last, monochorionic monoamniotic MZ twins (who represent less than 1% of MZ twins and are believed to represent a late splitting event). It has been hypothesized that dichorionic MZ twins result from separation soon after fertilization, whereas monochorionic twins result from separation ≥ 3 days after fertilization(Fig. 2b). Data on chorionicity were obtained by linking data from the NTR child cohort to the Pathological Anatomy National Automatic Archive of the Netherlands (PALGA) database and biobank. Of the 834 MZ-DMPs, 833 were present in the methylation data set from children. Twin correlations were largest, on average, in MZ monochorionic monoamniotic twins (mean r = 0.57, N = 14 pairs), followed by monochorionic diamniotic twins (mean r = 0.45, N = 101 pairs), and MZ dichorionic twins (mean r = 0.41, N = 69 pairs; Fig. 2c), in contrast to all genome-wide methylation sites, which did not show this differential pattern (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. S11). The distributions of the correlations illustrate that the relatively small mean differences are driven by a subset of CpGs that have a larger correlation in monochorionic (especially monochorionic monoamniotic) MZ twins (Fig. 2c). Among CpGs with the most distinctive pattern of monochorionic versus dichorionic twin correlations (Fig. 2e) are multiple CpGs in the protocadherin (PCDH) superfamily gene clusters on chromosome 5q31 and multiple CpGs in KCNE1; a potassium channel involved in cardiac QT interval.

### Expectant management versus selective fetal reduction in dichorionic-diamniotic twins following mid-trimester, preterm premature rupture of membranes in one twin: review of literature and meta analysis [^1141AFQA]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes following selective fetal reduction versus expectant management in dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies complicated by mid-trimester preterm premature rupture of membranes in one sac.

Data Sources

A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus was conducted through March 2025.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Included studies were observational (case series or cohort studies) comparing selective fetal reduction versus expectant management in twin pregnancies with mid-trimester preterm premature rupture of membranes (prior to 24+0 weeks). Only studies reporting relevant maternal or neonatal outcomes were included.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed using random- or fixed-effects models based on heterogeneity. Outcomes included perinatal survival, neonatal survival, latency period, gestational age at delivery, delivery ≥ 32 weeks, and other maternal and neonatal complications.

Results

Five retrospective studies met eligibility criteria, and four were included in the meta-analysis. Neonatal survival was higher with selective fetal reduction (74% vs. 69%), though not statistically significant (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 0.96–4.25). Perinatal survival was significantly lower with selective fetal reduction (33% vs. 69%), when the reduced fetuses were included (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.19–0.8). Selective fetal reduction significantly increased odds of delivery ≥ 32 weeks (67.4% vs. 11.3%; OR = 15.34, 95% CI = 3.86–61.03). Latency and mean gestational age at delivery trended higher in the reduction group but did not reach statistical significance. Maternal and neonatal complications - including chorioamnionitis, cesarean delivery and respiratory morbidity - were less frequent following selective reduction, except for pulmonary hypoplasia, which was higher.

Conclusions

Selective fetal reduction after mid-trimester rupture in one sac of dichorionic-diamniotic twins increases the likelihood of delivery ≥ 32 weeks. Although most other outcome differences were not significant, these findings suggest that fetal reduction may be an alternative to expectant management when termination of the entire pregnancy is not optional.

### Guideline no. 440: management of monochorionic twin pregnancies [^116UCAxc]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to determination of chorionicity and amnionicity, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to be cautious not to misdiagnose monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies as monoamniotic when one twin has anhydramnios (such as the donor in twin-twin transfusion syndrome).

### Guideline no. 428: management of dichorionic twin pregnancies [^112sLZWs]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to management of delivery (dichorionic twins), SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to include a discussion of vaginal, Cesarean, and combined delivery in the informed consent for the mode of delivery of twins. Recognize that planned vaginal delivery carries no increased risk compared with planned Cesarean delivery.

### Successful monozygotic triplet pregnancy after a single blastocyst transfer following in vitro maturation of oocytes from a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome: a case report [^1141m9em]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Here, we describe a case of a triplet pregnancy from a SET following IVM with a successful delivery at 33 weeks. This triplet pregnancy was considered dichorionic derived from monozygotic embryos following IVM. This patient was diagnosed with anovulatory PCOS, and therefore, a concurrent spontaneous pregnancy at the same time as SET was not considered. Therefore, this pregnancy was considered monozygotic triplets and, moreover, the gender was the same female. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a successful delivery of monozygotic triplets after SET following IVM.

A dichorionic twins occurs when an embryo splits until 3 days after fertilization and a monochorionic twins occurs when an embryo splits 4–8 days after fertilization. These phenomena are speculated based on natural pregnancy. In the ART treatment cycles, dichorionic twins originated from SET have been reported. This does not fit the theory of embryo splitting timing and forming monozygotic dichorionic twins. In the present case, none of the embryo split was observed at the time of transfer 5 days after fertilization. There is a possibility that the embryo split after the transfer and became a dichorionic triamniotic triplet.

### Sonographic diagnosis of conjoined diamniotic monochorionic twins [^112WQJ1a]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

According to traditional theories for the pathogenesis of conjoined twins, diamniotic placentation should not occur. We present an unusual case with diamniotic/monochorionic conjoined twins and discuss possible etiologic hypotheses. The diagnosis of this improbable case was made in the first trimester using ultrasound, which assisted in making an early decision regarding further management.

### Repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins following assisted reproduction: a case report and literature review [^1169m3VX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many studies have demonstrated that an increased risk of monozygotic twins(MZT) was associated with assisted reproductive techniques(ART) procedures. According to published studies, the incidence of MZT after ART varies from 1.57 to 13.2% compared with the natural conception rate of 0.4%. There are three types of monozygotic: dichorionic-diamniotic, monochorionic-diamniotic and monochorionic-monoamniotic. Monochorionic twin occupies most of the proportion of the incidence in monozygotic twinning. It is well-known that monochorionic twins are at high risk of maternal and fetal complications, including low birthweight, preterm birth, twin-twin transfusion syndrome(TTTS), umbilical cord accidents and perinatal mortality. Regarding dichorionic triplets pregnancy, the rate was only 0.004% among all the pregnancies, as previously reported. Here, we describe a rare case of repeated triplet pregnancy complicated by a monochorionic diamniotic twin in a patient after assisted reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report of this kind. This case highlights the risk factors and obstetric outcomes of dichorionic triplets.

### Management of monochorionic twin pregnancy green-top guideline no. 51 (2024 partial update) [^114v9ySw]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to general counseling, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to inform patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies that they have higher fetal loss rates (miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death) compared with dichorionic twin pregnancies and, overall, may have a higher risk of associated neurodevelopmental morbidity.

### Prospective risk of stillbirth and neonatal complications in twin pregnancies: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LDuhK]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the risks of stillbirth and neonatal complications by gestational age in uncomplicated monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases (until December 2015).

Review Methods

Databases were searched without language restrictions for studies of women with uncomplicated twin pregnancies that reported rates of stillbirth and neonatal outcomes at various gestational ages. Pregnancies with unclear chorionicity, monoamnionicity, and twin to twin transfusion syndrome were excluded. Meta-analyses of observational studies and cohorts nested within randomised studies were undertaken. Prospective risk of stillbirth was computed for each study at a given week of gestation and compared with the risk of neonatal death among deliveries in the same week. Gestational age specific differences in risk were estimated for stillbirths and neonatal deaths in monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies after 34 weeks' gestation.

Results

32 studies (29685 dichorionic, 5486 monochorionic pregnancies) were included. In dichorionic twin pregnancies beyond 34 weeks (15 studies, 17830 pregnancies), the prospective weekly risk of stillbirths from expectant management and the risk of neonatal death from delivery were balanced at 37 weeks' gestation (risk difference 1.2/1000, 95% confidence interval -1.3 to 3.6; I² = 0%). Delay in delivery by a week (to 38 weeks) led to an additional 8.8 perinatal deaths per 1000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval 3.6 to 14.0/1000; I² = 0%) compared with the previous week. In monochorionic pregnancies beyond 34 weeks (13 studies, 2149 pregnancies), there was a trend towards an increase in stillbirths compared with neonatal deaths after 36 weeks, with an additional 2.5 per 1000 perinatal deaths, which was not significant (-12.4 to 17.4/1000; I² = 0%). The rates of neonatal morbidity showed a consistent reduction with increasing gestational age in monochorionic and dichorionic pregnancies, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was the commonest neonatal complication. The actual risk of stillbirth near term might be higher than reported estimates because of the policy of planned delivery in twin pregnancies.

Conclusions

To minimise perinatal deaths, in uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies delivery should be considered at 37 weeks' gestation; in monochorionic pregnancies delivery should be considered at 36 weeks.

### Perinatal outcome, placental pathology, and severity of discordance in monochorionic and dichorionic twins [^113AFNcX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate differences in pregnancy outcomes and placental findings among severely discordant monochorionic and dichorionic twins.

Methods

We studied retrospectively a cohort of 382 twin pregnancies with gestational ages that ranged from 24 to 40 weeks. Pregnancies were classified as dichorionic or monochorionic by histologic examination of placentas. Infants were subdivided into concordant (less than 5% difference in birth weight), mildly discordant (5–25% difference), and severely discordant groups (more than 25% difference), and their clinical characteristics and findings at placental examination were analyzed and compared.

Results

Severe discordance occurred significantly more often in monochorionic than in dichorionic twins and was associated with significantly more deliveries before 36 weeks and more newborns remaining more than 10 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Severely discordant monochorionic and dichorionic twins had significantly worse perinatal mortality and morbidity than mildly discordant and concordant twins. The weight of the placenta of the smaller fetus in severely discordant dichorionic twins with separate placentas and the total placental weight in severely discordant monochorionic twins were significantly smaller than the weights of the placentas in their concordant and mildly discordant counterparts. The umbilical cords of the smaller fetuses in both dichorionic and monochorionic pregnancies exhibited significantly more velamentous insertions and single umbilical arteries than in concordant or mildly discordant twins of similar chorionicity.

Conclusion

Severe discordance is more frequent and has greater morbidity in monochorionic than dichorionic twins. The most frequent findings in the placentas of severely discordant twins were small placental weight and umbilical cord abnormalities.

### Influence of chorionicity on the heritability estimates of blood pressure: a study in twins [^112C3upz]. Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A basic assumption of the twin design is that environmental influences including prenatal experiences are equal across twin types. However, the intra-uterine environment may differ according to the chorionicity of the monozygotic twins, which may have biased previous heritability estimates of blood pressure.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to assess whether the heritability of blood pressure, derived from measurements in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, differs according to the chorionicity of the monozygotic twins.

Methods

Conventional and 24-h ambulatory blood pressures were measured in 125 dizygotic twin pairs and in 97 dichorionic and 128 monochorionic monozygotic twin pairs at the age of 18–34 years. The twin sample was drawn from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey, in which perinatal data were collected at birth. Intra-pair correlation coefficients were calculated and compared between both types of monozygotic twin pairs. Heritability was estimated from model-fitting and path analysis, based on the dizygotic twins and, respectively, all monozygotic twins and the two subtypes.

Results

Intra-pair correlation coefficients for the various blood pressures, after adjustment for body mass index, ranged from 0.45 to 0.71 in the monozygotic twin pairs and did not differ significantly according to chorionicity. Heritability estimates of blood pressure were between 52 and 64%, and were similar when calculated from dizygotic twins and, respectively, dichorionic and monochorionic monozygotic twins.

Conclusions

Heritability estimates of conventional and ambulatory blood pressure do not differ significantly according to the chorionicity of the monozygotic twins.

### Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy: a report of three cases and literature review [^116kxbNM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Conjoined twins are a rare and serious complication of monochorionic twins. The total incidence is 1.5 per 100,000 births, and about 50% are liveborn. Prenatal screening and diagnosis of conjoined twins is usually performed by ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assist in the diagnosis if necessary. Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy are extremely rare.

Case presentation

We reported three cases of dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy with conjoined twins. Due to the poor prognosis of conjoined twins evaluated by multidisciplinary teams, selective termination of conjoined twins was performed in three cases. In case 1, selective reduction of the conjoined twins was performed at 16 gestational weeks, and a healthy female baby weighing 3270 g was delivered at 37 weeks. In case 2, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 17 weeks of gestation, and a healthy female baby weighing 2760 g was delivered at 37 weeks and 4 days. In case 3, the conjoined twins were selectively terminated at 15 weeks and 2 days, and a healthy female baby weighing 2450 g was delivered at 33 weeks and 6 days. The babies of all three cases were followed up and are in good health.

Conclusion(s)

Surgical separation is the only treatment for conjoined twins after birth. Early determination of chorionicity and antenatal diagnosis of conjoined twins in triplet gestations are critical for individualized management options and the prognosis of normal triplets. Expecting parents should be extensively counseled by multidisciplinary teams. If there are limitations in successful separation after birth, early selective termination of the conjoined twins by intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride may be a procedure in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy to improve perinatal outcomes of the normal triplet.

### Prenatal diagnosis and management of fetal discordant α-thalassaemia in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins [^113vuWrQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Twin pregnancies have a higher risk of having a child with a genetic disease than singleton pregnancies, especially in a dizygotic twin gestation. Zygosity can be surmised in most cases by determination of chorionicity and amnionicity by ultrasonography in the first trimester or before 16 weeks of gestation. Monochorionic twins are almost always monozygotic while the majority (90%) of dichorionic twins are dizygotic. Thus, the genetic makeup of dichorionic twins can differ and invasive prenatal diagnosis must be performed from each sac separately, resulting in increased procedure-related pregnancy loss rate compared with that in singleton pregnancies. Several studies have reported the procedure-related pregnancy loss in twins to be 2%–5%.

Compared with singleton pregnancies, the risk of at least one fetus being affected with severe thalassaemia in a dizygotic twin pregnancy is about double and this information should be given to the couple at risk along with the risk of invasive procedure during the counselling. Furthermore, the couple should be made aware of possible situations of prenatal diagnosis result so that they can make a proper decision about the whole process or consider in advance regarding options after the result becomes available. In other words, they should be informed about options for the following situations: (1) neither fetus is affected, (2) both fetuses are affected and (3) only one fetus is affected. The last situation can cause a dilemma in decision-making. If pregnancy is continued, they have to prepare for an affected child and the condition puts the woman at risk of mirror syndrome or pre-eclampsia and postpartum haemorrhage. If pregnancy is disrupted, the unaffected fetus would be terminated as well.

### Grade and looseness of the inner cell mass may lead to the development of monochorionic diamniotic twins [^1139GbTv]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship between the inner cell mass (ICM) grade and its morphological configuration on the occurrence of monochorionic diamniotic (M-D) twinning.

Design

Retrospective embryo cohort study.

Setting

Private IVF clinic.

Patient(S)

Evaluation of frozen-thawed single blastocyst transfers with hormone replacement treatment in 8,435. This cohort included 71 blastocysts and their ICMs observed by time-lapse photography.

Intervention(S)

Any changes in configuration of the ICMs observed by time-lapse photography were analyzed retrospectively.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The amount of loosening of blastomeres within the ICM was evaluated by time-lapse observations. The number of cells that were involved in the loosening process was also assessed. Both of these parameters were correlated with the type of monozygotic twinning that eventuated.

Result(S)

The M-D twinning incidence resulting from blastocysts with a high grade ICM (grade A) were transferred was 0.38% (3/796), whereas it was significantly higher, 1.38% (34/2,463), when blastocysts with a poorer (B and C) grade ICM were transferred. Among 71 transferred frozen-thawed blastocysts that were studied with time-lapse photography, there were two dichorionic diamniotic and one M-D twins. Careful observations of the embryo that resulted in the one M-D case, revealed that the ICM acquired a looser appearance due to decompaction of at least eight cells. This type of decompaction was not observed in the ICMs of other transferred blastocysts.

Conclusion(S)

The occurrence of M-D twinning may be avoided by excluding blastocysts that contain decompacting ICMs.

### Multifetal gestations and associated perinatal risks [^116x6M5Q]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with the rise of assisted reproductive technology, multifetal gestations increased dramatically. Twin pregnancies account for 97% of multifetal pregnancies and 3% of all births in the United States. Twins and higher-order multiples carry increased risks of obstetric, perinatal, and maternal complications; these risks increase with increasing fetal number. Neonatal morbidity and mortality in multifetal gestations is driven primarily by prematurity. Both spontaneous and indicated preterm births are increased in multifetal gestations, and only a limited number of strategies are available to mitigate this risk. No single intervention has been shown to decrease the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in most twin pregnancies. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is recommended in all multifetal pregnancies to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its associated complications. Antenatal management of multifetal gestations depends on chorionicity, which should be established using ultrasonography in the first trimester. Unlike dichorionic twin gestations, monochorionic pregnancies experience unique complications because of their shared vascular connections, and therefore, need frequent ultrasound surveillance. Even uncomplicated twin gestations have higher rates of unanticipated stillbirth compared with singletons. Delivery of twin pregnancies is generally indicated in the late preterm to early term period depending on chorionicity and other clinical factors. For most diamniotic twin pregnancies with a cephalic presenting fetus, vaginal delivery after 32 weeks' gestation is a safe and reasonable option with high rates of success and no increased risk of perinatal morbidity.

### Twin pregnancy complicated with congenital hemivertebra: report of two cases and literature review [^111R4PLN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, the globally published papers in English related to twin pregnancy with the hemivertebrae number only 4 so far. It has been found that in twin pregnancy, even in identical twins, if one fetus has congenital scoliosis, the other one can be normal. However, there is no consensus on the perinatal management of twin pregnancies with hemivertebrae.

Sturm P. F. et al. reported a case of monozygotic twins who both suffered from hemivertebrae with no other deformity. These twins were first evaluated for their spinal anomalies at age 11 months; however, both twins showed minimal progression of their spinal curves within two years of follow-up. Benacerraf B. R. et al. reported two cases of twin pregnancies affected by hemivertebrae. One case delivered one hemivertebrae newborn and one healthy newborn. However, the other case was a blighted twin and only a single fetus with hemivertebrae was alive. Weisz B, et al. reported two cases of DCDA twin pregnancies with one hemivertebrae fetus and one healthy fetus. Among these two cases, one case chose selective termination, and the other case delivered two living newborns without any neurological deficits within a 24 month follow up. Kaspiris A, et al. reported a case where both twins had hemivertebrae, with congenital scoliosis, moderate mental retardation, and dyslalia. Detailed information of these cases is shown in Table 1.

Table 1
The character of the included study

# NS Not specified, Th Thoracic, L Lumbar, PROM Premature rupture of membranes, DCDA Dichorionic diamniotic, MCDA Monochorionic diamniotic, MCMA Monochorionic monoamniotic, CS Cesarean section, VD Vaginal delivery, ART Assisted reproductive technology, GDM Gestational diabetes mellitus

From the above-published results and our center's experience, we can see that all of these hemivertebrae cases were alive after birth except when the parents chose selective termination, and some had deformation of the spine; however, isolated hemivertebrae has a good prognosis. Hence, given the above available evidence, there is no different behavior of hemivertebra in twins as compared to singletons.

### Identical twins carry a persistent epigenetic signature of early genome programming [^114BiAT9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We next combined all blood EWAS results (Supplementary Table S3) in a meta-analysis (total sample size = 5723, 88% of samples), which revealed 834 Bonferroni-significant CpGs, hereafter referred to as "MZ-DMPs" (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 3): 497 (60%) of which had a lower methylation level in MZ twins (MZ-hypo-DMPs) and 337 had a higher methylation level (MZ-hyper-DMPs). The correlation between MZ-DMPs is described in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3.

### Chromosomal aberrations and CNVs in twin fetuses with cardiovascular anomalies: comparison between monochorionic diamniotic and dichorionic diamniotic twins [^115NM6vk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the types of cardiovascular anomalies and the results of invasive prenatal diagnosis in twin fetuses.

Methods

A total of 298 fetuses in 149 twin pairs were enrolled, in which 1 or 2 fetuses of a twin pair had cardiovascular anomalies. Prenatal diagnosis was performed on 290 fetuses of 149 twin pairs, including 150 monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) fetuses (79 pairs) and 140 dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) fetuses (70 pairs). G-Banding karyotyping and/or chromosomal microarray analysis were performed. The types of cardiovascular anomalies and the results of prenatal diagnosis were analyzed.

Results

Fifty percent (79/158) fetuses in MCDA group and 52.1% (73/140) fetuses in DCDA group were diagnosed with cardiovascular anomalies by ultrasound. Primary cardiac structural defects such as septal defects and tetralogy of Fallot were more common in DCDA group than in MCDA group, while acardiac anomaly was the most common in MCDA group. Chromosomal aberrations were identified in 7.7% fetuses (11/142) of MCDA group and in 18.3% fetuses (22/120) of DCDA group by G-banding karyotyping. Except benign copy number variations (CNVs), 37 CNVs (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variant of uncertain significance) and chromosomal aberrations were detected in 21.3% (32/150) fetuses of MCDA group and 47 CNVs (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and variant of uncertain significance) and chromosomal aberrations were detected in 32.1% (45/140) fetuses of DCDA group by chromosomal microarray analysis.

Conclusions

Most of cardiovascular anomalies were identified in one fetus of a twin pair no matter in MCDA or DCDA twin. Primary cardiac structural defects were more common in DCDA group. Monozygotic twins may have discordant phenotypes, karyotypes, and CNVs between 2 fetuses of each pair.

### Delivery of twins [^115mnn4a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this article is to review current information regarding the management of twin gestations and discuss optimal pregnancy length and considerations regarding route of delivery. Limited data are available on the timing and mode of delivery for twins. For apparently uncomplicated twin pregnancies, current recommendations suggest the optimal length of gestation is 38 weeks for dichorionic diamniotic twins, 34–36 weeks for monochorionic diamniotic twins, and 32–34 weeks for monoamniotic twins. In general, vaginal trial of labor may be considered for cephalic-cephalic twins and in cases of cephalic-noncephalic twins where the provider's skills and experience allow. Cesarean is recommended in twin gestations with monoamnionicity, noncephalic presenting fetus, and those at high risk for combined vaginal-abdominal delivery. The optimal management of twin deliveries is controversial, with timing and mode of delivery dependent on multiple factors, including chorionicity, amnionicity, provider experience, and fetal presentation.

### The pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of monochorionic diamniotic twin gestations: a multicenter prospective cohort study from the first trimester onward [^1123QCwy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to document the pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcome in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies and to identify risk factors for death and impairment.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study of 136 monochorionic twins followed up from the first trimester until infancy.

Results

A total of 122 (90%) pregnancies resulted in 2 survivors, 6 (4%) in 1 survivor and 8 (6%) in no survivor. In all, 230 (92%) of 250 surviving infants were assessed at a mean age of 24 months. Neurodevelopmental impairment was present in 22 (10%) infants. Death or impairment of 1 or both infants occurred in 28 (22%) of 126 pregnancies. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and assisted conception increased the risk of both death and impairment, whereas early-onset discordant growth only increased the risk of death.

Conclusion

The mortality in this prospective series was 8% and neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 10% of infants.

### Repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins following assisted reproduction: a case report and literature review [^114dsH8E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Monochorionic twinning involves numerous maternal and fetal complications, triplets complicated by a monochorionic pair are at further increased risk. Here, we report a case of repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins with successful pregnancy outcomes in a woman using autologous oocytes.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old female undergoing embryo transfer with fresh and frozen embryo cycles with autologous oocytes. The two cycles were confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound to result in successful clinical pregnancies of triplets complicated by a monochorionic twinning. The first pregnancy resulted in a singleton delivery after a selective reduction of the monochorionic pair. The subsequent pregnancy resulted in a dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy after the heartbeat of one of the monochorionic twin fetuses stopped at 43 days after embryo transfer. Both of the pregnancies ended with successful live births.

Conclusions

Our case report of repeated triplets with monochorionic twins suggests the potential causes and risk factors of monochorionic twinning in assisted reproduction and raises concern regarding the timing of multifetal pregnancy reduction.

### Performance and diagnostic value of genome-wide noninvasive prenatal testing in multiple gestations [^116ymJBH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the accuracy and diagnostic value of genome-wide noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for the detection of fetal aneuploidies in multiple gestations, with a focus on dichorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study including data from pregnant women with a twin or higher-order gestation who underwent genome-wide NIPT at one of the eight Belgian genetic centers between November 1, 2013, and March 1, 2020. Chorionicity and amnionicity were determined by ultrasonography. Follow-up invasive testing was carried out in the event of positive NIPT results. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the detection of trisomy 21, 18, and 13 in the dichorionic-diamniotic twin cohort.

Results

Unique NIPT analyses were performed for 4,150 pregnant women with a multiple gestation and an additional 767 with vanishing gestations. The failure rate in multiple gestations excluding vanishing gestations ranged from 0% to 11.7% among the different genetic centers. Overall, the failure rate was 4.8%, which could be reduced to 1.2% after single resampling. There were no common fetal trisomies detected among the 86 monochorionic-monoamniotic and 25 triplet cases. Two monochorionic-diamniotic twins had an NIPT result indicative of a trisomy 21, which was confirmed in both fetuses. Among 2,716 dichorionic-diamniotic twin gestations, a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 74.12–100%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 99.86–100%) was reached for trisomy 21 (n = 12). For trisomy 18 (n = 3), the respective values were 75% (95% CI 30.06–95.44%) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI 99.86–100%) specificity, and for trisomy 13 (n = 2), 100% (95% CI 20.65–100%) sensitivity and 99.96% (95% CI 99.79–99.99%) specificity. In the vanishing gestation group, 28 NIPT results were positive for trisomy 21, 18, or 13, with only five confirmed trisomies.

Conclusion

Genome-wide NIPT performed accurately for detection of aneuploidy in dichorionic-diamniotic twin gestations.

### Monochorionic and dichorionic twin pregnancies discordant for fetal anencephaly: a systematic review of prenatal management options [^112kXhZv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selective feticide (SF) compared to expectant management (EM) on perinatal outcome in dichorionic and monochorionic twins discordant for anencephaly. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review of literature and added ten unpublished cases. As a result, we found that in dichorionic twins, mean gestational age (GA) at birth in the SF group was 38.0 weeks versus 34.9 weeks (P = 0.0002). Mean birth weight was 2922 g in the SF group versus 2474 g (P = 0.03). In monochorionic twins, mean GA at birth was 35.2 weeks versus 32.7 weeks (P = 0.1). Mean birth weight was 2711 g versus 1667 g (P = 0.0001). We conclude that while SF does not reduce perinatal mortality, it does result in significantly longer gestations and higher birth weight, and appears to be the management of choice in dichorionic twins discordant for anencephaly. In monochorionic twins, SF also increases birth weight, but in view of the complexity of this group, no clear recommendations can be made.

### Special considerations regarding antenatal care and pregnancy complications in dichorionic twin pregnancies [^115hyXvy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Twin pregnancies account for about 3.3% of all deliveries in the United States, with most of them being dichorionic diamniotic. Maternal physiological adaptation in twin pregnancies is exaggerated, and the rate of almost every maternal and fetal complication in twin pregnancies is higher than that in singleton pregnancies. Therefore, twin pregnancies necessitate closer antenatal surveillance by care providers, who are familiar with the specific challenges unique to these pregnancies. In addition, there is evidence that following women with twins in a specialized twin clinic can result in improved obstetrical outcomes. The importance of the first antenatal visit in twin pregnancies cannot be over emphasized and should preferably take place early in gestation, as that is the optimal period to correctly identify the number of fetuses and the type of placentation (chorionicity and amnionicity). This will allow the patients, families, and caregivers to make the appropriate modifications and tailor an optimal antenatal follow-up plan. This plan should focus on general recommendations such as weight gain and level of activity, education regarding the complications specific to twin pregnancies along with the relevant symptoms and indications to seek care, and close maternal and fetal monitoring. In this review, we summarize the available evidence and current guidelines regarding antenatal care in dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.

### When diamniotic twins suddenly become monoamniotic twins: spontaneous septostomy of the dividing membrane [^115LXN1Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In twin pregnancies, amnionicity and chorionicity are crucial as they strongly determine prenatal and perinatal management. First trimester ultrasound allows a highly reliable diagnosis of amnionicity and chorionicity, making it an internationally accepted standard in antenatal care. However, in rare cases, amnionicity can change from diamniotic to monoamniotic throughout pregnancy, substantially impacting perinatal management. We report the case of a confirmed monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with a diagnosis of spontaneous septostomy of the dividing membrane (SSDM) at 28 weeks of gestation, resulting in a pseudomonoamniotic pregnancy. Even though SSDM is a rare condition and its sonographic diagnosis might be challenging, it should be considered if, in a known diamniotic pregnancy, there is a sudden failure to visualise the intertwin membrane truly separating both twins.

### Multiple gestations: timing of indicated late preterm and early-term births in uncomplicated dichorionic, monochorionic, and monoamniotic twins [^114wzhqy]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

In this work we review the indications for late preterm and early-term birth in uncomplicated dichorionic, monochorionic, and monoamniotic twin gestations. Uncomplicated dichorionic twins have optimal outcomes when delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. Monochorionic twins, however, are at greater risk for unexpected stillbirth, and a management plan of late preterm delivery (34–37 weeks) after informed consent is reasonable. Monoamniotic twins are at even greater risk for sudden intrauterine fetal demise, and it is recommended that these expectant mothers be managed by inpatient hospitalization with fetal testing 1–3 times per day and delivery between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation. Recommendations are also provided for the circumstance of single intrauterine fetal demise in a twin gestation.

### Ultrasound in twins: dichorionic and monochorionic [^111yu3js]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to assess the evidence that supports the use of ultrasound in twin pregnancies. Although many of the indications for obstetric ultrasound are the same in both singleton and multiple gestations, there are special considerations as well as unique conditions in twins that require additional imaging studies. The reasons for ultrasound in twins include pregnancy dating, determination of chorionicity, nuchal translucency assessment, anatomical survey, placental evaluation, cervical length assessment, routine fetal growth, and serial surveillance of pregnancies complicated by anomalies, cervical shortening, fetal growth disturbances, and amniotic fluid abnormalities. Twins with monochorionic placentation require heightened scrutiny for monoamnionicity, conjoined twins, twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) syndrome, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, unequal placental sharing with discordant twin growth or selective intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR), twin anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS), and single fetal demise. Ultrasound is essential for the detection and management of conditions that can complicate dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies.

### Development of customized fetal growth charts in twins [^115xgaiu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Twin gestations are at significantly higher risk of fetal growth restriction in comparison with singletons. Using fetal biometric charts customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics may facilitate an accurate assessment of fetal growth.

Objective

The objective of the study was to construct reference charts for the gestation of fetal biometric parameters stratified by chorionicity and customized for obstetrical and parental characteristics.

Study Design

Fetal biometric measurements obtained from serial ultrasound examinations in uncomplicated twin pregnancies delivering after 36 weeks of gestation were collected by 19 Italian fetal medicine units under the auspices of the Società Italiana di Ecografia Ostetrica e Ginecologica. The measurements acquired in each fetus at each examination included biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. Multilevel linear regression models were used to adjust for the serial ultrasonographic measurements obtained and the clustering of each fetus in twin pregnancy. The impact of maternal and paternal characteristics (height, weight, ethnicity), parity, fetal sex, and mode of conception was also considered. Models for each parameter were stratified by fetal chorionicity and compared with our previously constructed growth curves for singletons.

Results

The data set included 1781 twin pregnancies (dichorionic, n = 1289; monochorionic diamniotic, n = 492) with 8923 ultrasonographic examinations with a median of 5 (range, 2–8) observations per pregnancy in dichorionic and 6 in (range, 2–11) monochorionic pregnancies. Growth curves of twin pregnancies differed from those of singletons, and differences were more marked in monochorionic twins and during the third trimester. A significant influence of parental characteristics was found.

Conclusion

Curves of fetal biometric measurements in twins are influenced by parental characteristics. There is a reduction in the growth rate during the third trimester. The reference limits for gestation constructed in this study may provide a useful tool for a more accurate assessment of fetal growth in twin pregnancies.

### Fetal sex determination in twin pregnancies using non-invasive prenatal testing [^111HRePn]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Sample collection and processing

This retrospective study was granted by the Ethical Committees of the University Hospital Leuven, and a written informed consent was obtained from all participants. NIPT sequence reads were recovered from twin pregnancies with documented sex. Fetal sex confirmation was done either by ultrasound during the 20th week of gestation or postnatally by visual inspection. Table 2 presents the characteristics of all samples included in this research. In total, 198 twin pregnancies were investigated. Chorionicity and amnionicity were determined by ultrasound in all twin pregnancies, which are classified as dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA), or monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA), based on whether the pairs share the same placenta and amniotic sac or not. Genetic counseling is provided by the gynecologists before sampling for NIPT. The patient is informed that in case of a dizygotic twin pregnancy, the accuracy of the test for fetal sex determination and aneuploidy detection can be lower compared to a monozygotic twin pregnancy due to a possibility of a mixed-sex twin. Peripheral blood samples from pregnant women were collected from 10 weeks of gestation onwards in either cell-free DNA BCT tubes (Streck, Omaha, NE, USA) or cell-free DNA collection tubes (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Cell-free DNA extraction, DNA library preparation, as well as whole genome sequencing were carried out as previously described.

### Management of twin pregnancies: remaining challenges and unanswered questions [^1128uT7Q]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

While counseling to patients with twins regarding the mode of delivery tends to focus on the risk of CD for the second twin (approximately 5%), it should be noted that patients with twins might also be at an increased risk of CD during the first or second stages of labor before the delivery of the first twin. For example, in the Twin Birth Study, the overall rate of intrapartum CD among patients in the planned vaginal delivery group was 43.8% (39.6% for both twins and 4.2% for the second twin), which is higher than that reported in singleton pregnancies. We recently developed a calculator based on data from the Twin Birth Study that can facilitate patient counseling based on their individualized risk of intrapartum CD.

Finally, there is a considerable variation among existing guidelines regarding the optimal timing of delivery in uncomplicated twin pregnancies (Figure 1 and Table 1). This variation is a reflection of the fact that available data regarding the optimal timing of delivery are largely based on gestational‐week‐specific estimates of the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death derived from observational data.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^111br5Vo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

The specific guidance for DCDA twins was at times indistinct and the guidelines lacked a clear standardised approach in both structure and recommendations. We identified differences in recommendations across CPGs, but we also found areas of consensus. The observed variations among recommendations may be explained by the year of guideline development, their PICAR/ PICO used during the search, method of rating the evidence and the guideline developers own prioritisation process in developing recommendations.

Findings from this review suggest that clinicians using national guidelines may be using guidelines that are not methodologically rigorous and/or reflect the best and most recent clinical evidence available. For example, most CPGs agreed chorionicity and dating was essential in early pregnancy but there was no consensus on the definition of early pregnancy, the best method of chorionicity determination or method of documentation, while the majority of CPGs agreed this was an important process. Given the high risk associated with twin pregnancies, research supports accurate dating, chorionicity assessment and documentation for correct management of the pregnancy. Therefore, guideline recommendations should be more specific and the optimal gestation for dating and chorionicity should be agreed on and clarified on beyond 'early pregnancy'.

Separating twin guidelines according to their chorionicity could be beneficial for clinical practice. We have seen this with monochorionic specific guidelines in recognition of the unique complications specific to monochorionic twins. This is not the case with DCDA twins and the complexities of these twins merit greater recognition. Only 5 CPGs provided recommendations for dating a pregnancy following ART, this lack of consensus is surprising as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) greatly increases the risk of a twin pregnancy, especially in cases where more than one embryo is transferred.

Most of the recommendations focussed on fetal growth (n = 105), and we speculate the focus on this category is in recognition of twins having a higher rate of growth complications compared to singletons, which is generally managed by ultrasound surveillance. There was consensus regarding the frequency of fetal growth scans across the guidelines, in recognition of the increased risk of DCDA twin pregnancies. Differences between recommendations were evident regarding the definition of sIUGR, sFGR and growth discordance, and these differences have also been identified in various previous reports and studies. Fetuses diagnosed with suboptimal fetal growth are at risk of stillbirth, preterm birth and long-term adverse health outcomes. To facilitate the optimal management of these pregnancies, international consensus of standardised definitions would make guidelines more practicable and applicable.

### Managing twins discordant for fetal anomaly [^112rsHzb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

An excess of structural anomalies is observed in twins compared to singletons. Approximately 1–2% of twin pregnancies may face the dilemma of expectant management versus selective termination following diagnosis of an anomaly affecting only one fetus. If the option of selective fetocide is considered, the main variable determining the technique to achieve this aim is chorionicity. In a dichorionic pregnancy, passage of substances from one twin into the circulation of the co-twin is unlikely due to the lack of placental anastomoses, hence KCl can be injected safely into the circulation of the affected twin to produce fetal asystole. In monochorionic twin pregnancies, selective termination needs to be performed by ensuring complete and permanent occlusion of both the arterial and venous flows in the umbilical cord of the affected twin, in order to avoid acute haemorrhage from the co-twin into the dying fetus, which may lead to death or organ damage. Bipolar cord coagulation under ultrasound guidance is associated with approximately 70–80% survival rates.

### Adverse perinatal outcome of twin pregnancies according to chorionicity: review of the literature [^112UrEKQ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Twin gestations are at significant increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome. As a result, although prospective randomized data is lacking, increased fetal surveillance has been advocated for twins. Growth concordance is considered a reassuring sign in twins and conversely, discordancy to possibly reflect a hostile intrauterine environment at least to the smaller twin. Consequently, increased surveillance of discordant twins is commonly practiced. Monochorionic twins are at further risk for type-specific perinatal complications, for example, twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Recently, precise first-trimester depiction of chorionicity has enabled early antepartum stratification of twin gestations according to chorionicity, in comparison with previous later (mid- and third-trimester) ultrasonographic diagnosis of chorionicity. This immediately leads to the question whether antenatal testing of twins should differ according to chorionicity? Review of the literature supports that despite the existence of complications unique to monochorionic twin gestations, dichorionic twins sustain an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome (such as fetal growth restriction) in comparison with singletons, and that close antenatal fetal surveillance of twins should be performed, irrespective of chorionicity.

2 ZYGOSITY AND CHORIONICITY

Approximately 60%–70% of twin pregnancies are dizygotic and 20%–30% monozygotic, depending on the maternal age, use of fertility treatments, and race/ethnicity of the population. Dizygotic ("non‐identical") twins are the product of two egg fertilizations and these pregnancies will generally have dichorionic diamniotic extra‐fetal tissues. The existence of monochorionicity for dizygotic twins has traditionally been viewed as rare although more recent studies suggest this may be more frequently encountered, especially when there has been assisted reproduction. Monozygotic ("identical") twins are the consequence of an early splitting of the cells derived from a single fertilized egg and the presentation of the extra‐embryonic tissues will be dependent on the timing of the split. Very early separation (morula stage) will result in dichorionic diamniotic tissues (i.e. the same as that seen in a dizygotic twin pregnancy). Separation at the hatching stage results in monochorionic diamniotic tissues. Later separation results in monochorionic monoamniotic tissues. Approximately 75% of monozygotic twins are monochorionic and 25% are dichorionic. There are also very rare examples of twins in which only the chromosome set from one parent is shared.

Although all twin pregnancies are considered to be high‐risk for almost all obstetrical complications in pregnancy (except post‐date pregnancies and macrosomia), the primary associated risk factor for a poor pregnancy outcome in twin pregnancies is the chorionicity. Monochorionic twins are uniquely at risk for twin‐to‐twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anemia‐polycythemia syndrome and twin reversed arterial perfusion. Chorionicity can be established by ultrasound examination in the first trimester. The characteristic "lambda" sign on ultrasound is considered to be indicative of monochorionicity and has generally been considered to be accurate provided the sonogram is carried out prior to 14 completed weeks gestational age. However, not all patients are able to obtain this early diagnostic ultrasound. For example, based on Center for Disease Control reports for 2016, in the United States, over 20% of women entered prenatal care in the second trimester or later and this proportion was even greater in marginalized and vulnerable populations. It is not always possible to determine chorionicity due to intrauterine crowding of the fetuses, reduced amniotic fluid, or maternal obesity.

### Monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancies [^114frhUV]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Monoamniotic twin pregnancies are rare, but early diagnosis of such pregnancies is critical, as the incidence of complications in these pregnancies is much higher than in diamniotic or dichorionic twin pregnancies. Overall, only 70% of all monoamniotic twins will survive. Furthermore, approximately half of fetal deaths in these pregnancies are because of the high incidence of fetal anomalies (15%-25%), such as twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence and conjoined twinning. Therefore, early anatomy screening in the first trimester of pregnancy is recommended. Other causes of fetal death in these pregnancies include twin-twin transfusion syndrome, tight cord entanglement, or acute hemodynamic imbalances through the large placental vascular anastomoses. After viability, fetal surveillance can be intensified, as this decreases the risk of in utero death. Both inpatient and outpatient surveillance are reasonable. If otherwise uncomplicated, monoamniotic twins should be delivered at 33 to 34 weeks' gestation. Most centers will deliver by cesarean delivery, but some continue to advocate for vaginal delivery. Lastly, neonatal morbidity is high in monoamniotic twin pregnancies and is mainly related to prematurity.

### Dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy with monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 13 after preimplantation genetic screening: case report [^111ddQ5k]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the first dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy discordant for trisomy 13 after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS).

Design

Case report.

Setting

Private IVF center.

Patient(S)

A 40-year-old para 1+6 woman.

Intervention(S)

IVF combined with PGS for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, and 22, resulting in the transfer of two embryos.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Prenatal fetal ultrasonography revealed a dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy. An amniocentesis, performed at 15-weeks' gestation, confirmed that the singleton and one monozygotic twin were normal but the other monozygotic twin was trisomy 13.

Result(S)

After diagnosis and counseling, selective termination of the trisomy 13 monozygotic twin was performed at 16 weeks and 4 days. At 18 weeks and 4 days the co-twin died. A healthy boy was delivered by elective caesarean section at 36-weeks' gestation.

Conclusion(S)

Assisted reproductive techniques that breach the embryo's zona pellucida such as assisted hatching and PGS embryo biopsy increase the incidence of monozygotic twins. Due to high levels of mosaicism in human preimplantation embryos, PGS cannot ensure that embryos diagnosed as normal and selected for transfer do not contain abnormal cells. Hence, further reports of discordant monozygotic twins following PGS are expected, emphasizing the need for appropriate counseling of patients wishing to embark on an IVF/PGS treatment cycle.

### Prevalence of common aneuploidy in twin pregnancies [^1129exXK]. Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of twin pregnancies, particularly dizygotic pregnancies, which positively correlate with the maternal age and use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), has increased. Twin pregnancies have a higher risk of intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, and neonatal mortality. Many studies have found that twin pregnancies also have a higher risk of congenital anomalies than singleton pregnancies. Approximately 25% of congenital anomalies are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities, and twin pregnancies have also been considered to have a high risk of chromosomal abnormalities. However, it was reported that the incidence of trisomy 21 was lower in twin than in singleton pregnancies, most notably in monozygotic twins, although these findings were not universal. The risk of chromosomal abnormalities in twin pregnancies remains controversial.

This study retrospectively investigated the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in twin pregnancies in Japan. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in dichorionic diamniotic (DD) and monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins were compared using data collected from 57 clinical facilities across Japan. We also compared the observed incidence of trisomy 21 among twin pregnancies with that expected based on maternal age-matched singletons.

### Monozygotic dichorionic-diamniotic pregnancies following single frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer: a retrospective case series [^1169E5TJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

When a single embryo divides into two after fertilization defines the type of twin pregnancy. There is a classical theory presented by Corner about the timing of embryo division and twin pregnancy development: within 3 days of fertilization, dichorionic-diamniotic (DC-DA) twins; between 4 and 8 days, monochorionic-diamniotic (MC-DA) twins; and between 9 and 12 days, monochorionic-monoamniotic (MC-MA) twins; and rarely, after 12 days, conjoined twins.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has been associated with multiple gestations as a result of transfer with more than one embryos, which may develop into DC-DA twins. However, the frequency of monozygotic twinning after ART also increases, which varies from 0 to 13.2% compared with 0.4% of live births in spontaneous conception population. Although the specific mechanism of the increased risk of monozygotic twinning with in vitro fertilization (IVF) is controversial, researchers have proposed a lot of risk factors including extended embryo culture, female age and certain IVF procedures, especially those related to micromanipulation of the zona pellucida as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or assisted hatching (AH), embryo biopsy and embryo cryopreservation.

The information on monozygotic DC-DA twinning after single blastocyst transfer is extremely limited. As it differs with the deep-rooted multiple pregnancy theory that single blastocyst transfer should only lead to MC-DA or MC-MA twinning, more studies and further investigation are needed. Many DC-DA twinning are suspected to be the results of either transfer of more than one embryo or less common, spontaneous pregnancies at the same time. DC-DA monozygotic twinning rate is underestimated because genetic testing of offspring is rarely performed. Therefore, we collected and analyzed data of thirteen cases of monozygotic DC-DA twinning after single blastocyst transfer in down-regulated or hormone replacement frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles.

### Conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancy: a report of three cases and literature review [^113qfh9X]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Conjoined twins in triplet pregnancy are considered a unique phenomenon that is accompanied by a wide variety of congenital abnormalities and has hazardous consequences for both fetuses and parents, which also occurs in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) triplets and DCDA triplets. Due to its rarity, triplet pregnancies with increased maternal complications, perinatal morbidity and mortality, provide a great challenge for staff to undertake the complete workup, determine shared anatomy, evaluate maternal-fetal prognosis, and decide management (to continue as a triplet gestation, termination of pregnancy, or selective termination of conjoined twins) once a diagnosis is reached. Up to now, no consensus has been achieved.

We used a list of keywords including "conjoined twins", "triplet pregnancy", "dichorionic diamniotic", "monochorionic", and "multiple pregnancy" to perform an extensive Medline and CNKI search of the literature in English and Chinese about the perinatal management and outcomes of conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies. To the best of our knowledge, the number of published papers related to conjoined twins in triplet pregnancies was less than 30. There were four reported cases of unclear chorionic triplet pregnancies. Conjoined twins all had a poor prognosis. Detailed information is shown in Table 1. We found 14 cases of monochorionic triplet pregnancies with conjoined twins. Detailed information is shown in Table 2. Due to placental vascular anastomoses between the conjoined twins and the other fetus, the prognosis of the normal triplet was poor after selective fetal reduction. We also found 10 cases of conjoined twins in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancies. Detailed information is shown in Table 3. Compared with conjoined twins in monochorionic triplet pregnancies, the prognosis in dichorionic diamniotic triplet pregnancies is generally better. Except for two cases, all cases achieved good pregnancy outcomes after selective reduction.

### Monozygotic twinning after assisted reproductive technologies: a case report of asymmetric development and incidence during 19 years in an international group of in vitro fertilization clinics [^1173VoDN]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of monozygotic twinning with asymmetric development following a single fresh embryo transfer as part of an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. Secondarily, to report the incidence of monozygotic twinning at the IVI (Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad) clinics.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Private fertility centers.

Patient(S)

A 33-year-old woman with a 2-year history of primary infertility.

Intervention(S)

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and ICSI treatment with single-embryo transfer.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Incidence of monozygotic twinning at the IVI clinics.

Result(S)

We report a twin pregnancy after a single-embryo transfer. Twins were dichorionic and diamniotic. One fetus had a 6-day delay in its growth compared with the other when observed by ultrasound. Two female infants were delivered, and despite presenting congenital diseases, they were successfully treated and evolved correctly. A subsequent DNA analysis confirmed that the infants were monozygotic. Furthermore, we estimated a monozygotic twinning rate of 1.17% at the IVI clinics, taking into account those cases in which two or more embryos with heart beats were observed by ultrasound scanning after single-embryo transfers.

Conclusion(S)

Ultrasound scans performed during pregnancy suggested a possible dizygotic origin of the twins, but DNA analysis performed after birth established that they were monozygotic. Genetic analysis is the only valid tool to confirm if like-sex dichorionic twins are monozygotic or dizygotic.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine special statement: updated checklists for management of monochorionic twin pregnancy [^116mCPwM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of twin pregnancies are monochorionic. The management of monochorionic twin pregnancy involves several additional interventions beyond the routine management of singletons or dichorionic twins. In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine posted checklists for monochorionic/diamniotic twins and monochorionic/monoamniotic twins. The Society presents updated versions of these 2 checklists reflecting recent changes in practice recommendations. Suggestions for implementing the use of the checklists into antenatal care practices are also included.

### Management of monochorionic twin pregnancy green-top guideline no. 51 (2024 partial update) [^111EStKF]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to maternal and perinatal risks, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that monochorionic/dichorionic triplet pregnancies have higher fetal loss rates than trichorionic triplet pregnancies and may be complicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome, selective growth restriction, and twin anemia polycythemia sequence.

### ISUOG practice guidelines (updated): role of ultrasound in twin pregnancy [^1116KKoN]. Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for multiple gestation, more specifically with respect to antenatal fetal monitoring, ISUOG 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a first-trimester scan, a second-trimester anomaly scan, and subsequent scans every 4 weeks in patients with uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies. Obtain more frequent assessments in complicated dichorionic twins based on the condition and its severity.

### Recurrent preterm birth reduction by 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in dichorionic / diamniotic twin gestation [^111SAgov]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The study aimed to evaluate the impact of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) on recurrent preterm birth (PTB) in women with a prior PTB and a current dichorionic/diamniotic twin gestation.

Study Design

We combined individual patient-level data from two prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials of prophylactic 17-OHPC in twin gestation and compared the rates of recurrent spontaneous PTB in those women with a prior singleton PTB randomized to placebo or 17-OHPC (250mg weekly).

Results

Only 7.4% of women with dichorionic/diamniotic twin gestation experienced a prior PTB. Among these 66 women, spontaneous delivery prior to 34 weeks occurred significantly less often (p = 0.03) in those randomized to 17-OHPC (20.6%) than in those randomized to placebo (46.9%). However, mean gestational length was not significantly different, and there was no statistically significant difference in composite neonatal outcome.

Conclusion

17-OHPC may be beneficial to women with a prior PTB and a current dichorionic/diamniotic twin gestation. These findings along with those reported by the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network in singletons suggest a common mechanism of action and a specific target population, those with a prior PTB, that may benefit from 17-OHPC treatment. A large prospective trial is needed to validate these findings.

Key Points

· 17-OHPC reduces recurrent PTB in women with dichorionic/diamniotic twins. · PTB risk and response to 17-OHPC may differ according to the type of twinning. · 17-OHPC may affect a common pathway in twins and singletons with a prior PTB.

### Monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 13 [^111Z91o4]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Monozygotic twins with discordant karyotypes are rare. We report a case of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 13 by amniocyte karyotypes. Ultrasound revealed multiple congenital anomalies in Twin A (47, XY,+13), none in Twin B (46, XY), and monochorionic-diamniotic placentation. Zygosity testing performed both prenatally and after birth supported monozygosity. Twin A died in the neontal period. Twin B survived and had normal physical examination, but peripheral blood karyotype revealed 20% mosaicism for trisomy 13. Monochorionic-diamniontic placentation with vascular anastomoses was confirmed by pathological examination. In this paper, we discuss the various mechanisms by which monozygotic twins may have discordant karyotypes. The surviving twin, structurally and developmentally normal at 6 months of age, will be monitored for potential complications of uniparental disomy of chromosome 13 and trisomy 13 mosaicism.

### Prevalence of congenital heart defects in monochorionic / diamniotic twin gestations: a systematic literature review [^11683QhD]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect approximately 0.5% of all neonates. Recent literature points to a possible increase in the CHD prevalence among monochorionic/diamniotic (MC/DA) twin gestations. We hypothesized that MC/DA twin pregnancy is a risk factor for CHD.

Methods

A systematic review of all published English literature was conducted on MEDLINE (Ovid and PubMed) from January 2000 through April 2007 using the medical subject heading terms "congenital heart defect" and "monozygotic twins". Four observational studies were included in the final analysis. Published historical data were used for the population background risk of CHD. Relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed and random effect models.

Results

We included a total of 40 fetuses with CHDs among 830 fetuses from MC/DA twin gestations. Compared with the population, CHDs were significantly more prevalent in MC/DA twins regardless of the presence of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) (RR, 9.18; 95% CI, 5.51–15.29; P < .001). Monochorionic/diamniotic twin gestations affected by TTTS were more likely to be complicated by CHDs than those that did not have TTTS (RR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.03–7.52; p = 0.04). Ventricular septal defects were the most frequent heart defects. Pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defects were significantly more prevalent in pregnancies complicated with TTTS.

Conclusions

Monochorionic/diamniotic twin gestation appears to be a risk factor for CHDs. Conditions that lead to abnormal placentation may also contribute to abnormal heart development, especially in MC/DA twin pregnancies complicated with TTTS. Fetal echocardiography may be considered for all MC/DA twin gestations because ventricular septal defects and pulmonary stenosis are the most common defects.

### Repeated triplets complicated by monochorionic diamniotic twins following assisted reproduction: a case report and literature review [^114HkVkL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent studies reported that the transfer of a blastocyst resulted in a higher incidence of MZ pregnancies than the transfer of cleavage-stage embryos. Our 6-year single center retrospective study demonstrated that younger maternal age and prolonged embryo culture might be potential contributing factors associated with a higher incidence of monochorionic diamniotic twinning in ART. However, some researchers attributed this association to the high-quality embryos generated by prolonged embryo culture. In their opinion, blastocyst transfer is not associated with the incidence of MZT when controlling for embryo cohort quality.

It has been shown that multiple pregnancies are associated with an increased incidence of abortion and premature labor. Triplets complicated by a monochorionic twin are at further increased risk of many maternal and fetal complications. A selective reduction of the monochorionic pair is usually recommended when using MFPR in the obstetric management of complex triplets. In the first pregnancy of this case, we had a good obstetric outcome (full-term normal delivery at 41 weeks + 6 days in this case). The transvaginal fetal reduction technique proved to be safe and effective, and it can be performed as early as 7 weeks of gestation. However, it should be noted that spontaneous reduction can occur before 12 weeks, and some scholars propose that selective reduction should be performed between 10 and 13 weeks when the nuchal translucency((NT) thickness and fetal abnormalities are easier to measure and diagnose. In the second successful pregnancy of the patient, the heartbeat in one of the monozygotic twin fetuses stopped at 43 days after embryo transfer, and the patient had a dichronic twin pregnancy. Guidelines or an expert consensus should be issued regarding the timing and decision to retain the singleton or twins when using MFPR in triplet pregnancies with monochorionic twins.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of repeated triplets complicated by a monochorionic pair in a patient with autologous oocytes following assisted reproduction treatment. Potential risk factors for this patient include young maternal age, high quality embryos and micromanipulation of the ZP. In the cases with dichorionic triplets, selective multifetal pregnancy reduction is associated with a better obstetric outcome and should be offered in the obstetric management. While these cases are no longer rare after an ART procedure, the potential causes and risk factors of monochorionic twinning in assisted reproduction and the timing of MFPR warrant continued investigation.

### Placental cord insertion and birth weight discordancy in twin gestations [^1142mXZo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether abnormal umbilical cord insertion (UCI) into the placenta is a risk factor for birth weight discordancy in twin gestations.

Methods

Pathology records of all liveborn twins delivered between January 1993 and June 1996 were reviewed. The information collected included gestational age at delivery, birth weight, gross placental pathology, and placental UCI-velamentous, marginal, or disc. Discordancy in birth weight was defined as an intrapair difference of at least 20%. Analyses were stratified on placental chorionicity. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for birth weight discordancy were calculated based on the presence of an abnormal (velamentous or marginal) placental UCI relative to normal (disc) UCI on both placentae, after adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

There were 447 twin pairs identified. Dichorionic diamniotic placentation was present in 358 pairs (80.1%), monochorionic diamniotic in 84 (18.8%), and monochorionic monoamniotic in five (1.1%). There was a 13-fold increase in the risk of birth weight discordancy in monochorionic diamniotic twins in the presence of a velamentous UCI (odds ratio 13.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 138.4), with a rate of birth weight discordancy of 46%. This relationship was not demonstrated in dichorionic diamniotic twins (odds ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.3, 3.5).

Conclusion

Birth weight discordancy in twins is a different entity depending on chorionicity. The substantial increase in birth weight discordancy in monochorionic diamniotic twins that accompanies velamentous UCI underscores the need for prenatal detection and increased surveillance in these twins.

### Mode of delivery in multiple pregnancies [^115D4FKN]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

The mode of delivery in multiple pregnancies has been subject to vigorous debates during the last few decades. Although observational and retrospective data were accumulated, it was not until the publication of the Twin Birth Study that evidence-based recommendations could emerge. However, although some of the most pressing questions were answered by the Twin Birth Study, other questions were left outside the scope of the study. The questions were of great interest and included the following topics: the impact of gestational age, the influence of chorionicity, and the generalizability of the results for women with a previous uterine scar. The current evidence supported a trial of labor in dichorionic-diamniotic or monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies in which the first twin is in cephalic presentation at ≥ 32 weeks' gestation. Dichorionic-diamniotic, monochorionic-diamniotic, and monochorionic-monoamniotic twins should be delivered at 37 0/7 to 38 0/7, 36 0/7 to 37 0/7, and 32 0/7 to 34 0/7 weeks' gestation, respectively. Breech extraction done by a competent healthcare provider seemed to offer a higher chance of successful vaginal delivery of the second twin than the external cephalic version. The current data did not allow for a clear recommendation regarding the mode of delivery in very preterm birth of low birthweight twins, but most studies did not demonstrate a clear benefit of cesarean delivery vs trial of labor. Furthermore, a trial of labor seemed safe in women with a previous cesarean delivery. Cesarean delivery is likely beneficial for twin pregnancies with the first twin in breech presentation, monochorionic-monoamniotic twins, and higher-order multiple pregnancies. In all multiple pregnancies, delivery should be performed by an experienced practitioner competent in multiple pregnancy deliveries.

### Increased stillbirth in uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ShKDM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the risk of stillbirth in apparently uncomplicated monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies by systematic review and meta-analysis and compare it with that in uncomplicated dichorionic pregnancies.

Data Sources

We performed an electronic search (January 1985 to April 2012) of Medline, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases.

Methods Of Study Selection

Studies detailing gestational-age specific stillbirth rates after 24 weeks of gestation in monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies uncomplicated by twin-twin transfusion syndrome, growth restriction, or major anomalies. The rate and risk of stillbirth were calculated in 2-week gestational age blocks and compared in controlled studies with dichorionic pregnancies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

We evaluated 361 studies to include nine informative studies, four after additional data from the investigators. The rate of stillbirth per 1,000 uncomplicated monochorionic-diamniotic pregnancies at 32–33, 34–35, and 36–37 weeks of gestation was 5.1, 6.8, and 6.2, respectively. The risk of stillbirth per pregnancy at 32, 34, and 36 weeks of gestation was 1.6%, 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. Compared with uncomplicated dichorionic pregnancies, the odds ratio for stillbirth per pregnancy at 32, 34, and 36 weeks of gestation was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–12.6), 3.7 (CI 1.1–12.0), and 8.5 (CI 1.6–44.7), respectively.

Conclusion

Uncomplicated monochorionic twin pregnancies are at substantial risk of stillbirth throughout the third trimester, which is severalfold higher than in dichorionic twin pregnancies. Given the risk of fetal death to the cotwin, these data should inform decisions around timing of delivery in seemingly normal monochorionic twin pregnancies.
