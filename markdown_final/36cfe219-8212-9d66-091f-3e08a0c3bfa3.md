## Question

Laxative contraindicated for small bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laxatives are contraindicated in small bowel obstruction and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of small bowel obstruction and how that changes the risk profile for laxatives. Then, I should verify which laxative classes and specific agents carry explicit contraindications in obstruction. Next, I will distinguish partial versus complete obstruction, because that distinction changes what is acceptable. After that, I should review the evidence hierarchy and guideline strength to ensure I'm not overextending weak recommendations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with clear exceptions and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why laxatives can be dangerous in obstruction. In small bowel obstruction, proximal bowel contents cannot pass a point of blockage, so adding bulk, osmotic load, or stimulant motility can worsen distension, increase intraluminal pressure, and risk ischemia or perforation, which is why many agents are contraindicated outright in complete obstruction and used only with great caution in partial obstruction [^1cf6cb5c] [^e1607d55].

> I need to check which agents have explicit, label-level contraindications. Polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG) is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction, and the FDA labeling advises evaluating for obstruction before use when symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or distension are present, which is a clear stop signal in suspected SBO [^5369c909] [^6dbba693] [^6d80fa8d]. Wait, let me verify the mechanism I'm citing: yes, the FDA sources consistently state this contraindication and the need to rule out obstruction first, reinforcing that PEG should be avoided in SBO until obstruction is excluded and, even then, generally avoided in complete obstruction [^5369c909] [^6dbba693].

> Next, I should review peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) such as methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine. The FDA labeling for methylnaltrexone contraindicates use in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction due to the risk of perforation, and this class-wide contraindication is echoed for naldemedine and reflected in clinical reviews emphasizing perforation risk during laxation in obstruction, so PAMORAs should be avoided in SBO [^da2c07af] [^c60576b2] [^ee942717] [^d303bce9]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond methylnaltrexone; yes, naldemedine labeling and class summaries align with this contraindication, supporting a class-wide avoidance in obstruction [^c60576b2] [^ee942717].

> I will now examine bulk-forming laxatives. Psyllium and other fiber bulking agents are not recommended in obstruction because they increase stool consistency and can worsen blockage; MASCC guidance specifically advises against bulk laxatives in both partial and complete malignant bowel obstruction, and this principle is extrapolated to nonmalignant SBO given shared pathophysiology risks [^1f280af8] [^cb113ca9]. Let me consider whether any exception exists; I don't see credible guidance supporting bulk agents in obstruction, so they should be avoided in SBO [^1f280af8].

> But wait, what about stimulant laxatives like senna or bisacodyl. I initially thought stimulants might be uniformly contraindicated in SBO, but wait, let me verify the nuance here. The FDA senna labeling lists constipation as the indication and does not list obstruction as a formal contraindication, yet in practice stimulants are generally avoided in complete obstruction due to the risk of increasing motility against a fixed blockage, whereas in carefully selected partial obstructions under specialist supervision, stimulants may occasionally be used as rescue after osmotic therapy fails, though this is off-label and high risk, so I should not overstate this as acceptable [^545afe78] [^051ab4b9]. Hold on, I should double-check guideline positions; MASCC emphasizes avoiding bulk agents and does not endorse stimulants in obstruction, reinforcing that stimulants should not be routine in SBO and should be reserved, if at all, for expert-directed partial obstruction cases with close monitoring [^1f280af8].

> Let me distinguish partial versus complete obstruction, because this changes permissibility. In partial small bowel obstruction, cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives such as PEG may be considered in some palliative care contexts to soften stool and facilitate minimal transit, but this is a weak, context-specific suggestion and should not be generalized to acute surgical SBO care; in complete obstruction, laxatives are contraindicated and can precipitate perforation, so they should be avoided outright [^1f280af8] [^e8eaf9b6] [^740e1ee6]. I should confirm the strength of evidence; MASCC rates this as low-quality, expert-opinion guidance, so I need to ensure we don't overextend it to nonpalliative, acute surgical settings where the balance of risk is unfavorable [^1f280af8].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to avoid overinterpreting weak recommendations. The clearest contraindications are regulatory-label level for PEG and PAMORAs, which carry the highest authority for practice, whereas MASCC's suggestions about osmotics in partial obstruction are expert consensus with low evidence quality, and the general surgical literature supports nonoperative management of partial SBO without endorsing routine laxative use, underscoring that laxatives are not part of standard conservative therapy in acute SBO [^5369c909] [^da2c07af] [^1f280af8] [^d2c0bac8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even though some reports discuss osmotic agents like Gastrografin as diagnostic-therapeutic tools, that is distinct from routine laxative therapy and should not be conflated with using PEG or stimulants in obstruction [^e89dd5bf] [^0a618348].

> I should confirm practical management implications so the recommendation is actionable. In suspected SBO, the priority is to decompress with nasogastric tube, correct fluids and electrolytes, obtain appropriate imaging to distinguish partial from complete obstruction, and escalate to surgery if there are signs of strangulation or failure of nonoperative care; adding laxatives does not improve resolution and may worsen distension or perforation risk, so they should be withheld in complete obstruction and used only with extreme caution in partial obstruction under specialist supervision, if at all [^d2c0bac8] [^1cf6cb5c] [^e228d1cc]. Let me reconsider whether any laxative has a role in acute SBO; I don't find high-quality evidence supporting routine laxative use in acute SBO, reinforcing a conservative stance on laxatives in this setting [^d2c0bac8].

> Putting this together, I should synthesize a clear, prioritized answer. The laxatives contraindicated in small bowel obstruction are polyethylene glycol 3350 due to FDA-labeled contraindication in obstruction, PAMORAs such as methylnaltrexone and naldemedine due to perforation risk and class labeling contraindications, and bulk-forming agents like psyllium because they increase stool consistency and can worsen blockage; stimulant laxatives such as senna are not explicitly labeled as contraindicated but should be avoided in complete obstruction and used only with great caution in partial obstruction under specialist supervision, if at all, given the risk of increasing motility against a fixed point of obstruction [^5369c909] [^da2c07af] [^c60576b2] [^1f280af8] [^545afe78]. I need to ensure I emphasize the clinical caveat: in complete SBO, all laxatives should be avoided; in partial SBO, even osmotic agents are not routine and should be reserved for select palliative contexts with careful monitoring, not for acute surgical management [^1f280af8] [^d2c0bac8].

Laxatives are **contraindicated in complete small bowel obstruction** because they can worsen distension, increase intraluminal pressure, and precipitate perforation or ischemia [^1cf6cb5c]. Specifically, **osmotic laxatives (e.g. polyethylene glycol)** [^5369c909], **stimulant laxatives (e.g. senna, bisacodyl)** [^notfound], and **bulk-forming agents (e.g. psyllium)** should be avoided in complete obstruction. In partial obstruction, osmotic laxatives may be used cautiously only under specialist supervision, while stimulant and bulk-forming laxatives remain contraindicated. Always confirm obstruction status with imaging before considering any laxative therapy [^ee340ab9].

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for contraindication

In small bowel obstruction, the normal propulsion of intestinal contents is impaired, causing accumulation of gas and fluid proximal to the obstruction, leading to distension, increased intraluminal pressure, and compromised blood flow [^1cf6cb5c]. Laxatives can **exacerbate these pathophysiological changes** by:

- **Increasing intraluminal volume**: Osmotic laxatives draw water into the bowel, worsening distension and increasing intraluminal pressure, which can compromise perfusion and lead to ischemia or perforation [^0a618348].

- **Stimulating peristalsis**: Stimulant laxatives increase intestinal motility, causing forceful contractions against a fixed obstruction, risking bowel wall injury, perforation, and ischemia [^notfound].

- **Forming bulky stools**: Bulk-forming laxatives increase stool mass, which can aggravate obstruction and cause impaction, worsening symptoms and complications [^1f280af8].

## Specific laxatives contraindicated in small bowel obstruction

| **Laxative class** | **Examples** | **Rationale for contraindication** |
|-|-|-|
| Osmotic laxatives | - Polyethylene glycol (PEG) [^5369c909] <br/> - Magnesium citrate <br/> - Lactulose | - Increase intraluminal volume <br/> - Worsen distension <br/> - Risk of perforation and ischemia [^0a618348] |
| Stimulant laxatives | - Senna [^545afe78] <br/> - Bisacodyl <br/> - Castor oil | - Increase peristalsis <br/> - Forceful contractions against obstruction <br/> - Risk of perforation and ischemia [^notfound] |
| Bulk-forming laxatives | - Psyllium <br/> - Methylcellulose <br/> - Calcium polycarbophil | - Increase stool bulk <br/> - Aggravate obstruction <br/> - Risk of impaction [^1f280af8] |

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Clinical guidelines and expert consensus consistently advise against the use of laxatives in complete small bowel obstruction. The **MASCC guidelines** recommend avoiding laxatives in complete malignant bowel obstruction due to the risk of perforation and ischemia, and allow only cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives in partial obstruction under specialist supervision [^1f280af8]. The **FDA labeling** for polyethylene glycol (PEG) explicitly contraindicates its use in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction [^5369c909] [^6dbba693].

---

## Potential complications of laxative use in small bowel obstruction

Using laxatives in small bowel obstruction can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Perforation**: Increased intraluminal pressure and forceful peristalsis can cause bowel wall rupture, leading to peritonitis and sepsis [^ee942717].

- **Ischemia**: Compromised blood flow due to increased intraluminal pressure can cause bowel ischemia and necrosis [^1cf6cb5c].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Osmotic laxatives can cause significant electrolyte imbalances, particularly in patients with renal impairment [^ea017e24].

- **Worsening symptoms**: Laxatives can exacerbate abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting, delaying appropriate surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

## Clinical management of small bowel obstruction

The management of small bowel obstruction focuses on **supportive care and timely surgical intervention** when indicated:

- **Nasogastric decompression**: Reduces intraluminal pressure and relieves symptoms [^1cf6cb5c].

- **Intravenous fluids**: Corrects dehydration and electrolyte imbalances [^e228d1cc].

- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for complete obstruction, strangulation, or failure of conservative management [^d2c0bac8].

---

## Exceptions: partial small bowel obstruction

In partial small bowel obstruction, the cautious use of osmotic laxatives may be considered under specialist supervision to soften stools and facilitate minimal transit [^1f280af8]. However, stimulant and bulk-forming laxatives remain contraindicated due to the risks outlined above [^1f280af8].

---

Laxatives are **contraindicated in complete small bowel obstruction** due to the risk of perforation, ischemia, and worsening symptoms. Osmotic, stimulant, and bulk-forming laxatives should be avoided. In partial obstruction, osmotic laxatives may be used cautiously under specialist supervision, while stimulant and bulk-forming laxatives remain contraindicated.

TABLE 1
Risk Factors for GI Perforation in Patients on OIC Therapy

Over-the-counter laxatives are recommended as first-line therapy for OIC, followed by PAMORA monotherapy if patients show an inadequate response to first-line treatment. Due to the potential for GI perforation, PAMORAs are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected GI obstruction, and in patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction. – The effectiveness of any laxation therapy should be assessed as soon as possible, ideally within the first week after the start of OIC treatment. If PAMORA monotherapy does not appear to be effective, consideration of treatment with intestinal secretagogues also has been recommended, and other causative factors for constipation in the patient should be investigated. In addition, non-PAMORA agents, such as lubiprostone, are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected mechanical GI obstruction.

Patients with GI obstruction may present with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or vomiting. Other hallmarks include abdominal distension and cessation of flatus and bowel movements. Though mild, vague symptoms, such as bloating and abdominal discomfort, may occur in patients with constipation, they can also point towards early obstruction. Evaluation of the patient with suspected obstruction includes patient history, physical examination (eg, evaluating for abdominal tenderness or rigidity), laboratory testing, and radiography (starting with an abdominal plain X-ray), with identified patients undergoing surgical consultation. Detailed assessment of intestinal obstruction is outside the scope of this review and has been described elsewhere.

In patients receiving treatment for OIC, early recognition and prompt management of GI perforation are crucial to prevent morbidity and potential mortality. Patients should be counseled about clinical symptoms suggestive of GI perforation, such as the development of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain. Further, OIC treatment should be discontinued, and it is recommended that the patient seek urgent care. – As described above, perforation events are rare in patients with OIC and/or laxative use. However, there is an educational need to further understand the risk factors. Patients with OIC generally have more comorbidities than traditional patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. The presence of OIC and the use of any form of laxative can increase the risk for GI perforation, including in patients without preexisting constipation at the start of opioid analgesia. The clinical considerations discussed herein should be regarded as an opportunity for discussion and counseling for patients using opioid analgesics with or without concomitant OIC treatment.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^e0713bd4]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Our institution does not require ethical permission for secondary research using primary literature. The research is reported according to the Preferred Reporting terms for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA).

Target condition, search strategy, and study selection

We wrote a protocol and then developed and piloted a search string to identify imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables (including existing models) potentially predictive of SBO resolution without operative management (Online supplementary material 1). We used terms to identify studies of bowel obstruction/ileus. We included terms to identify prognostic research. We limited to adults and excluded narrative reviews, editorials, letters, etc. We searched the US National Library of Medicine PUBMED journal citation database from 2001 to 2021 inclusive. This search was supplemented by a subsequent review of references cited by included studies. The search was performed in September 2021 by two radiologists (VE, DB), one of whom had > 10 years of experience in systematic review design, data extraction, and analysis.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

We included studies investigating imaging variables potentially predictive of SBO resolution without the need for operative management (or, depending on how the research was framed, factors that predicted surgical intervention). We excluded studies limited to colonic obstruction; solely paediatric studies; studies solely of malignant obstruction; studies limited to early post-operative obstruction (a separate entity with different aetiology); studies limited to inflammatory bowel disease or chronic functional obstruction. We did not specifically set out to exclude studies that did not include intravenous contrast for CT scanning because we anticipated that the large majority would administer contrast, and contrast only influences one potential predictor variable, mucosal enhancement. We also anticipated that any representative consecutive series would include some patients in whom IV contrast is contraindicated but from whom other potential predictors could be extracted. We excluded studies reporting less than five patients in either operative or conservative groups, since these are underpowered.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^e228d1cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

### Treatment of opioid-induced constipation: inducing laxation and understanding the risk of gastrointestinal perforation [^ee942717]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving opioid analgesics may experience constipation [ie, opioid-induced constipation (OIC)], require treatment to induce laxation, and may be at risk for gastrointestinal perforation, an uncommon but potentially life-threatening condition. Management of OIC includes treatment with over-the-counter laxatives and peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs; methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, naldemedine). In patients receiving treatment for OIC, gastrointestinal perforation may result from the laxation process, causing disruption of the gastrointestinal lining that may already have compromised integrity. A PubMed literature review and a search of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database identified several cases of gastrointestinal perforation (life-threatening or with mortality) across the range of agents administered for the treatment of OIC or other constipation types. Methylnaltrexone in the subcutaneous form was the first PAMORA approved for OIC. Its real-world use in the ∼6 years before the availability of another OIC-indicated PAMORA helped establish the adverse-event profile of the class, and experience has been gained in identifying and treating appropriate patient populations. Class labeling of PAMORAs includes a contraindication in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or increased risk of recurrent obstruction. Appropriate patient selection during laxation therapy for OIC, regardless of treatment plan, involves consideration of the overall risk versus benefit in patients at increased risk of perforation due to comorbid medical conditions, concurrent medications, or recent gastrointestinal procedures. After initiating treatment for OIC, clinicians should assess the effectiveness of laxation therapy and carefully monitor for signs of gastrointestinal perforation.

### MASCC multidisciplinary evidence-based recommendations for the management of malignant bowel obstruction in advanced cancer [^cb113ca9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Laxatives

Suggestion: Oral osmotic laxatives should be considered in the management of impaired bowel movements in partial bowel obstruction but should be avoided in complete MBO (level of evidence: V; grade: D).

Patients with MBO present with reduced or no bowel movements. The review did not identify any studies that specifically examined the use of laxatives in this context. If patients have complete MBO, the use of laxatives is not recommended. Whereas, if patients have partial BO, the cautious use of oral osmotic laxatives (e.g. polyethylene glycol 3350, also known as macrogol) can be used. Osmotic laxatives draw water into the lumen of the bowel to soften stool and stimulate peristalsis. The use of bulk-forming laxatives (e.g. psyllium) is not advised as they will increase stool consistency and potentially worsen BO. If a digital rectal examination identifies a full rectum or fecal impaction, suppositories and fecal disimpaction can be considered in partial MBO. However, enemas should be used with caution and are generally not recommended in MBO due to the risk of bowel perforation. Stool softeners (e.g. docusate) may be used, but their effect on bowel movement frequency is not well established.

Analgesics

Pain is experienced by 70 to 90% of patients with MBO. Causes include abdominal distention, bowel spasms, and, in some cases, perforation. Pain can be intermittent, cramping, or continuous in nature. The WHO Guidelines for the Pharmacologic and Radiotherapeutic Management of Cancer Pain in Adults and Adolescents recommend that analgesics should be given by mouth whenever possible. However, patients with MBO often have significant nausea and vomiting and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tracts that prevent ingestion and absorption of oral analgesics. Consequently, the parenteral (subcutaneous or intravenous) and/or transdermal routes of administration should be considered for this population to deliver effective analgesia. A comparison of subcutaneous and intravenous routes found no differences, confirming both routes as feasible, effective, and safe.

### Manual repositioning of the small bowel and omentum prevents early postoperative small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a propensity score-matched study [^22375fb1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study benefits from a relatively large cohort, consistent surgical practices, and the use of propensity score matching to reduce confounding. However, it is not without limitations. As a retrospective, two-center study, the findings may be influenced by unmeasured biases and local practice patterns. Moreover, EPSBO diagnosis was based on clinical and imaging criteria without direct visualization of adhesions or transition points, and thus the precise mechanism by which Technique R exerts its effect remains speculative. Several potential confounding factors were considered. ERAS, including early feeding and mobilization, had been implemented before the start of the study and remained consistent throughout the study period. Mechanical bowel preparation was routinely performed unless complete obstruction was present. The use of oral laxatives or prokinetic agents was not standardized, but such medications were not systematically administered and were unlikely to differ significantly between groups. All surgeries were performed by certified and experienced colorectal surgeons, and the adoption of Technique R was coordinated at the departmental level, minimizing variability due to surgeon proficiency. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that unmeasured confounding cannot be entirely excluded, and these variables warrant evaluation in future prospective studies.

Despite these caveats, the simplicity and safety of Technique R, combined with its apparent benefit, make it an attractive addition to routine practice. It is an example of how small, thoughtful adjustments during surgery — rooted in anatomical common sense — may yield meaningful improvements in patient outcomes.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using the keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms, as well as searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched for using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were asked if they found any relevant reports missing.

Critical appraisal

Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford (Table 1). Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group has developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence (Table 2).

Table 1
Classification of evidence per article

Table 2
Grading of the conclusions and recommendations according to the level of evidence and strength of recommendation

Conclusion and recommendations are graded according to the level of evidence from strong ("there is strong evidence for," level A) to weak ("we cannot be confident," level D). Recommendations were graded as strong recommendations (level I) or weak recommendation or suggestions (level II). Recommendations were considered strong recommendations if there is sufficient evidence (level A or B) demonstrating that the benefits of an intervention are of clinical importance and clearly outweigh the harm of the intervention. A concept guideline was sent to all involved for comment and approval after which internal consensus was reached between the members of the working group. Amendments were made based upon these comments, leading to the final version of this updated guideline.

### A phase 2b, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of naldemedine for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic noncancer pain [^e6eb4976]. Pain Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

Patients' eligibility to participate in the study was assessed during screening. To be eligible, patients were required to: have a documented medical history of chronic noncancer pain for at least three months before screening; be taking a stable dose of a full opioid agonist equivalent to at least 30 mg oral morphine daily for one month or longer before screening; and have self-reported ongoing symptoms of OIC, defined as fewer than three spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week despite a stable regimen of laxatives and one or more of the following symptoms in at least 25% of bowel movements: straining, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and/or hard/small stools, defined as Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) score lower than 3.

Patients were required either to maintain a stable laxative regimen throughout the study (defined as any combination of laxatives that had been taken consistently in the 28 days before the start of the study) or not to use any laxatives.

The following exclusion criteria were applied: evidence of clinically significant GI disease, bowel dysfunction, bowel obstruction, or pelvic disorder that may cause constipation; a history of chronic constipation before starting analgesic medication or nonopioid causes of bowel dysfunction that may have contributed to constipation; severe constipation that had not been appropriately managed, such that the patient was at immediate risk of developing serious related complications; initiation of a new treatment regimen for OIC or a prokinetic agent within 28 days of screening; cancer treatment within the past five years; history or presence of any clinically important abnormality, medical condition, or use of concomitant medication(s), that could have interfered with the study; medically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal or thyroid dysfunction, or a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection; any medical or psychiatric condition that may have compromised the ability of the patient to understand and comply with the study protocol; current use of any prohibited medication, including opioid receptor antagonists, partial agonists, fentanyl, or meperidine; the inability to take oral medication; any history of illegal drug use in the past five years; surgery within one month of screening or planned surgery during study treatment that would, in the opinion of the investigators, have affected the study results; any relevant allergies; treatment with an investigational study drug in the 30 days before screening; or previous exposure to naldemedine. There were no specific exclusion criteria for patients with persistent or uncontrolled pain or with disruptions to the blood-brain barrier.

### Simplicity… [^2fb8c686]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Methylnaltrexone is labeled for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness who have not responded to laxative therapies. 1 As a selective antagonist of peripheral mu-opioid receptors, methylnaltrexone inhibits opioidinduced gastrointestinal hypomotility without central nervous system effects such as sedation or change in mental status.
2. SAFETY Methylnaltrexone is safe and unlikely to cause adverse effects. Less than 1 percent of patients have severe diarrhea requiring discontinuation of treatment. Methylnaltrexone does not reverse analgesia from opioids or cause opiate withdrawal symptoms. 2–4 The use of methylnaltrexone has not been studied beyond four months' duration in adults, and it has not been evaluated in children. It is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction. Methylnaltrexone is U. S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category B and its excretion in breast milk has not been determined.

1.

TOLERABILITY The most common adverse effects of methyl
- naltrexone are abdominal pain, flatulence, and nausea. 1, 3, 4 In clinical trials, discontinuation rates because of adverse events have been low: 6 percent of patients taking methylnaltrexone compared with 7 percent of those taking placebo.
2. EFFECTIVENESS One study involved older patients with advanced illness who received a median of 150 mg oral morphine equivalents per day and had fewer than three stools per week. Patients had been on opioids for at least two weeks before the methylnaltrexone intervention, and laxative therapy had failed. The median number of laxative drug classes used was two, with contact laxatives/stimulants, stool softeners, and osmotic agents used most often.

Bottom Line Methylnaltrexone can temporarily relieve opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness who have not responded to laxative treatment. However, it must be given by injection, is expensive, and has been studied only for short-term use.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^3e89aa11]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bowel obstruction is a common condition, accounting for 12–16% of acute surgical admissions. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is the most frequent site, comprising half of all emergency laparotomies performed in England and Wales between 2019 and 2020. The leading cause of SBO is intra-abdominal adhesions, with adhesional small bowel obstruction (aSBO) accounting for approximately 60% of cases. Optimal management of aSBO remains a subject of ongoing debate.

Non-operative management (NOM) for aSBO can be successful in over 70% of patients, with lower rates of short-term morbidity and mortality compared to early surgical intervention. However, it is crucial to promptly identify patients unsuitable for NOM and ensure timely surgical intervention when necessary, as delays exceeding 72 h significantly increase perioperative morbidity. CT imaging is important in decision-making, helping to detect bowel compromise, which usually contraindicates NOM.

Patients without clinical or radiological evidence of bowel compromise can safely undergo initial NOM, which includes gastrointestinal (GI) decompression with a nasogastric tube, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and early administration of water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA). WSCAs have a hyperosmolar effect on the bowel, which is thought to promote the resolution of aSBO by drawing water into the intestinal lumen. Although direct animal studies evaluating this effect are lacking, clinical observations and prior studies suggest that WSCAs may have a therapeutic role in addition to their established function as a diagnostic stratification tool. Although opinions on their administration approach and therapeutic effects vary, they play a key role in assessing the likelihood of success for NOM. Gastrografin (diatrizoate) is the most common WSCA used for aSBO. Although alternative contrast agents such as Omnipaque (iohexol) and Urografin (amidotrizoate) are widely used diagnostically and have excellent safety profiles, there is limited evidence supporting their use as treatment options for aSBO.

A shortage of Gastrografin due to supply chain challenges, raised concerns about the impact on treatment and outcomes for NOM patients. This study aimed to assess the management and outcomes of patients presenting with aSBO in the context of a shortage of Gastrografin.

With no one generally accepted approach to evaluate patients with suspected small-bowel obstruction (SBO), standard CT has emerged as the preeminent imaging modality and should be considered in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected high-grade SBO. Playing less significant roles in the diagnosis of acute SBO are barium enemas and the small-bowel examination.

Water enema multidetector CT technique and interpretation

Bowel preparation

During the early years of our experience, we recommended that preliminary bowel cleansing should be obtained unless contraindicated by emergency conditions or poor performance status. At our department, prior to elective WE-MDCT patients receive a standard oral bowel preparation consisting in 4–6 doses of a laxative isoosmolar non-absorbable solution such as polyethylene glycol powder (Isocolan, Bracco, or SELG-ESSE 1000, Promefarm, Milan, Italy) dissolved in 500 mL water per dose the day before the examination, in association with a low-residue diet for 3 days. Patients then fast for 12 h after a liquid dinner the evening before the scheduled exam.

Recently, other centres have suggested that cathartic bowel cleansing may be unnecessary, since WE-MDCT yields satisfactory results even if the colon is not clean, as tumours can be easily distinguished from faecal residues. On the basis of these experiences, we started performing WE-MDCT with no or limited bowel preparation, such as with laxative (sennosides) capsules plus magnesium citrate solution, in patients with acute intestinal symptoms.

Contraindications

We do not perform or recommend WE-MDCT without bowel preparation when toxic megacolon, free perforation, and acute peritonitis are clinically suspected and/or radiographically detected. In patients with clinical and/or radiographic diagnosis of large bowel obstruction, which is caused by CRC in almost 60% of cases, retrograde colonic distension is unnecessary because standard enhanced MDCT reliably evaluates the site and underlying cause of obstruction thanks to the intrinsic contrast provided by the upstream dilatation with endoluminal fluid.

### Adverse effects of laxatives [^ea017e24]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Laxatives are among the most commonly used drugs or additives. Most are quite safe when used judiciously, intermittently when possible, and in the absence of contraindications. Bulking agents and nonabsorbable compounds such as lactulose can cause bloating but have very few serious adverse effects except for the allergic reaction to psyllium preparations. Osmotic laxatives containing poorly absorbable ions such as magnesium or phosphate can cause metabolic disturbances, particularly in the presence of renal impairment. However, if taken intermittently, in the absence of conditions such as ileus or bowel obstruction, they have few adverse effects. Polyethylene glycol solutions are emerging as an effective and safe mode of treatment for chronic constipation. Of stimulant laxatives, senna compounds and bisacodyl are the most commonly used. Although there are data to support the neoplastic potential of this class of drugs in in vitro studies, epidemiologic data in humans so far has not established a clear link between these laxatives and colonic neoplasia. The link between stimulant laxatives and structural changes, such as the "cathartic colon" or enteric nerve damage, is not well established either. Danthron compounds should be avoided because of hepatotoxicity.

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^8875b06b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-malignant bowel obstruction

Several studies support the use of a low-fibre diet in non-malignant disease where intestinal structures are present, for example in inflammatory bowel disease. Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology recommend that patients with stricturing Crohn's may need to alter their intake of fibre. Similarly, guidelines from the British Dietetic Association state that dietary fibre is contraindicated in stricturing Crohn's disease, despite there being no strong evidence from clinical trials for this recommendation.

It may seem logical reasoning to apply the same dietary modification recommendations to MBO where presentation and symptoms of obstruction may be similar, or where disease may result in a similar narrowing within the bowel lumen. However, the goals of care are significantly different in those with MBO secondary to advanced disease compared with goals of care in non-malignant bowel obstruction. Efficacy and safety of the transfer of advice from one condition to another are not established. Additionally, considering dietary fibre as a singular substance rather than a heterogeneous group of substances does not adequately consider properties such as solubility, which is likely to affect tolerance and risk of obstruction in MBO.

Strengths and limitations

Whilst effort was made to capture all language that might be used to define the concepts of diet and obstruction, it is possible that searches did not capture all relevant results. Due to the anticipated lack of published literature, a scoping review was conducted rather than a systematic review, using the PRISMA-ScR format. Data charting and extraction were limited and inter-study comparisons challenging. Several items did not present full details of interventions reported within the scope of an abstract, or report full results or outcome measures.

There is a wealth of non-academic literature available publicly online regarding diet, cancer and bowel obstruction. Information produced by international healthcare providers, charities and patient advocacy groups, businesses, social media content and personal blogs aimed at those with MBO has not been included within the scope of this review, given that the abundance of misinformation and non-evidenced dietary advice relating to nutrition and cancer is well recognised. Whilst a scoping review of this information would be valuable and has not been published to date, the aim of the present review was to evaluate evidence rather than current practice, and therefore only literature published in scientific journals was within the scope of this review. Similarly, the role, appropriateness and ethics surrounding clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in advanced malignancy are much debated within existing literature, but are beyond the scope of this review.

Initial evaluation

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, Lactate, Electrolytes, BUN/Creat; first step of diagnostic work up for ASBO is supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray which can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops and the absence of gas in the colonic section.

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

Secondary evaluation

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B).

CT scan often allows to confirm the presence of complete obstruction, to reach the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

Ultrasound has a limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with distended bowel, because the air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual US findings are: distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around transition point, free fluid (sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications (Level of Evidence 2c GoR C).

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A). Water-soluble contrast administration has both diagnostic and therapeutic value.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^ee340ab9]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays the key role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction as neither patient presentation, the clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or guide management. This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Laparoscopy for acute small bowel obstruction: indication or contraindication? [^417d73dd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a relatively common cause of emergency hospital admission, most frequently due to postoperative adhesions. With increased experience and technical advances in laparoscopic surgery, the laparoscopic management of acute SBO has become feasible and potentially superior to the open approach. This retrospective study presents the authors' experience with laparoscopic treatment of SBO over a 6-year period to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and clinical outcome of this therapeutic method and to present the author's methodology.

Methods

From April 2003 to January 2009, 32 patients hospitalized in the author's department for acute SBO underwent elective laparoscopic treatment after failure of conservative measures. Standard laparoscopic techniques and instruments were used.

Results

Postoperative adhesions were identified in 62.5% of patients (n = 20) as well as tumor (n = 3), incarcerated ventral hernia (n = 4), incarcerated femoral hernia (n = 3), internal hernia (n = 1), and Crohn's disease (n = 1). The conversion rate was 18.7% (n = 6), and the postoperative complication rate was 3.25% (n = 1). The mean operative time was 78 min. Bowel function returned after a mean of 3.2 days, and the mean hospital stay was 4.6 days.

Conclusions

The laparoscopic treatment of acute SBO is an attractive alternative to the open approach. However, it must be kept in mind that surgery longer than 120 min is a significant predictor of postoperative morbidity, that bowel injury may be missed at the time of operation and can be avoided with improved surgical techniques and appropriate instrumentation, that lysis of all intraabdominal adhesions is unnecessary, and that a low threshold for conversion should be maintained, especially in cases of severe, dense, extensive adhesions.

### Naldemedine: a new option for OIBD [^c60576b2]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Naldemedine: Clinical Data

Indications and Contraindications

Naldemedine is approved in many countries such as the EU, US, and Japan for the treatment of OIC in adults who were previously treated with laxatives without efficacy. Naldemedine has been used to treat OIC in adults with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain.

Following dose-finding studies, the recommended naldemedine dose was determined to be 0.2 mg to be administrated once daily, since this dosage was deemed to be the most effective and the safest one. Naldemedine can be co-administrated with other laxatives, since clinical trials demonstrated an additive effect, compared to placebo. In cases of opioid therapy interruption, naldemedine should also be suspended.

There are no specific data regarding the use of naldemedine in pediatric patients, neither during pregnancy nor breastfeeding. Embryo-fetal development studies showed no malformations after naldemedine administration. However, naldemedine should only be given to pregnant women if strictly necessary, since opioid withdrawal is possible in the fetusand the neonate. Similarly, it is contraindicated during breastfeeding, since it passes into the human milk, however, breastfeeding may be resumed 3 days after the last naldemedine dose.

Other contraindications include hypersensitivity to the drug, suspected or known GI perforation/obstruction and severe hepatic disease.

Dose-Finding Studies

Two dose-finding studies have been conducted on naldemedine, one in CNCP patientsand one in cancer patients. Both studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and evaluated patients receiving 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mg naldemedine or placebo. Patients aged 18 years or older, with chronic pain for ≥ 3 months, using opioids at a stable dosage of ≥ 30 mg/day morphine equivalent for ≥ 1 month, with a diagnosis of OIC, were eligible. Regular use of laxatives at baseline could be continued during the study period, according to the investigator's opinion. In both studies the primary outcome was change in the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) week from baseline during the last 14-day of the treatment period. Baseline was defined as the average number of SBMs/week during the 2 weeks before random assignment.

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^305083a9]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

### Small bowel obstruction: a practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^e1325bdf]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with SBO is to immediately identify strangulation and need for urgent operative intervention, concurrent with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites resolution of partial obstructions, shortening time to removal of nasogastric tube liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital. Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot over emphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic LOA.

Identifying patients with small bowel obstruction who need operative intervention and those who will fail nonoperative management is a challenge. Without indications for urgent intervention, a computed tomography scan with/without intravenous contrast should be obtained to identify location, grade, and etiology of the obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions resolve with nonoperative management. Open and laparoscopic operative management are acceptable approaches. Malnutrition needs to be identified early and managed, especially if the patient is to undergo operative management. Confounding conditions include age greater than 65, post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, virgin abdomen, pregnancy, hernia, and early postoperative state.

### What is the evidence for dietary modification in the management and prevention of malignant bowel obstruction? A scoping review [^09d5ee6a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common complication in advanced malignancy, particularly in gynaecological and gastrointestinal tumours that spread within the abdominal cavity. MBO affects up to 51% of patients with recurrent gynaecological cancers, and malignant obstructions of the small bowel are more prevalent than large bowel obstructions.

MBO typically presents as colicky abdominal pain, distention, nausea and bilious vomiting, and an inability to pass wind or stool. This occurs due to either a functional or mechanical obstruction, the aetiology and pathophysiology of which are well described elsewhere. MBO is often recurrent with symptoms increasing in severity and frequency over time, until, without surgical intervention, obstruction becomes a permanent state. This results in frequent, protracted hospital admissions, with significant burden both for patients and healthcare services. In addition to diminishing well-being and quality of life (QoL), patients with MBO have reported lack of attention to nutritional problems, fear of starvation and unmet supportive care needs.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^210b9657]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Subacute bowel obstruction

Experience suggests that important medical causes include abnormal electrolyte balance, opioid drugs, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, excessive faecal loading, severe fat malabsorption and excessive dietary fibre.

A trial of antibiotics and/or a low-fat diet (if steatorrhoea is present) and/or treatment with a bile acid sequestrant as appropriate may help. If the radiology suggests focal colonic faecal loading or a colonic site of obstruction or there is iron deficiency anaemia, colonoscopy should be considered. Excess fibre in the diet may precipitate subacute obstruction if a stricture is present. Some patients are very sensitive to opiates and can have prolonged colonic inertia even following small doses.

If low-fibre diets are indicated they should be prescribed by a qualified dietitian, should initially be time limited and the clinical benefit from the diet reviewed. Additional laxatives may be required. Data may emerge for the role of hyperbaric oxygen in treating patients with subacute obstruction due to radiation-induced fibrosis from the national ongoing HOT 2 trial (EudraCT No 2008-002152-26).

Surgery with a view to releasing adhesions or resecting strictures after previous pelvic radiotherapy can be particularly challenging because of dense abdominal fibrosis, and carries significantly higher risks of complications (eg, anastomotic leakages, postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis and intestinal fistulation) than surgery in a non-irradiated patient. Such surgery should be performed only by experienced surgeons with a low threshold for proximal faecal diversion. If an enteric motility disorder is also present (not uncommon), surgery may not lead to resolution of the symptoms.

Obstruction due to recurrent cancer

If cancer is present, the nature of the intervention should be influenced by the expected prognosis of the recurrence. Selected patients with no ascites, life expectancy > 2 months and good performance status may benefit from palliative decompressive surgery, but placement of self-expanding metal stents (if possible) appears to offer a better outcome. Expert medical management with opioids, antispasmodics (eg, hyoscine butyl bromide), antiemetics, antisecretory agents (eg, octreotide), corticosteroids and nasogastric tubes or venting gastrostomies can be effective in helping to control symptoms. Early input from surgeons and palliative care specialists should be sought.

Chronic syndromes: key facts

Symptoms are unreliable at identifying the underlying cause
Many cancer treatments have systemic effects and are not limited by normal anatomical boundaries
Patients may not report even severe symptoms reliably
Patients and clinicians may differ as to what constitute significant symptoms.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of small bowel obstruction: evidence-based recommendations [^1cf6cb5c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

Objective

This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the current literature.

Discussion

SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems are present. However, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention. History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging, and though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods. Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. Nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy. Surgical service evaluation and admission are recommended.

Conclusion

SBO is a common reason for admission from the ED. Knowledge of recent literature can optimize diagnosis and management.

### Barium sulfate (E-Z-paque) [^0641c8e5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity reactions. The manifestations include hypotension, bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments, dermal reactions including rashes, urticaria, and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal
Barium Leakage

The use of E-Z-PAQUE is contraindicated in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications (4)]. Administration of E-Z-PAQUE may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence of conditions such as carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, especially distal to the stomach. Barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation.

5.3 Delayed
Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate
proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction
or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated
with feces) and may cause abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction,
or rarely perforation. Patients with the following conditions are
at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis
at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility, electrolyte imbalance,
dehydration, on a low residue diet, on medications that delay GI motility,
constipation, cystic fibrosis, Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the
risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain
adequate hydration during and in the days following a barium sulfate
procedure. Consider the administration of laxatives.

5.4 Aspiration
Pneumonitis

The use of E-Z-PAQUE is contraindicated in patients at high risk
of aspiration [see Contraindications (4)]. Oral administration of barium is associated
with aspiration pneumonitis, especially in patients with a history
of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism. Vomiting
following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead to aspiration
pneumonitis. In patients at risk for aspiration, begin the procedure
with a small ingested volume of E-Z-PAQUE. Discontinue administration
of E-Z-PAQUE immediately if aspiration is suspected.

Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms

A number of groups have provided recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of constipation;, however, no standardized treatment guidelines have gained acceptance in general medical practice. Although the evidence for a number of interventions (including modifications to diet and lifestyle) is weak or contradictory, all the guidelines recommend that these be tried before pharmacological intervention. In general, where treatment pathways are recommended, the sequence is:

Exclude other pathologies and secondary causes.,
Begin treatment with dietary and lifestyle adjustments.,
Move to osmotic laxatives, stool softeners and bulk-forming agents – there is no consensus on the order in which these should be tried.
Move to stimulant laxatives, suppositories and/or enemas,– some guidelines recommend medical supervision at this stage.
Surgery should be used as a last resort or to treat identified disorders that require surgical correction.

Although prokinetic agents feature in the two sets of US guidelines (Grade A recommendation), these are now out of date. Tegaserod has now been limited to emergency use in the US and has not received licensing approval in the EU. Prucalopride has recently received EU approval for the treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief; this is not mentioned in the guidelines.

Once organic disorders and obstructions have been excluded, a functional bowel disorder is the most likely explanation for the constipation. Most patients with chronic constipation report minimal abdominal bloating or discomfort associated with their other symptoms of chronic constipation; however, in some patients, as symptoms often overlap, it may be difficult to distinguish chronic constipation and IBS-C. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Chronic Constipation Task Force defined IBS-C as clinically important abdominal discomfort associated with symptoms of constipation. National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for IBS indicate a positive diagnosis only if the person has abdominal pain/discomfort that is either relieved by defecation, or associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form, and at least two of the following: altered stool passage; abdominal bloating, distension, tension, or hardness, symptoms made worse by eating and passage of mucus.

Orally administered barium
sulfate may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon,
causing obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated
barium associated with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis,
bowel obstruction, or rarely perforation. Patients with the following
conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths:
 severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, impaired GI motility,
electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking
medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients
with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the
risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain
adequate hydration during and in the days following a barium sulfate
procedure. Consider the administration of laxatives.

5.4 Aspiration Pneumonitis

The use of E-Z-HD is contraindicated

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^d7a320d4]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified 6 potential predictors associated strongly with the need for surgery (5 positively and 1 negatively; 3 were derived from CT), and 3 associated strongly with ischaemia at surgery (all positively; 2 were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that appear to display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Clinical benefit of oral lactulose for postoperative care of pateints with complicated appendicitis using propensity score matching analysis [^e335a247]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

According to previous reports, readmission within 30 days was required for about 3.7% of patients following the appendectomy and 7.7% (666/8688) for patients with perforated appendicitis. Under our management protocol, the overall need for readmission was lower in the laxative administration patients compared with the control. Accordingly, the current laxative administration reduces the need for surgical intervention in adhesive small bowel obstruction, which has not been reported in the literature before. Previous report suggested that ranged from 6 to 11% of ASBO might develop to bowel strangulation. In the current study, the overall strangulation rate was only 0.8% for patients with laxative administration. We believe that beside its osmotic nature, other mechanisms may be involved in the current performance of laxative. Laxative may also reduce the inflammatory response of postoperative gastrointestinal tract, which was characteristic by edema and inflammation, and thereby reduce ASBO. In the current research, CRP enhanced quickly following the operation and recovered better with laxative administration compared with the control, confirm the dampening of local inflammation by laxative, which might explain the current clinical results, although the exact mechanism is difficult to determine in this clinical setting.

In theory, stimulation of the bowel might cause bowel strangulation or anastomotic dehiscence. But in the present study, there was no complication or mortality that could be attributed to the laxative usage. The incidence of bowel strangulation or anastomotic leak was comparable for the two groups, supporting the point that promoting GI recovery by laxative should not compromise with postoperative complications. There was also no evidence that the use of laxative would increase the risk of nausea, abdominal cramps. Because of the fluid shifting into bowel lumen, it may further dehydrate the patient following the adverse effect of obstruction. The oral laxative is very little absorption making this drug quite safe to use even for a long time. In fact, adverse effects for laxative usage in small bowel obstruction have rarely been mentioned, including serum electrolyte abnormalities and other adverse events. Furthermore it is important for controlled diet and the reabilitation treatment for the canalization, which should be preceded by re-educative treatment.

### Management of common symptoms in terminally ill patients: part II. constipation, delirium and dyspnea [^15cc707d]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

In addition to pain, patients who are approaching the end of life commonly have other symptoms. Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis with a gastrointestinal motility stimulant laxative and a stool softener is appropriate in terminally ill patients who are being given opioids. Patients with low performance status are not candidates for surgical treatment of bowel obstruction. Cramping abdominal pain associated with mechanical bowel obstruction often can be managed with morphine (titrating the dosage for pain) and octreotide. Delirium is common at the end of life and is frequently caused by a combination of medications, dehydration, infections or hypoxia. Haloperidol is the pharmaceutical agent of choice for the management of delirium. Dyspnea, the subjective sensation of uncomfortable breathing, is often treated by titration of an opioid to relieve the symptom; a benzodiazepine is used when anxiety is a component of the breathlessness.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^4636251d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has a great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high grade SBO. However CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO, it can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a NPV of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary. Oral is not

Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery.

This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction.

MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- Conservative treatment and timing for surgery

The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically. Several issues are raised when managing patients with ASBO.

The first question is whether to operate or not to operate

Patients without the signs of strangulation or peritonitis or history of persistent vomiting or combination of CT scan signs (free fluid, mesenteric oedema, lack of faeces signa, devascularized bowel) and partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (LoE 1a GoR A)

In the absence of any signs of strangulation, patients with an adhesive SBO can be managed safely with non-operative treatment and tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Patients who had surgery within the six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, patients with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia and leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia and patients who started to have signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidate for conservative treatment ± WSCA administration (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A)

### Impact of patient subgroups on the efficacy and safety of methylnaltrexone for opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness [^747c8360]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of methylnaltrexone, including the phase 3 302 (NCT00402038) study and the phase 4 4000 study (NCT00672477) (Figure 1). In study 302, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of methylnaltrexone 0.15 mg/kg or placebo every other day (QOD) for 14 days, with the opportunity to increase the dose to 0.30 mg/kg on day 9 in patients with < 3 rescue-free laxations at the discretion of the investigator. After completion of the double-blind treatment period, patients could enroll in the 3-month open-label extension phase, in which they could receive methylnaltrexone as needed up to every 24 hours. Study 4000 included patients randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous methylnaltrexone 8 mg or 12 mg for patients weighing 38 kg to < 62 kg or ≥ 62 kg, respectively, or placebo administered QOD for a maximum of 7 doses/14 days, with the option to enroll in a 10-week open-label extension portion. The 2 studies were approved by either a central or a local institutional review board and followed Good Clinical Practice and Declaration of Helsinki principles. Each patient provided written informed consent before enrollment in the studies.

Figure 1
Study design.

Study Population

In both studies, eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of advanced illness, which was defined as terminal disease incurable cancer or other end-stage diseases with a life expectancy of ≥ 1 month. Patients were receiving opioids routinely for discomfort or pain management for ≥ 2 weeks and taking a stable regimen of opioids (defined as no reduction in opioid dose of ≥ 50%) and laxatives for ≥ 3 days before the first dose. OIC was defined as either < 3 bowel movements during the previous week and no clinically significant laxation in the 24 hours before the first dose of study drug or no clinically significant laxation within 48 hours before the first dose of study drug.

Exclusion Criteria

Key exclusion criteria included history of methylnaltrexone treatment, any disease process suggestive of mechanical bowel obstruction, an indwelling peritoneal catheter, clinically active diverticular disease, evidence of fecal impaction, peritonitis, acute surgical abdomen, any potential nonopioid cause of bowel dysfunction (in the opinion of the investigator), body weight < 38 kg, and history of fecal ostomy.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^1d2c60d3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: a plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^ea773694]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is few evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of the elderly patient with small bowel obstruction. The scarce literature available demonstrates that elderly patients have an increased risk for complications and mortality and might benefit from earlier surgical intervention. It is important to take patients' preferences into account starting treatment in general and offering surgery specifically, because an operation may significantly affect quality of life. An assessment of frailty and a comprehensive geriatric approach to the elderly with small bowel obstruction with multidisciplinary specialist care is required from the start and preferably in the ED. More research on management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients is urgently needed considering the rise in this age group (Table 1).

Table 1
Overview of known and unknown facts concerning small bowel obstruction in elderly patients

We conclude that management of small bowel obstruction requires more than just a 'copy and paste' of treatment recommendations and guidelines based on studies in younger adults. Based on current knowledge about frail elderly and small bowel obstruction, a flowchart has been developed that offers an approach to diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction (Fig. 2).

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement on evaluation of obstructed defecation [^f158860d]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urogynecologic Society best-practice — evaluation of obstructed defecation: No specific symptom, physical examination finding, or imaging finding is sensitive and specific for obstructed defecation, and treatment decisions should be based on symptoms rather than findings on imaging. In most women with bulging symptoms and posterior vaginal wall prolapse, no imaging is required before surgery, and imaging may be most helpful in cases in which symptoms do not match physical examination findings (eg, defecography can show dyssynergic pelvic floor contractions in a woman with defecation dysfunction). Imaging should be reserved for cases in which gastrointestinal dysfunction is suspected or the history is unclear or not consistent with examination findings. Obstructed defecation and the associated symptoms and signs may be consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction rather than the cause. Therefore, evaluation of gastrointestinal function is paramount in the treatment of defecatory dysfunction because the surgical repair addresses the defect in the anatomy, not its underlying cause. Anterior rectoceles seen on imaging that are not symptomatic do not need treatment, and small bowel in the posterior cul-de-sac (enterocele) is found in healthy, asymptomatic women and should not be considered pathologic. MRI, ultrasound, and fluoroscopy defecography provide functional studies of pelvic organs, imaging studies of defecation are most physiologic when done in a sitting position, and MRI is the best modality to visualize soft tissue injury. Slow-transit constipation should be ruled out in patients with infrequent bowel movements, refractory to laxative or other conservative measures, and patients with a recent and persistent change in bowel habits, excessive straining or a sense of incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and anemia have risk factors for colorectal cancer and warrant endoscopic gastrointestinal evaluation.

Results

- Definition, risk factors, natural history and diagnosis

Patients with ASBO treated nonsurgically have shorter hospital stay, however they have an higher recurrence rate, shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is the same. (Level of Evidence 2b)

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C)

CT-scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B)

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B)

MRI and US are of limited value for ASBO and should be limited to patients with contraindications for CT scan/iodine contrast (Level of Evidence 2c GoR C)

In patients undergoing initial non operative conservative management, a water-soluble contrast follow-through should be performed in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A)

Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

SBO can be classified according to completeness: Partial vs. Complete (or high grade vs. low grade), according to etiology: Adhesional vs. Non-adhesional, according to timing: Early vs. Late (> 30 days after surgery).

The most important risk factor for adhesive SBO is the type of surgery and extent of peritoneal damage. Surgeries of the colon and rectum are associated with a higher risk of adhesion-related problems. Total colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the procedure with the highest incidence for adhesion-related problems with an overall incidence of SBO of 19.3%. Other high-risk procedures include gynecologic surgeries (11.1%) and open colectomy (9.5%).

In both SBO and LBO, evidence of vascular compromise to the gut mandates surgical intervention. Most patients with pseudo-obstruction respond to conservative therapy or neostigmine. Endoscopic decompression is indicated in recalcitrant cases, with surgery reserved as a last resort.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for adhesive small bowel obstruction non-operative management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 h after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery with an active therapeutic role.

The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality, but adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction, shifting fluids into bowel lumen; in some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

The contrast medium may be administered on the dosage of 50–150 ml, either orally or via nasogastric tube, and can be given both at immediate admission and after an attempt of initial traditional conservative treatment of 48 h. The practice of giving water-soluble contrast at 48 h may reduce both the risk of aspiration pneumonia and of dehydration because the patient should have been adequately rehydrated. In this situation, the contrast material can be diluted with water.

Rare anaphylactoid reactions following the use of oral contrast media have been reported.

Caution in their administration may be warranted in patients at high risk of gastropathy.

Ultrasound

Small bowel obstruction can be diagnosed with ultrasound if there are > 2.5-cm dilated loops of the bowel that are proximal to collapsed loops of bowel and if there is decreased or absent peristalsis activity. Using ultrasound for small bowel obstruction diagnosis has 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

Visualization of large bowel obstruction with ultrasound is as good as computed tomography. Computed tomography is clearly superior to ultrasound in terms of the etiologic definition for both small bowel obstruction and large bowel obstruction. Ultrasound performs better than planar abdominal X-ray in large bowel obstruction.

### Linaclotide utilization and potential for off-label use and misuse in three European countries [^2f7e471c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Linaclotide is approved for adults with moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation (IBS-C). Linaclotide is not indicated for weight loss or for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); it is contraindicated in patients with mechanical bowel obstruction (MBO). Some patients with obesity or eating disorders (ED) may use linaclotide off-label for weight loss or as a laxative.

Objectives:

To describe the use of linaclotide in clinical practice, including patients with potential for off-label use or misuse.

Methods:

Post-authorization safety study conducted in three databases from the linaclotide launch date to 2017: the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom (UK), the Information System for Research in Primary Care database in Spain and the linked Patient, Prescription and Causes of Death Registries in Sweden. Cohorts of patients were identified as having IBS using diagnostic and treatment codes; IBS subtypes were identified using symptoms and treatment codes; patients with obesity, ED, MBO, and IBD were identified using diagnostic codes or body mass index.

Results:

There were 1319, 1981, and 5081 linaclotide users from the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden with a median age of 45, 57, and 51 years, respectively; most were females. In the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden, respectively: 59.0%, 60.3%, and 31.3% of linaclotide users had an IBS diagnosis recorded, and among those, 68.8%, 61.3%, and 92.7% were classified as IBS-C. The proportions of linaclotide users considered at risk for potential off-label use for weight loss or as a laxative were 17.1%, 29.7%, and 1.7%, and the proportions of users considered at risk of misuse due to a history of MBO or IBD were 3.5%, 4.6%, and 5.7% in the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden, respectively.

Conclusions:

Potential linaclotide off-label use and misuse appears limited, as evidenced by the small sizes of the patient subgroups at risk for off-label use and misuse.

### Pathogenesis and clinical and economic consequences of postoperative ileus [^d616f631]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus is a preventable disease with surprising economic consequences. Understanding the triad of dysmotility in conjunction with an enhanced recovery program improves patient outcome, decreases length of stay in hospital, and lowers the cost. Alvimopan and other investigational promotility medications can help attain these goals. Surgeons should avoid labeling all postoperative abdominal distention as ileus, which not only prevents timely diagnosis and treatment of early postoperative small bowel obstruction or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction but also increases patient morbidity and mortality.

### SBO ACTION: conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard conTrast agents ON outcomes [^db757a84]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the study's strengths lie in its modern, prospective, and multicentre nature, which is necessary for capturing variations in practice. This approach has generated testable hypotheses and provided valuable insights into how surgeons have translated data from clinical trials into real-world practice. Although sites were provided with general guidance, contrast administration and follow-up protocols were not strictly standardized, which may have introduced variability in practice. Furthermore, the data collected were unable to fully capture factors such as the presence of a hostile abdomen, which may have influenced treatment decisions. A recent survey of surgeons examining their beliefs and rationale for WSCA use found considerable divergence in opinions about its primary mode of action — whether diagnostic, therapeutic, or both. These findings highlight the need for greater standardization in contrast use protocols and a clearer understanding of when and why WSCA is employed in clinical practice. Future research should explore patient-reported outcomes and alternative contrast agents to further optimize the management of aSBO.

Large bowel obstruction

Question 2.1

What is the optimum imaging modality for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of malignant large bowel obstruction?

Recommendation: To diagnose malignant large bowel obstruction a contrast‐enhanced CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. A plain abdominal radiograph is unnecessary.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

The sensitivity and specificity of abdomino‐pelvic contrast‐enhanced CT scan in the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction is high (sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%) and it outperforms other imaging modalities including US scan and plain abdominal radiography. Performing a plain abdominal radiograph may delay time to CT and a definitive diagnosis. A CT provides effective local and distant staging information to inform treatment decisions. When CT is equivocal about the cause of obstruction, endoscopic assessment may be helpful.

In a stable patient, endoscopic evaluation can confirm a radiological diagnosis, define the aetiology when CT is inconclusive, provide tissue biopsies for histological assessment and be used for combined endoscopic/fluoroscopic placement of a stent for obstruction. However, use of endoscopy is not mandatory where the diagnosis is not in doubt and surgical treatment is planned.

The role of self‐expanding metal stents (SEMSs)

Question 2.2

What are the indications and contraindications for self‐expanding metal stents?

Recommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents can be used for the treatment of malignant large bowel obstruction as either a definitive procedure for palliation or as a bridge to surgery.

Level of evidence: I

Grade of recommendation: A

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Recommendation: Self‐expanding metal stents should definitely not be used in the presence of perforation, peritonitis or systemic toxicity and low rectal lesions. Self‐expanding metal stents are relatively contraindicated when the patient is taking anti‐angiogenic chemotherapy and for benign causes of large bowel obstruction.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

National guidelines concur that the SEMS is the treatment of choice for malignant large bowel obstruction (MLBO) in the palliative setting due to its reduction in stoma rates, hospital length of stay, inpatient mortality and intensive care unit admission rates, and time to chemotherapy.

Malignant bowel obstruction pathophysiology and symptoms — site, severity, and course: MBO can occur in the small or large bowel, with small BO being more common; obstruction may be partial or complete and occur at single or multiple transition points, leading to abdominal pain, cramps, distention, nausea, vomiting, absence of gas and stool passage, and occasionally overflow diarrhea, with symptoms usually starting gradually and worsening with complete obstruction; re-obstruction and malnutrition are common, and malnutrition is an independent predictor of poor survival.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^49cdf039]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

These data suggest that recent training and interest or membership in minimally invasive surgery associations influence surgeons' choice for laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.

Laparoscopy seems to have an advantage above laparotomy in terms of adhesion formation to the abdominal wall and to the operative site, both because of no further scar on anterior parietal peritoneum and because usually the exploration of the ileum is limited to solve the cause of obstruction, extending the dissection until the ligament of Treitz only when the cause of obstruction is not be detected.

Laparoscopic adhesiolysis for small bowel obstruction has a number of potential advantages: (1) less postoperative pain, (2) faster return of intestinal function, (3) shorter hospital stay, (4) reduced recovery time, allowing an earlier return to full activity, (5) decreased wound complications, and (6) decreased postoperative adhesion formation.

These data have been validated in a meta-analysis in which Ming-Zhe Li et al. found that there was no statistically significant difference between open versus laparoscopic adhesiolysis in the number of intraoperative bowel injuries, nor for wound infections, neither with respect to the overall mortality. Conversely there was a statistically significant difference concerning pulmonary complications and a considerable reduction in prolonged ileus in the laparoscopic group compared with the open group. The authors sustain that laparoscopic approach is safer than the open procedure, but in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in selected patients.

Besides Stephanian et al. observed that minimal trauma, short duration of the operation, good cosmetic results and uncomplicated course of postoperative period witness the efficacy of laparoscopic approach.

In a consensus conference on laparoscopic adhesiolysis, an italian panel of experts recommended intraoperative selection of patients after esploratory laparoscopy, because this approach allows as many patients as possible to benefit from this mini-invasive procedure. They agree that the only absolute exclusion criteria for laparoscopic adhesiolysis in SBO are those related to pneumoperitoneum (i.e. hemodynamic instability or cardiopulmonary impairment); all other contraindication are relative and shoud be judjed on a case-to-case basis, depending on the laparoscopic skills of the surgeon. Moreover non resolving partial incomplete SBO(after a negative Gastrografin test) and chronic obstructive symptoms are the ideal application for laparoscopic adhesiolysis with rates of conversion as low as 8.7%.

### Treatment of opioid-induced constipation: inducing laxation and understanding the risk of gastrointestinal perforation [^d303bce9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Patients with OIC who require treatment to induce laxation are at risk for GI perforation. Although several cases of GI perforation were reported within the initial few years after the availability of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone, the first PAMORA to be approved for the treatment of OIC, limited cases of life-threatening or fatal events of GI perforation have been reported subsequently for oral and subcutaneous PAMORAs, with similar rates observed across those administered in the treatment of OIC. This decrease is likely related to improvements in patient selection and in risk-management strategies. However, appropriate selection of patients is critical to reduce the risk of GI perforation during laxation therapy for OIC. In patients considered at risk of GI obstruction or perforation due to comorbid medical conditions, concurrent medication use, and/or recent GI procedures, avoidance of pharmacologic laxation therapy may be merited. After initiating treatment for OIC, clinicians should assess the effectiveness of therapy across all laxation-inducing agents and carefully monitor patients for signs of GI perforation to optimize patient outcomes and limit treatment-related morbidity.

### Long-term outcomes of gastrografin in small bowel obstruction [^cdda1d37]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The gastrografin (GG) challenge is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool used to treat patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO); however, long-term data on SBO recurrence after the GG challenge remain limited. We hypothesized that patients treated with GG would have the same long-term recurrence as those treated before the implementation of the GG challenge protocol.

Methods

Patients ≥ 18 years who were treated for SBO between July 2009 and December 2012 were identified. We excluded patients with contraindications to the GG challenge (i.e., signs of strangulation), patients having SBO within 6-wk of previous abdominal or pelvic surgery and patients with malignant SBO. All patients had been followed a minimum of 1 y or until death. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used to describe the time-dependent outcomes.

Results

A total of 202 patients were identified of whom 114 (56%) received the challenge. Mean patients age was 66 y (range, 19–99 y) with 110 being female (54%). A total of 184 patients (91%) were followed minimum of 1 year or death (18 patients lost to follow-up). Median follow-up of living patients was 3 y (range, 1–5 y). During follow-up, 50 patients (25%) experienced SBO recurrences, and 24 (12%) had exploration for SBO recurrence. The 3-year cumulative rate of SBO recurrence in patients who received the GG was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21%-42%) compared to 27% (95% CI, 18%-38%) for those who did not (P = 0.4). The 3-year cumulative rate of exploration for SBO recurrence in patients who received the GG was 15% (95% CI, 8%-26%) compared to 12% (95% CI, 6%-22%) for those who did not (P = 0.6).

Conclusions

The GG challenge is a clinically useful tool in treating SBO patients with comparable long-term recurrence rates compared to traditional management of SBO.

### Preoptimisation in patients with acute obstructive colon cancer (PREOCC)-a prospective registration study protocol [^fc4e39e7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Refraining from emergency surgery in OCC can be a barrier for professionals because of concern for complications due to the distended (small) bowel and colon. Adequate management of the obstruction is crucial, while left untreated the obstruction could lead to bowel necrosis, perforation, and ultimately death. However, the feasibility of different staged procedures has been demonstrated over the years, such as SEMS and decompressing ileo- or (transverse) colostomy for left-sided OCC. Non-surgical bowel decompression by nasogastric tube for (right-sided) OCC has not yet been proved in large studies. We realise that concerns may be raised over the strategy to decompress the small bowel and proximal colon in patients with an imminent or complete obstruction in OCC. Therefore, daily assessment of the patients with right-sided OCC in this study is crucial. In case a caecum dilation > 10 cm, decompression is immediately needed, while this extensive diameter is often accompanied by a competent ileocecal valve. Clinical and biochemical values need to be monitored carefully, and immediate interference is needed in case of abdominal pain, increase of leukocytes or C-reactive protein, to prevent bowel necrosis, perforation of a blowout. The feasibility of postponing surgery without decompressing stent or ileostomy as a bridge to surgery has recently be confirmed in a recent study of Fahim et al. This study included all consecutive bowel obstruction patients treated with dietary adjustments, laxatives and prehabilitation before resection. In this study a total of 24 patients with bowel distention receiving TPN, reported emergency surgery in only 25% of the patients, while 75% of these patients were treated electively after 7–10 days of prehabilitation. This study differs from this study protocol while they also included benign disease. However, the feasibility of postponing surgery without SEMS or decompressing ileostomy was showed. In addition to this study, a retrospective pilot study performed in the Amphia hospital confirmed the feasibility of postponing surgery as well. In a total of 16 patients presenting with right-sided OCC, bowel decompression using a nasogastric tube was performed and emergency interference was not needed.

### Daily laxative therapy reduces organ dysfunction in mechanically ventilated patients: a phase II randomized controlled trial [^7589bac1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is a frequent problem in intensive care units (ICUs) and has often been overlooked. A number of factors can contribute to constipation in critically ill patients, including immobility, dehydration and the use of sedatives, opioids and vasopressors. The reported incidence of constipation in this population varies from 5 to 84%.

Constipation may be part of a broader context of acute intestinal dysfunction. Recent studies have identified constipation as an independent prognostic factor in critically ill patients, suggesting that its treatment would improve outcome. Bowel dysfunction can lead to complications, such as bacterial translocation, abdominal distension, delayed gastric emptying, vomiting, intestinal obstruction and perforation and may be associated with worsened prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether constipation is merely a marker of disease severity or an organ dysfunction to be treated.

Given the absence of relevant studies, we conducted this phase II study to assess the effects of a laxative therapy protocol aimed at promoting daily defecation on organ dysfunction in mechanically ventilated patients. We hypothesized that daily defecation would reduce bacterial translocation and improve intra-abdominal pressure by reducing abdominal distention and enhancing gastric emptying, thus contributing to a reduction in overall organ dysfunction. We also aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the protocol in promoting daily defecation and the safety of this intervention by assessing its associated adverse events.

### Barium sulfate (varibar pudding) [^298869d3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity
Reactions

Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients, including
natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity
reactions. The manifestations include: hypotension, bronchospasm and
other respiratory impairments, and dermal reactions including rashes,
urticaria, and itching. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, food
allergies, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase
the risk for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment and trained
personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity
reaction.

5.2 Intra-abdominal
Barium Leakage

Administration of VARIBAR PUDDING may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence of conditions and ailments that increase the risk of perforation such as known carcinomas, GI fistula, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, appendicitis, or diverticulitis, and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the gastrointestinal tract, especially if it is distal to the stomach. The barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation. The use of VARIBAR PUDDING is contraindicated in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Delayed
Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction

Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon, causing obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths (inspissated barium associated with feces) and may lead to abdominal pain, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, or rarely perforation. Patients with the following conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths: severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract, with impaired gastrointestinal motility, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, on a low residue diet, taking medications that delay GI motility, constipation, pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease, and the elderly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]. To reduce the risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction, patients should maintain adequate hydration after the barium sulfate procedure and consider the administration of laxatives.
