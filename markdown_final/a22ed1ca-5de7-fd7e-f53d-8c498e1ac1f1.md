## Question

Does hypothermia cause bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hypothermia causes bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiological mechanism by which low temperature affects cardiac conduction. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence across clinical contexts, including accidental hypothermia, therapeutic hypothermia, and neonatal hypothermia. Next, I will review guideline statements that list hypothermia as a reversible cause of bradycardia. After that, I should consider exceptions and confounders, such as drug interactions and the depth of hypothermia. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and note when bradycardia should be treated versus observed during rewarming.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis. Hypothermia slows sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular conduction via temperature-dependent reductions in ion-channel kinetics and metabolic rate, which produces sinus bradycardia and conduction delays. This is well described in reviews and supported by clinical observations of bradycardia that resolve with rewarming, consistent with a direct temperature effect rather than a primary myocardial pathology [^112A4ab8] [^116ESDaL] [^116oVgz4].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence across settings. In accidental hypothermia, bradycardia is a hallmark finding that correlates with severity. Case series and reports repeatedly document marked sinus bradycardia that improves with rewarming, and prehospital guidance notes progressive bradycardia as core temperature falls, reinforcing causality in environmental hypothermia [^116oVgz4] [^112S312n] [^113UsjJB]. In therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest, randomized and observational cohorts consistently show a high incidence of sinus bradycardia during cooling, with heart rates commonly dropping below 50–60 beats per minute and recovering with rewarming, again supporting a causal relationship rather than mere association [^11557fDG] [^112PQZYE] [^1146it3u]. In neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with therapeutic hypothermia, randomized trials and systematic reviews report increased rates of benign sinus bradycardia that did not compromise perfusion, aligning with a predictable physiologic response to cooling [^111RZzUb] [^11375afs] [^117Ppe1s].

> I need to check guideline-level sources to ensure this is framed correctly. Major guidelines explicitly list hypothermia as a reversible cause of bradycardia and bradyarrhythmias, advising clinicians to identify and correct the underlying cause, which in this case is low core temperature, before escalating invasive therapies. This is consistent across adult and pediatric ALS guidance and the ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline [^111xwiEX] [^113ks2P2] [^116u3mDF] [^112iiY4v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should consider exceptions and confounders. Bradycardia in hypothermia is typically physiologic and proportional to the degree of cooling, but concomitant factors can modulate the response: sedatives like dexmedetomidine, negative chronotropes, or autonomic dysfunction can accentuate bradycardia, and in profound hypothermia below roughly 28–30°C, the risk of ventricular fibrillation rises, so the observed rhythm may reflect both hypothermia and arrhythmic vulnerability rather than pure sinus slowing alone [^117PDkan] [^113Rm5z6] [^113SVZ8g]. I should double-check that in moderate hypothermia, bradycardia is expected and often benign if perfusion is preserved, whereas in severe hypothermia, bradycardia may herald instability and warrants careful monitoring and rewarming rather than aggressive antiarrhythmic therapy [^112A4ab8] [^113Rm5z6].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Yes, hypothermia causes bradycardia via direct suppression of sinus node automaticity and conduction system function, with the magnitude of bradycardia tracking the depth and duration of cooling. This is a predictable, reversible physiologic effect documented across accidental hypothermia, therapeutic hypothermia, and neonatal cooling, and it is recognized in high-quality guidelines as a reversible cause of bradycardia that should be managed primarily by correcting temperature while supporting perfusion and avoiding premature escalation to pacing or chronotropes unless there is hemodynamic compromise disproportionate to the degree of hypothermia [^115XeENJ] [^11557fDG] [^111RZzUb] [^111xwiEX] [^116u3mDF].

Hypothermia causes **bradycardia** by slowing sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular conduction, producing a predictable, temperature-dependent reduction in heart rate that is typically benign and reversible with rewarming [^112A4ab8] [^115XeENJ]. Bradycardia is a hallmark of hypothermia and is commonly observed in both accidental and therapeutic settings, with heart rates often dropping below 60 bpm as core temperature falls below 35°C [^115XeENJ] [^11557fDG]. Clinically, this bradycardia is usually managed conservatively unless there is hemodynamic compromise; pacing is reserved for unstable patients or when bradycardia persists despite rewarming and correction of reversible causes [^116u3mDF] [^114chmca].

---

## Physiological mechanisms underlying hypothermia-induced bradycardia

Hypothermia-induced bradycardia arises from **direct effects of low temperature on cardiac electrophysiology**:

- **Sinus node suppression**: Lower temperatures reduce sinus node automaticity, slowing the spontaneous firing rate and causing sinus bradycardia [^112A4ab8].

- **Atrioventricular conduction delay**: Hypothermia slows atrioventricular conduction, contributing to bradycardia and conduction blocks [^116ESDaL].

- **Metabolic rate reduction**: Hypothermia lowers metabolic rate, decreasing oxygen demand and contributing to slower heart rates [^112A4ab8].

---

## Clinical evidence of bradycardia in hypothermia

Multiple clinical studies and case reports document **bradycardia as a consistent feature of hypothermia**:

- **Accidental hypothermia**: Patients with accidental hypothermia frequently present with sinus bradycardia, often with heart rates below 60 bpm, correlating with the severity of hypothermia [^115XeENJ] [^116oVgz4].

- **Therapeutic hypothermia**: In therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, bradycardia is a common and expected physiological response, with heart rates commonly dropping below 50 bpm during cooling [^11557fDG] [^112PQZYE].

- **Neonatal hypothermia**: Neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy also exhibit bradycardia, typically managed conservatively without adverse outcomes [^111RZzUb] [^11375afs].

---

## Clinical significance and management implications

Bradycardia in hypothermia is **typically benign and reversible** with rewarming; however, clinicians should consider the following:

- **Conservative management**: Bradycardia due to hypothermia is generally managed conservatively, with rewarming and supportive care as primary interventions [^116u3mDF].

- **Indications for intervention**: Pacing or pharmacological interventions are reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability, significant hypotension, or persistent bradycardia despite rewarming and correction of reversible causes [^114chmca].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The Wilderness Medical Society recommends considering transcutaneous pacing in hypothermic patients with bradycardia and hypotension disproportionate to core temperature, emphasizing individualized decision-making [^114chmca] [^117EiVeF].

---

## Potential complications and risks associated with hypothermia-induced bradycardia

While generally benign, **hypothermia-induced bradycardia** can lead to complications, particularly in severe cases:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Severe bradycardia can compromise cardiac output, leading to hypotension and organ hypoperfusion [^111xwiEX].

- **Arrhythmias**: Hypothermia increases the risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation, particularly as core temperature drops below 28°C [^113Rm5z6] [^1163Py46].

- **Coagulopathy and electrolyte disturbances**: Hypothermia-induced bradycardia may coexist with coagulopathy and electrolyte imbalances, complicating clinical management [^112A4ab8].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical context** | **Evidence of bradycardia** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Accidental hypothermia | Common, correlates with severity | Rewarming, supportive care |
| Therapeutic hypothermia | Expected physiological response | Conservative management, pacing if unstable |
| Neonatal hypothermia | Benign, manageable | Conservative management, monitoring |

Hypothermia causes **bradycardia** through direct suppression of sinus node automaticity and atrioventricular conduction, producing a predictable, temperature-dependent reduction in heart rate that is typically benign and reversible with rewarming. Clinically, this bradycardia is managed conservatively unless there is hemodynamic compromise, in which case pacing or pharmacological interventions may be considered [^116u3mDF] [^114chmca].

Adult advanced life support — bradycardia definition and clinical assessment states that bradycardia has historically been defined as a ventricular heart rate of less than 60/min, and the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline adopted a lower threshold of less than 50/min. Bradycardia can be a normal finding in healthy adults, athletes, or during sleep, and its clinical manifestation ranges from stable (asymptomatic) through symptomatic to unstable with signs of poor perfusion. Patients with symptomatic bradycardia can present with dizziness or light‑headedness, acute altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or syncope due to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Clinicians must evaluate whether bradycardia is a manifestation of another underlying disease process (eg, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbance, acidosis, hypothermia) or the primary driver of the presentation. Immediate treatment of symptomatic bradycardia is focused on both supporting perfusion and identifying and reversing the underlying cause(s).

### Sinus bradycardia during hypothermia in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest-a new early marker of favorable outcome? [^112PQZYE]. Resuscitation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bradycardia is a common finding in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), presumably as a normal physiological response to low body temperature. We hypothesized that a normal physiological response with sinus bradycardia (SB) indicates less neurological damage and therefore would be associated with lower mortality.

Methods

We studied 234 consecutive comatose survivors of OHCA with presumed cardiac etiology and shockable primary rhythm, who underwent a full 24-h TH-protocol (33°C) at a tertiary heart center (years: 2004–2010). Primary endpoint was 180-day mortality; secondary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome (180-day cerebral performance category: 1–2).

Results

SB, defined as sinus rhythm < 50 beats per minute during TH, was present in 115 (49%) patients. Baseline characteristics including sex, witnessed arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and time to return of spontaneous circulation were not different between SB- and no-SB patients. However, SB-patients were younger, 57 ± 14 vs. 63 ± 14 years, p < 0.001 and less frequently had known heart failure (7% vs. 20%, p < 0.01). Patients experiencing SB during the hypothermia phase of TH had a 17% 180-day mortality rate compared to 38% in no-SB patients (p < 0.001), corresponding to a 180-day hazard ratio (HRadjusted = 0.45 (0.23–0.88, p = 0.02)) in the multivariable analysis. Similarly, SB during hypothermia was directly associated with lower odds of unfavorable neurological outcome (ORunadjusted = 0.42 (0.23–0.75, p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Sinus bradycardia during therapeutic hypothermia is independently associated with a lower 180-day mortality rate and may thus be a novel, early marker of favorable outcome in comatose survivors of OHCA.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — transient/reversible causes of sinus bradycardia attributable to sinus node dysfunction (SND): Patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (I C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms; if the drug cannot be stopped, a simple dosage reduction may increase the heart rate and therefore improve symptoms. For medication-related bradycardia, a beta-blocking drug used solely for hypertension that is causing significant bradycardia could be switched to a diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or an angiotensin receptor blocking drug that are devoid of negative chronotropic effect, and other treatable contributors include elevated intracranial pressure, acute MI, severe hypothermia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

### Bradycardia during targeted temperature management: an early marker of lower mortality and favorable neurologic outcome in comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients [^11557fDG]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bradycardia is common during targeted temperature management, likely being a physiologic response to lower body temperature, and has recently been associated with favorable outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in smaller observational studies. The present study sought to confirm this finding in a large multicenter cohort of patients treated with targeted temperature management at 33°C and explore the response to targeted temperature management targeting 36°C.

Design

Post hoc analysis of a prospective randomized study.

Setting

Thirty-six ICUs in 10 countries.

Patients

We studied 447 (targeted temperature management = 33°C) and 430 (targeted temperature management = 36°C) comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with available heart rate data, randomly assigned in the targeted temperature management trial from 2010 to 2013.

Interventions

Targeted temperature management at 33°C and 36°C.

Measurements and Main Results

Endpoints were 180-day mortality and unfavorable neurologic function (cerebral performance category 3–5). Patients were stratified by target temperature and minimum heart rate during targeted temperature management (< 50, 50–59, and ≥ 60 beats/min) at 12, 20, and 28 hours after randomization. Heart rates less than 50 beats/min and 50–59 beats/min were recorded in 132 (30%) and 131 (29%) of the 33°C group, respectively. Crude 180-day mortality increased with increasing minimum heart rate (< 50 beats/min = 32%, 50–59 beats/min = 43%, and ≥ 60 beats/min = 60%; p(log-rank) < 0.0001). Bradycardia less than 50 beats/min was independently associated with lower 180-day mortality (hazard ratio(adjusted) = 0.50 [0.34–0.74; p < 0.001]) and lower odds of unfavorable neurologic outcome (odds ratio(adjusted) = 0.38 [0.21–0.68; p < 0.01]) in models adjusting for potential confounders including age, initial rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and lactate at admission. Similar, albeit less strong, independent associations of lower heart rates and favorable outcome were found in patients treated with targeted temperature management at 36°C.

Conclusions

This study confirms an independent association of bradycardia and lower mortality and favorable neurologic outcome in a large cohort of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated by targeted temperature management at 33°C. Bradycardia during targeted temperature management at 33°C may thus be a novel, early marker of favorable outcome.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — transient/reversible causes of sinus node dysfunction (SND) states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of the offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms; medications are frequent culprits, including negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Additional reversible contributors noted include hypothyroidism with cardiovascular abnormalities that respond to thyroxine, metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia in acute settings, and other treatable conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure, acute MI, severe hypothermia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

### The effects of mild induced hypothermia on the myocardium: a systematic review [^113FhJrx]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Mild induced hypothermia improves neurological outcome and reduces mortality among initially comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Similar pathological processes occur in the heart and the brain, namely ischaemia followed by reperfusion injury. Animal data indicate that mild induced hypothermia results in improved myocardial salvage, reduced infarct size, reduced left ventricular remodelling and better long-term left ventricular function. Several small human studies suggest that infarct size may be reduced by mild induced hypothermia, although this has not reached significance in any human study to date. There are variable reports of harm to the myocardium caused by mild induced hypothermia, including reduced myocardial contractility and cardiac output, electrocardiographic changes and arrhythmias, especially bradycardia. These harmful effects are reversible with rewarming.

### Fetal bradycardia in response to maternal hypothermia [^1172Sxwz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal tachycardia can occur with maternal fever (hyperthermia); therefore, a low maternal temperature (hypothermia) might produce fetal bradycardia.

Cases

Five cases of fetal bradycardia are presented in gestations complicated by maternal hypothermia. The fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings demonstrated stable baselines of 88–96 beats per minute with moderate variability and accelerations. All baselines returned to normal after maternal warming measures.

Conclusion

A possible cause for fetal bradycardia with a stable baseline and moderate variability is maternal hypothermia, a pattern not indicative of fetal hypoxia. Delivery is not indicated, and maternal warming results in FHR baseline normalization.

### Mechanisms of action, physiological effects, and complications of hypothermia [^112A4ab8]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mild to moderate hypothermia (32–35 degrees C) is the first treatment with proven efficacy for postischemic neurological injury. In recent years important insights have been gained into the mechanisms underlying hypothermia's protective effects; in addition, physiological and pathophysiological changes associated with cooling have become better understood.

Objective

To discuss hypothermia's mechanisms of action, to review (patho)physiological changes associated with cooling, and to discuss potential side effects.

Design

Review article.

Interventions

None.

Main Results

A myriad of destructive processes unfold in injured tissue following ischemia-reperfusion. These include excitotoxicty, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, free radical production, seizure activity, blood-brain barrier disruption, blood vessel leakage, cerebral thermopooling, and numerous others. The severity of this destructive cascade determines whether injured cells will survive or die. Hypothermia can inhibit or mitigate all of these mechanisms, while stimulating protective systems such as early gene activation. Hypothermia is also effective in mitigating intracranial hypertension and reducing brain edema. Side effects include immunosuppression with increased infection risk, cold diuresis and hypovolemia, electrolyte disorders, insulin resistance, impaired drug clearance, and mild coagulopathy. Targeted interventions are required to effectively manage these side effects. Hypothermia does not decrease myocardial contractility or induce hypotension if hypovolemia is corrected, and preliminary evidence suggests that it can be safely used in patients with cardiac shock. Cardiac output will decrease due to hypothermia-induced bradycardia, but given that metabolic rate also decreases the balance between supply and demand, is usually maintained or improved. In contrast to deep hypothermia (≤ 30 degrees C), moderate hypothermia does not induce arrhythmias; indeed, the evidence suggests that arrhythmias can be prevented and/or more easily treated under hypothermic conditions.

Conclusions

Therapeutic hypothermia is a highly promising treatment, but the potential side effects need to be properly managed particularly if prolonged treatment periods are required. Understanding the underlying mechanisms, awareness of physiological changes associated with cooling, and prevention of potential side effects are all key factors for its effective clinical usage.

### Hypothermia… [^1145QRcd]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Peiris AN, Jaroudi S, Gavin M. Hypothermia. JAMA. 2018; 319:

1290. doi: 10.1001/jama.2018.0749 Hypothermia is a medical emergency; it occurs when a person is exposed to excessive cold temperatures. Hypothermia is defined by a core body temperature lower than 35°C. Below this temperature, the body loses more heat than it generates. Acute hypothermia occurs with immersion in cold water or exposure to cold weather. Chronic hypothermia occurs with certain diseases, aging, or prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, arthritis, and preexisting heart conditions, as well as homeless persons, elderly persons, and young children are more prone to developing hypothermia. Hypothermia causes major dysfunction in vital organs such as the heart, leading to irregular heartbeat; the kidneys, leading to kidney failure; and the brain, leading to mental status changes such as confusion or loss of consciousness.

Liver damage, bleeding disorders, and breakdown of muscle tissue can also occur. Damage occurs when the mechanisms of heat regulation start to fail as the body temperature continues to drop. Ensure babies have proper clothing and limit their exposure to cold temperatures. Check on elderly persons and neighbors living alone and ensure they have adequate food, clothing, and heating. In adults, look for shivering, pallor, and drowsiness. In infants, look for bright red, cold skin and a low energy level. If you see symptoms of hypothermia, consider calling 911 immediately. Goals include preventing further heat loss and rewarming the affected individual. Move affected person into a warm building. Be gentle and avoid rubbing or massaging the skin. Remove any wet clothing and cover the person with dry or warm blankets. Do not use direct heat like a heating pad or hot bath to warm the person. The heat may cause burns, and the person's core temperature may drop even further.

If the affected person is conscious, provide a warm beverage. Avoid alcohol or caffeine. If hypothermia progresses to a severe state, the individual may become unresponsive and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be needed until emergency personnel arrive.

### Bradycardia during therapeutic hypothermia is associated with good neurologic outcome in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^1146it3u]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Comatose patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receive therapeutic hypothermia. Bradycardia is frequent during therapeutic hypothermia, but its impact on outcome remains unclear. We explore a possible association between bradycardia during therapeutic hypothermia and neurologic outcome in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Design

Retrospective cohort study, from January 2009 to January 2011.

Setting

University hospital medical and cardiac ICUs.

Patients

One hundred eleven consecutive comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia.

Interventions

Patients treated with standardized treatment protocol after cardiac arrest.

Measurements and Main Results

All out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients' records were reviewed. Hemodynamic data were obtained every fourth hour during the first days. The patients were in temperature target range (32–34°C) 8 hours after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and dichotomized into bradycardia and nonbradycardia groups depending on their actual heart rate less than or equal to 60 beats/min or more than 60 beats/min at that time. Primary endpoint was Cerebral Performance Category score at hospital discharge. More nonbradycardia group patients received epinephrine during resuscitation and epinephrine and norepinephrine in the early in-hospital period. They also had lower base excess at admission. Survival rate with favorable outcome was significantly higher in the bradycardia than the nonbradycardia group (60% vs 37%, respectively, p = 0.03). For further heart rate quantification, patients were divided into quartiles: less than or equal to 49 beats/min, 50–63 beats/min, 64–77 beats/min, and more than or equal to 78 beats/min, with respective proportions of patients with good outcome at discharge of 18 of 27 (67%), 14 of 25 (56%), 12 of 28 (43%), and 7 of 27 (26%) (p = 0.002). Patients in the lowest quartile had significantly better outcome than the higher groups (p = 0.027), whereas patients in the highest quartile had significantly worse outcome than the lower three groups (p = 0.013).

Conclusions

Bradycardia during therapeutic hypothermia was associated with good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge. Our data indicate that bradycardia should not be aggressively treated in this period if mean arterial pressure, lactate clearance, and diuresis are maintained at acceptable levels. Studies, both experimental and clinical, are warranted.

### A systematic review of cooling for neuroprotection in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy-are we there yet? [^11375afs]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The frequency of sinus bradycardia following therapeutic hypothermia was significant. A borderline effect on thrombocytopenia was noted and there was a trend towards a higher risk of anemia, coagulopathy, and hypotension (Table 5). However, sinus bradycardia is a physiological response rather than a true adverse event and did not compromise perfusion, and thrombocytopenia was not reported as of clinical importance. The adverse events therefore may be outweighed by the potential benefits.

Given the overall encouraging results without significant adverse effects it is not surprising that some centers may now consider therapeutic hypothermia as a standard treatment for HIE. However, many experts including a commission of the American Academy of Pediatrics have suggested that further research should continue and therapeutic hypothermia should not be offered outside RCTs. Their suggestions are based on heterogeneity as discussed above and the possibility that neurological outcomes at 18 to 22 months may not reflect the true long-term benefits. The rate of severe disability is very unlikely to change, however, more subtle neurodevelopmental problems that cannot be assessed at the age of 18 months may become apparent by school age. The unaddressed issues include the specific target population that is most likely to benefit, the most effective and safe method for cooling, the optimal age at onset and duration of cooling, and the field difficulties in applying any specific method for cooling, particularly for outborn neonates. In practice, hypothermia is quite frequent in asphyxiated neonates, whereas guidelines for rewarming are not standardised/uniform. The targets, methods as well as the speed of rewarming may influence the neuronal recovery/damage following HIE. This issue is especially important during transport of hypothermic neonates with HIE. The field difficulties have been addressed to some extent by Eicher et al who showed that it is feasible to cool outborn neonates with ice bags followed by cooling with a blanket on reaching the receiving hospital. This approach can help to reduce the time between birth asphyxia and initiation of cooling. Animal studies have clearly shown that there is a correlation between early onset of cooling and treatment effect.

### Mad honey poisoning-related hypothermia: a case series [^116KEpKc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mad honey-related intoxication frequently leads to bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope. Hypothermia is a potentially life-threatening condition if not identified early and treated appropriately.

Case Report

Three patients are reviewed. Patient 1 was a 66-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and faintness beginning 2 h after consuming honey. His temperature was 34°C, his blood pressure was 70/40 mm Hg, and his heart rate was 30 beats/min. Patient 2, a 57-year-old man, presented to the emergency department with headache, feeling cold, and faintness beginning 3 h after consuming honey. His temperature was 35°C, his blood pressure was 60/40 mm Hg, and his heart rate was 46 beats/min. Patient 3 was a 79-year-old woman who presented with nausea, vomiting, and headache 2 h after consuming honey. Her temperature was 35°C, her blood pressure was 70/40 mm Hg, and her heart rate was 40 beats/min. All 3 patients were discharged in good condition after appropriate therapy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Bradycardia and hypotension are frequently encountered in mad honey intoxication. However, intoxication accompanied by hypothermia has attracted little attention to date.

### A systematic review of cooling for neuroprotection in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy-are we there yet? [^111RZzUb]. BMC Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized trials assessing therapeutic hypothermia as a treatment for term neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

Methods

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL databases, reference lists of identified studies, and proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies were searched in July 2006. Randomized trials assessing the effect of therapeutic hypothermia by either selective head cooling or whole body cooling in term neonates were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was death or neurodevelopmental disability at ≥ 18 months.

Results

Five trials involving 552 neonates were included in the analysis. Cooling techniques and the definition and severity of neurodevelopmental disability differed between studies. Overall, there is evidence of a significant effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the primary composite outcome of death or disability (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.92, NNT: 8, 95% CI: 5, 20) as well as on the single outcomes of mortality (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96) and neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 22 months (RR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.98). Adverse effects include benign sinus bradycardia (RR: 7.42, 95% CI: 2.52, 21.87) and thrombocytopenia (RR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.03, NNH: 8) without deleterious consequences.

Conclusion

In general, therapeutic hypothermia seems to have a beneficial effect on the outcome of term neonates with moderate to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Despite the methodological differences between trials, wide confidence intervals, and the lack of follow-up data beyond the second year of life, the consistency of the results is encouraging. Further research is necessary to minimize the uncertainty regarding efficacy and safety of any specific technique of cooling for any specific population.

Accidental hypothermia — transcutaneous cardiac pacing: Two case reports suggest that transcutaneous pacing may be beneficial in the hypothermic patient, and it was instituted to increase blood pressure to facilitate arteriovenous rewarming rather than to control heart rate. Recommendation: It is the consensus of the panel that transcutaneous pacing may be beneficial in hypothermia in the setting of bradycardia with hypotension disproportionate to the core temperature (Evidence grade: 2C).

What action would you advise next?

D) Active slow rewarming

Key ECG features that assist in correct diagnosis are sinus bradycardia, attenuated P wave and classic J (Osborn) wave. Our image shows bradycardia with diffuse classic J (Osborn) waves prominent in leads II and V4–V6 (more prominent in panel B). It was proposed to be due to hypothermia-induced prolongation of action potential and abnormal repolarisation creating a transmural voltage gradient between the ventricular epicardium and endocardium resulting in J point elevation. Hypothermia has variable ECG manifestations that range from bradycardia, decreased P wave amplitude, wide QRS complex, Osborn waves, prolonged PR interval, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Early identification is important in the context of the clinical setting to avoid unnecessary interventions before appropriately rewarming the patient. Cardiac pacemaker is also ineffective in treating bradycardia (choice A) until fully rewarming the patient. There is no indication for PCI (choice B) and haemodialysis (choice E) at this point. Rapid rewarming (choice C) triggers a cascade of destructive inflammatory processes.

Patient outcome

Temperature obtained via bladder probe was 87.4 ○ F. The patient was rewarmed slowly with warming blankets, a Bair Hugger and warm IVF. The patient's BP and mental status improved. Her bradycardia and Osborne waves resolved, except for a prolonged QT interval.

### Glycopyrrolate does not ameliorate hypothermia associated bradycardia in healthy individuals: a randomized crossover trial [^117PDkan]. Resuscitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypothermia improves outcomes following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Shivering is common and can be mediated by agents such as dexmedetomidine. The combination of dexmedetomidine and hypothermia results in bradycardia. We hypothesized that glycopyrrolate would prevent bradycardia during dexmedetomidine-mediated hypothermia.

Methods

We randomly assigned eight healthy subjects to premedication with a single 0.4 mg glycopyrrolate intravenous (IV) bolus, titrated glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg IV every 3 min as needed for heart rate < 50), or no glycopyrrolate during three separate sessions of 3 h cooling. Following 1 mg/kg IV dexmedetomidine bolus, subjects received 20 ml/kg IV 4 °C saline and surface cooling (EM COOLS, Weinerdorf, Austria). We titrated dexmedetomidine infusion to suppress shivering but permit arousal to verbal stimuli. After 3 h of cooling, we allowed subjects to passively rewarm. We compared heart rate, core temperature, mean arterial blood pressure, perceived comfort and thermal sensation between groups using Kruskal-Wallis test and ANOVA.

Results

Mean age was 27 (SD 6) years and most (N = 6, 75%) were male. Neither heart rate nor core temperature differed between the groups during maintenance of hypothermia (p > 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in the glycopyrrolate bolus condition (p < 0.048). Thermal sensation was higher in the control condition than the glycopyrrolate bolus condition (p = 0.01). Bolus glycopyrrolate resulted in less discomfort than titrated glycopyrrolate (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Glycopyrrolate did not prevent the bradycardic response to hypothermia and dexmedetomidine. Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in subjects receiving a bolus of glycopyrrolate before induction of hypothermia. Bolus glycopyrrolate was associated with less intense thermal sensation and less discomfort during cooling.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

### Targeted temperature management in critical care: a report and recommendations from five professional societies [^117HBc6f]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Representatives of five international critical care societies convened topic specialists and a nonexpert jury to review, assess, and report on studies of targeted temperature management and to provide clinical recommendations.

Data Sources

Questions were allocated to experts who reviewed their areas, made formal presentations, and responded to questions. Jurors also performed independent searches. Sources used for consensus derived exclusively from peer-reviewed reports of human and animal studies.

Study Selection

Question-specific studies were selected from literature searches; jurors independently determined the relevance of each study included in the synthesis.

Conclusions and Recommendations

1) The jury opines that the term "targeted temperature management" replace "therapeutic hypothermia". 2) The jury opines that descriptors (e.g., "mild") be replaced with explicit targeted temperature management profiles. 3) The jury opines that each report of a targeted temperature management trial enumerate the physiologic effects anticipated by the investigators and actually observed and/or measured in subjects in each arm of the trial as a strategy for increasing knowledge of the dose/duration/response characteristics of temperature management. This enumeration should be kept separate from the body of the report, be organized by body systems, and be made without assertions about the impact of any specific effect on the clinical outcome. 4) The jury STRONGLY RECOMMENDS targeted temperature management to a target of 32°C-34°C as the preferred treatment (vs. unstructured temperature management) of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest victims with a first registered electrocardiography rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and still unconscious after restoration of spontaneous circulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 5) The jury WEAKLY RECOMMENDS the use of targeted temperature management to 33°C-35.5°C (vs. less structured management) in the treatment of term newborns who sustained asphyxia and exhibit acidosis and/or encephalopathy (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### Early prognostication of neurological outcome by heart rate variability in adult patients with out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest [^111t4Jv3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Although hypothermia causes bradycardia physiologically, time-domain variables or frequency-domain variable of HRV during moderate hypothermia was enhanced in patients with poikilothermia or healthy volunteers. Tianien et al. reported that all HRV values based on 24-h RR intervals are higher in post-ROSC comatose patients treated with moderate hypothermia (33 °C) than those treated with normothermia (< 38 °C). In infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, increased HF power and AVNN during hypothermia were reported in infants with moderate brain injury or favorable outcome Thus, enhanced HRV produced by moderate hypothermia may counter-act the suppressive effects of mechanical ventilation with sedation in the present study.

Limitations

Several limitations might affect the present findings. First, this study was conducted at a single institution with a small sample size. Thus, the cutoff values for HRV herein need to be validated in other studies with a larger cohort. Second, 20% of patients treated with hypothermic TTM were excluded due to severe hypotension, which may limit the applicability of the data of this study. Third, the 8-h recording time for RR intervals does not strictly adhere to the standard recommendation for HRV measures. Consequently, long-term (24 h) HRV variables of SDNN, ULF power, and triangular index may become unreliable. Finally, not all patients had reached the targeted bladder temperature of 34 °C at the beginning of recording of RR intervals because the recording was scheduled to start at midnight within 24 h after ROSC.

### Successful transcutaneous pacing in 2 severely hypothermic patients [^113czieV]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical condition of profound hypothermia is well described in the medical literature. There have been many case reports and studies describing successful aspects of caring for this problem. Significant bradycardia is a known pathophysiologic consequence of profound hypothermia. Transcutaneous pacing for this condition is not a routine or recommended practice in the literature. This case report details 2 patients with profound hypothermia and resultant bradycardia with hypotension. In both cases, transcutaneous pacing was successfully applied and used as part of the resuscitation. In both cases, transcutaneous pacing was required to maintain an adequate blood pressure so that continuous arteriovenous rewarming could be used during the resuscitation. Both cases had successful outcomes, and the rewarming process was greatly assisted by the pacing procedure.

### Accidental hypothermia [^114CCPXp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Accidental hypothermia has produced many cases of intact survival even after prolonged cardiac arrest, but it is also often fatal. In recent years, alterations in resuscitation care that sometimes confused or discouraged resuscitation teams have largely been supplanted by an emphasis on safe, rapid, effective rewarming.

### Personalizing temperature targets after cardiac arrest: our neurologically driven approach [^115Guoi2]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that our approach of using lower temperatures in patients with severe neurological injury warrants further robust evidence, particularly in specific subpopulations. This is supported by a patient-level meta-analysis from TTM/TTM2 demonstrating no interaction between risk profiles by MIRACLE-2 (Missed/ unwitnessed arrest; Initial rhythm; Reactive pupils; Age; Changing rhythm; Low pH; Epinephrine given) score and temperature selection. However, such findings may be limited by inclusion of relatively healthier cohorts. Consequently, while experts recognize the issue of limited CA phenotypes in major TTM trials, current American and European guidelines avoid temperature-specific recommendations based on arrest features and instead endorse a broad range of 32 to 37.5 °C (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

Broad implementation of TTM requires addressing medical, practical, and ethical challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings lacking trained personnel, specialized equipment, and institutional protocols. This is particularly relevant for strict fever prevention and formal neuroprognostication per societal guidelines, which recommend allowing sufficient time for neurological recovery before considering WLST. Studies show that WLST is a leading cause of death after CA, affecting up to 59% of patients within 48 hours, many of whom could have displayed neurological recovery. Clinicians managing CA should be proactive in avoiding this devastating practice, which is based on biased nihilism rather than published evidence or recommendations. At the same time, potential harms of TTM-HT, including electrolyte imbalances (mostly hypokalemia), bradyarrhythmias, bleeding, hemodynamic instability (although often from bradycardia or sedation), and the need for neuromuscular-blocking agents, must be carefully weighed against its potential benefits in specific populations, illustrating the importance of individualized care.

Clinicians must balance the benefit of cooling against its risks, costs, and the likelihood of meaningful recovery. When deep cooling is indicated, we promptly coordinate care between intensivists, cardiologists, and others to promote systems-based care to ameliorate risk. Strict adherence to rewarming protocols and close monitoring mitigates complications. Multispecialty collaboration ensures complex decision-making through shared expertise, while ongoing family discussions ensure goals-of-care remain central. Educating families regarding quality-of-life and long-term expectations fosters confidence, clarity, and respect of patient wishes.

From 35 to 32°C thermoregulatory shivering control is functional and can still be strong at 31°C; below 32°C thermoregulation becomes less effective, rewarming is possible only with addition of exogenous heat, level of consciousness decreases, and below 28°C most patients are unconscious and not shivering with a high risk of VF or asystole.

### The electrocardiogram in hypothermia [^116o7DuD]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothermia is known to adversely affect the electrocardiogram (ECG) in many cases. This study set out to determine the incidence of defined cardiac dysrhythmias, J waves, and conduction abnormalities in urban hypothermia.

Methods

A prospective, multicenter study was carried out to determine the incidence of defined cardiac rhythms in patients suffering from accidental urban hypothermia. The ECGs were independently analyzed by 2 of the authors and placed into 1 of 6 rhythm categories.

Results

Seventy-three ECGs were analyzed. Normal sinus rhythm was the most common rhythm (41%). Overall mortality was 36% (26/73). J waves occurred in 36% of survivors and 38% of non-survivors and were, therefore, not prognostic. Shivering artifact was present in 66% of survivors and 38% of nonsurvivors. Although there was no statistically significant association between J waves and survival (P = 0.21), the presence of shivering artifact was associated with survival in severe hypothermia (P = 0.047). Atrial fibrillation and junctional bradycardia were both associated with high mortality.

Conclusions

This study confirms that the ECG is abnormal in the majority of patients suffering from accidental hypothermia. J waves do not appear to be independently prognostic in hypothermia. The results suggest that the inability to mount a shivering response may be associated with a poorer outcome; this finding requires further study.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation rewarming in the ED: an opportunity for success [^1163Py46]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

On average, approximately 1300 Americans die of hypothermia each year. Although accidental hypothermia is commonly associated with severely cold regions or mountain accident victims, hypothermia also commonly occurs in urban centers. Contributing factors often include homelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse. Hypothermia can profoundly affect the cardiovascular system. As the myocardium cools, the conduction system slows down, which results in prolongation of the QT interval as well as propensity for arrhythmias. Eventually, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation (VF) can develop. The risk of cardiac arrest increases as the core temperature drops below 32°C and increases substantially when less than 28°C.

Hypothermia-related cases typically occur after exposure to low ambient temperatures; however, numerous cases occur in individuals with no history of exposure to cold environment. Hypothermia is associated with such complications as acidosis, impaired myocardial function, bleeding diathesis, and decreased kidney and liver function.

### Donor heart and lung procurement: a consensus statement [^112BcZao]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Donor heart arrhythmia management — Cardiac arrhythmias may occur in up to 20%–30% of donors. Therapy for arrhythmia should be initiated early, including the correction of any reversible factors, targeting a heart rate between 60 and 120 beats per minute. If a donor heart cannot be cardioverted out of atrial fibrillation, the procuring and transplanting surgeons should discuss organ suitability and likely decline the organ for transplantation. Tachyarrhythmias that trigger hemodynamic instability should be treated with synchronized electrical cardioversion, and internal defibrillator paddles should be readily available from the time of sternotomy. In brain-dead donors, clinically significant bradycardia may not respond to atropine; therefore, a direct-acting chronotropic agent, such as epinephrine, dopamine, isoproterenol, or dobutamine, may instead be used. Hypothermia, defined as core temperature < 36°C, is arrhythmogenic and should be avoided.

### Thiazoline-related innate fear stimuli orchestrate hypothermia and anti-hypoxia via sensory TRPA1 activation [^112Hpjmh]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

tFO induces hypothermia/anti-hypoxia via Trpa1

Avoidance and risk assessment behaviors relevant to innate fear induced by 2MT are regulated by Trpa1 (refs.). 2MT also induces robust physiological responses such as hypothermia and bradycardia. We examined whether these physiological responses are regulated by Trpa1 using Trpa1 −/− mice. Whereas body temperature in the baseline condition was not significantly altered, 2MT-induced hypothermia was greatly suppressed in Trpa1 −/− mice (Fig. 1a, b). Most Trpa1 -expressing cells co-express Trpv1. However, 2MT-induced hypothermia was not affected in Trpv1 −/− mice (Fig. 1c). Hypothermia is observed not only because of tFO stimulation but also in response to restraint in a tight space, another type of innate fear stimulus. If Trpa1 works as a peripheral sensor for 2MT to induce hypothermia, it is expected that hypothermia induced by other types of innate fear stimuli would not be affected in Trpa1 −/− mice. As expected, restraint in a tight place induced hypothermia in Trpa1 −/− mice (Fig. 1d). Similarly, the heart rate in the control condition was not altered, but quick and robust bradycardia following 2MT presentation was almost completely suppressed in Trpa1 −/− mice (Fig. 1e). In contrast, reduction of heart rate induced by restraint in a tight space was observed in Trpa1 −/− mice (Fig. 1f). Interestingly, hypothermia and bradycardia induced by restraint in a tight space tended to be greater in Trpa1 −/− mice than those in control mice. Thus, it is suggested that the Trpa1 gene contributes to the initiation of innate fear-relevant suppression of body temperature/heart rate; Trpa1 may also have important roles in maintaining appropriate suppression levels to various stimuli.

### Hypothermia-related deaths – United States, 2003 [^1174J79M]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

Hypothermia, a preventable lowering of the core body temperature to < 95 degrees F (< 35 degrees C), causes approximately 600 deaths each year in the United States. Exposure to excessive cold (or excessive exposure to cold) slows enzymatic activity throughout the body, leading to potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, renal failure, and dysrhythmias. Alcohol intake, activity level, and type of clothing are among the modifiable factors associated with hypothermia. Understanding the epidemiology and pathophysiology of hypothermia is important to preventing hypothermia-related mortality. This report describes three cases of fatal hypothermia that occurred during 2003, reviews national statistics on mortality from cold exposure in 2001, and provides recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of hypothermia. Public health strategies tailored to U.S. populations at increased risk for exposure to excessive cold can help reduce mortality and morbidity from hypothermia.

### Profound sinus bradycardia after intravenous nicardipine [^1178j1sc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Implications

Nicardipine-induced bradycardia has been reported in experimental animals but not in clinical patients. We report a clinical case of unexpected bradycardia caused by nicardipine. The mechanism of this bradycardia was not clear, and depression of sympathetic tone by epidural anesthesia, hypothermia, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation might have been contributory.

### Moderate hypothermia in neonatal encephalopathy: safety outcomes [^117Ppe1s]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Hypoxic-ischemic injury may cause multisystem organ damage with significant aberrations in clotting, renal, and cardiac functions. Systemic hypothermia may aggravate these medical conditions, such as bradycardia and increased clotting times, and very little safety data in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury is available. This study reports a multicenter, randomized, controlled pilot trial of moderate systemic hypothermia (33 degrees C) vs normothermia (37 degrees C) for 48 hours in infants with neonatal encephalopathy instituted within 6 hours of birth or hypoxic-ischemic event. The best outcome measures of safety were determined, comparing rates of adverse events between normothermia and hypothermia groups. A total of 32 hypothermia and 33 normothermia neonates were enrolled in seven centers. Adverse events and serious adverse effects were collected by the study team during the hospital admission, monitored by an independent study monitor, and reported to Institutional Review Boards and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. The following adverse events were observed significantly more commonly in the hypothermia group: more frequent bradycardia and lower heart rates during the period of hypothermia, longer dependence on pressors, higher prothrombin times, and lower platelet counts with more patients requiring plasma and platelet transfusions. Seizures as an adverse event were more common in the hypothermia group. These observed side effects of 48 hours of moderate systemic hypothermia were of mild to moderate severity and manageable with minor interventions.

### Severe hypothermia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest in association with risperidone [^112WN2Rw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Antipsychotic medications, including risperidone, are widely used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. While hyperthermia is an establish adverse effect of these medications, less is known about the rare occurrence of hypothermia. We present two patients who developed hypothermia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest in association with risperidone. We briefly review previously similarly reported cases.

### The effect of therapeutic hypothermia on heart rate variability [^114VqyZa]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects integrity of the autonomic nervous system. However, no study has investigated the impact of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) on HRV measures in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In this study, we evaluate the influence of temperature on measures of HRV for a group of infants with favorable outcomes, as compared with a control group of infants with unfavorable outcomes.

Study Design

Term-born infants with moderate-severe HIE underwent standard TH treatment and prospective electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Infants with favorable outcome (no seizures, normal/mild EEG scores at 96h, no magnetic resonance imaging brain injury and normal neurodevelopmental scores at 18 to 24 months) were matched on gestational age, sex and worst encephalopathy score to a group of infants with unfavorable outcomes. Time- and frequency-domain HRV measures were calculated from 60min of ECG data obtained at three time points: 24h (hypothermia), 48h (hypothermia) and 96h (normothermia). The effect of time and temperature were evaluated using repeated-measures analysis of variance.

Results

Sixteen infants were included (8 favorable, 8 unfavorable). For both groups of infants, an increase in the HR, RR and HF power was associated with an increase in temperature, but was not associated with any other HRV measure. In contrast, measures of HRV increased over time, as encephalopathy decreased, for infants with favorable outcomes (reflecting increased cortical-autonomic integration), but not for those with unfavorable outcomes.

Conclusions

In general, the effect of hypothermia on measures of HRV is limited to changes in heart rate (bradycardia) and respiratory rate, as opposed to changes in true variability. This supports the hypothesis that persistent changes in HRV are driven by the underlying brain injury and not by the process of TH.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia and conduction disorders — conditions associated with these rhythms include intrinsic cardiac disease and inflammation or infection (cardiomyopathy [ischemic or nonischemic], congenital heart disease, degenerative fibrosis, Chagas disease, diphtheria, infectious endocarditis, Lyme disease, myocarditis, sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis), infiltrative disorders (amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, lymphoma), ischemia/infarction, rheumatological conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus), and surgical or procedural trauma (cardiac procedures such as ablation or cardiac catheterization); additional associations include congenital heart disease surgery, septal myomectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and valve surgery (including percutaneous valve replacement), as well as extrinsic and physiologic triggers (autonomic perturbation, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, neurally-mediated syncope/presyncope, physical conditioning, situational syncope with cough, defecation, glottic stimulation, medical procedures, micturition, vomiting), sleep (with or without sleep apnea), and metabolic states (acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypothermia, hypothyroidism, hypoxia).

### Children with infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis have an increased risk of hypothermia and bradycardia during anesthesia [^112tDqCj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by lysosomal accumulation of autofluorescent material in neurons and other cell types. The infantile NCL (INCL) subtype is rare (1 in > 100,000 births), the most devastating of childhood subtypes, and is caused by mutations in the gene CLN1, which encodes palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1.

Methods

To investigate the incidence of hypothermia and bradycardia during general anesthesia in patients with INCL, we conducted a case-control study to examine the perianesthetic course of patients with INCL and of controls receiving anesthesia for diagnostic studies.

Results

Eight children with INCL (mean age 25 mo [range, 10–32] at first anesthetic) and 25 controls (mean age 44 mo [range, 18–92]) underwent 62 anesthetics for nonsurgical procedures. Patients with INCL had neurologic deficits including developmental delay, myoclonus, and visual impairment. Patients with INCL had lower baseline temperature (36.4 ± 0.1 vs 36.8 ± 0.1, INCL versus controls, P < 0.007), and during anesthesia, despite active warming techniques, had significantly more hypothermia (18 vs 0 episodes, P < 0.001) and sinus bradycardia (10 vs 1, P < 0.001) compared with controls. INCL diagnosis was significantly associated with temperature decreases during anesthesia (P < 0.001), whereas age, sex, and duration of anesthesia were not (P = NS).

Conclusions

We report that patients with INCL have lower baseline body temperature and during general anesthesia, despite rewarming interventions, are at increased risk for hypothermia and bradycardia. This suggests a previously unknown INCL phenotype, impaired thermoregulation. Therefore, when anesthetizing these children, careful monitoring and routine use of warming interventions are warranted.

### Outcome after resuscitation beyond 30 minutes in drowned children with cardiac arrest and hypothermia: Dutch nationwide retrospective cohort study [^112Y31rE]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Season

Season correlated strongly with outcome (fig 4). Children who drowned in winter had a significantly better outcome than those who drowned in other seasons (5/17, 29% (95% confidence interval 8% to 51%) v 12/143, 8% (4% to 13%); odds ratio 4.6 (1.4 to 15.1), P = 0.013). This seasonal effect was also evident in children who underwent resuscitation for less than 30 minutes: all five children who drowned in winter had a good outcome compared with 12 of the 57 children who drowned in other seasons (5/5, 100% (55% to 100%) v 12/57, 21% (10% to 32%); odds ratio 4.8 (2.9 to 7.9), P = 0.01). The median estimated minimum and maximum durations of submersion were not different for winter and other seasons (fig 5). The initial core body temperature was significantly lower in children who drowned in winter than in other seasons (difference 3.7°C, P < 0.001; fig 5).

Initial cardiac arrest rhythm

We were able to retrieve data on the initial cardiac arrest rhythm from the medical records in 118 of the 160 children (74%). Asystole was diagnosed in nearly all children (101/118, 86%), followed by bradycardia (15/118, 13%) and ventricular fibrillation (2/118, 2%). Bradycardia correlated strongly with good outcome: six of the 15 children with bradycardia had good outcome versus eight of the 101 children with asystole (40% (95% confidence interval 15% to 65%) v 8% (3% to 13%); odds ratio 7.8 (2.2 to 27.3), P = 0.001).

### Apraclonidine hydrochloride (apraclonidine ophthalmic) [^114FNcke]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Ingestion of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause bradycardia, drowsiness, and hypothermia.

Accidental or intentional ingestion of oral clonidine has been reported to cause apnea, arrhythmias, asthenia, bradycardia, conduction defects, diminished or absent reflexes, dryness of the mouth, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoventilation, irritability, lethargy, miosis, pallor, respiratory depression, sedation or coma, seizure, somnolence, transient hypertension, and vomiting.

Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy; a patent airway should be maintained. Hemodialysis is of limited value since a maximum of 5% of circulating drug is removed.

### Neurologic recovery from profound accidental hypothermia after 5 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^112u6pc4]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the successful neurologic recovery from profound accidental hypothermia with cardiac arrest despite the longest reported duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Mountain.

Patient

A 57-year-old woman experienced profound accidental hypothermia (16.9°C) in a mountainous region of Grenoble. She was unconscious and had extreme bradycardia (6 beats/min) at presentation. A cardiac arrest occurred at the mobilization that was not responsive to electrical shocks or epinephrine.

Intervention

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continued for 307 minutes after rescue until venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood flow had been established at the emergency department.

Measurements and Main Results

At a 3-month follow-up, the patient showed good physical and mental recovery.

Conclusion

With no evidence of trauma or asphyxia, profound accidental hypothermia with cardiac arrest represents a specific condition for which successful neurologic recovery is feasible despite prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### Late-onset post-lesional paroxysmal hypothermia: a case series and literature review [^116g3XDq]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal hypothermia (PH) is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of spontaneous hypothermia, bradycardia, disorders of consciousness and, in some cases, hyperhidrosis. When associated with a detectable hypothalamic lesion, PH episodes usually occur shortly after the brain insult.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study to identify patients who had demonstrated at least one episode of symptomatic spontaneous PH as defined by (i) tympanic temperature < 35 °C; (ii) drowsiness and/or confusion state and/or coma; (iii) duration of the episode ≥ 24 h; (iv) absence of other condition resulting in hypothermia RESULTS: Among 8824 patients, we identified four patients with recurrent late-onset PH episodes of 1-26-day duration that occurred 6–46 years after the brain insult. The lesion always involved the diencephalon. All patients suffered from epilepsy and three of hypopituitarism. PH episode typically included severe hypothermia, bradycardia, drowsiness, thrombocytopenia and in some patients central hypoventilation and narcolepsy-like hypersomnia. In ¼ of episodes, confusion was mistaken as non-convulsive epileptic manifestation resulting in benzodiazepine administration which aggravated symptoms. In the two patients with nocturnal hypoventilation, chronic non-invasive ventilation with bi-level positive airway pressure allowed cessation of symptomatic episodes.

Discussion

Late-onset post-lesional PH is exceptional with only a single case hitherto reported in the literature. Distinguishing hypothermia-related disturbances of consciousness from epileptic seizures or post-ictal phenomena is crucial since treatment with benzodiazepines may worsen hypothermia through their action on GABAa receptors. Lastly, PH may be associated with sleep disorders and hypoventilation, for which investigations and treatment should be considered.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^116i1Ljc]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — cardiac and thrombotic complications and monitoring: In adults, four RCTs failed to identify a statistically significant difference in the rate of arrhythmias between hypothermic patients and normal controls, while a fifth RCT identified a significantly greater incidence of bradycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and couplets during the first 24 h of TTM; however, these results are of questionable clinical significance. A study by De Georgia identified a 66% higher incidence of DVT with hypothermic patients. In high-quality neonatal and pediatric studies, no significant difference was seen in cardiac complication rates between hypothermia and normothermia, although Jacobs found a higher incidence of prolonged QT during hypothermia for HIE (p = 0.006), and Gluckman et al. found no difference in the incidence of DVT. We recommend cardiac monitoring during TTM, particularly focused on QT during the induction and maintenance of hypothermia. Because of the lack of evidence for increased risk, we do not recommend a change to routine monitoring for other complications, including renal failure, ARDS, GI-tract impairment, hypotension, DVT, days intubated and seizures.

### Dynamicity of hypothermia-induced J waves and the mechanism involved [^115FVtHU]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

J waves develop during hypothermia, but the dynamicity of hypothermia-induced J waves is poorly understood.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the rate-dependent change in the amplitude of hypothermia-induced J waves.

Methods

Nineteen patients with severe hypothermia were included (mean age 70 ± 12 years; 16 men [84.2%]). The rectal temperature at the time of admission was 27.8° ± 2.5°C. In addition to prolonged PR, QRS complex, and corrected QT intervals, the distribution of prominent J waves was widespread in all 19 patients.

Results

Nine patients showed changes in RR intervals. When the RR interval shortened from 1353 ± 472 to 740 ± 391 ms (P = 0.0002), the J-wave amplitude increased from 0.50 ± 0.29 to 0.61 ± 0.27 mV (P = 0.0075). The J-wave amplitude increased in 7 patients (77.8%) and decreased in 2 patients (22.2%) after short RR intervals. The augmentation of J waves at short RR intervals was associated with a significant prolongation of ventricular activation time (35 ± 5 ms vs 46 ± 5 ms; P = 0.0020), suggesting accentuated conduction delay. Increased conduction delay at short RR intervals was suggested to accentuate the phase 1 notch of the action potential and J waves in hypothermia. None developed ventricular fibrillation, and in 2 of 9 patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation persisted after rewarming to normothermia.

Conclusion

J waves in severe hypothermia were augmented after short RR intervals in 7 patients as expected for depolarization abnormality, whereas 2 patients showed a bradycardia-dependent augmentation as expected for transient outward current-mediated J waves. Increased conduction delay at short RR intervals can be responsible for the accentuation of the transient outward current and J waves during severe hypothermia.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to patients with accidental hypothermia, WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to perform chest compressions in patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest at the same rate as for patients with normothermia.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Symptomatic bradycardia — definition and attribution are described as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or pre-syncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate", while noting that direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging; in patients with vasovagal syncope bradycardia is often accompanied by a significant vasodepressor effect, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

### Esmolol hydrochloride [^1167zTsY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypotension

Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes.

5.2 Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of esmolol hydrochloride. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving esmolol hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4)].

If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop esmolol hydrochloride.

5.3 Cardiac Failure

Beta blockers, like esmolol hydrochloride, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop esmolol hydrochloride and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension

Monitor vital signs closely and titrate esmolol hydrochloride slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia.

5.5 Reactive Airways Disease

Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1selectivity and titratability, titrate esmolol hydrochloride to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates.

5.6 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signsofhypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

### Accidental hypothermia [^1156teEf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on accidental hypothermia:

- **Definition**: Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core body temperature to < 35 °C due to environmental exposure.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of accidental hypothermia involves a combination of heat loss and impaired thermoregulation. Heat loss can occur through radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation. Impaired thermoregulation can result from factors such as sepsis, which can disrupt the body's normal temperature control mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, accidental hypothermia is responsible for at least 1,500 deaths each year. The incidence of accidental hypothermia in the Netherlands is estimated at 1.1 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of accidental hypothermia can vary depending on the severity. Mild hypothermia may present with shivering and altered mental status. As the condition worsens, patients may exhibit detectable vital signs even with core temperatures < 24 °C. Severe hypothermia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypoventilation, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality rate of accidental hypothermia is significant. In a study conducted in Japan, the overall proportion of cases resulting in in-hospital death was 24.4%.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113Z4N1v]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Hypothermia — background and scope: Accidental hypothermia "is an environmental emergency that may be encountered in urban, rural, and austere settings", with "the very young, the very old, and people with impaired temperature perception, regulation, and ability to communicate" at increased risk. "In the United States, hypothermia is responsible for ≈1300 deaths annually". "Heat loss occurs through 4 methods: conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation". "Hypothermia occurs when the core body temperature drops below the normal temperature range near 37°C", and individuals may be "'cold' or 'cold stressed' with temperatures of 35°C to 37°C". "Mild hypothermia begins when the core temperature falls below 35°C". Rewarming "may use passive measures… or active measures", and these recommendations "are not applicable to infants < 60 days of age and to cardiac arrest in all age groups". A literature search was performed in 2023.

### Cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia [^114eZ63q]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia for patients who remain comatose following resuscitation from a cardiac arrest improves both survival and neurologic outcomes. Although this therapy has been incorporated into the guidelines for routine post-resuscitation care and has been in clinical use for over a decade, significant questions and controversies remain. In this review, we discuss these questions in the context of the current evidence and provide a practical framework to help guide clinicians.

### Physiology and clinical relevance of induced hypothermia [^114FVVcf]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence and clinical experience suggest that mild hypothermia protects numerous tissues from damage during ischemic insult. However, the extent to which hypothermia becomes a valued therapeutic option will depend on the clinician's ability to rapidly reduce core body temperature and safely maintain hypothermia. To date, general anesthesia is the best way to block autonomic defenses during induction of mild-to-moderate hypothermia; unfortunately, general anesthesia is not an option in most patients likely to benefit from therapeutic hypothermia. Induction of hypothermia in awake humans is complicated by both the technical difficulties related to thermal manipulation and the remarkable efficacy of thermoregulatory defenses, especially vasoconstriction and shivering. The most effective thermal manipulation devices are generally invasive and, therefore, more prone to complications than surface methods. In an effort to inhibit thermoregulation in awake humans, several agents have been tested either alone or in combination with each other. For example, the combination of meperidine and buspirone has already been applied to facilitate induction of hypothermia in human trials. However, pharmacological induction of thermoregulatory tolerance to cold without excessive sedation, respiratory depression, or other serious toxicity remains a major focus of current therapeutic hypothermia research.

Hypothermia first aid — showers and warm water immersion: People with simple cold stress were generally able to safely rewarm in a warm shower or warm water immersion, but in a single-patient experimental study of mild hypothermia with core temperature ≈36° C, warm bath rewarming was associated with transient core temperature drop, decreases in mean arterial pressure, and increases in heart rate and cardiac output; these effects can decrease perfusion and, in severe cases, cause arrhythmia, and attempting to manage a confused or less alert person with hypothermia in a shower or bathtub is potentially dangerous.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^111Tzx28]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Circumrescue collapse — definition and rescue handling emphasize horizontal positioning and limiting exertion to reduce hypotension and dysrhythmias. Circumrescue collapse refers to light-headedness, collapse, syncope, or sudden death around cold-water rescue, and can result from decreased catecholamines or sudden cardiac dysrhythmias. Keeping the patient horizontal mitigates decreased hydrostatic pressure and avoiding physical effort protects against afterdrop. Recommendations: "Rescuers should keep a hypothermic patient horizontal, especially during rescue from water or a crevasse (Evidence grade: 1B) and should limit physical effort by the patient during rescue (Evidence grade: 1B). A conscious patient should be encouraged to be attentive and focus on survival (Evidence grade: 1C)".

### A systematic review of safety and adverse effects in the practice of therapeutic hypothermia [^1117MocX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To carry out a systematic review to estimate the rate and magnitude of adverse effects following therapeutic hypothermia (TH) procedure in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and highlight the specific complications seen after the procedure.

Methods

A systematic review of currently published studies was performed following standard guidelines. Online database searches were performed for controlled trials for the last twenty years. Papers were examined for methodological soundness before being included. Data were independently extracted by two blinded reviewers. Studies were also assessed for bias using the Cochrane criteria. The adverse effects attributed to TH in the literature were appraised critically.

Results

The initial data search yielded 78 potentially relevant studies; of these, 59 were excluded for some reason. The main reason for exclusion (n = 43, 55.8%) was that irrelevance to adverse effects of TH. Finally, 19 underwent full-text review. Studies were of high-to-moderate (n = 12, 63%) to low-to-very low (n = 7, 37%) quality. Five studies (27.7%) were found to have high risk of bias, while 8 (42.1%) had low risk of bias.

Interpretation

Although adverse effects related to the practice of TH have been studied extensively, there is substantial heterogeneity between study populations and methodologies. There is a considerable incidence of side effects attributed to the procedure, e.g., from life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias to self-limited consequences. Most studies analyzed in this systematic review indicated that the procedure of TH has not caused severe adverse effects leading to significant alterations in the outcomes following resuscitation from OHCA. PROSPERO, registration number is: CRD42018075026.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations of hypothermia [^112RqyMj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Hypothermia is generally defined as a core body temperature less than 35 degrees C (95 degrees F). Hypothermia is one of the most common environmental emergencies encountered by emergency physicians. Although the diagnosis will usually be evident after an initial check of vital signs, the diagnosis can sometimes be missed because of overreliance on normal or near-normal oral or tympanic thermometer readings. The classic and well-known electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations of hypothermia include the presence of J (Osborn) waves, interval (PR, QRS, QT) prolongation, and atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias. There are also some less known (ECG) findings associated with hypothermia. For example, hypothermia can produce ECG signs that simulate those of acute myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction. Hypothermia can also blunt the expected ECG findings associated with hyperkalemia. A thorough knowledge of these findings is important for prompt diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia. Six cases are presented that show these important ECG manifestations of hypothermia.

5.1 Hypotension

Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended.

If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop BREVIBLOC injection.

Beta blockers, like BREVIBLOC injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop BREVIBLOC injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension

Monitor vital signs closely and titrate BREVIBLOC injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia.

5.5 Reactive Airways Disease

Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta1selectivity and titratability, titrate BREVIBLOC injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta2stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates.

5.6 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

### Hypothermia depth and duration and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy outcomes… [^113Kurzu]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

or moderate is incomplete Moro reflex and severe is absent); and autonomic nervous system — either pupil, heart rate, or respiration. To obtain probability estimates of treatment effect for the 3 experimental groups, a Bayesian analysis of death or disability or death alone was conducted. A log binomial model with level of encephalopathy and main effects of cooling duration and depth and their interaction was used to estimate posterior median of the RRs and 95% credible intervals. The adjusted RRs for the primary outcome for duration or depth of cooling were not significantly different. The primary outcome was similar among infants with moderate or severe encephalopathy between the 120-hour and 72-hour groups and between the 32. 0°C and
33. 5°C groups.

The Bayesian analyses of the posterior probabilities of reducing death or moderate or severe disability with deeper cooling, longer cooling, or both compared with standard cooling were 58%, 50%, and 78%, respectively. There was no statistically significant interaction for death or any other secondary outcome other than a Bayley III cognitive score of 70 to 84 vs 85 or higher and a Bayley III motor score of less than 70 vs 85 or higher. The posterior probabilities of increasing death with deeper cooling, longer cooling, or both compared with standard cooling were 66%, 93%, and 89%, respectively. This trial demonstrated that neither longer nor deeper cooling reduced mortality or appeared neuroprotective in term neonates with moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The rates of death or moderate or severe disability among infants randomized to the usual care group was 29%; this is lower than the rate of 44% from the cooled group in the first NICHD Neonatal Research Network cooling trial1 and in other trials. 2 This lower rate may reflect the lower rate of severe encephalopathy, lower acuity, and earlier initiation of cooling in this trial.

Ingestion of IOPIDINE* 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution has been reported to cause bradycardia, drowsiness, and hypothermia. Accidental or intentional ingestion of oral clonidine has been reported to cause apnea, arrhythmias, asthenia, bradycardia, conduction defects, diminished or absent reflexes, dryness of the mouth, hypotension, hypothermia, hypoventilation, irritability, lethargy, miosis, pallor, respiratory depression, sedation or coma, seizure, somnolence, transient hypertension, and vomiting. Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy; a patent airway should be maintained. Hemodialysis is of limited value since a maximum of 5% of circulating drug is removed.

### Body temperature regulates glucose metabolism and torpid behavior [^111ekmUh]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Among the tissues used to measure 2DG uptake, only heart 2DG uptake was lower than that in the control at 34 °C, indicating that Qrfp POA directly control cardiac function rather than other tissues. Consistent with this, different populations of neurons in the POA increase or decrease heart rate and cardiovascular function. Although QIH mice had a markedly low heart rate, which was also noted in hypothermia induced by estrogen receptor-expressing neurons in the POA, whether bradycardia is controlled by these neurons or by hypothermia needs further studies. Besides body temperature, the POA regulates locomotor activity –. The locomotor activity of QIH mice, which was inhibited at 23 °C, was higher than that of the control at 34 °C, suggesting that Qrfp POA activation enhanced locomotion, and this enhancement was masked by hypothermia in QIH mice. Therefore, hypothermia may interfere with phenotypes of POA-regulated behaviors or physiology and complicate the interpretation of results. In recent decades, the POA has been reported to regulate physiology and behaviors, including sleep, feeding, and parental behavior. Disturbed body temperature can sometimes be induced by manipulating POA neurons and interferes with the actual functions of the POA. The extent to which POA-mediated hypothermia or hyperthermia disrupts these physiology and behaviors may be a question for future studies.

### Endotoxemia causing fetal bradycardia during urosepsis [^112Fw3wQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal bradycardia is a recognized response to maternal hypothermia associated with hypoglycemia, tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, or urosepsis, and it is thought to be a direct response to the decrease in the maternal core temperature.

Case

A 25-year-old white woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 31 1/7 weeks' gestation was admitted with a diagnosis of pyelonephritis. The baseline fetal heart rate was 120 beats per minute with accelerations. Within 3 hours of admission, the patient became hypothermic (35.1C) and, concomitantly, the fetal heart rate baseline declined to 90 beats per minute with marked variability. Despite sustained maternal hypothermia, the fetal heart rate baseline rose to 120 beats per minute. It was another 6 hours before the patient's temperature rose above 38.5C. Her urine and blood cultures were positive for Serratia rubidacea infection. The patient delivered a healthy infant at 39 weeks' gestation.

Conclusion

Fetal bradycardia in the presence of urosepsis might be due to the release of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria, triggering production of cardiotoxic cytokines, rather than to maternal hypothermia alone.

### ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction vs. hypothermia-induced electrocardiographic changes: a case report and brief review of the literature [^112NwS9K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) usually prompts rapid cardiac catheterization response.

Objective

Our aim was to raise awareness that hypothermia can cause electrocardiographic (ECG) changes that mimic STEMI.

Case Report

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) was called for altered mental status and lethargy in a 47-year-old man with a medical history of paraplegia. His history included hepatitis C, hypertension, seizures, anxiety, and recent pneumonia treated with i.v. antibiotics. When brought in by EMS, the patient was responsive only to painful stimuli. His blood glucose was 89 mg/dL; blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg, and ECG showed ST elevations diffusely. His vital signs in the emergency department were heart rate 53 beats/min, blood pressure 134/79 mm Hg, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, pulse oximetry of 100%, and a rectal temperature of 32.7°C (91°F). A second ECG showed diffuse ST elevation, sinus bradycardia with a rate of 56 beats/min, and a first-degree atrioventricular block. J waves were noted in V3-V6, I and II. There were no reciprocal changes or ST depressions. A bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no coronary artery disease and a normal ejection fraction. Later, hypercapneic respiratory failure with bilateral pneumonia developed and was intubated. His ECG the following day, once he was rewarmed, showed complete resolution of ST elevation and almost complete resolution of J waves.

Conclusion

Obtaining a complete set of vital signs is key to making a correct diagnosis. Hypothermia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ST elevation.

### Improved therapeutic benefits by combining physical cooling with pharmacological hypothermia after severe stroke in rats [^114aZrsN]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we compared the efficacy and efficiency of PC and the hypothermic NTR1 agonist HPI-201 in a severe ischemic stroke rat model. Both PC using ice and pharmacological cooling using HPI-201 were able to reduce the body temperature of stroke rats. This effect is clinically meaningful because pyrexia occurs after severe strokes, and the extent of hyperthermia directly correlates with the outcomes and mortality of patients with stroke. More importantly, we demonstrate that HPI-201 in combination with PC leads to multiple benefits, including faster cooling, no shivering induction, a slower rewarming phase, enhanced neuroprotective effects, and improved functional recovery. These data support that the strategy of combining pharmacological hypothermia with PC should increase the clinical feasibility, efficacy, and safety in the treatment of patients with stroke.

HPI-201 did not trigger the defensive response of shivering, which made the induction and maintenance of cooling more effective and controllable. We further examined the effects of combined treatments of PC plus HPI-201 on the induction of hypothermia, brain protection, and functional outcomes. Impressively, adding HPI-201 during PC effectively prevented the adverse shivering and tachycardia responses. Of clinical importance, the elimination of shivering could allow PC to be carried out without general anesthesia. We also demonstrated significant additional effects of the combined treatment in neuroprotection and functional recovery. All these advantages provide promising benefits in clinical applications of hypothermia therapy.

Previous data from human and animal studies have shown that cooling can cause both tachycardia and bradycardia. – Generally, deep hypothermia (< 30°C) leads to further depression of the metabolic rate and bradycardia. – In this study, the PC-induced cooling (30–35°C) caused tachycardia response, but not bradycardia, likely because of the relatively moderate level of cooling. Although it is unclear what kind of influences tachycardia may have in hypothermia, cooling-induced tachycardia can be deleterious because of the high risk of cardiac arrhythmias.HPI-201 showed a significant effect of preventing tachycardia. Although further study are needed to reveal possible direct and indirect mechanisms related to the HPI-201 regulation of heart function, it seems that the prevention of tachycardia by HPI-201 is an additional benefit for clinical application of the combined hypothermia therapy.

Field rewarming — The rewarming methods described in this section achieve the safe rewarming rate of 1 to 2°C h−1 and minimize the risk of afterdrop. Afterdrop can lead to hemodynamic instability and VF, and the risk of afterdrop is reduced by limiting limb movement and by keeping the patient horizontal. Most patients with altered consciousness will require active rewarming.

### The TOBY study. whole body hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy: a randomised controlled trial [^117MiQGt]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of treatment with hypothermia

Preliminary studies in adults of whole body hypothermia following head injury, cardiac arrest and stroke have suggested benefit. In 2001 a systematic review of treatment of head injury with whole body hypothermia failed to demonstrate benefit but this may have been due to inconsistencies in clinical management.

In neonates, hypothermia was first reported as therapy for resuscitation, before modern resuscitation techniques were introduced. Pilot studies in infants with encephalopathy of head cooling combined with mild whole body hypothermia and of moderate whole body cooling to 33.5°C have been reported. No complications were noted but the group sizes were too small to evaluate benefit.

Potential adverse effects of hypothermia

The risk of adverse effects of hypothermia is a critical issue, given the poor outcome conventionally associated with hypothermia. Impaired cardiac function, disordered coagulation and increased sepsis have been reported with profound hypothermia. Thrombocytopenia, hypokalaemia and increased sepsis have been noted in studies of hypothermia to 33°C in adults, but these were not associated with an adverse outcome. The metabolic rate is reduced during hypothermia and this results in bradycardia and prolonged PR and QT intervals. However, significant arrhythmia has only been reported in adults with head injury when the rectal temperature is less than 32°C.

There are few data on the safety of mild or moderate hypothermia in newborn infants since previous studies employed hypothermia for brief periods in the treatment of failed resuscitation. These early studies appeared to demonstrate improved outcomes without side effects but few controls were included.

No clinically significant adverse effects due to cooling were observed in the recent pilot studies of whole body cooling following encephalopathy. As expected, the heart rate reduced to below 100 bpm with cooling but this was not accompanied by arrhythmia, and the blood pressure and perfusion were maintained.

Selective or whole body cooling

Although some experimental evidence suggests that selective head cooling may be effective, it is uncertain whether head cooling alone effectively lowers deep brain temperature. In anaesthetized piglets, which have a much smaller head than the human newborn infant, it was possible to cool the basal ganglia 5°C more than rectal temperature. In adults, a steep temperature gradient has been observed between the surface of the head and deep brain structures and the deep brain temperature remains very close to core temperature even when extreme cold is applied to the surface of the head. The possibility of temperature gradients within the brain and the importance of damage to deep structures in causing severe neurodevelopmental impairment and the lack of precise, non-invasive methods for measuring regional brain temperature pose major difficulties with selective head cooling.

### Advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^112qxUmL]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest temperature control — evidence overview: The 2024 ILCOR systematic review found no difference in overall outcomes between hypothermia, normothermia, or fever prevention, and noted no evidence of worse outcomes with hypothermic temperature control. One trial reported better survival with favorable functional outcome in the hypothermic temperature control group among nonshockable cardiac arrest patients, but 90-day survival was not significantly different. Large trials have primarily included patients with an initial shockable rhythm and a primary cardiac cause, whereas in the U.S. the initial rhythm is more often nonshockable in noncardiac, respiratory events; additional studies are needed to determine whether patients with an initial nonshockable rhythm or noncardiac etiology may benefit from hypothermic temperature control.

### Hypothermia-related deaths – United States, 2003–2004 [^113D7buT]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Hypothermia, a reduction in the body's core temperature to < 95.0 degrees F (< 35.0 degrees C), is a preventable medical emergency usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures without adequate protective clothing. Warning signs and symptoms of hypothermia include lethargy, weakness and loss of coordination, confusion, uncontrollable shivering, and reduced respiratory or heart rate. Common risk factors are advanced age, substance abuse, altered mental status, and increased contact with substances that promote heat loss, such as water. This report describes three hypothermia-related deaths that occurred in the United States during 2003–2004, summarizes hypothermia-related mortality during 1979–2002, describes risk factors for and symptoms of hypothermia, and reviews measures to prevent hypothermia-related injury and death. Public health strategies tailored to persons at increased risk for exposure to excessive cold might help reduce hypothermia-related morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical practice recommendations on the management of perioperative cardiac arrest: a report from the PERIOPCA consortium [^111WVmao]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perioperative cardiac arrest (PERIOPCA) is a rare but potentially catastrophic event. According to the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), the risk of intraoperative and early postoperative PERIOPCA ranges from 4.3 to 34.6 per 10,000 procedures. Other data suggests that the incidence of PERIOPCA in the surgical population is approximately 1 in 1400 cases, while the 30-day mortality may reach up to 70%.

PERIOPCA is commonly related to "secondary causes", but many of them are anesthesia-caused or related, such as hypoxia due to failed airway and ventilation management, loss of the airway during transfer, residual neuromuscular block or severe hemodynamic derangement caused by negative inotropic and vasodilator effects of general anesthesia drugs, severe bradycardia after subarachnoid block, immune-mediated, such as anaphylaxis, and nonimmune-mediated drugs adverse effects, e.g. local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), or iatrogenic pneumothorax due to central line insertion. Another significant source of causes or precipitating factors is the surgical intervention itself that may cause significant bleeding, reduce venous return with visceral manipulation or cavity insufflation, and induce deleterious cardiac reflexes.

Although PERIOPCA is usually witnessed, with onset under monitoring in face of healthcare professionals and immediate availability of therapeutic means, aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) does not always lead to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and optimal long-term outcomes, with 55% of the survivors having poor neurological status. The precipitating causes of PERIOPCA are usually known, but these patients constitute an heterogeneous group and their management often requires modification of traditional CPR algorithms. The heterogeneous nature of PERIOPCA is further demonstrated by the differences in survival between intraoperative and postoperative CPR. Indeed, coagulation and hemostasis disturbances may be a perceived as a potential barrier to controlled hypothermia.

To date the ERC published relevant guidelines for this type of cardiac arrest, but their PICOs were fewer and their treatment recommendations were mainly extrapolated from other settings. Guidelines for treatment of PERIOPCA are lacking and are acknowledged as a gap of knowledge. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Recommendations is to support appropriate decision making for patients with PERIOPCA.

### Hypothermia during the infusion of cryopreserved autologous peripheral stem cell causes electrocardiographical changes: report of two cases [^112WnPVX]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Currently, autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation used as a therapeutic modality in the treatment of various hematological malignancies is gaining more popularity day by day. In this method, the patient's own peripheral stem cells are collected by a proper method and stored at -80 degrees C until they are reinfused into the patient after being rewarmed in water bath at 37 degrees C. A number of complications have been reported related to reinfusion of the cryopreserved cells into the patient. These may include noncardiovascular complications such as nausea, vomiting, flushing, abdominal pain, chest discomfort, and headache, as well as cardiovascular complications like arrhythmias, hypotension, and hypertension. Hypothermia related to rapid infusion has been reported as the main factor underlying the cardiovascular complications. Electrocardiographic findings of hypothermia include sinusal bradycardia, prolonged QT and PR intervals, widened QRS complexes, and J wave, which is a ECG abnormality characterized by supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. We here present two cases of giant J wave caused by hypothermia during infusion of cryopreserved autologous peripheral stem cell that is detected by ECG and regressed after infusion ceased.

### Idioventricular rhythm induced by therapeutic hypothermia [^113q7y98]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 11-year-old girl with fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. During the induction of hypothermia, her rhythm degenerated into idioventricular rhythm with extremely prolonged QRS duration. The hypothermia-induced bradycardia caused a drop of mixed venous oxygenation saturation and which was resolved by re-warming to normothermia. This finding suggested that hypothermia may compromise cardiac performance and physicians should be cautious about its application in patients with fulminant myocarditis.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for accidental hypothermia, more specifically with respect to CPR, WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to perform immediate, high-quality CPR in patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest. Perform delayed or intermittent CPR if immediate and continuous CPR is impossible or unsafe. Do not delay compressions for > 10 minutes, a conservative interval based on the uncontrolled nature of the out-of-hospital hypothermic cardiac arrest. Perform compressions for a minimum of 5 minutes with interruptions between periods of compressions < 5 minutes, if continuous CPR is not possible.

### The osborn wave in accidental hypothermia [^116oVgz4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hypothermia is generally defined as a core body temperature less than 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), and is one of the most common environmental emergencies encountered by emergency physicians. A 32-year-old male hunter was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status. He remained unconscious, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was recorded as 5/15, and pupils were dilated and unreactive. His vital signs showed a heart rate of 48 beats/min, respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, blood pressure of 95/50 mm Hg, and rectal temperature of 31 degrees C. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and showed marked sinus bradycardia and J waves. His finger-stick glucose was 85. He was intubated. After 3 h of active rewarming, his temperature was 34 degrees C, and the repeat ECG showed near-complete resolution of the J waves and acceleration of the sinus rate to 68 beats/min. At the same time, emergency head computed tomography (CT) scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hemorrhage. The patient died on the third day of admission. In this case we want to indicate that J waves and obtunded state could be due to either SAH or hypothermia, and SAH could have been missed if initial obvious hypothermia had been believed to cause all symptoms.

### Sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant and neonate-a brief review [^116vGRCN]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Risks associated with anesthesia and sedation in infants are similar to those of other pediatric patients, the most significant being cardiorespiratory depression due to hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and/or hypotension and hypothermia. Adverse events occur more in infants than older children, and preterm infants are at the highest risk regardless of corrected gestational age. Respiratory complications such as apnea, oxygen desaturations, and airway obstruction are most frequently reported.

The increased risk for these complications likely relates to physiologic differences between infants and children. Preterm infants have decreased chemosensitivity to hypercarbia and an immature, altered response to hypoxia and apnea is common. Apneic pauses lead to atelectasis and a reduced functional residual capacity due to their highly compliant chest walls — this lower functional residual capacity yields faster oxygen desaturation. As a result, all infants, and particularly those born premature, are at risk for hypoxic bradycardia. Additionally, infants and neonates are less able to respond to hemodynamic changes such as hypotension with augmentation of cardiac output compared to older children. Their ventricular compliance and thus ability to increase stroke volume is lower, so they rely on increasing heart rate. In premature infants, side effects of commonly used sedating medications may be exacerbated. For example, propofol and midazolam frequently lead to hypotension, and fentanyl has been shown to have wide inter-individual variation in plasma concentration as well as half-life, though overall less effect on hemodynamics.

Thermoregulation is also an important consideration in infants where a high surface area to volume ratio increases risk for hypothermia. This can lead to downstream effects including bradycardia, altered response to adrenergic input, altered glucose metabolism, and decreased cerebral blood flow among others. The use of a thermal mattress, swaddling blankets, and regular temperature monitoring is prudent to maintain normothermia.

Some critically ill neonatal populations deserve special attention when considering sedation and anesthesia selection. Infants with hypoxemic encephalopathy undergoing therapeutic hypothermia experience altered physiology including bradycardia and subsequent lower cardiac output, as well as decreased cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate, making careful hemodynamic monitoring especially important. Furthermore, changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics lead to longer half-lives and lower rates of medication clearance. The hypoxic injury itself may affect renal clearance and hepatic metabolism. These infants are at risk for drug accumulation and side effects, making dosing especially challenging. Overall, in these infants, non-urgent radiologic studies are avoided during hypothermia in order to maintain strict temperature control.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets (metformin hydrochloride) [^116kJPEn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].
