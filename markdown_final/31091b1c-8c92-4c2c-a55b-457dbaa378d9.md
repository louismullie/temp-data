## Question

labs to check for cholecystits

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which labs to check for suspected acute cholecystitis, how to interpret them, when to obtain blood cultures, and how to integrate with imaging and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core laboratory panel to order at presentation. Then, I should verify the interpretive roles of inflammatory markers versus liver tests. Next, I will assess indications for blood cultures. After that, I should synthesize a diagnostic framework with Tokyo criteria and imaging. Finally, I will address special scenarios and distill practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the standard laboratory order set at initial presentation: I should include a complete blood count with differential, C-reactive protein, a comprehensive liver panel with AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and total/direct bilirubin, and a basic metabolic panel to assess electrolytes and renal function for perioperative planning, because Tokyo Guidelines treat leukocytosis and CRP as systemic inflammatory criteria and WSES recommends a full liver panel in all patients to stratify choledocholithiasis risk [^111Dzo9D] [^115ji3tH] [^114gKpDj].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inflammatory markers before I jump ahead: leukocytosis supports a systemic inflammatory response, but CRP generally outperforms WBC for diagnosing acute cholecystitis across severities, so I should prioritize obtaining and interpreting CRP while remembering that no single cut-off is definitive and clinical context remains essential [^115nMfUb] [^111Dzo9D].

> Hold on, I need to be precise about liver tests: I should confirm that LFTs are primarily for assessing the probability of common bile duct stones rather than diagnosing cholecystitis itself, and I must remember that normal LFTs have a high negative predictive value for choledocholithiasis while any LFT abnormality has poor positive predictive value, so abnormal results should trigger further evaluation rather than be considered diagnostic on their own [^112Bus4P] [^112RxuPA] [^114xrDEe].

> I will now examine emerging biomarkers, but I need to check their status in guidelines: the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio shows promising discriminative performance similar to CRP and superior to WBC in retrospective cohorts, yet it is not incorporated into major guideline algorithms, so I should consider it supportive but not definitive in my interpretive strategy [^1179vqs8] [^1114f7Hp].

> Next, I should review when to obtain blood cultures, and I should double-check IDSA's criteria so I don't overorder: I will obtain cultures if the patient is febrile and has hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium, or if I suspect antibiotic-resistant organisms where results would alter therapy, and I will avoid routine blood cultures in stable, non-immunocompromised patients without these features [^117G2gor] [^117G2gor].

> Let me think about microbiology beyond blood cultures for a moment: in complicated cases or in those at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, I should ensure bile cultures are obtained to guide targeted therapy once source control is achieved, but I should not delay surgery for culture acquisition [^116xi3ue].

> I need to ensure I am integrating labs with a validated diagnostic framework rather than relying on a single datum: WSES explicitly warns against relying on any single clinical or laboratory finding, and Tokyo Guidelines require combining local signs, systemic inflammatory markers, and imaging to classify suspected versus definite acute cholecystitis, so I must synthesize labs with exam and ultrasound to reach a robust diagnosis [^113UFb78] [^111Dzo9D].

> Let me verify the imaging step because laboratory interpretation depends on pretest probability and imaging findings: ultrasound is first-line due to availability and accuracy for gallstones, with pooled sensitivity around 70–81% and specificity around 83–92% in contemporary meta-analyses, so I should correlate lab abnormalities with RUQ ultrasound findings including stones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and sonographic Murphy sign [^113LNnBi] [^115XBEBr] [^115X7qkh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CT was not helpful, but I should correct that nuance: WSES notes CT has lower diagnostic accuracy than HIDA and ultrasound, yet IDSA suggests CT as subsequent imaging when ultrasound is equivocal and clinical suspicion persists, whereas HIDA has the highest diagnostic accuracy but may be less accessible and slower, so I should escalate to HIDA or CT based on availability and patient factors while recognizing MRI performance comparable to ultrasound [^113fQgaP] [^116iwqDr].

> Now, I should confirm how to use abnormal LFTs to guide next steps for choledocholithiasis risk: if liver biochemistries or bilirubin are abnormal, I should stratify the risk and pursue MRCP or EUS preoperatively, or intraoperative cholangiography or laparoscopic ultrasound, reserving preoperative ERCP for high-risk patients, while remembering that an enlarged common bile duct alone should not be considered diagnostic and should prompt further testing rather than definitive conclusions [^113uzofZ] [^116yRz7a] [^114np3mS] [^111HNmJg].

> But wait, what if the labs are all normal despite strong clinical suspicion: I should re-evaluate pretest probability and proceed with imaging because normal LFTs decrease the likelihood of ductal stones but do not exclude acute cholecystitis, and normal inflammatory markers lower but do not eliminate the probability of disease, so serial exams and imaging remain crucial [^112Bus4P] [^113UFb78] [^111Dzo9D].

> I need to check special populations to ensure I am not missing adjustments: in pregnancy and the elderly or immunocompromised patients, the laboratory panel remains the same, but I should anticipate blunted inflammatory responses in older or immunosuppressed patients and maintain a lower threshold for cultures and early imaging, with laparoscopic approaches generally feasible in pregnancy and advanced age when clinically indicated [^112KVF3P] [^113GLTod] [^116zK9sk].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical approach I can use: at triage, I will order CBC with differential, CRP, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, and a basic metabolic panel; I will interpret CRP alongside WBC to support an inflammatory process; I will use LFTs to risk stratify for choledocholithiasis rather than to diagnose cholecystitis; I will obtain blood cultures only if IDSA criteria are met; and I will integrate these data with RUQ ultrasound and, if equivocal, HIDA or CT to reach a Tokyo-concordant diagnosis [^115nMfUb] [^114gKpDj] [^116zK9sk] [^111Dzo9D] [^113LNnBi] [^116iwqDr].

> Hold on, I should verify the interpretation pathway to avoid overcalling ductal stones: if LFTs are normal, the likelihood of choledocholithiasis is low and I may proceed directly to cholecystectomy in low-risk patients; if LFTs are abnormal, I will not assume stones but will pursue MRCP or EUS or obtain intraoperative cholangiography based on risk category and local expertise, ensuring that elevated bilirubin or ALP alone does not short-circuit the algorithm [^112Bus4P] [^113uzofZ] [^111ePSdL].

> Finally, key caveats I need to keep front-of-mind: no single laboratory test confirms or excludes acute cholecystitis, CRP is generally more informative than WBC for inflammatory assessment, LFT abnormalities suggest possible biliary obstruction but are not diagnostic and require further imaging, blood cultures should be selective rather than routine, and NLR is promising but not guideline-standard, all of which must be integrated with clinical examination and imaging to make a confident diagnosis and plan [^113UFb78] [^115nMfUb] [^114xrDEe] [^117G2gor] [^1179vqs8].

---

For suspected cholecystitis, order a **CBC with differential** [^111Dzo9D] to detect leukocytosis and neutrophilia, and **CRP** to assess inflammation severity [^115nMfUb]. Obtain a **comprehensive metabolic panel** to evaluate liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) [^114gKpDj] and total and direct bilirubin for biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^111peK8x]. Consider **blood cultures** in febrile patients with hypotension, tachypnea, or delirium [^116zK9sk], or when resistant organisms are a concern [^117G2gor]. These tests inform diagnosis and severity but are not diagnostic on their own [^113UFb78]; interpret alongside clinical assessment and imaging [^116kUMFg].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

- **Leukocytosis**: Elevated WBC count is common in acute cholecystitis [^111Dzo9D], reflecting systemic inflammation or infection [^111pmgwj].
- **Neutrophilia**: An increased neutrophil count [^113S5Gvs] is a strong independent predictor of acute cholecystitis [^1165emXK].
- **NLR**: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a useful inflammatory biomarker, with superior discriminative power compared to WBC alone [^1179vqs8].

---

## C-reactive protein (CRP)

CRP is a **sensitive marker of inflammation** [^111Dzo9D] and is typically elevated in acute cholecystitis. It has superior discriminative power [^115nMfUb] compared to WBC count, particularly in mild and moderate-to-severe cases.

---

## Liver function tests (LFTs)

LFTs are essential for evaluating **hepatic involvement and biliary obstruction** [^116SAcCw]. ALT and AST rise with hepatocellular injury; ALT may also increase with biliary obstruction or cholangitis [^111peK8x]. Elevations in ALP, GGT, and total and direct bilirubin [^114gKpDj] suggest biliary obstruction or cholangitis. Elevated LFTs alone are insufficient [^115ji3tH] to diagnose choledocholithiasis [^111v6obo]; further diagnostic tests are recommended [^114xrDEe].

---

## Blood cultures

Blood cultures are recommended for patients with suspected **intra-abdominal infection** who have fever, hypotension, tachypnea, delirium, or concern for antibiotic-resistant organisms [^117G2gor]. Positive results identify bacteremia, guide antibiotic therapy, and indicate severe infection or sepsis [^116xi3ue].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

Serum amylase and lipase may be elevated when **pancreatitis** is suspected [^116TBPPj], a potential complication of cholecystitis. Elevated lactate may indicate tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis, suggesting severe or complicated disease [^112p7nKs].

---

## Laboratory findings indicating severity or complications

Certain laboratory abnormalities suggest **severe or complicated cholecystitis**:

- **Marked leukocytosis**: Indicates severe inflammation or infection [^111Dzo9D].
- **Significantly elevated CRP**: Suggests severe inflammation or gangrenous cholecystitis [^115nMfUb].
- **Elevated bilirubin and LFTs**: May indicate biliary obstruction, cholangitis, or hepatic involvement [^114gKpDj].
- **Positive blood cultures**: Indicate bacteremia or sepsis, suggesting severe infection [^116xi3ue].

---

## Limitations of laboratory tests

- **Non-specificity**: Laboratory tests alone cannot definitively diagnose acute cholecystitis [^113UFb78]; they must be interpreted with clinical and imaging findings [^111pmgwj].
- **Normal results**: Normal laboratory results do not exclude acute cholecystitis, particularly in early or mild cases [^111Dzo9D].
- **False positives**: Elevated LFTs may occur without choledocholithiasis [^112Bus4P], necessitating further diagnostic evaluation [^114xrDEe] [^114gGaRR].

---

## Recommended laboratory tests summary

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| CBC with differential | Leukocytosis, neutrophilia, NLR [^111Dzo9D] |
| CRP | Inflammation severity [^115nMfUb] |
| ALT, AST, ALP, GGT | Hepatic involvement, biliary obstruction [^114gKpDj] |
| Total and direct bilirubin | Biliary obstruction, cholangitis [^111peK8x] |
| Blood cultures | Bacteremia, sepsis [^116zK9sk] |
| Serum amylase and lipase | Pancreatitis suspicion [^116TBPPj] |
| Lactate | Tissue hypoperfusion, sepsis [^112p7nKs] |

---

Laboratory tests for cholecystitis include **CBC with differential, CRP, LFTs, bilirubin, and blood cultures** when indicated [^111Dzo9D]. These tests assess inflammation, hepatic involvement, and complications but should be interpreted alongside clinical assessment and imaging [^116kUMFg].

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" for acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease serves as a pivotal clinical tool for identification and classification of this condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious gallbladder inflammation, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis are composed of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings.

- **Local signs of inflammation**: Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness.

- **Systemic signs of inflammation**: Fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count.

Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

The diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not. If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding clinicians in effective evaluation and management of the condition.

### C-reactive protein has a better discriminative power than white cell count in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [^115nMfUb]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) is challenging and may result in a delay in surgery, hospital discharge, and increased mortality. To improve its diagnosis, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been proposed as a benchmark. This study aimed to evaluate the discriminative power of CRP against white cell count (WCC) in AC.
- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study. Over a 5-year period, 1959 patients were identified from the audit of cholecystectomies. The exclusion criteria were coexisting acute surgical conditions, absence of blood tests within 3 days before hospital admission for elective surgery, and private patients.
- **Results**: The eligibility criteria were met by 1843 patients. Comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of CRP and WCC in acute on chronic, edematous, necrotic, suppurative, and gangrenous AC showed a better discriminative power of CRP. Both tests performed equally well in patients with pericholecystic abscess and gallbladder perforation. CRP was superior to WCC in mild AC, AUC = 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.9–0.95) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74–0.84), P < 0.00005; in moderate and severe AC, AUC = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97–1.0) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.97), P = 0.009; and in all forms of AC combined, AUC = 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92–0.97) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79–0.87), respectively, P < 0.00005.
- **Conclusions**: CRP has a better discriminative power than WCC in most forms of AC and is a useful diagnostic marker of AC.

Diagnosis of ACC

- **Diagnosis considerations**: As no feature has sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude the diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC), it is recommended not to rely on a single clinical or laboratory finding. The quality of evidence for this recommendation is high, and the strength of recommendation is strong.
- **Diagnostic strategy**: For the diagnosis of ACC, it is suggested to use a combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations. However, the optimal combination is still unknown. The quality of evidence here is very low, and the strength of recommendation is weak.

Comment: Useful features for the diagnosis of ACC include:

- **History and clinical examination**: Fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting or food intolerance, and Murphy's sign.

- **Laboratory tests**: Elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count.

- **Imaging**: Signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation.

The recommendations of the 2016 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines were primarily based on two studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis by Trowbridge et al. and a prospective diagnostic study by Eskelinen et al. Although this evidence had limitations, it remains relevant and the statements associated with it continue to be valid.

The study by Trowbridge et al. included 17 studies that provided a quantitative assessment of history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests for diagnosing acute cholecystitis. The results indicated that, except for Murphy's sign (positive likelihood ratio — LR 2.8; 95% CI 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2–1.1) — despite the 95% confidence intervals including 1.0 in both cases — none of the clinical signs or laboratory tests resulted in LRs higher than 1.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis — more specifically with respect to MRCP/EUS — WSES 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining preoperative imaging (with MRCP or EUS) or intraoperative cholangiography or laparoscopic ultrasound, depending on local expertise and availability, in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis and moderate risk for choledocholithiasis.

---

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113R8ekX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis is still a subject of debate regarding diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options, and timing for surgery.
- **Material and methods**: A systematic review of the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been completed. The recommendations of recent guidelines have been examined, taking into account the results of this review.
- **Results**: The evidence available in the literature supports the recommendation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible after diagnosis because early treatment reduces the total hospital stay and does not increase complication or conversion rates. Antibiotics can play different roles, and attention should be paid to the risk of emerging resistance. Surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is advocated by some authors in cases of advanced inflammation or patients with severe comorbidities; however, the available evidence does not support this, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XBEBr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). High credibility.

An updated overview of ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) remains lacking. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US for AC.
- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. We meticulously screened articles from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, spanning from inception to August 2023. We employed the search strategy combining the keywords "bedside US", "emergency US", or "point-of-care US" with "AC". Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to identify suitable studies. The inclusion criteria encompassed articles investigating the diagnostic performance of US for AC. Data regarding diagnostic performance, sonographers, and sonographic findings including the presence of gallstones, gallbladder (GB) wall thickness, peri-GB fluid, or sonographic Murphy sign were extracted, and a meta-analysis was executed. Case reports, editorials, and review articles were excluded, as well as studies focused on acalculous cholecystitis. The study quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.
- **Results**: Forty studies with 8,652 patients were included. The majority of studies had a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. US had a pooled sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 69–72%), a specificity of 85% (95% CI, 84–86%), and an accuracy of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82–0.83) for the diagnosis of AC. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 71% (95% CI, 67–74%) and 92% (95% CI, 90–93%) when performed by emergen.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^114BcThD]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult Western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year, the majority due to biliary colic, but a significant proportion due to acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute cholecystitis episode settles because of the fear of higher morbidity and the need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes individuals to gallstone-related complications.
- **Objectives**: The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) with regard to benefits and harms.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012.
- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.
- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.
- **Main results**: We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the analysis.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^111cihJ4]. World journal of emergency surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis is a common disorder worldwide. Its prevalence varies significantly by region: in Western countries, the prevalence of gallstone disease reportedly ranges from approximately 7.9% in men to 16.6% in women; in Asia, it ranges from approximately 3% to 15%; it is nearly non-existent (less than 5%) in Africa, and ranges from 4.21% to 11% in China.

Acute cholecystitis develops in 1–3% of patients with symptomatic gallstones. In 2016, WSES guidelines for the management of acute calculous cholecystitis (AAC) were published. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is made based on clinical features such as right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, and is supported by findings from relevant imaging studies. Ultrasound is the investigation of choice for patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis. Ultrasound typically shows pericholecystic fluid (fluid around the gall bladder), a distended gall bladder, an oedematous gallbladder wall, and gallstones. Murphy's sign can be elicited on ultrasound examination.

Treatment is predominantly surgical, although the timing of surgery without evidence of gangrene or perforation has been debated in recent years. Two approaches are available for the treatment of acute cholecystitis:

- **Early option**: Generally within 7 days of onset of symptoms, this involves a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to provide immediate, definitive surgical treatment after establishing diagnosis and surgical fitness of the patient in the same hospital admission.
- **Delayed treatment option**: This is performed at a later time.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^1145t1K2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute cholecystitis, particularly gallbladder drainage technique, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend preferring ultrasound-guided transmural gallbladder drainage with lumen-apposing self-expandable metal stents over endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder drainage. This recommendation applies to patients with acute calculous cholecystitis, provided the procedure is performed by skilled endoscopists.

### Cholecystitis [^113bNUia]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholecystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder and is usually caused by obstruction of the cystic duct.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute cholecystitis is mostly caused by gallstones or impacted biliary sludge, with or without secondary bacterial infection such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus faecalis.
- **Disease course**: The inflammatory process due to obstruction of the cystic duct results in acute cholecystitis, causing clinical manifestations of persistent pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and mild jaundice. Disease progression may lead to gangrenous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, cholecystoenteric fistulas, gallstone ileus, and acalculous cholecystitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, the overall mortality associated with untreated complications of acute cholecystitis is approximately 20%.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116f4bpe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning cholecystectomy, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend performing an early laparoscopic cholecystectomy as soon as possible. This should be done within 7 days of hospital admission and within 10 days from the onset of symptoms, provided adequate surgical expertise is available.

- **Associated common bile duct stones**: Which tools to use for suspicion and diagnosis at presentation?

Choledocholithiasis, i.e. the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS), is reported to occur in 10% to 20% of gallstone cases, with a lower incidence ranging from 5% to 15% in cases of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). Investigations for CBDS require time and may delay surgical treatment. Due to the relatively low incidence of CBDS during ACC, the main issue is selecting patients with a high likelihood of CBDS, who would benefit from further diagnostic tests and removal of CBDS. An uncommon condition that mimics CBDS is Mirizzi syndrome, occurring in less than 1% of patients with gallstones. Preoperative investigations may help in the diagnosis, although the vast majority of cases are identified at surgery.

The only new study on this topic was a cross-sectional study on the role of liver function tests (LFTs). The authors evaluated the role of LFTs and the role of early follow-up in the diagnosis of CBDS in ACC. The most reliable LFT was gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 75.3%, using a cut-off level of 224 IU/L. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 50%, while negative predictive value (NPV) was 91.4%. The results also showed a significant decrease in LFTs within the non-CBD groups at 4-day follow-up, which was not evident in the ACC + CBDS group — with the exception of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, in the CBDS group, all LFT values improved significantly after the removal of the CBDS at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 days.

### A proposal for a preoperative clinical scoring system for acute cholecystitis [^114eLrrN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common diagnosis for which surgery is usually indicated. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation makes it difficult to standardize management. The variation in clinical presentation is influenced by both patient-dependent and disease-specific factors. A preoperative clinical scoring system designed to include patient-dependent and clinical factors might be a useful tool in clinical decision-making.
- **Methods**: The data of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in a university hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patient-dependent factors (age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score) and disease-specific factors (history of biliary colics, white blood count, C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness) were used to compute a clinical score between zero and nine for each patient. Cholecystitis was classified as mild (score ≤ 3), moderate (4 ≤ score ≤ 6), or severe (score ≥ 7).
- **Results**: Cholecystitis was mild in 45 cases, moderate in 105 cases, and severe in 27 cases. Among patient-dependent factors, the male gender, age > 65 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score > 2 correlated significantly with high scores (P = 0.001). Equally, high white blood count, elevated C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness > 4 mm correlated significantly with high scores (P = 0.001). These findings were confirmed on multivariate analyses. High scores correlated significantly with the duration of surgery (P = 0.007) and the need for intensive care unit management.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, specifically concerning cholecystectomy, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend converting from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis who present with any of the following conditions:

- **Severe local inflammation**: This condition may complicate the procedure, necessitating an open approach.
- **Adhesions**: Presence of adhesions could obstruct visualization and access during a laparoscopic procedure.
- **Bleeding from the Calot's triangle**: Bleeding makes it difficult to proceed safely with a laparoscopic method.
- **Suspected bile injury**: If a bile injury is suspected, it is often safer to proceed with an open cholecystectomy to manage it appropriately.

### Clinical characteristics of acute cholecystitis with elevated liver enzymes not associated with choledocholithiasis [^114gGaRR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Elevated liver enzymes are occasionally observed in patients with acute cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis. The etiology and mechanism of this phenomenon are not well known. We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics between acute cholecystitis with and without choledocholithiasis in patients with elevated liver enzymes.
- **Patients and methods**: The medical records of patients with acute cholecystitis who underwent cholecystectomy between January 2001 and October 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. We retrieved data of patients who showed abnormal liver enzymes and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or intraoperative cholangiography.
- **Results**: We analyzed clinical characteristics and comorbidities in 424 patients. Among 424 cholecystectomy patients with abnormal liver enzymes, 178 (42%) patients did not have choledocholithiasis and 246 (58%) patients had choledocholithiasis. The median AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were 47, 82.5 IU/dl, and 1.21 mg/dl, respectively, in patients without choledocholithiasis, and 58, 96 IU/dl, and 1.53 mg/dl, respectively, in patients with choledocholithiasis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fatty liver [odds ratio (OR): 0.218; P < 0.001], radiologic findings (OR: 0.414; P = 0.001), and the level of total bilirubin (OR: 1.410; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of choledocholithiasis.

Elevated liver enzymes in patients with cholecystitis who do not have choledocholithiasis are correlated with the presence of fatty liver.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^1155Wsr7]. World journal of emergency surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasound (AUS) is the preferred initial imaging technique for patients who are clinically suspected to have acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) because of its lower cost, better availability, lack of invasiveness, and high accuracy for gallbladder stones.
- **Widespread availability**: AUS offers wide availability, lack of invasiveness, no exposure to ionizing radiation, and a short examination period, making it the primary choice for imaging investigation in the diagnosis of ACC. Two conditions must be met to diagnose ACC: the presence of gallbladder stones and inflammation in the gallbladder wall. AUS is the best available investigation for detecting gallbladder stones. A meta-analysis by Shea provides strong support for this assertion. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AUS in diagnosing gallstones were 84% (95% CI: 84–92%) and 99% (95% CI: 99–100%), respectively, based on diagnostic accuracy data from three studies.

### Evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a potential biomarker for acute cholecystitis [^1179vqs8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) is frequently associated with an increase in white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, one or both of these inflammatory biomarkers can be normal in AC. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the discriminative powers of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with WCC and CRP in diagnosing AC.
- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study. For more than a period of 5 years, 1959 patients were identified from the cholecystectomy registry. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients with histologic evidence of AC were included if they also had preoperative WCC and CRP measurements. Eligibility criteria were met by 177 patients. These patients were compared with 45 control subjects who had normal gallbladder histology.
- **Results**: One unit of increase in the NLR was associated with a 2.5 times increase in the odds of AC (odds ratio = 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.5–4.1; P < 0.0005). NLR cutoff values of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.42–4.79), 3.25 (95% CI, 1.95–4.54), and 4.17 (95% CI, 3.76–4.58) were diagnostic for the overall AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC, respectively. The NLR areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC were 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%), 87% (95% CI, 81%-93%), and 98% (95% CI, 96%-100%), respectively. The discriminative power of an NLR was superior to that of the WCC and similar to CRP for diagnosing AC and different grades of severity.
- **Conclusions**: NLR can be considered a potential inflammatory biomarker for AC.

The article by Eskelinen et al. evaluated more than 1300 patients and revealed a good diagnostic yield with a combination of findings from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, reporting a positive LR of 25.7 and a negative LR of 0.24.

The TG criteria for the diagnosis of cholecystitis include clinical signs, laboratory tests, and imaging features. After the publication of the paper by Yokoe et al. in 2012, which reported 91.2% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity, three studies reporting the validation of the TG diagnostic criteria were found. Although published in 2017, one study focused on the TG07 rather than the more recent TG13. A cross-sectional study evaluated the validity of fever, inflammatory markers, and US findings as a validation of the TG13 criteria. In multivariate analysis, only neutrophil count was statistically associated with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (p < 0.0001), with a 70% sensitivity and 65.8% specificity.

Overall, the accuracy of the TG13 criteria was low at 60.3%. The TG13 correctly predicted 83.1% of all confirmed ACC but over-diagnosed ACC in 62.5% of normal gallbladders. More than half of eligible patients did not undergo US and were excluded from the study; this represents a major source of potential selection bias. A cross-sectional study on the possible limitations of the TG13 reported a 53.4% sensitivity in diagnosing acute cholecystitis. However, some uncertainty regarding the sample population and the lack of detail in sensitivity calculation indicates that the data should be interpreted with caution.

- **Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis**: The guidelines highlight the feasibility and safety of performing the procedure in this category of patients.

- **Elderly age (> 80 years)**: It is suggested that advanced age alone should not be a deterrent for opting for a surgical approach if it aligns with the overall clinical context.
- **Pregnancy**: Consideration is given to the reduced invasiveness of laparoscopic techniques and their decreased risk profile, making them a viable option during pregnancy.

### Test characteristics of emergency medicine-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113t6CC8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis accounts for up to 9% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain, and the best practice entails early surgical management. Ultrasound is the standard modality used to confirm the diagnosis. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis when compared with a reference standard of final diagnosis, informed by available surgical pathology, discharge diagnosis, and radiology-performed ultrasound.

We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO, in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched seven databases as well as gray literature in the form of select conference abstracts from inception to February 8, 2023. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2) assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer.

Data were extracted from eligible studies to create 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis. Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic models were constructed. Of 1,855 titles/abstracts, 40 were selected for full-text review. Ten studies (n = 2,356) were included. Emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound with final diagnosis as the reference standard (7 studies, n = 1,772) had a pooled sensitivity of 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.3 to 78.2), specificity of 94.4% (95% CI 88.2 to 97.5).

The heterogeneity of patients affected by acute cholecystitis and their comorbidities make it very difficult to standardize therapy for this common condition. The staging system suggested in the recent "Tokyo guidelines" did not show a relevant impact on the management of patients or the outcome of the disease. The relationship among the local pathological picture, patient clinical status, and treatment algorithm needs to be better studied.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^112Bus4P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels are not sufficient to identify ACC patients with choledocholithiasis, and further diagnostic tests are needed. Liver biochemical tests historically have a great utility in determining the presence of CBDS; however, the majority of published studies are not in patients with ACC and also include asymptomatic cholelithiasis.

Normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. The positive predictive value of liver function studies is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in non-ACC cases, with results ranging from 25 to 50%. In fact, in ACC, liver biochemical tests may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree. Fifteen to fifty percent of patients with ACC show elevation in liver enzymes without choledocholithiasis.

Song et al. demonstrated that 424 of 1,178 patients with ACC had increased liver tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST] greater than twice normal levels). Of these, only 246 (58%) had choledocholithiasis. Chang et al. showed that 51% and 41% of ACC patients without choledocholithiasis had elevated ALT and AST, respectively. However, increased bilirubin levels with leukocytosis may predict gangrenous cholecystitis.

Padda et al. demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients with ACC without choledocholithiasis had abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or bilirubin, and 50% had abnormal ALT. Among patients with…

Which initial imaging technique should be used in case of a suspected diagnosis of ACC? We recommend the use of abdominal ultrasound (US) as the preferred initial imaging technique, in view of its cost-effectiveness, wide availability, reduced invasiveness, and good accuracy for gallstones disease.

- **Comment**: Abdominal US is a reliable investigation method; however, it may be of limited utility to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of ACC according to the adopted US criteria.

Neither meta-analysis nor studies with adequate quality of evidence have been published on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES guidelines. In 2012, Kiewet et al. published a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic performance of different imaging techniques in ACC. Abdominal ultrasound was not as accurate as it is for the diagnosis of gallstones.

The meta-analysis was based on the results of 26 studies including a total of 2847 patients. The sensitivity in individual studies ranged from 50 to 100% and specificity from 33 to 100%. Summary sensitivity and specificity were 81% (95% CI 75 to 87%) and 83% (95% CI 74 to 89%), respectively. However, strong heterogeneity in the diagnostic performance of abdominal US was reported: the inconsistency index was 80% for sensitivity and 89% for specificity. Notwithstanding these limitations, the widespread availability, lack of invasiveness, lack of exposure to ionizing radiation, and the reduced costs make abdominal US the preferred initial imaging technique in suspected ACC.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111MrViD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis reported the diagnostic accuracy of serum bilirubin and serum ALP at two cut-off values for each test. Serum bilirubin at a cut-off of 22.23 μmol/L had a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Bilirubin at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit had a sensitivity of 0.42 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.63) and a specificity of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than 125 IU/L, sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.99) and specificity was 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84). For ALP at a cut-off of greater than twice the normal limit, sensitivity was 0.38 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.59) and specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99).
- **Predictive imaging features of CBDS in patients with ACC**: We suggest considering the visualization of a stone in the common bile duct at transabdominal US as a predictor of CBDS in patients with ACC. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

- **Diameter of the common bile duct**: An increased diameter, an indirect sign of stone presence, is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with CBDS; further diagnostic tests are recommended. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Abdominal US is the preferred imaging technique for the diagnosis of ACC; the common bile duct can be visualized and investigated at the same time. A meta-analysis by Gurusamy et al. investigated the diagnostic potential of US: sensitivity ranged from 0.32 to 1.00 with a summary sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), while specificity ranged from 0.77 to 0.97 with a summary specificity of 0.91 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.97).

### Evaluating the relevance of the 2013 Tokyo guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cholecystitis [^117VWbSF]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

The 2013 Tokyo Guidelines (TG13) are used to diagnose, grade severity, and guide management of acute cholecystitis (AC). The aim of our study was to verify the diagnostic criteria, severity assessment, and management protocols based on the TG13.

- **Study design**: Our prospectively maintained emergency general surgery registry was used to review patients who had a surgical consultation for right upper quadrant pain (from 2013 to 2015). Diagnosis and severity were graded based on TG13 and compared with pathology reports. Our institutional management protocols were compared with TG13.

- **Results**: Nine hundred and fifty-two patients were analyzed, of which 857 had biliary diseases. The mean age was 42 ± 18 years, and 67% were female. Seven hundred and seventy-nine had a cholecystectomy, 15 underwent cholecystostomy tube placement, and 63 patients were managed conservatively. Only 4% were febrile on presentation, and 51% of patients had leukocytosis. Fifty-nine percent of patients did not have any signs of AC on ultrasonography. The TG13 criteria had a sensitivity of 53% for diagnosing AC (definitive 27%, suspected 26%, and undiagnosed 47%) when compared with the final pathology report; 92.5% of patients with grade I, 93% with grade II, and even 64% with grade III, underwent cholecystectomy safely at our institute. There were no differences in complication rates (3.7% vs. 4.7%; p = 0.81), return to operating room rates (0.6% vs. 0.7%; p = 0.95), or mortality rates (0.3% vs. 0%; p = 0.96) between grade I and grade II patients who underwent early cholecystectomy.

An updated overview of ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (AC) remains lacking. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US for AC.
- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Articles from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were meticulously screened, spanning from inception to August 2023. The search strategy employed keywords such as "bedside US", "emergency US", or "point-of-care US" in combination with "AC". Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to identify suitable studies. The inclusion criteria encompassed articles investigating the diagnostic performance of US for AC. Data regarding diagnostic performance, sonographers, and sonographic findings — including the presence of gallstone, gallbladder (GB) wall thickness, peri-GB fluid, or sonographic Murphy sign — were extracted, and a meta-analysis was executed. Case reports, editorials, and review articles were excluded, as well as studies focused on acalculous cholecystitis. The study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool.
- **Results**: Forty studies with 8,652 patients were included. The majority of studies had a low risk of bias and applicability concerns. US had a pooled sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 69–72%), a specificity of 85% (95% CI, 84–86%), and an accuracy of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.82–0.83) for the diagnosis of AC. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 71% (95% CI, 67–74%) and 92% (95% CI, 90–93%) when performed by emergency clinicians.

### Acute cholecystitis [^11656bvQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to the hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men, and about 1.5 times more common in women than in men thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.
- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
- **Results**: We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, and open cholecystectomy.

### Does this patient have acute cholecystitis [^111pmgwj]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources.
- **Objective**: To determine if aspects of the history and physical examination or basic laboratory testing clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
- **Data sources**: An electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 indexed in MEDLINE was conducted. Index Medicus was hand-searched for the years 1950–1965, and references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks on physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology were scanned. To identify relevant articles published since the comprehensive search, the MEDLINE search was repeated in July 2002.
- **Study selection**: Studies were included if they evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group that was determined not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan, right upper quadrant ultrasound, or a clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis with no evidence of an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were also included. Seventeen of the 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.
- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies.

### Acute cholecystitis: A review [^116TBPPj]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Gallbladder disease affects approximately 20 million people in the US. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in approximately 200,000 people in the US each year.
- **Observations**: Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness.

	- The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy (a nuclear medicine study that includes the intravenous injection of a radiotracer excreted in the bile) is the gold standard diagnostic test.

	- Following diagnosis, early (performed within 1–3 days) vs. late (performed after 3 days) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications (11.8% for early vs. 34.4% for late), a shorter length of hospital stay (5.4 days vs. 10.0 days), and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of m.

Acute cholecystitis is a common cause of right upper quadrant pain in patients presenting to the emergency department. Ultrasound, computed tomography, HIDA scans, and magnetic resonance imaging are increasingly utilized to evaluate suspected cases. The prognosis of acute cholecystitis is usually excellent with timely diagnosis and management. However, complications associated with cholecystitis pose a considerable challenge to the clinician and radiologist. Complications of acute cholecystitis may result from secondary bacterial infection or mural ischemia secondary to increased intramural pressure. The recognized subtypes of complicated cholecystitis are hemorrhagic, gangrenous, and emphysematous cholecystitis, as well as gallbladder perforation. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a form of cholecystitis that occurs as a complication of severe illness in the absence of gallstones or without gallstone-related inflammation. Complicated cholecystitis may cause significant morbidity and mortality, and early diagnosis and recognition play a pivotal role in the management and early surgical planning.

As appropriate utilization of imaging resources plays an essential role in diagnosis and management, the emergency radiologist should be aware of the spectrum of complications related to cholecystitis and the characteristic imaging features. This article aims to offer a comprehensive contemporary review of clinical and cross-sectional imaging findings of complications associated with cholecystitis. In conclusion, cross-sectional imaging is pivotal in identifying the complications associated with cholecystitis.

### The yield of fever, inflammatory markers and ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: A validation of the 2013 Tokyo Guidelines [^113S5Gvs]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Each year, 1–4% of people with known gallstones become symptomatic, either presenting with biliary colic or as acute cholecystitis. The distinction between both diagnoses remains challenging. To aid proper diagnosis, the revised 2013 Tokyo Guidelines (TG 2013) were proposed with a self-acclaimed diagnostic accuracy of over 90%. However, this accuracy has not been verified by others so far.
- **Objective**: To determine the accuracy of the TG 2013 guidelines in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, both in its single components of fever, inflammatory markers, and ultrasound features, and in the combined application of the TG 2013 guidelines as a whole.
- **Methods**: A 5-year retrospective analysis was conducted in accordance with the TG 2013 validation process for all emergency cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis or persistent biliary pain with an ultrasound performed during the same admission. Acute cholecystitis at histology was the gold standard.
- **Results**: Inclusion criteria were met by 169 patients, with a prevalence of acute cholecystitis of 52.7%. The individual features of fever, gallbladder wall thickening, and probe tenderness were not significant in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only neutrophil count was an independent predictor. The combined application of the TG 2013 guidelines led to a better sensitivity of 83.1% at the cost of a reduced specificity of 37.5% compared to neutrophil count alone. The accuracy was therefore only 60.3%, which was well below the TG 2013 report.
- **Conclusion**: The 2013 Tokyo Guidelines were slightly better in predicting acute cholecystitis.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116xi3ue]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

What is the role of microbiological cultures and sensitivities in patients with ACC?

- **In patients with complicated ACC and high risk for antimicrobial resistance**: We recommend adapting the targeted antibiotic regimen to the results of microbiological analysis, ensuring adequate antimicrobial coverage. #QoE: moderate; SoR: weak#

Identifying the causative organism(s) is an essential step in managing ACC, especially in patients at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, such as immunocompromised patients and those with healthcare-associated infections. The rate of positive bile culture (from either gallbladder culture or bile samples from the common bile duct) ranges from 29 to 54% in cases of ACC.

No additional studies have been found on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC.

### Sensitivity and predictive value of ultrasound in pediatric cholecystitis [^116ei15s]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2013). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography has a high sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosing cholecystitis in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity and PPV of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pediatric cholecystitis.
- **Methods**: We performed a single-institution retrospective review of the records of all patients undergoing cholecystectomy with a preoperative ultrasound during 2005–2010. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and PPV using pathologic findings as the standard for the diagnosis of cholecystitis.
- **Results**: In the 223 included patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 14 years (11–16 years), and 64% were female. Preoperative symptoms of abdominal pain were reported in 98% of patients. A diagnosis of cholecystitis was reported in 10% (23 of 223) of ultrasound readings. Pathologic diagnosis of cholecystitis was present in 80% (179 of 223) of cholecystectomy specimens, with 8% (15 of 179) having acute cholecystitis, 83% (148 of 179) chronic cholecystitis, and 9% (16 of 179) both. Sensitivity of ultrasound findings ranged from 6% for Murphy's sign to 66% for cholelithiasis. Positive predictive values ranged from 67% for Murphy's sign to 87% for gallbladder sludge. Presence of any one ultrasound sign had a sensitivity of 82% and PPV of 80%.
- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound findings in pediatric cholecystitis have lower sensitivities and PPVs than reported in adults. These differences may be explained by the higher prevalence of chronic cholecystitis in children, which suggests that children may have milder episodes of self-limited cholecystitis.

### Derivation and validation of a practical bedside score for the diagnosis of cholecystitis [^111rXr5G]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

We sought to develop a practical bedside score for the diagnosis of cholecystitis and test its accuracy against the Tokyo Guidelines (TG13).
- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of 438 patients undergoing evaluation of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain in an urban, academic emergency department (ED). Symptoms, physical signs, ultrasound signs, and laboratory data were considered as possible components of the scoring system. A random split-sample approach was used to develop and validate the new clinical score. Multivariable regression analysis was performed on the development data to identify predictors of cholecystitis. Cutoff values were selected to ensure positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of at least 0.95. The score was externally validated on 80 patients at a different hospital undergoing RUQ pain evaluation.
- **Results**: Of the patients, 230 (53%) were diagnosed with cholecystitis. Five variables were identified as predictors and included in the score: gallstones, gallbladder thickening, clinical or ultrasonographic Murphy's sign, RUQ tenderness, and post-prandial symptoms. A clinical prediction score was developed, and when a cut-off score of 4 was used, the overall accuracy for acute cholecystitis was 90% in the development cohort, 82%, and 86% in the internal and external validation cohorts, respectively. The TG13 accuracy ranged between 62% and 79%.

The study concludes that the clinical prediction score for cholecystitis demonstrates accuracy comparable to TG13. Utilizing this score could streamline work-up by reducing the need for comprehensive ultrasound evaluations and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement, potentially decreasing the length of stay in the ED.

### Diagnostic performance of ultrasound in acute cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154hNrp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

A total of 1309 studies were identified through MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and manual searches of the reference list of the included articles. After the initial screening and removal of duplicates, 60 studies were left for full-text article review. Among them, 20 studies were excluded during the full-text review as they did not present relevant findings on the topic or report the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US). Consequently, 40 studies were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. We also generated a summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curve to assess the performance of US in detecting acute cholecystitis (AC).

- **Figure 1: Flowchart**: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram outlines the inclusion and exclusion process.
- **Quality of the included studies**: Figure 2 shows the risk of bias and applicability of the included studies. In the risk of bias assessment, the majority of studies, except for patient selection, had a low risk of bias across four domains. However, more than 25% of the studies were identified as having a high risk of bias due to their utilization of a case–control study design and their non-consecutive or non-random enrollment of sample patients. Most studies received a low-risk score in the reference standard and index test domains. Nevertheless, some studies were deemed to have a high risk of bias in terms of applicability because they exclusively focused on post-cholecystectomy patients instead of a more diverse and representative sample.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^114xrDEe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend not relying solely on elevated LFTs or bilirubin for identifying common bile duct stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis. Instead, further diagnostic tests should be obtained.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^113fQgaP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend considering further imaging for the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis in selected patients. This should be based on local expertise and availability, recognizing that:

- **Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan**: Has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis.

- **Diagnostic accuracy of CT scans**: Is poor.
- **MRI accuracy**: Is comparable to that of an abdominal ultrasound.

### Acute acalculous cholecystitis: a review [^116hSK6A]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Although recognized for more than 150 years, acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) remains an elusive diagnosis. This is likely due to the complex clinical setting in which this condition develops, the lack of large prospective controlled trials evaluating various diagnostic modalities, and the reliance on a small database for clinical decision-making. AAC most often occurs in critically ill patients, especially those related to trauma, surgery, shock, burns, sepsis, total parenteral nutrition, and prolonged fasting.

Clinically, AAC is difficult to diagnose as the findings of right upper-quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver tests are not specific. It is associated with a high mortality rate, but early diagnosis and intervention can alter this outcome. Early diagnosis is crucial in the debate surrounding AAC and usually relies on imaging modalities. There are no specific criteria to diagnose AAC, so this review discusses the imaging methods most likely to achieve an early and accurate diagnosis despite the complexities of the radiologic modalities.

A pragmatic approach is vital. A timely diagnosis will depend on a high index of suspicion in the appropriate patient and the combined results of clinical findings (admittedly nonspecific) and properly interpreted imaging. Sonogram (often sequential) and hepatic iminodiacetic acid scans are the most reliable modalities for diagnosis. It is generally agreed that cholecystectomy is the definitive therapy for AAC. However, sometimes diagnostic/therapeutic drainage via interventional radiology or surgery may be necessary.

### Role of liver function tests in predicting common bile duct stones in acute calculous cholecystitis [^111v6obo]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The role of liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients with cholelithiasis has been studied widely. However, it is not clear whether these predictive models are useful in inflammatory gallstone disease.
- **Methods**: A review was undertaken of 385 consecutive patients admitted as an emergency for acute calculous gallbladder disease. The diagnosis of calculous cholecystitis was confirmed by ultrasonography or histological confirmation of acute or chronic inflammation of the gallbladder. Patients with obvious jaundice, defined as a bilirubin level above 80 micromol/l, and gallstone pancreatitis were excluded.
- **Results**: Some 216 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 (13.0 per cent) were found to have CBD stones. LFT results were not significantly different in patients with chronic, acute, or complicated acute cholecystitis. Using several cut-off levels, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) had the highest specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, comparable to a scoring system that combined all LFTs. Bilirubin was the least specific and predictive. A cut-off point for GGT at 90 units/l produced a sensitivity of 86 per cent (24 of 28), specificity of 74.5 per cent (140 of 188), and positive and negative predictive values of 33 per cent (24 of 72) and 97.2 per cent (140 of 144), respectively. This represented a one in three chance of CBD stones when the GGT level was above 90 units/l and a one in 30 chance when the level was less than 90 units/l.
- **Conclusion**: Selection criteria based on GGT can be highly useful in predicting CBD stones in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^112RxuPA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

One flaw of the study is that the index diagnosis depends to some extent on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of common bile duct stones (CBDS) is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated liver function tests (LFTs); this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC)?

- **Recommendation**: We recommend against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC. We recommend performing further diagnostic tests instead. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LFTs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included only those with asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value (PPV) of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC; the literature reports a range from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction. A proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had…

### History, physical examination, laboratory testing, and emergency department ultrasonography for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis [^1165emXK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common differential for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain. The diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for AC has not been quantitatively described.
- **Objectives**: We performed a systematic review to determine the utility of history and physical examination (H&P), laboratory studies, and ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing AC in the ED.
- **Methods**: We searched medical literature from January 1965 to March 2016 in PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS using a strategy derived from the following formulation of our clinical question: patients - ED patients suspected of AC; interventions - H&P, laboratory studies, and US findings commonly used to diagnose AC; comparator - surgical pathology or definitive diagnostic radiologic study confirming AC; and outcome - the operating characteristics of the investigations in diagnosing AC were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using Meta-DiSc with a random-effects model (95% CI). Study quality and risks for bias were assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.
- **Results**: Separate PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS searches retrieved studies for H&P (n = 734), laboratory findings (n = 74), and US (n = 492). Three H&P studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria with AC prevalence of 7%-64%. Fever had sensitivity ranging from 31% to 62% and specificity from 37% to 74%; positive LR [LR+] was 0.71–1.24, and negative LR [LR-] was 0.76–1.49. Jaundice sensitivity ranged from 11% to.

### 2020 world society of emergency surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (50%) of CBDS. This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC in order to select patients who need stone removal; finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP (see Figure 1 for the flowchart of management of ACC).
- **Risk factors and classification**: For CBDS, as modified from Maple et al. (2010).

For stratifying the risk of CBDS in patients with ACC, we suggest using the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. #QoE: very low; SoR: weak#

ASGE guidelines remain a valuable tool for the diagnosis and management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high-risk patients require specific diagnostic approaches.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (e.g. acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are necessarily related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### The ChoCO-W prospective observational global study: Does covid-19 increase gangrenous cholecystitis [^113bFW8V]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 group has more generalized abdominal pain (20.1% compared with 12.4%).
- **Laboratory test results**: The mean white blood cell count and CRP were significantly higher in the COVID group [8156 (8266)/mm³ compared with 7501 (18 690)/mm³ and 89.44 (98.3) mg/L compared with 80.15 (102.5); p = 0.04 and 0.002, respectively]. The most striking significant differences were in the total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin, which were almost doubled in the COVID group [9.07 (19.99) mg/dL compared with 5.38 (26.24) mg/dL and 5.38 (15.89) mg/dL compared with 2.31 (8.14), p < 0.0001 in both].
- **AST and ALT values**: Although there was statistical significance in the mean value of AST and ALT, the difference did not seem to impact clinical features and outcomes.
- **D-dimer and arterial lactates**: D-dimer was significantly higher and arterial lactates were significantly lower in the COVID group [858.5 (2382) nmol/L compared with 456.8 (1644); p = 0.02] and [3.52 (12.73) mmol/L compared with 16.96 (79), p = 0.03, respectively].
- **APTT time**: APTT time was significantly longer in the COVID patients [31.52 (8.94) sec compared with 26.39 (11.54); p < 0.0001].

### Hemorrhagic cholecystitis: ultrasound and CT imaging findings — a retrospective case review series [^114fNbFy]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Gallbladder pathology is diverse, and imaging tests are essential tools for its diagnosis. Acute cholecystitis has multiple manifestations or complications, one of which is hemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC). In the literature, this pathology has been described only in the spectrum of acute cholecystitis complications, within case reports or series with a maximum of two to three cases. After a retrospective review, we present 11 cases of hemorrhagic cholecystitis and discuss its various causes, clinical presentations, and findings on ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT), considering dual-energy CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

A retrospective review covering six years (2012–2018) of hemorrhagic cholecystitis cases diagnosed at our hospital was performed. A medical terms search engine and the hospital's emergency department radiological cases database were used. After a careful review by two emergency and one abdominal radiologist, 11 patients were identified as hemorrhagic cholecystitis cases according to their clinical, radiological, and surgical records, confirmed with pathology reports.

Both lithiasis and anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy were the most common etiologies found (9 patients, 82%). The clinical presentation may be misleading, simulating a usual cholecystitis episode with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, or manifesting with signs of bile duct obstruction, hematemesis, or anemia that may compromise the patient hemodynamically and become fatal. US is useful, but CT is the most complete test for evaluating this condition.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^114jxnHw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is no single clinical or laboratory finding with sufficient diagnostic accuracy to establish or exclude acute cholecystitis (LoE 2 GoR B). A combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, and laboratory tests may strongly support the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) (LoE 4 GoR C).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of different clinical signs and bedside tests in the diagnosis of ACC included 17 studies in which the quantitative assessment of diagnostic values of clinical tests were reported. Twelve variables related to history and clinical examination, five variables related to basic laboratory tests, and one variable which was a combination of a clinical sign and a laboratory test were tested in a cohort of patients with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis.

Results showed that with the exception of Murphy's sign, none of the summary positive likelihood ratios (LR) of the clinical tests was higher than 1.6, and none of the summary negative LRs was less than 0.4. Murphy's sign had a positive LR of 2.8 (95% CI 0.8 to 8.6) and a negative LR of 0.5 (95% CI 0.2 to 1), but the 95% CI included the value 1. Although the study was classified as one of high quality according to the Oxford classification, it presents some limitations. The study did not report the proportion of patients with abdominal pain and the proportion of patients with suspected acute cholecystitis. Although LR is robust to assess the prevalence, the inclusion of patients with abdominal pain together with patients having suspicion of acute cholecystitis may be a source of heterogeneity.

### Acute cholecystitis [^114pPftD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to the hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men. Beyond this age, it is about 1.5 times more common in women than in men. Approximately 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. The optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.
- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2011. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
- **Results**: We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.
- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, open cholecystectomy, and percutaneous cholecystostomy.

### 2020 world Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^114Dy5DR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholecystitis, specifically in the evaluation for choledocholithiasis, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following, depending on local expertise and availability, for patients with acute calculous cholecystitis and high risk for choledocholithiasis:

- **Preoperative ERCP**: Obtain to evaluate the biliary tree for stones or obstructions prior to surgery.
- **Intraoperative cholangiography**: Perform during surgery to ensure there are no bile duct obstructions.
- **Laparoscopic ultrasound**: Use as an alternative to visually assess the bile ducts for stones or other abnormalities.
