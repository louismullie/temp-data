## Question

Which antihypertensive medication is indicated for renal hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive medication is most appropriate for "renal hypertension", and how to tailor therapy when the cause is CKD versus renovascular disease from renal artery stenosis, including combinations, contraindications, and monitoring expectations.

> Let me first clarify the term, because I need to ensure we're treating the right entity and not talking past each other; "renal hypertension" can mean hypertension in CKD, or renovascular hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, and that distinction changes risk, drug selection, and the role of revascularization, so I should confirm which phenotype fits the patient before committing to a plan.

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for hypertension in CKD with albuminuria, because that's where the renoprotective choice really matters; guidelines consistently prioritize RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB to lower BP, reduce albuminuria, and slow CKD progression, and this applies across diabetes and non-diabetes with A2–A3 albuminuria, so ACEi or ARB is my initial anchor unless there's a contraindication [^115eF8X2] [^117Qk1GA] [^116VhNKh] [^113hhZjA].

> Wait, let me verify choice within the RAAS class; ACE inhibitors and ARBs are both acceptable, and I might be tempted to combine them for added proteinuria reduction, but hold on, I should not jump to that because dual RAAS blockade increases hyperkalemia, hypotension, and AKI without mortality benefit, so I should pick one class and avoid ACEi + ARB together [^111Z3zt7] [^111LLsb8].

> I will now examine combination strategy, because most patients need more than one drug; if BP is not controlled, I should add a dihydropyridine CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, ideally as a single-pill triple combination anchored by the RAAS blocker, and I can favor ARB + CCB for good tolerability and renocardiovascular profiles while I titrate to targets [^116Uiyap] [^111Z3zt7].

> Let me consider renovascular hypertension specifically, since the safety calculus shifts; medical therapy remains first-line for most, and ACEi/ARBs can be effective, but I need to check for bilateral renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney because RAAS blockade can precipitate AKI in that context, meaning I should start low, monitor closely, and if creatinine rises ≥ 30% or potassium climbs, I must reassess for hemodynamically significant stenosis and consider revascularization in high-risk phenotypes like flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid GFR loss with high-grade lesions [^1164MacD] [^112jEytt] [^115jTENw].

> I should double-check monitoring steps whenever I initiate or uptitrate RAAS blockade; I need baseline creatinine and potassium, then repeat labs within 1–2 weeks, accept up to a 30% creatinine rise as expected hemodynamics, and intervene if hyperkalemia or larger creatinine increases occur, because early detection prevents avoidable AKI and lets me continue the renoprotective agent when safe [^1131CjHu].

> Next, I should review resistant hypertension add-ons in CKD, because a fourth agent is often needed; spironolactone or another MRA is the preferred fourth-line option if potassium and kidney function allow, while beta-blockers, alpha-1 blockers, or centrally acting agents can be layered if MRA is not tolerated, and in carefully selected patients with eGFR above 40 and persistent uncontrolled BP despite optimized combinations, renal denervation may be considered as an adjunct [^113ehTpj] [^111b7tZD].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic work-up when renovascular disease is suspected, because treatment hinges on confirmation; renal ultrasound with Doppler is a reasonable first test in CKD to assess kidney structure and screen for renoparenchymal or renovascular causes, with CT or MR angiography as alternatives to define anatomy and lesion severity when intervention is contemplated [^1136t7QG].

> Putting this together, my first-line medication for "renal hypertension" due to CKD with albuminuria is an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, titrated to maximal tolerated effect, then combined as needed with a dihydropyridine CCB and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, while strictly avoiding dual ACEi+ARB and monitoring creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks; for renovascular hypertension, I will still favor medical therapy with cautious RAAS blockade and prompt lab monitoring, but I should avoid or very carefully use RAAS inhibitors in bilateral stenosis or a solitary functioning kidney and move to revascularization in high-risk presentations such as flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension despite optimal therapy, or rapid kidney function decline from high-grade stenosis [^1131CjHu] [^115eF8X2] [^117Qk1GA] [^111Z3zt7] [^1164MacD].

---

For renal hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are **first-line** [^1131CjHu] because they lower blood pressure and provide renal protection, especially in proteinuric CKD [^113hhZjA]. Monitor for a **≥ 30% rise in creatinine or hyperkalemia** after starting therapy [^112jEytt], and avoid dual ACEi/ARB use [^111Z3zt7]. Add a **calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic** if needed [^116Uiyap], and use loop diuretics in advanced CKD [^notfound]. Beta-blockers or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are options for resistant hypertension [^113ehTpj]. Revascularization is reserved for refractory cases or rapid renal decline [^112jEytt], and renal denervation is considered only in resistant hypertension with eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111b7tZD].

---

## First-line antihypertensive therapy

- **ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: These are the preferred initial therapy [^1131CjHu] for renal hypertension due to their dual effect of lowering blood pressure and providing renal protection, particularly in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^113hhZjA]. ACEis and ARBs reduce intraglomerular pressure, proteinuria, and slow CKD progression [^116gsgXk].

- **Monitoring and precautions**: After initiating ACEis or ARBs, closely monitor renal function and serum potassium levels. A rise in serum creatinine up to 30% from baseline is acceptable; however, increases beyond this threshold or significant hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mmol/L) necessitate dose adjustment or discontinuation [^1131CjHu].

- **Avoidance of dual RAAS blockade**: Combining ACEis and ARBs is not recommended due to increased risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal impairment without additional clinical benefit [^111Z3zt7].

---

## Adjunctive antihypertensive agents

When ACEis or ARBs alone fail to reach target blood pressure, **add another antihypertensive class**:

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Particularly dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. amlodipine) are effective adjuncts, especially in patients with CKD or those intolerant to ACEis/ARBs [^116VhNKh].

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Useful in early-stage CKD (eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) to manage volume overload and enhance antihypertensive efficacy [^116Uiyap].

- **Loop diuretics**: Preferred in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) due to superior efficacy in managing fluid overload [^115qWDuQ].

- **Beta-blockers**: Considered in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease or resistant hypertension [^113ehTpj].

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**: Spironolactone or eplerenone are effective in resistant hypertension but require careful monitoring for hyperkalemia, particularly in CKD patients [^113ehTpj].

---

## Special considerations in renal hypertension management

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis**: ACEis and ARBs can precipitate acute renal failure in bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initiate therapy cautiously with close monitoring of renal function [^1158GvHE].

- **Resistant hypertension**: Defined as uncontrolled blood pressure despite optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic. In such cases, MRAs, beta-blockers, or centrally acting agents (e.g. clonidine) may be added [^113ehTpj].

- **Renal denervation**: Considered in patients with resistant hypertension [^112nsARW] and eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m² who remain uncontrolled despite multiple antihypertensive agents or experience significant side effects [^111b7tZD].

---

## Role of revascularization

Revascularization (angioplasty or stenting) is **reserved for specific clinical scenarios** [^112jEytt], such as refractory hypertension despite optimal medical therapy, rapidly declining renal function, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema. Recent guidelines emphasize that most patients with renal hypertension can be effectively managed with medical therapy alone, with revascularization limited to high-risk cases [^115jTENw].

## Summary of antihypertensive therapy for renal hypertension

| **Drug class** | **Indication** | **Monitoring** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACEis/ARBs | First-line therapy | Renal function, potassium | Avoid dual blockade |
| CCBs | Adjunctive therapy | Blood pressure | Peripheral edema |
| Thiazide diuretics | Early CKD | Electrolytes | Ineffective in advanced CKD |
| Loop diuretics | Advanced CKD | Electrolytes | Hypokalemia |
| Beta-blockers | Resistant HTN, CVD | Heart rate | Bradycardia |
| MRAs | Resistant HTN | Potassium | Hyperkalemia |

---

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the **preferred initial therapy** [^115eF8X2] for renal hypertension, with careful monitoring of renal function and potassium levels. Adjunctive antihypertensive agents, including calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, beta-blockers, and MRAs, are added as needed to achieve blood pressure targets [^116Uiyap]. Revascularization is reserved for refractory cases [^112jEytt], and renal denervation is considered in resistant hypertension with preserved renal function [^111b7tZD].

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly with respect to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of RAAS inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, in patients with hypertension, CKD, and moderately increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2) without diabetes.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^111Z3zt7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials reported between January 1990 and August 2012 compared dual blockers of the RAS with monotherapy. It reported data on either long-term efficacy (≥ 1 year) or safety events (≥ 4 weeks) and included a sample size of at least 50 (68,405 patients [mean age 61 years, 71% men] and mean duration of 52 weeks). The study showed that although dual blockade of the RAS had seemingly beneficial effects on certain surrogate endpoints, it failed to reduce mortality and was associated with an excessive risk of adverse events such as hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure compared to monotherapy. The results of this comprehensive meta-analysis at the time of writing indicated that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual therapy. Based on these study results, the EMA recently started a review of the risks of combining certain medicines to block separate stages of the RAS in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.

Selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should depend on careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology. Existing evidence suggests that in cardiovascular high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB plus calcium channel blocker is the preferred combination due to superior renoprotective and cardiovascular benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hypertension, specifically renal denervation, the ESH 2023 guidelines recommend considering renal denervation as a treatment option for patients with an eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m² and uncontrolled BP, despite the use of antihypertensive drug combination therapy. It is also recommended when drug treatment causes serious side effects and poor quality of life (QoL).

### Treatment of atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension: Review of observational studies and a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115jTENw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis can cause ischaemic nephropathy and arterial hypertension. We herein review the observational and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing medical and endovascular treatment for control of hypertension and renal function preservation. Using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) strategy, we identified the relevant studies and performed a novel meta-analysis of all RCTs to determine the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment when compared with medical therapy.

- **Outcomes examined**: Baseline follow-up difference in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, number of drugs at follow-up, incident events (heart failure, stroke, and worsening renal function), mortality, cumulative relative risk of heart failure, stroke, and worsening renal function.

Seven studies comprising a total of 2,155 patients (1,741 available at follow-up) were considered, including the recently reported CORAL Study. Compared with baseline, diastolic BP fell more at follow-up in patients in the endovascular than in the medical treatment arm (standard difference in means -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.342 to -0.078, P = 0.002) despite a greater reduction in the mean number of antihypertensive drugs (standard difference in means -0.201, 95% CI: -0.302 to -0.1, P < 0.001). At variance, follow-up changes (from baseline) of systolic BP, serum creatinine, and incident cardiovascular event rates did not differ between treatment arms.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system blockade: Little to no rationale for ACE inhibitor and ARB combinations [^111LLsb8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complexities and inter-related pathways of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system continues to evolve. Which drugs to use, when, and how, are everyday questions faced by clinicians in the ambulatory setting. Combining these classes, for the purpose of enhancing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and incremental blood pressure, nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects, logically has emerged as an area for scientific inquiry and clinical use.

Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials.

Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.

### Blood pressure-elevating and antihypertensive medication prescription trends [^111vFGu9]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke, which are among the leading causes of death in the United States. Hypertension is a chronic medical condition that affects a significant portion of the US population. According to 2017 to 2020 estimates, nearly 48.1% of US adults have hypertension, of which 77.5% have uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg). Hypertension control is critically important as it is significantly associated with lower risks of premature heart disease mortality and major acute cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

One of the less investigated barriers to hypertension control is the use of medications that can raise BP levels. According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline, certain prescription medications, such as amphetamines, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and combined oral contraceptives, can raise BP. The use of these medications might lead to hypertension or worsening BP control among those with hypertension.

- **Concomitant use**: Use of BP-elevating medication might attenuate the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy or might also lead to a change in BP from drug interactions.

Prior studies have documented antihypertensive medication trends among the US population; however, there is scarce literature on prescription fills for BP-elevating medications. One study, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination, provides some insights into this issue.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^116SDeLF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is highly prevalent in heart failure (HF), occurring in 54% of outpatient individuals with HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and in 34% of patients over 70 years of age who are hospitalized for acute systolic HF. Two small secondary analyses of the ASTRAL study showed no difference between groups in cardiac structure and function, assessed either by echocardiography or MRI. However, as previously discussed, HF was underrepresented in the large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and no imaging RCTs including solely patients with HF and renal artery stenosis (RAS) are available.

Several case reports have noted significant improvements in cardiac morphology and function after renal artery revascularization in patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis presenting with flash pulmonary edema. An observational analysis from the UK involving 611 patients with RAS greater than 50% revealed a large difference in mortality risk between percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and standard medical therapy for those with HF [HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.3–0.9)], with non-significant reductions for those without HF [HR 0.8 (95% CI 0.5–1.1)]. Furthermore, the hazard ratio (HR) for hospital admission for HF overall in revascularized patients was 0.2 (95% CI 0.0–1.1, P = 0.06).

In 152 patients with HF but without previous acute pulmonary edema, the HR for death after revascularization compared with medical therapy was 0.76 (95% CI 0.58–0.99). Another observational study of 163 patients found that PTRA with stenting was associated with a significant decrease in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (1.9 ± 0.8 versus 2.6 ± 1.0; P < 0.04) and a five-fold reduction in the number of hospitalizations.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^115FjA93]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The addition of antihypertensive drug therapy to nonpharmacological lifestyle counseling is recommended for all adults with an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, irrespective of CVD/ASCVD risk, in the ACC/AHA guideline (Tables 6–8). For the same BP cut points, the ESC/ESH guideline recommends the immediate initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy in high-risk or very-high-risk patients with CVD, renal disease, or HMOD. This recommendation also applies if BP is not controlled after three months of lifestyle intervention in patients at low or moderate risk for CVD. An exception is that adults older than 80 years with untreated hypertension should only be considered for BP lowering when their office SBP is ≥ 160 mm Hg. In the ACC/AHA guideline, drug therapy is recommended for approximately 30% of adults with an SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP of 80 to 89 mm Hg who are identified as being at higher risk for CVD/ASCVD. This has a notable impact on increased drug treatment for older patients, given that age is a strong, nonmodifiable determinant of risk. In contrast, the ESC/ESH may only consider drug therapy for adults with an SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP of 85 to 89 mm Hg in patients with CVD, particularly those with coronary artery disease. Figure 2 provides two algorithms that highlight the recommended approaches to managing adults with different categories of BP and CVD/ASCVD risk using nonpharmacological therapy/lifestyle advice and antihypertensive drug therapy. It is challenging to derive a precise quantitative estimate for the resulting difference in therapy initiation and outcomes.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^111FbFMq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Several reports of individual cases and cohorts have shown that patients with high-risk presentations of AVRD — such as flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function — benefit most from revascularization. These patients often present with nearly occluded renal arteries, bilateral RAS, or single RAS with a solitary kidney, and revascularization had immediate beneficial effects. This procedure resulted in substantial decreases in blood pressure and significant improvement in kidney function. Following publications of relevant RCTs that almost entirely excluded patients with ARVD and high-risk clinical presentations, as discussed below, several observational cohort studies examined whether PTRA with stenting might be beneficial for these individuals.

A previous prospective cohort study evaluated 467 individuals in the UK with RAS > 50% who received either medical treatment or medical treatment plus PTRA with stenting. This study examined future CV events and mortality depending on clinical presentation, as well as the relevant treatment. Among patients receiving only medical treatment, those with flash pulmonary oedema had a markedly increased risk of death [HR 2.2 (95% CI 1.4–3.5)] and CV events [HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.7–5.5)] compared with patients with low-risk phenotypes. These low-risk individuals were characterized by the absence of flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function. In the same study, PTRA with stenting compared to medical treatment was associated with large reductions in the risk of death [HR 0.15 (95% CI 0.02–0.9)] and CV events.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes, due to the postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite their widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Authors of relevant papers were also contacted regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbid outcomes.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients, due to postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg) that compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^1136t7QG]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, specifically concerning the evaluation of renovascular and renal parenchymal disease, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining renal ultrasound and Doppler in patients with hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) to assess kidney structure, determine causes of CKD, and exclude renoparenchymal and renovascular hypertension. Consider obtaining computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance renal angiography as alternative options.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^116NdMvi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Renin inhibitors, which inhibit the first and rate-limiting step in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are thought to be more effective than other RAS inhibitors in blocking the RAS. Previous meta-analyses have shown that renin inhibitors have a favorable tolerability profile in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension and a blood pressure-lowering magnitude that is similar to that of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs inhibit the RAS by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II with its receptors. ARBs are widely prescribed and recommended as first-line therapy by some hypertension guidelines. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ARBs in treating hypertension are unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to angiotensin receptor blockers in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search Methods**: On 26 January 2024, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials: Cochrane Hypertension's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) were also searched for ongoing trials. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

### Should beta blockers remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension? A meta-analysis [^117T5Dgx]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have been widely used in treating hypertension and are recommended as first-line drugs in hypertension guidelines. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that atenolol is not very effective in hypertension. We aim to substantially enlarge the data on atenolol and analyze the effect of different beta blockers.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for beta blocker treatment in patients with primary hypertension. Data were then entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager package and summarized in meta-analyses. Thirteen randomized controlled trials (n = 105,951) were included in a meta-analysis comparing treatment with beta blockers and other antihypertensive drugs. Seven studies (n = 27,433) were included in a comparison of beta blockers and placebo or no treatment.

- **Findings**: The relative risk of stroke was 16% higher for beta blockers (95% CI 4–30%) than for other drugs. There was no difference for myocardial infarction. When the effect of beta blockers was compared with that of placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19% for all beta blockers (7–29%), about half that expected from previous hypertension trials. There was no difference for myocardial infarction or mortality.

- **Interpretation**: In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of beta blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that beta blockers should not remain the first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomized trials.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: Clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset.

A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal and to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). This is advised for patients with hypertension (HTN), CKD, and moderately to severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2, and A3) with diabetes.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^1167uQaF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In a recent issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Reinhard et al. report that in a prospective observational study with a 2-year follow-up regarding the effect of renal artery stenting in patients with resistant hypertension, a 24-hour systolic blood pressure (BP) evaluated by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was decreased by 25.7 mm Hg from a baseline of 166.2 mm Hg, and an improvement in renal function was observed. Although participants were using 2 to 3 classes of antihypertensive medications and office BP measurements were used in former studies, the novelty of Reinhard et al.'s observational study is the feature of "true resistant hypertension" among subjects who had used at least 4 different classes of antihypertensive medications and whose uncontrolled BP was evaluated by multiple ABPM measurements. All prospective observational studies, including that of Reinhard et al, reported that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTRA), such as renal artery stenting, had a favorable effect on elevated BP. From these findings, PTRA for renovascular hypertension should be considered a reasonable treatment for the management of hypertension. Of course, PTRA is an invasive procedure with a risk of adverse complications. Before it can be widely applied to patients with renovascular hypertension, it must be shown that PTRA is superior to antihypertensive drug therapy.

There are cases of uncontrolled blood pressure in patients who take appropriate medications and have adhered to recommended dietary and exercise interventions. In fact, their resistant hypertension presents a significant challenge in management.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9**: In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If the goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug; if the goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

- **Basis of Recommendations**: In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories. For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of over 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of six different thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent effect.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1164MacD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

The pathogenesis of blood pressure (BP) rise in renal artery stenosis (RAS) was first described 90 years ago. It is widely accepted that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) with lumen stenosis greater than 70% will cause a reduction of renal blood flow and hypoperfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, stimulating the release of renin, followed by increased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Stenoses of lesser degrees are suggested to have minimal haemodynamic effects due to the compensatory mechanisms of renal autoregulation. However, renal autoregulation may be compromised in several groups of individuals, including the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus or heart failure (HF), and thus it cannot be excluded that renal blood flow in such patient groups could be compromised in stenoses of lesser degrees.

Furthermore, ischaemia of even a few nephrons can cause the full syndrome of renovascular hypertension, as shown in numerous cases of segmental RAS with excess unilateral renin release, striking hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of affected glomeruli, and reversal of hypertension by partial nephrectomy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. In unilateral RAS, the contralateral healthy kidney is expected to at least partly compensate for the adverse effects of renin-dependent hypertension through pressure natriuresis. However, in the increasingly common cases of bilateral RAS, this compensation cannot be present, causing sodium/volume retention and leading to a volume-dependent hypertension phenotype, and a higher risk of 'flash' pulmonary edema.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension: Pragmatism, pitfalls, and perspectives [^115q2btt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many years, a diagnostic work-up to identify secondary forms of hypertension, particularly of renovascular origin, has been a central tenet in medicine. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization call into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes "renovascular hypertension".

From a clinical standpoint, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not experience a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty. Subjecting these patients to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up amounts to little more than a wild goose chase. However, with very few exceptions, medical therapy with antihypertensives and statins remains the cornerstone for the management of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension.

### Endovascular intervention in renovascular disease: a pictorial review [^1115Cjw6]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure that remains above the goal despite the use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes, or hypertension that requires four or more medications for effective management. RH affects 9% of all hypertensive patients and 13% of those receiving antihypertensive therapy, putting these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events.

Various factors, including renal artery stenosis, have been implicated in the development of RH. Physiologically, RH has been associated with elevated activity in both the efferent and afferent renal sympathetic nerves. Renal denervation is an emerging endovascular treatment modality in the management of this disease.

The denervation procedure involves the delivery of catheter-based radiofrequency ablation through the main renal artery. Thermal energy generated in this process effectively disrupts the sympathetic nerves in the adventitia, thereby decreasing vascular tone. While studies are ongoing, suggested indications for renal denervation include patients with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (> 160 mmHg; > 150 mmHg in diabetics) despite optimized lifestyle factors and antihypertensive medications (i.e. more than three synergistic drugs).

Studies comparing the effectiveness of renal sympathetic denervation to standard medical therapy have demonstrated contradictory results. Early nonrandomized studies and randomized, unblinded trials have shown significant blood pressure reduction in denervation patients, with a BP reduction of 33/11 mmHg at 6 months.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, particularly concerning antihypertensive selection and subsequent therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines suggest intensifying treatment to a three-drug combination. This typically involves a renin-angiotensin system blocker with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably in a single-pill combination, if blood pressure is not controlled with a two-drug combination.

### Intracranial pressure during the development of renovascular hypertension [^112W7t5Y]. Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

The study investigates the changes in intracranial pressure that occur during the progression of renovascular hypertension. In particular, it examines the relationship between high blood pressure due to renal artery stenosis and its impact on the pressure within the skull. The findings suggest that elevated blood pressure may directly influence intracranial dynamics, which could have implications for managing patients with this condition. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective treatments.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^113ipxvw]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The central role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) has been recognized for many years. The discovery of tissue-based angiotensin II production has resulted in the concept of a local RAS that is independent of the circulating RAS.

RAS activation, following the release of renin by the kidney, results in a cascade of physiological events (Figure 1). Renin catalyzes the formation of angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), resulting in activation of the angiotensin II receptors and its deleterious effect on renal vasculature, leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The progressive development of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) resulting from pathophysiological changes mediated by angiotensin II in the presence of risk factors is well established, and local activation of RAS in the vascular walls is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intrarenal RAS is often inappropriately activated in diabetes, and is thought to predispose these patients to nephropathy. RAS inhibition (both circulatory and intrarenal) is therefore a key therapeutic approach to slow progression of CKD and to reduce CV risk through both BP-dependent and independent mechanisms.

### Renovascular hypertension: screening and modern management [^111GPSDo]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of patients with renovascular disease and hypertension continue to challenge healthcare providers. The advent of novel imaging and interventional techniques, coupled with an increased understanding of the pathways leading to irreversible renal injury and renovascular hypertension, has led to commendable efforts to optimize and refine strategies to preserve or restore renal function and control blood pressure. Large randomized clinical trials comparing different forms of therapy, along with smaller trials testing novel experimental treatments, are anticipated to contribute to the development of innovative concepts and tools for managing patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: Current understanding and future direction [^115Ewkok]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is common and affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to management of these people is unclear. This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectrum of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. It is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

### Treatment of hypertension with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and renal dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131N9he]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine whether inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction when compared to other antihypertensive treatments in patients with essential hypertension and no pre-existent renal disease.

- **Methods**: The search strategy utilized the Cochrane Library, Medline, previous meta-analyses, and journal reviews. Randomized, controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs comparing a RAS inhibitor to another treatment in essential hypertension were included, excluding studies with patients specifically having diabetes or renal disease. Quality assessment and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Effects on dichotomous renal outcomes (such as serum creatinine (SCreat) higher than a prespecified value, doubling of SCreat, or end-stage renal disease) and a secondary continuous marker of renal outcome (change in SCreat) were calculated using Peto's method.

- **Results**: A total of 33,240 patients met the inclusion criteria for studies with a dichotomous outcome, and 10,634 patients for studies with a continuous outcome. The mean follow-up was 42 ± 13 months. Patients randomized to RAS inhibitors did not show a significant reduction in the risk of developing renal dysfunction compared to other antihypertensive strategies (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89–1.25; P = 0.54). There was no significant difference in the change of SCreat between groups (mean difference = 0.0005 mg/dl; 95% CI -0.0068 to 0.0077 mg/dl; P = 0.91).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with essential hypertension, RAS inhibitors do not significantly reduce the risk of renal dysfunction compared to other antihypertensive treatments.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of this review, originally published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors typically aim to achieve a specific blood pressure target. This target is the blood pressure value below which optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. The "lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged over the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomized trials supporting that strategy. Consequently, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice in recent years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of attempting to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the benefits outweigh the harms when striving for targets lower than the standard target.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for treating patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were to ascertain if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with "lower targets" compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, and to determine if there is a change in withdrawal rates.

### Renovascular hypertension: a case with atypical neurological signs [^1165iHHU]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertension is the most frequent form of hypertension in children. Renovascular disease accounts for 5–10% of all childhood hypertension and should be suspected in the presence of severe hypertension that is difficult to manage with medical therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to severe target organ damage. We describe the case of a 13-month-old baby boy with failure to thrive, recent muscular weakness of the lower extremities, and irritability. Hypertension was detected, and he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a refractory hypertensive emergency, despite multiple antihypertensive therapies.

Bilateral renal artery stenosis was diagnosed through renal angiography, and balloon dilation was performed, leading to lower blood pressure. He is currently withdrawing from antihypertensive medication, slowly gaining weight, and recovering from target organ damage. However, weakness of the lower extremities persists, and he has been diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2014 JNC 8 guidelines recommend initiating an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as the initial or add-on antihypertensive treatment. This approach is advised to improve kidney outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of race or diabetes status.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117UxXSS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

The 2023 ESH guidelines recommend that in patients aged 18–79 years, the office threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 140 mmHg for SBP and/or 90 mmHg for DBP (CoR I, LoE A). The exception to this rule is adult patients with a history of CVD, predominantly coronary artery disease, in whom drug treatment should be initiated in the high-normal BP range (SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg) (CoR I, LoE A). Nephrologists should note that many patients with CKD fall into the latter category. In patients aged 80 years or older, the recommended office SBP threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 160 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A), but a lower SBP threshold of 140–159 mmHg may be considered (CoR II, LoE B).

The 2023 ESH guidelines offer a detailed discussion on the issue of the best (most protective) BP targets in patients with CKD, including those with CKD and diabetes mellitus (DM). For more than a decade, there has been considerable debate in the scientific literature in this field. Old observational data suggested an association between BP and the risk for kidney failure, starting from an SBP level of > 120 mmHg. More recent data from China, obtained in CKD patients without antihypertensive therapy who were followed prospectively for 5 years, indicated that a BP > 130/90 mmHg was associated with a significantly increased risk of CV and kidney outcomes. However, RCT evidence to fully delineate the target BP in CKD is missing; ideally, this would be an RCT comparing different BP targets (i.e. SBP < 140 vs < 130 mmHg).

### Impact of antihypertensive medication changes after renal denervation among different patient groups: SPYRAL HTN-ON MED [^117FvCcJ]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control rates in the treated hypertensive population are less than 50% and contribute substantially to global morbidity and mortality, despite the availability of safe and effective drug therapies. Within the United States, hypertension disproportionately affects Black Americans, highlighting the potential benefit of adjunctive therapies to augment drugs and lifestyle modification, especially in socioeconomic groups with unequal access to health care. Several recent clinical trials have shown highly consistent reductions in both office and ambulatory BP following catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) in untreated patients with hypertension compared with the sham control group. Likewise, BP reductions following RDN have been consistent in patients simultaneously treated with antihypertensive drugs.

However, several on-medication trials of RDN have shown variable BP changes following randomization in the sham control group, obfuscating the comparative efficacy of RDN therapy in the presence of antihypertensive medications. In particular, primary analysis of the randomized sham-controlled SYMPLICITY HTN-3 (Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension) trial showed similar BP reductions in the RDN-treated and sham control groups. A further subanalysis identified several potential confounding factors that may have contributed to the neutral result, including changes in adherence to antihypertensive drugs during the follow-up period in the sham group. Recent results from the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED (Global Clinical Study of Renal Denervation) provide additional insights.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events, or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1179p2ZG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The overall prognosis of atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is poor. An analysis of a 5% random sample of the US Medicare population showed that adverse event rates after an incident diagnosis of ARVD greatly exceeded those in the general population. These included atherosclerotic heart disease (303.9 vs. 73.5 per 1000 patient-years), peripheral artery disease (PAD; 258.6 vs. 52.2 per 1000 patient-years), and congestive heart failure (CHF; 194.5 vs. 56.3 per 1000 patient-years).

Further adverse events include cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (175.5 vs. 52.9 per 1000 patient-years), mortality (166.3 vs. 63.3 per 1000 patient-years), and the need for renal replacement therapy (28.8 vs. 1.3 per 1000 patient-years). Patients with ARVD and pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) face a 1.5 times higher mortality risk, and those on dialysis have a 3.3 times higher risk than patients with other causes of CKD.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) prognosis varies considerably depending on clinical presentation and comorbid conditions. A prospective cohort study in 467 patients with RAS greater than 50% demonstrated that among those not treated with revascularization, patients presenting with flash pulmonary edema have a markedly increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–3.5] and cardiovascular events (HR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7–5.5) compared with those with low-risk phenotypes, such as absence of flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously.

- **Hypertension management in specific populations**: In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

### Beta blockers in the management of chronic kidney disease [^114omNoQ]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system modulates renal function through its receptors, namely beta1 (cardiac output and renin release), alpha1 (systemic and renovascular constriction), and beta2 (renovascular dilation). Sympathetic overactivity is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and significantly contributes to the increased risk of cardiovascular events and the progression of renal disease. Recent evaluations of drug use in people with CKD show a remarkably low percentage of patients receiving beta-blockers, especially in more advanced stages of CKD when cardiovascular risk is higher. This is largely due to the tolerability of these agents.

Moreover, water-soluble beta-blockers, such as atenolol and metoprolol, are dialyzable and require supplementation to avoid exacerbation of arrhythmias following dialysis. Newer vasodilating beta-blockers have better tolerability and different effects on renal hemodynamics and metabolic variables. These effects relate to the relative alpha1-blocking effect of agents such as carvedilol and labetalol, with carvedilol having relatively greater alpha-blocking effects.

Few studies evaluate beta-blockers on cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. However, studies with carvedilol demonstrate reduced increases in albuminuria and a reduction in cardiovascular events in CKD patients with hypertension. This paper reviews the animal and clinical trial data that evaluate beta-blockers in CKD, highlighting vasodilating beta-blockers. It is apparent that greater use of this drug class for blood pressure control would further enhance outcomes in CKD patients.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^112qMyRs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The figure shows the suspected mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) elevation in renal artery stenosis and recommendations for the management of renovascular hypertension. Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis induces excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing both sympathetic nervous system activation and fluid retention, which may lead to elevated BP levels at bedtime and/or an abnormal nocturnal BP dipping pattern.

Renal artery stenosis leads to renal hypoperfusion, which induces excessive activation of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system, as well as fluid retention caused by the decrease in pressure natriuresis. These abnormalities cause the elevation of BP levels and flash pulmonary edema. Based on the mechanisms of renovascular hypertension, we speculated that an increase in nighttime BP levels and abnormal nocturnal BP dipping may occur in patients with resistant hypertension due to renovascular disease. Nighttime BP is an important target to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, especially in resistant hypertension. In the management of renovascular hypertension, interventional renal angioplasty, including percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), should be considered in patients with poor BP control despite adequate use of multiple antihypertensive medications. *Contraindicated in bilateral stenosis and taking care of renal dysfunction. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin receptor antagonist; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD.

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112jEytt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

The 2023 ESH guidelines also discuss the prevalence, prognosis, and management of the two main causes of renovascular hypertension: atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD) and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).

- **Treatment recommendations**: Revascularization with balloon angioplasty without stenting is emphasized as the treatment of choice for patients with FMD and critical renal artery stenosis. In cases of ARVD, revascularization is recommended in addition to medical therapy for patients with documented secondary hypertension due to ARVD or those with high-risk clinical presentations, such as flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function, with documented high-grade stenosis (≥ 70%).

- **Medical therapy**: Medical therapy alone may be appropriate for individuals with asymptomatic ARVD with stenosis < 70%, patients with mild or moderate hypertension that is easily controlled with antihypertensive drugs and low-grade stenosis, or patients with non-viable kidney parenchyma where revascularization offers little benefit.

- **Re-evaluation considerations**: In these cases, if initiation of treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) results in a reduction in eGFR of ≥ 30%, a careful re-evaluation is warranted.

- **Additional strategies**: Strategies in the management of ARVD are detailed in a recent clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice and the Working Group 'Hypertension and the Kidney' of ESH.

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents [^111usRUX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcomes. Effective control of hypertension is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality, and there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events across a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of their antihypertensive effect.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drugs to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve a more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that they are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

### Effect of ramipril vs amlodipine on renal outcomes in hypertensive nephrosclerosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116gsgXk]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

The incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for treatment to prevent renal failure is unknown, particularly among African Americans. This study aims to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on the progression of hypertensive renal disease.

An interim analysis was performed on a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 factorial trial. This trial included 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease, defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 20–65 mL/min per 1.73 m². These participants were enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. The report focuses on comparing the ramipril and amlodipine groups following the discontinuation of amlodipine in September 2000.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following interventions: amlodipine (5 to 10 mg/d, n = 217), ramipril (2.5 to 10 mg/d, n = 436), or metoprolol (50 to 200 mg/d, n = 441). Additional agents were included to achieve one of two blood pressure goals.

The main outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR. The main secondary outcome was a composite index comprising the clinical endpoints of a reduction in GFR of more than 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m², progression to end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results indicated that among participants with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 0.22 (approximately corresponding to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group experienced a 36% relative effect (2.02 [SE 0.74] mL/min) over the study period.

### Reliability of captopril renography in patients under chronic therapy with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists [^115fBDRo]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Captopril renography is a reliable, widely used test for the functional diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Well-recognized drawbacks of the procedure include reduced accuracy in patients with bilateral disease or renal impairment as well as the possible interference from antihypertensive medication (diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers). Currently, no data exist regarding the reliability of captopril renography in patients with renovascular hypertension evaluated while they are under chronic treatment with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists (Sartans). Moreover, the renographic response of the kidney with renal artery stenosis to prolonged therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has not yet been evaluated.

- **Methods**: We investigated the diagnostic effectiveness of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine captopril renography performed after acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to the daily dose of AT1 receptor antagonist in 13 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis and subsequent evidence of renovascular hypertension, based on short-term (3-month) blood pressure outcome after revascularization. The renographic evaluation was first performed after ingestion of the daily therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonist alone (Sartan renography) and was repeated within 7 days after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to chronic treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonist (captopril-Sartan renography).

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with major associated risks for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration, and reduced healthcare costs.

Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs, compared with corresponding free-drug combinations, is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs.

### Angiotensinogen suppression: A new tool to treat cardiovascular and renal disease [^112DfhJL]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Worldwide, 1 in 3 adults are hypertensive. Although the treatment of hypertension effectively prevents death and disability, the number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension continues to rise. This may be attributed, at least partly, to patient noncompliance, which is the tendency for patients to take their medication intermittently or stop taking them completely, rather than treatment-resistant hypertension.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the long-term regulation of blood pressure and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector peptide of the RAS, stimulates the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor to elicit all the classical actions of the RAS, including vasoconstriction, water and sodium retention, aldosterone synthesis, proinflammatory effects, and growth and remodeling.

Although several drug classes already target the RAS, such as direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), as well as the dual AT1 receptor neprilysin inhibitor, there remains an unmet need for a RAS inhibitor that can circumvent the so-called RAS escape phenomenon and issues pertaining to patient noncompliance. This RAS escape concerns the fact that Ang II suppresses renin release via its AT1 receptor (the so-called negative feedback loop), implying that any type of RAS blockade will prevent this suppression, causing renin levels to rise and potentially overcoming the effect of RAS blockade.

### Management of renovascular hypertension [^1125zXuX]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is a potentially reversible cause of hypertension, and transcatheter techniques are essential to its treatment. Angioplasty remains a first-line treatment for stenosis secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. Renal artery stenting is commonly used in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although recent trials have cast doubts upon its efficacy. Renal denervation is a promising procedure for the treatment of resistant hypertension, and in the future, its indications may expand.

### Clinical pharmacology of antihypertensive therapy for the treatment of hypertension in CKD [^115qWDuQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and frequently complicated by hypertension, both in the predialysis stage and in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). As a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, addressing hypertension in patients with CKD is crucial. This review examines the mechanisms and indications for the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-adrenergic blocking agents, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, direct vasodilators, and centrally acting α-agonists.

Recent evidence indicates that β-adrenergic blocking agents might play a more substantial role in patients on dialysis. Additionally, thiazide diuretics could be more beneficial for individuals with advanced CKD. The article concludes by sharing a general prescribing algorithm applicable to patients with predialysis CKD and those with ESKD undergoing dialysis.

### Renal denervation: A review [^112nsARW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension remains a significant health issue despite the availability of numerous medications and non-drug therapies that lower blood pressure. Nonadherence to medication is found in approximately 2 out of every 5 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In the pursuit of interventions that reduce blood pressure without relying on adherence to a regimen requiring daily medication or repeated physical activity, device-based methods that denervate the renal arteries have emerged as a potential complement to standard antihypertensive treatments.

At least three different approaches to renal artery denervation are under active investigation: the use of radiofrequency energy, ultrasound, or the injection of neurolytic agents into the renal perivascular tissue. This review covers what is currently known about the mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of renal denervation, summarizes the efficacy and safety of renal denervation using recent controlled trial publications in various hypertensive populations, and concludes with thoughts about challenges in the field. These include optimizing patient selection for the procedure and what the reader can expect in the near future in this rapidly developing domain.

### Renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy [^1158GvHE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease remains among the most prevalent and important causes of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction. Many lesions reduce perfusion pressure, including fibromuscular diseases and renal infarction, but most are caused by atherosclerotic disease. Epidemiologic studies establish a strong association between atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (ARAS) and cardiovascular risk.

Hypertension develops in patients with renovascular disease from a complex set of pressor signals, including activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), recruitment of oxidative stress pathways, and sympathoadrenergic activation. Although the kidney maintains function over a broad range of autoregulation, sustained reduction in renal perfusion leads to disturbed microvascular function, vascular rarefaction, and ultimately the development of interstitial fibrosis.

Advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and intensive risk factor management, including smoking cessation and statin therapy, can provide excellent blood pressure control for many individuals. Despite extensive observational experience with renal revascularization in patients with renovascular hypertension, recent prospective randomized trials fail to establish compelling benefits either with endovascular stents or with surgery when added to effective medical therapy. These trials are limited and exclude many patients most likely to benefit from revascularization. Meaningful recovery of kidney function after revascularization is limited once fibrosis is established. Recent experimental studies indicate that mechanisms allow…

### Catheter-based renal denervation ready for the management of hypertension: Evidence, challenges, and perspectives [^114su84Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Overall, currently available evidence supports the use of renal denervation (RDN) as an additional antihypertensive treatment option. However, the FDA approval of RDN as an adjunctive treatment for patients with hypertension, in whom lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications do not adequately control blood pressure (BP), reflects the invasive nature of the procedure.

Some of the greatest unmet needs in hypertension management are effective control of both nocturnal and morning hypertension. Our data suggest that although the control status of office and daytime BP could be improved by increasing the number of antihypertensive medications, this approach did not improve control of nighttime BP and morning home BP. These measures remained uncontrolled in 45% to 55% of medicated patients with hypertension.

These data suggest that, even with longer medication half-life, the limitation of antihypertensive medication is the attenuation of its BP-lowering activity during nighttime to the early morning period before the morning antihypertensive dose. In contrast, the BP-lowering effect of RDN persists for 24 hours, including the nighttime and morning periods. This means that the differential BP-lowering effects of RDN should be greatest for nighttime BP, morning home BP, and morning trough office BP (before morning antihypertensive dosing), and smaller for daytime BP and intermittent office BP readings taken after taking antihypertensive medication in the morning.

This point is confirmed by data from the Global Clinical Study of Renal Denervation.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss.

There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus.

Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients. Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### Hypertension [^116sbFAA]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Resistant and uncontrolled hypertension are common presentations to the nephrology clinic. Many of these patients benefit from evaluation for secondary hypertension in order to optimize antihypertensive therapy and reduce the risks of target organ damage from uncontrolled hypertension. The purpose of this review is to present several cases of difficult-to-control and/or secondary hypertension and to identify optimal approaches to evaluating and managing hypertension in these high-risk patients.

### Prevalence and clinical characteristics of renovascular hypertension associated with fibromuscular dysplasia in China [^1179e1gK]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

After percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), antihypertensive drugs were adjusted according to the clinical needs of each patient. The attending physician managed these treatment adjustments. Patients were routinely followed up at 1 month, 6 months, and every year after the procedure. Antihypertensive medications, blood pressure, and postoperative complications were recorded during follow-up. All patients were asked to measure their blood pressure at home. They were also informed that they could return to our hospital if they experienced a recurrence of hypertension or unsatisfactory hypertension control. Determinants of hypertension cure and renal artery intervention at follow-up were analyzed. The cure rate of hypertension was calculated based on the results of the last follow-up, at least 1 year after the intervention.

In our study, the responses were defined as follows: 'cured' — patients became normotensive without medications; 'improved' — patients became normotensive after intervention with the same (or reduced) number of medications, or had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 10 mmHg below baseline with the same or reduced number of medications; 'no effect' — patients had no change in hypertension after intervention or did not meet the criteria for cure or improvement, and were considered as having treatment failure.

- **Statistical analysis**: SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for database management and statistical analyses. We performed comparisons between multifocal and focal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Means and proportions were compared using the Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus AT1 receptor antagonist in cardiovascular and renal protection: The case for AT1 receptor antagonist [^114MLp3f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

The development of pharmacologic agents that directly inhibit the angiotensin II receptor (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has provided clinicians with an alternative to the previously available angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to downregulate the renin-angiotensin system. This review focuses on the available data that can guide the clinician in using these two classes of agents concerning their ability to provide cardiovascular (CV) and renal protection.

Although the CV protective effect of ACEI in high-risk populations is widely appreciated, whether such an effect is entirely blood pressure (BP) independent can be questioned. Most head-to-head comparisons between ACEI and ARB have yielded comparable CV protective effects, with ARB being associated with fewer adverse effects. Likewise, several — but not all — studies have demonstrated a CV protective effect of ACEI when compared with other active agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. One study demonstrated a similar protection with ARB when compared with a beta blocker.

In terms of renal protection, there are ample data to support a role for both ACEI and ARB in preventing the progression from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, when the progression of renal disease is used as an endpoint, protection has been demonstrated with ACEI only for type 1 but not type 2 diabetes. In this latter group, only ARB has been shown to slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111TbaB5]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

In the 2023 ESH guidelines, hypertension is defined based on repeated office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. The document acknowledges that this definition is arbitrary and mainly serves the pragmatic purpose of simplifying the diagnosis and decision-making process in hypertension management, given the continuous relationship between BP and the risk of death from stroke or ischemic heart disease starting from an office SBP > 115 mmHg and a DBP > 75 mmHg.

The office threshold BP values are the levels at which the benefits of intervention (either lifestyle changes or drug treatment) exceed those of inaction, as demonstrated by outcome-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The classification of office BP and definition of hypertension grades remain consistent with previous guidelines and are summarized in Table 1. The evidence grading system used in the 2023 ESH guidelines is depicted in Supplementary data, Fig. S1.

Table 1: Classification of office BP and definition of hypertension grades in adults and adolescents ≥ 16 years old.

In addition to grades of hypertension, based on BP values, the guidelines also distinguish stages of hypertension as summarized below. Class of Recommendation (CoR) I, Level of Evidence (LoE) C: The presence of CKD is crucial in this staging.

- **Stage 1**: Uncomplicated hypertension [i.e. without hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), established cardiovascular disease (CVD), and CKD G3 or higher].

### 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The task force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension, endorsed by the International Society of Hypertension (ISH) and the European Renal Association (ERA) [^113ehTpj]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, and more specifically the management of resistant HTN, the ESH 2023 guidelines recommend considering the following drugs as additional therapy in patients with resistant hypertension:

- **Spironolactone (or other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists)**: These are often considered effective in managing resistant hypertension.

- **Β-blockers**: These can be useful in controlling heart rate and reducing blood pressure.

- **Α-1 blockers**: These help in relaxing the blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure.

- **Centrally acting agents (clonidine)**: These can be considered for patients requiring additional blood pressure control.

- **Amiloride (if available)**: This can be prescribed, particularly when other treatments are not suitable or available.
