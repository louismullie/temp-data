## Question

What electrolyte imbalances are related to conscious change?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which electrolyte imbalances are most closely related to changes in consciousness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which electrolytes have the strongest mechanistic and clinical links to altered mental status. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that explains those links. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guideline support. After that, I should consider special populations and edge cases. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized, clinically actionable answer with monitoring and treatment guardrails.

> Let me first confirm the primary culprits. Sodium disorders consistently emerge as the principal electrolyte drivers of consciousness change, with both hyponatremia and hypernatremia producing encephalopathy via osmotic brain water shifts; calcium disturbances, particularly hypercalcemia, are the next most common electrolyte cause of altered mentation, while potassium abnormalities primarily threaten via cardiac arrhythmias rather than direct CNS effects, though rare CNS presentations occur [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN] [^114GeFZN] [^113sHnmu].

> I will now examine hyponatremia's mechanism and clinical spectrum. Acute hypotonic hyponatremia drives water into brain cells, causing cerebral edema and raised intracranial pressure, producing headache, nausea, confusion, seizures, and coma; severity correlates with the rapidity and magnitude of the fall, and acute drops exceeding roughly 1 mmol/L/hour heighten risk of herniation and death, which is why severe symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency treated with hypertonic saline to raise sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L acutely while avoiding overcorrection that risks osmotic demyelination [^114hmeK4] [^114bB7zx] [^113BB6am].

> Hold on, I should verify the correction limits and monitoring cadence. Guidelines advise limiting the initial rise to 4–6 mmol/L within 1–2 hours for severe symptoms, and not exceeding about 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours to mitigate demyelination risk; frequent sodium checks and a tonicity-based approach to fluids are essential to avoid iatrogenic harm, especially in chronic cases where the brain has adapted [^114hmeK4] [^114ayGms].

> Next, I should review hypernatremia. Hypernatremia dehydrates the brain via water efflux, causing irritability, lethargy, seizures, focal deficits, and coma; the risk escalates with the rate of sodium rise, and in stroke patients with impaired thirst or access to water, hypernatremia is not uncommon and can worsen neurologic outcomes, so correction should be gradual with careful attention to volume status and free water deficit calculations to avoid cerebral edema from overly rapid rehydration [^114bB7zx] [^117RVSVk].

> Let me consider calcium next. Hypercalcemia produces encephalopathy with confusion, lethargy, and coma, and is a recognized precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis; case-based literature reinforces hypercalcemia as a reversible cause of altered mental status when identified and treated, so checking corrected calcium is prudent in any patient with new confusion or delirium, especially with malignancy or parathyroid disease in the differential [^113sHnmu] [^112kiprn].

> I need to check potassium's role carefully. Severe hyperkalemia and hypokalemia primarily threaten consciousness indirectly through cardiac arrhythmias and hemodynamic collapse, but there are rare reports of nonconvulsive status epilepticus temporally linked to rapid potassium correction in CKD, so while potassium is not a leading cause of isolated encephalopathy, it can rarely present with altered consciousness and warrants EEG when mental status fluctuates after electrolyte shifts in renal patients [^114RnHW7] [^114zFDxT] [^113xmXEa].

> But wait, what about magnesium and phosphate. Magnesium and phosphate disturbances more often cause neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure rather than isolated encephalopathy; however, in the critically ill, combined deficits can contribute to global cerebral dysfunction and ventilator dependence, so I should not overlook them when consciousness is impaired in the ICU context [^114GeFZN].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline alignment. Sodium disorders have the most robust, guideline-backed link to consciousness change, with multiple high-credibility sources emphasizing emergency hypertonic therapy for severe hyponatremia and structured approaches to dysnatremia; hypercalcemia is repeatedly included in encephalopathy differentials, whereas potassium-related CNS symptoms remain exceptional and largely indirect, reinforcing sodium and calcium as the key electrolytes to prioritize in altered mental status workups [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN] [^113sHnmu].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, rapid 3% saline boluses are recommended for altered mental status or seizures; in traumatic brain injury, a triphasic sodium pattern with CDI followed by SIADH complicates management and mandates dynamic monitoring; in older adults, even mild hyponatremia correlates with falls, delirium, and cognitive impairment; and in COVID-19, electrolyte disturbances contribute to encephalopathy alongside hypoxia and systemic inflammation, so I should tailor thresholds and monitoring to these contexts [^1153EeJU] [^116w76gQ] [^113AgYgC] [^112njsuu].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy. Primary electrolytes linked to consciousness change are sodium disorders, with hyponatremia the most common and acutely dangerous, followed by hypernatremia; calcium, particularly hypercalcemia, is the next most important; potassium abnormalities are typically indirect but can rarely manifest with seizures or NCSE during correction; magnesium and phosphate are contributory in critical illness rather than isolated causes of encephalopathy, so my initial laboratory screen in altered mental status should prioritize sodium, then calcium, with potassium, magnesium, and phosphate as supportive tests based on context and comorbidities [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN] [^114GeFZN].

> Finally, I should double-check practical guardrails. In any patient with new confusion, delirium, or coma, obtain serum sodium urgently, assess volume status, and if severe symptomatic hyponatremia is present, treat with hypertonic saline while planning safe correction limits; if hypernatremia is found, correct free water deficits slowly; if hypercalcemia is identified, pursue etiology and lower calcium; and if potassium is severely abnormal, stabilize the heart first and consider EEG if mental status remains altered after biochemical stabilization, documenting the time course to distinguish acute from chronic dysnatremias before choosing correction tempo [^114hmeK4] [^117RVSVk] [^113xmXEa] [^114zFDxT].

Electrolyte imbalances that most commonly alter consciousness are **hyponatremia** and **hypernatremia** [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN], with hyponatremia causing cerebral edema and seizures [^113BB6am] and hypernatremia causing brain shrinkage and intracranial hemorrhage [^114bB7zx]. Hyperkalemia can cause **lethargy, confusion, and seizures** [^112QfFzC], while hypokalemia and hypercalcemia typically cause milder cognitive effects unless severe [^114GeFZN]. Rapid correction of sodium can cause osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER], and electrolyte-related encephalopathy is a recognized cause of altered mental status in critical illness [^111h1Wg5] [^114GeFZN].

## Sodium imbalances

Key characteristics of hyponatremia and hypernatremia:

| **Aspect** | **Hyponatremia** | **Hypernatremia** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | Water shifts into the brain, causing cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure [^113BB6am] | Water shifts out of the brain, causing brain shrinkage and potential intracranial hemorrhage [^114bB7zx] |
| Clinical manifestations | Nausea, headache, confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma, and death [^114hmeK4] | Lethargy, irritability, confusion, seizures, coma, and death [^117RVSVk] |
| Severity correlation | Symptoms correlate with the rapidity and magnitude of sodium decline; acute drops (< 48 hours) are more dangerous [^114bB7zx] | Symptoms correlate with the rapidity and magnitude of sodium rise; acute rises are more dangerous [^114bB7zx] |
| Treatment considerations | Hypertonic saline for severe cases; avoid rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^114hmeK4] | Gradual correction with hypotonic fluids; avoid rapid correction to prevent cerebral edema [^117RVSVk] |

## Potassium imbalances

### Hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia causes **neuromuscular excitability**, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and cardiac arrhythmias [^112QfFzC]. Neurologic symptoms include lethargy, confusion, and seizures, particularly when potassium rises rapidly or is very high [^notfound]. Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment [^1114H4VY].

---

### Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia causes **neuromuscular depression**, leading to muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias [^1157d2D2]. Neurologic symptoms include lethargy, confusion, and cognitive impairment, typically only when potassium is severely low or the decline is rapid. Management involves potassium replacement and correction of underlying causes [^116xddYR].

---

## Calcium imbalances

### Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia causes **neuronal hyperexcitability**, leading to confusion, lethargy, and cognitive impairment [^notfound]. Severe cases can present with altered mental status, psychosis, and seizures. Management includes hydration, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and treatment of the underlying cause [^notfound].

---

### Hypocalcemia

Hypocalcemia causes **neuronal hyperexcitability**, leading to tetany, paresthesia, and seizures. Cognitive effects include confusion, irritability, and altered mental status, especially when calcium falls rapidly or is severely low. Acute management requires intravenous calcium supplementation [^notfound].

---

## Magnesium imbalances

### Hypermagnesemia

Hypermagnesemia causes **neuromuscular depression**, leading to lethargy, confusion, and respiratory depression. Severe cases can result in coma and cardiac arrest. Management includes stopping magnesium-containing drugs, supportive care, and calcium gluconate for cardioprotection [^notfound].

---

### Hypomagnesemia

Hypomagnesemia causes **neuronal hyperexcitability**, leading to seizures, tremors, and cognitive impairment. It can also exacerbate other electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Management involves magnesium replacement and correction of coexisting electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Rapid recognition**: Electrolyte-related encephalopathy requires prompt identification and correction to prevent permanent neurologic injury [^111V9Y4A].
- **Gradual correction**: Avoid rapid correction of sodium imbalances to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome or cerebral edema [^116XhAVB].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous neurologic and electrolyte monitoring is essential during correction [^113Xa6a1].
- **Underlying causes**: Address the underlying cause of the electrolyte imbalance to prevent recurrence [^114hmeK4].

---

Electrolyte imbalances — particularly hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypercalcemia — can significantly alter consciousness. Rapid recognition, gradual correction, and monitoring are essential to prevent **permanent neurologic injury** [^111fLWER].

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

Altered level of consciousness describes the reason for 3% of critical emergency department (ED) visits. Approximately 85% will be found to have a metabolic or systemic cause. Early laboratory studies such as a bedside glucose test, serum electrolytes, or a urine dipstick test often direct the ED provider toward endocrine or metabolic causes. This article examines common endocrine and metabolic causes of altered mentation in the ED via sections dedicated to endocrine-, electrolyte-, metabolic acidosis-, and metabolism-related causes.

Conclusion

Electrolyte imbalances are common in children and may cause life-threatening emergencies. Early identification of SEA and understanding of their pathophysiology is essential for adequate treatment. Adhering to safe correction limits and appropriate electrolyte monitoring is vital to prevent damage to the patient. The diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Medications are often responsible for changes in serum electrolytes. Therapy algorithms and treatment protocols should be available for clinicians to avoid inappropriate therapeutic measures.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112Lahan]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant intoxication — dehydration and electrolyte and fluid imbalances are managed according to best practices. Dehydration is a common consequence of stimulant intoxication that can result in electrolyte and fluid imbalances, no studies were identified on managing these concerns specific to stimulant intoxication or withdrawal, and the CGC did not propose any clinical recommendations related to these concerns; dehydration and electrolyte and fluid imbalance should be managed according to standard best practices. In this context, hyponatremia is typically seen with confusion, reduced consciousness, or seizures caused by water intoxication from excessive hydration during 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) intoxication, and the CGC agreed that stimulant-related hyponatremia should be managed according to best practices by replacing sodium. Patient follow-up should include routine and ongoing screening for electrolyte levels and renal function.

### Neurological aspects of electrolyte disorders [^114GeFZN]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are common in clinical practice and can occur as a consequence of primary neurological disease or as a complication of general medical disorders or critical illness. They may affect fluid shifts, cause disordered transmembrane potential or disrupt neurotransmission. Disorders of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate and magnesium metabolism are associated with a range of neurological complications that cause neuromuscular and central neurological disturbance. It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic hyponatraemia because prevention of long-term complications depends on appropriate management. Acute hyponatraemia can rarely cause cerebral oedema, seizures or encephalopathy. Potassium metabolism disorders are associated with cardiac and neuromuscular abnormalities. Calcium derangement can give neurological manifestations that range from mild and non-specific symptoms to encephalopathy. Phosphate and magnesium disturbances are particularly associated with neuromuscular weakness and are important causes of respiratory impairment and failure to wean from ventilatory support in critically ill patients.

### Dengue encephalitis: what's new? [^111rViM8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL DISTINCTIONS AND FEATURES

Dengue encephalopathy, characterized by altered consciousness secondary to metabolic derangements or shock, typically presents with normal CSF findings. In contrast, dengue encephalitis reflects direct CNS invasion, evidenced by CSF pleocytosis (> 5 cells/μl), focal neurological signs, seizures, neuroimaging abnormalities, and either DENV-specific IgM, NS1 antigen, or PCR positivity in CSF.

Pathophysiological mechanisms of CNS involvement in dengue include direct viral neuro- invasion, cerebral hypoperfusion, hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral oedema, electrolyte imbalances, and intracranial haemorrhage. Elevated levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) and biomarkers (sVCAM-1) in the CSF of dengue encephalitis patients suggest exaggerated neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption.

Clinical reviews indicate that 55% of patients with neurological manifestations meet the criteria for severe dengue, with haematological (89%) and hepatic (47%) involvement being the most common. Among neurologic clinical manifestations, encephalopathy predominates (31%), followed by encephalitis (15%). Other reported presentations include intracranial haemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), Guillain–Barré syndrome, and various neuromuscular disorders.

The classic triad of dengue encephalitis includes fever, headache, and altered mental status, often accompanied by seizures. Focal neurological deficits, status epilepticus, and meningeal signs may also occur. Interestingly, about 50% of encephalitis cases lack typical dengue syndrome (myalgia, rash, and bleeding), indicating the importance of considering dengue in any acute encephalitis syndrome occurring in endemic regions.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Incidence and risk factors of delirium in surgical intensive care unit [^111h1Wg5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The presence of electrolyte disorders or an abnormal electrolyte channel is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders including dementia. Several previous studies have shown that fluid/electrolyte disorders are closely related to delirium. In the present study, we found that the risk of postoperative delirium in patients with electrolyte disturbances (hypernatremia; serum sodium > 145) was higher than that of individuals with normal electrolytes. The result of this study is comparable to previous paper that described disturbance in sodium level was a very important risk factor for delirium. We believe that an effective balance of fluid and electrolytes is important for the prevention of delirium in ICU.

Fever is also an important risk factor in the development of delirium in ICU. In univariate analysis, we have found a significant correlation between fever and delirium. Elevated body temperature increases brain metabolic activity and the demand for oxygen supply to the brain, which might compromise cerebral cellular metabolism in old patients with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Fever is probably usually a symptom of infections, which could give rise to mental changes as a result of cytokines and/or bacterial toxins and cerebral metabolic changes. In our study, all-cause hospital mortality was higher in patients with delirium, which is consistent with the current data available on delirium.

The data from low-income andmiddle-income countries worldwide describing the prevalence of delirium are limited as most of the representation comes from Europe and high-income countries. What is the risk of delirium in low-income andmiddle-income countries? Not very much explicit from published papers. On this subject, these data can be a source of information related to the incidence of delirium to better understand its pattern and outcome. It will also help in designing appropriate future clinical studies.

This study has some shortcomings as it was a single-center study. Follow-up was restricted to 5 days only; therefore, we were not able to address the impact of delirium on long-term morbidity and mortality in our population. Delirium is managed with various ways (ie, physical restraint, sedatives, antipsychotics), and such diverse approaches may have impact on clinical outcomes. Also delirium was measured as a dichotomous variable without taking into consideration the severity and duration. Considering that delirium is a predictor of mortality, prolonged cognitive impairment and higher cost of care, interventional studies should be conducted to determine whether alternative management strategies are associated with reductions in delirium and other short-term and long-term clinical outcomes in the critically ill population.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^1123Rfo2]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Homeostasis is a process by which an organism can preserve internal stability while adjusting to changing external conditions which involves complex interactions of multiple mechanisms and reactions in the body. Electrolytes play a pivotal role in essential body functions. Electrolyte abnormalities are associated with prolonged hospital stays and higher in-hospital mortality among acutely ill children. A comprehensive understanding of electrolyte pathophysiology is imperative for the effective management of these pediatric cases. Anticipating changes in plasma electrolyte concentration is crucial for preventing life-threatening emergencies. Anticipation can be achieved through continuous clinical assessment, recognizing symptoms of imbalance, understanding patient history, and appropriate laboratory tests. Additionally, cautious laboratory monitoring and early intervention can decrease the risk of severe complications. This article offers a comprehensive overview of electrolyte and water homeostasis, while also exploring the treatment strategies linked to electrolyte imbalance-related emergencies.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality, encountered in up to 30% of inpatients. Inappropriate management can have serious implications for patients; including demyelinating disease, coma and death. We have used a case report to identify the common problems, and provide useful strategies in management for which these can be avoided. The aim was to provide a framework which clinicians can adopt, in order to improve clinical practice and provide optimum outcome for the patient.

### Brain-kidney crosstalk [^116VCiN4]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Encephalopathy and altered higher mental functions are common clinical complications of acute kidney injury. Although sepsis is a major triggering factor, acute kidney injury predisposes to confusion by causing generalised inflammation, leading to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, exacerbated by hyperosmolarity and metabolic acidosis due to the retention of products of nitrogen metabolism potentially resulting in increased brain water content. Downregulation of cell membrane transporters predisposes to alterations in neurotransmitter secretion and uptake, coupled with drug accumulation increasing the risk of encephalopathy. On the other hand, acute brain injury can induce a variety of changes in renal function ranging from altered function and electrolyte imbalances to inflammatory changes in brain death kidney donors.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^116XhAVB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^111qnyzL]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical considerations

Electrolyte abnormalities in children can present diverse challenges in clinical management and various factors must be understood for effective management. Distinguishing between acute and chronic electrolyte abnormalities is important in the approach for treatment. Acute imbalances may require immediate correction to prevent complications whereas chronic imbalances may need a more gradual correction, especially in cases to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. Additionally, when a SEA is detected, physicians must be aware for potential errors in sampling or processing by considering the clinical context. This can be achieved through repeating tests to confirm the imbalance and once detected, the treatment should depend on the severity of the SEA. To ensure the detection of SEAs, physicians should have a high index of suspicion in cases involving high risk groups such as critically ill patients or those receiving intravenous fluids. Addressing these various factors can help improve overall patient management and outcomes.

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus possibly induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia: a case report and literature review [^114zFDxT]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurological complications including confusion and altered consciousness are commonly encountered in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Altered consciousness in patients with CKD is caused by non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), uremic encephalopathy, disequilibrium syndrome, dialysis dementia, infection, drugs, electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, hypertensive crisis, or cerebrovascular disease.

NCSE is generally defined as a change from the baseline in behavior and/or mental process that is associated with ongoing epileptic activities or continuous epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram (EEG) in the absence of convulsive symptoms. Prompt diagnosis of NCSE is important because this condition is potentially reversible with appropriate treatment; however, NCSE is often misdiagnosed as a cause of an acute state of confusion when EEG is not used. Because there are few reports of NCSE in patients with CKD, the precise pathophysiological mechanism of NCSE development with kidney disease remains unknown.

We recently treated an older patient with CKD in whom NCSE was thought to be induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia using sodium bicarbonate, glucose–insulin (GI) therapy, and hemodialysis (HD).

### Acidosis, cognitive dysfunction and motor impairments in patients with kidney disease [^114NGFJM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis or CKD as a cause of cognitive dysfunction?

The composition of the extracellular compartment is altered in patients with CKD, with imbalances in electrolytes and minerals, accumulation of uraemic toxins, volume expansion and accumulation of acids. Some of these disturbances are ameliorated in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis, which also improves cognitive dysfunction and mood alterations. Other problems may be introduced by these treatment modalities, such as a reduction in brain blood flow or rapid alterations in acid–base parameters in haemodialysis. Unfortunately the association between acidosis or its amelioration by renal replacement therapy and cognitive dysfunction has not received much attention. While the associations between both cognitive dysfunctions and CKD as well as cognitive dysfunction and metabolic acidosis in CKD have become more apparent in recent years, it remains unclear how much can be directly attributed to metabolic acidosis. This is inherent to epidemiological associations, which usually do not establish causal links and direction of any dependencies. Moreover, there are other conditions with acidosis in which cognitive dysfunction and motor deficits are less common; in patients with tubulopathies such as inborn or acquired forms of distal renal tubular acidosis, cognitive and motor deficits are not part of the normal disease spectrum unless severe hypokalaemia develops, which can lead to muscle paralysis. Likewise, proximal renal tubular acidosis due to mutations in the SLC4A4 transporter does not cause cognitive dysfunction. In rare cases of proximal tubular acidosis (type II RTA), intellectual disabilities may occur but are explained in part by the direct role of these genes in the CNS in addition to their role in regulating systemic acid–base homeostasis. Indeed, many genes that are expressed in the kidney are also expressed in the brain, often contributing to transport of ions as well as concentration control of electrolytes. Examples include mutations in carbonic anhydrase II, which is expressed in kidney and in various CNS structures, as its mutations can lead to local calcifications in the brain, and the OCRL gene that leads to Lowe syndrome. On the other hand, in patients with intact kidney function and chronic hypercapnia or patients with sleep apnoea and intermittent episodes of hypercapnia hypoxaemia, reduced vascular reactivity to CO 2 /pH and cognitive dysfunction have been reported. Clearly, better-powered and detailed clinical association studies are required to further dissect the possible contribution of acidosis as a risk factor for the development of cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, intervention studies with correction of acid–base status could also provide evidence for a causal link between acidosis and cognitive dysfunction. Ideally these studies would be embedded into some of the larger trials aiming to reduce loss of kidney function with alkalizing therapies.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Integrative basic sciences: change in mental status [^11614bKe]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

This case discussion is part of the Integrating Basic Science Into Clinical Teaching Initiative. It examines the presentation of altered mental status and describes the underlying physiology, which explains the basic laboratory findings in an attempt to reach a diagnosis. This article describes a 13-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status after being found unconscious and alone in an abandoned building. He was unresponsive to painful and verbal stimuli, with otherwise normal findings on physical examination. Basic laboratory studies, including arterial blood gas, electrolytes, and serum osmolality, were obtained. The case discussion uses fundamentals of anatomy to build a focused differential diagnosis. The laboratory studies are interpreted using basic physiologic principles, including acid-base balance, anion gap, and osmolar gap, to determine the most likely cause of this patient's altered mental status. Subsequent investigation confirms a diagnosis of ethanol toxic effects. An understanding of electrolyte and acid-base physiology allows the clinician to use basic laboratory studies to build a focused differential diagnosis for altered mental status. This case discussion demonstrates how basic science principles of anatomy and physiology can be applied in clinical settings.

### Multiphase management of sodium imbalance following traumatic brain injury: a case-based review [^116w76gQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

This case report is important because it exemplifies a rare but clinically significant sequence of sodium disturbances — osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVD), and subsequent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) — following traumatic brain injury (TBI). These phases often overlap, mimic one another, or transition rapidly, making diagnosis and management highly challenging. The case emphasizes:

The Triphasic Pattern – Often overlooked in clinical practice, the unmasking of AVD following mannitol-induced diuresis and eventual transition to SIAD is under-recognized but crucial for guiding treatment decisions.
Dynamic Pathophysiology –The triphasic response mechanism is believed to involve an initial phase of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) caused by transient dysfunction or "stunning" of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-secreting neurons, followed by a second phase of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to uncontrolled ADH release, and finally a third phase of permanent CDI resulting from depletion of ADH stores and irreversible loss of ADH production in the posterior pituitary.
Clinical Relevance – Mismanagement (e.g. giving fluids in SIAD or restricting them in AVD) can lead to devastating complications like cerebral edema, seizures, or demyelination.
Teachable Value – The case serves as a high-yield clinical learning opportunity for ICU physicians, pediatricians, and neurologists, especially with its clear timeline, management strategies, and a schematic protocol for differentiation.
Gap in Literature – There are limited pediatric case reports systematically describing all three phases and offering practical ICU management tools in such a structured format.

In sum, the case bridges a gap between theory and bedside care, offering both a cautionary tale and a practical guide for optimizing outcomes in critically ill TBI patients.

Pathophysiology of Sodium Imbalance in Traumatic Brain Injury:

Sodium imbalance in TBI results from disruptions in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation, intracranial pressure, and renal handling of water and electrolytes. (Tables 1 and 2) Initial osmotic diuresis is a common consequence of mannitol use and may exacerbate sodium derangement, particularly in unconscious or altered-consciousness patients, where fluid intake may be inadequate. Vasopressin deficiency (formerly central DI) arises due to hypothalamic or pituitary injury, impairing vasopressin secretion or release and causing polyuria and hypernatremia if patients cannot compensate with adequate fluid intake. SIAD results from non-osmotic vasopressin release, leading to water retention, concentrated urine, and dilutional hyponatremia. (Table 2. Diagnostic Clues in Sodium Imbalance, Table 3: Differentiation table).

### Electrolyte disturbances associated with commonly prescribed medications in the intensive care unit [^112Sa32T]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances are common in critically ill patients. Although multiple disease states typically encountered in the intensive care unit may be responsible for the development of electrolyte disorders, medications may contribute to these disturbances as well. Medications can interfere with the absorption of electrolytes, alter hormonal responses affecting homeostasis, as well as directly impact organ function responsible for maintaining electrolyte balance. The focus on this review is to identify commonly prescribed medications in the intensive care unit and potential electrolyte disturbances that may occur as a result of their use. This review will also discuss the postulated mechanisms associated with these drug-induced disorders. The specific drug-induced electrolyte disorders discussed in this review involve abnormalities in sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium. Clinicians encountering electrolyte disturbances should be vigilant in monitoring the patient's medications as a potential etiology. Insight into these drug-induced disorders should allow the clinician to provide optimal medical management for the critically ill patient, thus improving overall healthcare outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Can delirium relieve psychosis? [^116oZLu6]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

A delirium presages a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, but an incidental delirium is a feature of some psychiatric treatments. We report five cases in which delirium preceded the relief of affective and psychotic symptoms of a major mental illness. The experience stimulated a review of the literature on delirium in psychiatric treatments. Five inpatients (aged 53 to 69 years) with an exacerbation of chronic mental illness developed deliria from medications (n = 4) and electrolyte disturbance (n = 1). The deliria were managed with medication washout or correction of electrolyte imbalance. The progress of the patients was noted clinically and summarized. The clinical signs of delirium such as confusion, disorganized speech, sleep-wake cycle changes, and hallucinations persisted for 24 to 72 hours. As the delirium cleared, psychotic and affective symptoms improved or resolved. The improvements persisted for 1 to 5 months, with low doses of medications in two of the cases. A delirium may precede clinical improvement in affective and psychotic symptoms. Historically, some treatments for mental illness induce an incidental delirium (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT] and insulin coma). Why a delirium should presage a beneficial effect on psychosis is unclear, but the emergence of delirium may herald a beneficial pathophysiology.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^114bB7zx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical relevance

The severity of neurological symptoms associated with hyponatraemia remains the most clinically relevant indication for prompt treatment. Symptoms of hyponatraemia can vary from mild and non-specific to severe and life-threatening, and are dependent on the level and rapidity of changes of serum sodium levels. As serum sodium levels decrease, water moves into the brain cells causing mild symptoms such as headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, gait disturbances, muscle cramps, falls, forgetfulness and attention deficits. The brain adapts rapidly by losing other intracellular solutes to decrease the risk of developing cerebral oedema. At this point, if hyponatraemia is not stabilised or corrected, patients can develop moderate to severe symptoms such as seizures, coma and/or death. Multiple case series recommend the use of hypertonic saline bolus to rapidly correct serum sodium levels, as corrections as small as 5 mmol/L can improve symptoms and achieve seizure control. Severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, obtundation, and coma are associated with acute hyponatraemia. A serum sodium drop of > 1 mmol/L/hour is associated with a higher likelihood of neurological sequelae and death, caused by cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure. Brain cells swell when water moves from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment because of a difference in effective osmolality between brain and plasma as the brain has had too little time to adapt to its hypotonic environment. Over time, the brain reduces the number of osmotically active particles within its cells (mostly potassium and organic solutes) to restore brain volume. This process takes approximately 24–48 hours, hence the rationale for using the 48-hour threshold to distinguish acute (< 48 hours) from chronic (≥ 48 hours) hyponatraemia.

Conversely, hypernatraemia tends to develop in patients who had an acute stroke who are unable to increase fluid intake due to impaired neurocognition and conscious levels. As opposed to hyponatraemia, water moves out into the extracellular space resulting in brain cell shrinkage, and this can precipitate intracerebral haemorrhage caused by tearing of the cerebral vasculature. Symptoms of hypernatraemia include lethargy, restlessness, seizures, decreased left ventricular contractility, muscle cramps and rhabdomyolysis. The worsening progression of symptoms is not only related to absolute increases in serum sodium levels, but also the rapidity at which the increase occurs due to the speed of brain cell dehydration.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus possibly induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia: a case report and literature review [^112QfFzC]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia as observed in the present case is rare and has a high mortality rate. The odds ratio of death within 1 day of severe (≥ 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalemia in CKD stage 4 is 11.6 compared with patients with normokalemia (< 5.5 mEq/L) and no CKD, and the 3-year incidence of death in patients with potassium ≥ 8 mEq/L is at least 80%. Electrolyte disturbances such as hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and alkalosis are all associated with seizures. Unlike other electrolyte disturbances, potassium abnormality rarely causes symptoms in the central nervous system, and there are only a few reports of epilepsy or seizures accompanying potassium abnormalities. Nardone et al. indicated that severe potassium abnormalities may provoke fatal arrhythmias or muscle paralysis before central nervous system symptoms appear. We might have encountered rare symptoms in the central nervous system in our case because we were able to appropriately decrease potassium concentrations, despite extremely severe hyperkalemia, without the occurrence of fatal arrhythmias or muscle paralysis. Furthermore, although previous reports indicate that more than one electrolyte disturbance can occasionally coexist in clinical settings, our case had no other electrolyte disturbances except for potassium abnormality; this finding highlights the association between potassium abnormality and NCSE in this case.

In 2015, the ILAE proposed a new definition of status epilepticus, as follows: "Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which lead to abnormally, prolonged seizures (after time point t1). It is a condition that can have long-term consequences (after time point t2), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures" ((p.1517). In semiology, forms of status epilepticus without prominent motor symptoms may be summarized as NCSE. Notably, the frequency of situation-related NCSE is higher than might be expected in daily clinical settings.

Hyperkalemia is potentially life-threatening, and the findings reported here do not suggest that potassium imbalances should not be rapidly corrected. Nevertheless, prompt EEG should be considered in patients with renal dysfunction or electrolyte disturbance who experience an acute state of confusion.

### QEEG abnormalities in cognitively unimpaired patients with delirium [^116cmkDW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute fluctuation in attention with reduced awareness, orientation, cognitive disturbances, sleep-wake cycle and emotional regulation. Psychomotor dysfunction represents a prominent feature defining three different delirium subtypes: hyperactive, marked by agitation, hypoactive, with lethargy and decreased motor activity, and mixed.

Delirium prevalence increases with age. It is particularly frequent during hospitalisation (20%–60% in elderly individuals), and is associated with high mortality rates.

Several factors may concur to delirium, as neurodegenerative diseases (it is considered a prodromal feature of dementia with Lewy bodies, DLB), electrolyte imbalance, alcohol or drug intoxication or withdrawal. In neurodegenerative conditions central cholinergic deficiency is a leading hypothesised mechanism. Delirium may result from an altered mechanism of external information processing due to derangement of intrinsic oscillation of cholinergic thalamocortical neurons, which modulates excitability of widespread cortical areas (the so-called thalamocortical dysrhythmia, TCD).

In the original TCD model, the abnormal inputs to oscillating thalamocortical neurons in quiet wakefulness disrupt their rhythmic neurotransmission to cortical neurons inducing the appearance of a dominant prealpha frequency (5.5–7.5 Hz) rhythms in the resting state eyes-closed electroencephalogram (rsEEG) activity. As a consequence, consciousness level changes from quiet vigilance to drowsiness, sleep and dreaming, as well as visual hallucination, cognitive fluctuation and psychotic or dissociative states. All these conditions are characterised by altered states of consciousness, as typically occurs during delirium. Notably, the presence of those prealpha rhythms can be revealed measuring compressed spectral array (CSA), based on dominant frequency (DF) and DF variability (DFV). This study focused on testing the possible association between specific EEG CSA patterns with prealpha DF and delirium in cognitively unimpaired hospitalised patients.

### Metabolic encephalopathy secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis: a case report [^115KEke4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a frequent complication of type 1 diabetes, with the UK National Diabetes Audit quoting a crude incidence rate of 3.6% among patients with type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for DKA include younger age, poor glycaemic control, lower socioeconomic status and depression/psychiatric illness. Precipitants of DKA include omission of or inadequate insulin, infection, cardiovascular disease such as stroke/acute coronary syndrome, acute pancreatitis and certain medications such as steroids, thiazide diuretics and sodium-glucose-co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Physiological stress from surgery, pregnancy or trauma has the potential to initiate a DKA due to increased release of counter-regulatory hormones.

Metabolic encephalopathy refers to an alteration in consciousness due to impaired cerebral metabolism causing diffuse or global brain dysfunction in the absence of primary structural dysfunction. Chemical imbalance occurs in the setting of hypoxia or due to systemic organ failure (hepatic failure, renal failure, pancreatic failure) and electrolyte imbalance (hypercalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia) resulting in toxic neurological injury. Varying presentations occur and may indicate the underlying cause, for example patients with hepatic encephalopathy may demonstrate asterixis, however in general metabolic encephalopathy presents as global cerebral dysfunction with fluctuating consciousness in the absence of focal neurological signs. It is a very rare but potentially devastating complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Hitherto, only one case has been reported of this complication in which the patient showed a gradual recovery with residual speech disturbance and irritability.

In this paper we describe a case of a patient with persisting neurological injury secondary to metabolic encephalopathy associated with DKA. The aims of this case report are to highlight metabolic encephalopathy as a complication of DKA and to explore the current research in diabetic related brain injury. The importance of investigation and treatment of reversible causes of encephalopathy is also demonstrated, as this is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio as prognostic predictors for delirium in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qsNqx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a serious neuropsychiatric illness that is characterized by acute fluctuations in mental status associated with altered consciousness, emotional disturbances, and inattention. It is often seen in the setting of acute illness. however, it can also be precipitated by additional physiologic stressors such as medications, electrolyte abnormalities, and dehydration.

Once thought to be a transient disorder of insignificant consequence, delirium is now recognized as a serious medical condition with important impacts on morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) ranges from 32–48% and can increase up to 83% in mechanically ventilated patients. Those who develop delirium are at significantly greater risk for persistent cognitive decline, institutionalization, and post-discharge mortality.

There are several well-characterized predisposing risk factors for delirium, such as advanced age, pre-existing cognitive impairment, psychiatric illness, and co-morbid disease. These risk factors, when in the presence of a precipitating event such as critical illness, lead to the onset of delirium.

### Dysnatremia at ICU admission and functional outcome of cardiac arrest: insights from four randomised controlled trials [^111hgD4G]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary insults can substantially worsen the outcomes of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with brain injury. Studies done over the last 50 years have demonstrated strong associations linking glycaemic control, body temperature, oxygenation, and disturbances in metabolites and electrolytes to outcomes of brain injured patients. Several of these factors have been extensively studied in patients admitted to the ICU with post-cardiac-arrest brain injury. Notably, an observational study showing that fever was associated with poorer outcomes after cardiac arrest prompted several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of therapeutic hypothermia. Also, guidelines about fever prevention and patient selection for neuroprotective interventions after cardiac arrest have been developed.

Brain ischaemia and brain oedema are two major components of secondary brain injuries. As a major determinant of free-water shifts and intracellular hydration, natremia strongly influences brain volume. About a third of ICU patients overall have abnormal serum sodium levels at admission. Serum sodium abnormalities are associated with neurological manifestations ranging from impaired consciousness to osmotic demyelination syndrome. Even though cardiac arrest is a common life- and function-threatening event, with over 300000 cases annually in Europe, data on potential links between dysnatremia and cardiac-arrest outcomes are scant. A study comparing intraosseous, arterial, and central venous samples demonstrated dynamic natremia changes during and early after cardiac arrest. In a study of 80 patients, natremia increased from 137 (104–143) mmol/L during cardiac arrest to 140 (109–142) immediately after ROSC. Collecting further information on the relations between natremia and outcomes of cardiac arrest might help to determine whether interventions targeting dysnatremia hold promise for improving outcomes.

The primary objective of this post hoc study was to use data from four published RCTs to look for associations linking dysnatremia early in the ICU stay to functional outcome on day 180 after cardiac arrest. The secondary objective was to determine whether dysnatremia was associated with 6-month survival.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Enhanced case management can be delivered for patients with EVD in Africa: experience from a UK military Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone [^112myf6q]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of the patients had renal impairment with 40% having acute kidney injury by RIFLE criteria, 17/40 with serum creatinine > 350 umol/L, higher than in other published cohorts. Electrolyte imbalance was extremely common, with hypokalaemia and hypoglycaemia occurring in the majority of patients, and is to be expected with the significant gastrointestinal involvement in EVD. Potassium supplementation was required by a number of patients into the recovery/convalescent phase of illness, and we believe hypokalaemia induced cardiac arrhythmia may be the cause of sudden death in recovering patients that was reported by other clinicians (Dr. M Jalloh – personal communication 2014). Haemorrhage and significant coagulopathy occurred in over 40% of patients, although haemorrhage was not uniformly fatal with 7/17 (41%, 95% CI 18%–67%) patients surviving to discharge. This rate is consistent with aggregate data of exported cases and we believe that it reflects higher staff-to-patient ratios allowing improved case observation, combined with an interventional approach of placing IV catheters. Encephalopathy was also frequently seen, and although it was associated with mortality, 7/26 (27%, 95% CI 12%–48%) patients with encephalopathy survived. The encephalopathy that we observed was an alteration in conscious level accompanied by transient cognitive impairment, consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction that was hypoactive in nature. We believe the aetiology is most likely multifactorial, incorporating metabolic and infective factors with direct viral brain involvement possibly contributing. Identifying features which reliably predict poor clinical outcome at presentation and during the course of illness improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and can inform future intervention strategies. In our cohort, factors significantly associated with poor outcome at presentation include a low Ct value, presence of established organ dysfunction (EVD stage 3) and a high NEWS score. Other significant laboratory variables associated with mortality in univariate analysis at baseline include AST, ALT, creatinine, CRP and white blood count. Recent further analysis of clinical trial data also showed significant electrolyte abnormalities in their EVD cohort and tested a prognostic model also incorporating calcium and haemoglobin levels.

### Mannitol [^117EGyfB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor the patient clinically and laboratory tests for changes in fluid and electrolyte status. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

5.3 Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity

CNS toxicity manifested by, e.g., confusion, lethargy, coma, has been reported in patients treated with mannitol, some resulting in death, in particular in the presence of impaired renal function CNS toxicity may result from high serum mannitol concentrations, serum hyperosmolarity resulting in intracellular dehydration within CNS, hyponatremia or other disturbances of electrolyte and acid/base balance secondary to mannitol administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)].

At high concentrations, mannitol may cross the blood brain barrier and interfere with the ability of the brain to maintain the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid especially in the presence of acidosis.

In patients with pre-existing compromise of the blood brain barrier, the risk of increasing cerebral edema (general and focal) associated with repeated or continued use of Mannitol Injection must be individually weighed against the expected benefits.

A rebound increase of intracranial pressure may occur several hours after the infusion. Patients with a compromised blood brain barrier are at increased risk.

Algorithm for differential diagnosis of hypernatremia, modified according to Bockenhauer et al. and Zieg, J. After excluding pseudohypernatremia, early management is tailored to the volume status and weight of the patient.

Etiology of hypernatremia in children

Hypernatremia may lead to neurologic symptoms due to the shift of water from the intracellular compartment, resulting in cellular shrinkage. These symptoms include irritability, fever, and weakness. Severe cases may present with lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, coma, seizures, and death. Children with hypernatremic dehydration should first receive intravenous isotonic solutions to restore intravascular volume and tissue perfusion, followed by solutions containing higher free water content to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit can be estimated using the formula: 4 mL x weight (kg) x desired change in serum sodium (mmol/L). This formula can be applied for patient management in situations where children are experiencing hypernatremia dehydration and require fluid supplements. It is essential to correct hypernatremia gradually with a recommended correction rate of below 1 mmol/L/h and 15 mmol/24 h to prevent the development of cerebral edema. Some experts recommend administering solutions with slightly higher sodium content (10–15 mmol/L lower) in children with severe hypernatremia (greater than 175 mmol/L) to avoid the risk of rapid decline in serum sodium due to excessive free water intake. Regular monitoring of serum sodium is necessary to avoid a rapid drop in serum sodium levels. Following fluid replacement for losses, hypotonic solutions with lower sodium content (Na 75 mmol/L) are recommended for severe hypernatremia and (Na 30 mmol/L) for mild cases to help control and gradually adjust the sodium concentration. Rehydration strategies are different in children with renal concentration defects to control sodium levels according to specific needs. Individuals with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should be given hypotonic solutions (dextrose), whereas those with central diabetes insipidus require replacement of water loss with hypotonic fluids alongside desmopressin administration. However, caution is exercised with these treatments as they potentially lead to hyponatremia in cases of renal impairment affecting electrolyte balance. Therefore, careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential when administering desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to prevent the development of hyponatremia. In hemodynamically unstable patients, rapid correction of intravascular volume with isotonic saline should be initially used to stabilize the patient. Once stability is achieved, transitioning to hypotonic solutions may be considered.

### Transient seizure-induced sodium increase camouflaging a symptomatic hyponatremia [^114CGH5U]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Hyponatremia is a disturbance of fluid and electrolytes in which there is a relative excess of body fluid water compared with body sodium content. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L and is the most commonly observed electrolyte disturbance in clinical medicine with a reported prevalence of 4% in the adult internal medicine patient population treated in the emergency department and up to 30% in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia has a variety of etiologies and is most commonly caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, the use of thiazide diuretics, congestive heart failure, severe vomiting and diarrhoea or polydipsia. Symptoms are often mild and non-specific like headache, nausea and confusion but can be severe and life-threatening with cardiorespiratory distress, seizures and coma. Severe symptoms are more commonly seen in cases of acute hyponatremia but also chronic hyponatremia in apparently asymptomatic patients must be considered a serious illness as it is associated with an marked increase in the risk of all-cause mortality. Although rare, encephalopathy is the most serious complication of acute hyponatremia. It is the result of cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure caused by the osmotically driven movement of water into brain cells after the extracellular compartment has become hypoosmolar in a relative short period of time (< 48 hours). Left untreated hyponatremic encephalopathy could result in neurological deterioration or death.

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^113sHnmu]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — The differential diagnosis should include common disorders altering consciousness and precipitating factors. Examples listed are diabetic metabolic derangements, alcohol intoxication/withdrawal/Wernicke, drugs (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, opioids), electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia and hypercalcemia), nonconvulsive epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, intracranial bleeding and stroke, severe medical stress, dementia, brain lesions, and obstructive sleep apnea. The recognition of precipitating factors for HE supports the diagnosis, and hyponatremia and sepsis can both produce encephalopathy per se and precipitate HE; in end-stage liver disease, uremic encephalopathy and HE may overlap.

### Non-convulsive status epilepticus possibly induced by a rapid correction of severe hyperkalemia: a case report and literature review [^113xmXEa]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease frequently develop neurological complications including confusion and altered consciousness. Non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is characterized by a change in behavior and/or mental process accompanied by epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram in the absence of convulsive seizures, is one of the overlooked causes of altered consciousness. The incidence and precise pathophysiological mechanism of non-convulsive status epilepticus in patients with kidney disease, and especially in patients with electrolyte disturbances, remains unknown. We recently treated an older patient with chronic kidney disease and severe hyperkalemia in whom non-convulsive status epilepticus developed following a correction of severe hyperkalemia.

Case Presentation

An 82-year-old male was admitted to our hospital at midnight because of weakness of all four limbs (Day 1). He underwent urgent hemodialysis for severe hyperkalemia (9.84 mEq/L) and his serum potassium concentration decreased to 4.97 mEq/L. He regained full consciousness and his limb weakness improved on the morning of Day 2, but he became confused in the evening. Electroencephalogram revealed repeated low-voltage ictal discharges in the right occipital region and a diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus was made. Following medication with fosphenytoin and phenytoin, the patient became fully alert and orientated on Day 8.

Conclusion

We speculate that a rapid correction of hyperkalemia was the possible cause of non-convulsive status epilepticus development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-convulsive status epilepticus from a potassium abnormality. We described a case of this condition in detail and summarized 78 previous case reports of non-convulsive status epilepticus with kidney disease or electrolyte disturbances.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### The forgotten electrolyte, when hypercalcaemia manifest as gait instability and altered mental status [^112kiprn]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An altered mental status presents a diagnostic challenge for many clinicians. Described here is a case of primary hyperparathyroidism not initially suspected until after a thorough neurological and infectious cause were excluded. A 60-year-old woman presented with altered mental status and gait instability. Her family noticed progressive gait instability and mood swings for the past 4 months. Initial imaging and laboratory values were unable to explain her symptoms. On transfer out of the intensive care unit, her corrected calcium was found to be 13.3mg/dL with an elevated parathyroid hormone. Her hypercalcaemia was refractory to medical management. Ultrasound found a 2 cm nodule, which was surgically removed and found to be a parathyroid adenoma. Her calcium normalised and neurological deficits subsided. Hypercalcaemia can lead to a constellation of symptoms that include the classical 'stones, bones, abdominal moans and psychic groans' and electrolyte derangements should be considered in the differential of altered mental status.

### Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy: a new classification for acute neurocognitive changes associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation from the ASTCT committee on practice guidelines [^1135nPNU]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Transplantation-associated altered mentation and encephalopathy (TAME) — indications and pharmacologic options emphasize that, in addition to nonpharmacologic interventions, "medications are indicated when patients have disturbing or frightening hallucinations or delusions or if their behavior calls for medical treatment or poses a risk of harm to staff or themselves". The use of chemical restraints "must be balanced against the increased morbidity and mortality associated with delirium". For hypoactive delirium in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), patients "must be evaluated and managed for aspiration risk/airway protection, monitored for nutrition and hydration status, and supported with positioning and mobilization to prevent pressure sores and venous thrombosis", and "The use of lines, tubes, and other therapies that act as physical restraints should be minimized whenever possible". Supportive care includes coordinating "with a dietician and speech therapist to maintain nutritional intake after HCT", and if TAME has already developed, interventions "should be maintained" with continuous evaluation for modifiable factors including "uncontrolled pain, elimination disturbances, disrupted sleep, poor nutrition, infections, medication side effects, and electrolyte disorders".

### Intraoperative isotonic balanced versus hypotonic crystalloids on postoperative sodium homeostasis in small children undergoing major neurosurgery: a randomized controlled trial [^113nQCAY]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Baseline serum electrolyte levels were collected from laboratory reports one day before surgery. A sample with 2 mL of blood drawn from the femoral vein line was collected at 6 timepoints: (1) immediately following induction of anesthesia and femoral vein catheterization, (2) immediately at the end of surgery, (3) 24 (± 6 h) h after returning to the ward or intensive care unit, (4) 48 (± 6 h) h after returning to the ward or intensive care unit, (5) Day 4 following surgery, (6) Day 6 following surgery. Serum electrolytes, anion gap, glucose, and hemoglobin were measured by the central laboratory using the Beckman Coulter AU5800 (Beckman Coulter, California, US). Indirect potentiometry was employed to process serum electrolytes. Strong ion difference (SID) was calculated by subtracting the concentration of serum chloride from that of sodium and potassium.

Additional laboratory blood tests can be chosen by the anesthetist in charge and the attending surgeon based on individual clinical status. Among patients with multiple daily measurements, daily average was calculated and used as the patient's daily value to calculate the group average. All caregivers were blinded with respect to study-specific investigation results. To ensure patient safety, an independent safety staff reviewed all masked serum sodium level results and referred the anesthetist or surgeon to the clinical pathways for managing acute serum electrolyte level derangements if predefined thresholds were met.

Postoperatively, clinical adverse events potentially related to the use of trial maintenance fluids included (1) clinical evidence of circulatory overload defined as the presence of new-onset, generalized, peripheral edema associated with tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, pulmonary crepitations, and pulmonary congestion on chest radiographs, (2) seizures ascribed to acute severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmol/l), defined as seizure and concurrent severe hyponatremia, (3) altered level of consciousness ascribed to acute hyponatremia, defined as altered level of consciousness and concurrent severe hyponatremia. Cranial radiography was reviewed to reveal any clinically apparent cerebral swelling on postoperative Day 1. Postoperatively, other adverse events were also prospectively collected, including moderate and/or severe fever (> 38.5℃), bronchitis, pneumonia, intracranial infection, and wound infection.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^1144qw6h]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure — definitions, patient care goals, and inclusion/exclusion criteria are outlined for prehospital evaluation. Heat cramps are described as "muscle cramps usually in the legs and abdominal wall" with "Patient temperature is normal". Heat exhaustion "has both salt and water depletion usually of a gradual onset", with progression marked by "tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature, and very painful cramps", and it "can progress to heat stroke". Heat stroke "occurs when the cooling mechanism of the body ceases due to temperature overload and/or electrolyte imbalances", with "Patient core temperature is usually greater than 104°F", and when no thermometer is available it is distinguished by "altered level of consciousness, seizures, or coma". Heat syncope is "transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous return to normal mentation, attributable to heat exposure". Patient care goals include "Cooling and rehydration", "Mitigate high-risk for decompensation", and "Mitigate high-risk for agitation and uncooperative behavior". Inclusion criteria list "Heat cramps", "Heat exhaustion", "Heat stroke", "Heat syncope", "Heat edema", "Stimulant drug abuse", and "Delirium with agitated behavior". Exclusion criteria include "Fever from infectious or inflammatory conditions", "Malignant hyperthermia", "Serotonin syndrome", and "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome".

### An unusual cause of pediatric altered mental status: a mesenteric hernia [^112NDKqY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Altered mental status can have many causes, some of which are life threatening, especially in children. In addition to the usual central nervous system and metabolic causes, such as meningitis, encephalitis, seizure, electrolyte imbalance, and inborn errors of metabolism, some less common causes of altered mental status, which if not diagnosed and managed rapidly, can have poor consequences. We present a case of a child with a life-threatening unusual cause of altered mental status, a mesenteric hernia with hypovolemic shock. The hernia was reduced successfully at laparotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful.

### Disturbances of sodium in critically ill adult neurologic patients: a clinical review [^111xx7SJ]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Disorders of sodium and water balance are common in critically ill adult neurologic patients. Normal aspects of sodium and water regulation are reviewed. The etiology of possible causes of sodium disturbance is discussed in both the general inpatient and the neurologic populations. Areas of importance are highlighted with regard to the differential diagnosis of sodium disturbance in neurologic patients, and management strategies are discussed. Specific discussions of the etiology, diagnosis, and management of cerebral salt wasting syndrome, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and central diabetes insipidus are presented, as well as the problems of overtreatment. The importance of diagnosis at an early stage of these diseases is stressed, with a recommendation for conservative management of milder cases.

### Multiple electrolyte disorders in a neurosurgical patient: solving the rebus [^114FPQCB]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the most challenging aspect of this clinical report was the presence of a pool of findings (hyponatremia, hypokalemia and polyuria in a markedly depleted patient), explained by the coexistence of different and often contradictory conditions. An erroneous therapy, as a consequence of an inadequate comprehension of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, could have further worsened the already frail clinical setting. A step-by-step and schematic evaluation of all clinical and laboratory signs is necessary to adequately recognize and treat hydro-electrolyte disorders, helping to solve also the most complex clinical problems.

### Delirium and dehydration: some fluid for thought? [^111QfrAV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Delirium is a frequent complication of advanced cancer. It is characterized by cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbance, and therefore can potentially result in severe symptom distress and impeded communication between patient and family and between patient and medical staff. The reversibility of delirium depends on its underlying causes. Delirium is multifactorial in origin, and precipitating or contributory factors include dehydration and hypovolemia. Much of the debate concerning the role of hydration in advanced cancer has centered on symptoms such as thirst, and ethical issues such as parenteral hydration and its association with prolongation of life, with the association between hydration status and delirium largely excluded. This review examines the latter association in the light of recent studies. It also provides an outline of relevant pathophysiology and clinical assessment, a decision-making framework and a practical approach to the techniques of assisting hydration. This will hopefully help physicians and families in weighing up the merits of assisted hydration in an individual context and help them to achieve a consensus on the role of hydration that is consistent with the goals of care.

WARNING: HYPONATREMIA

DDAVP can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

DDAVP is contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as patients with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Ensure the serum sodium concentration is normal before starting or resuming DDAVP. Measure serum sodium within 7 days and approximately 1 month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequently monitor serum sodium in patients 65 years of age and older and in patients at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If hyponatremia occurs, DDAVP may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Multiphase management of sodium imbalance following traumatic brain injury: a case-based review [^114pN7iu]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This case highlights the critical importance of vigilant monitoring and individualized management of sodium disturbances following traumatic brain injury. The dynamic interplay between osmotic diuresis, arginine vasopressin deficiency, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) underscores the diagnostic complexity inherent in such cases. Early recognition of clinical signs, in conjunction with serum and urine osmolality measurements, is essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention. Rapid transitions between phases necessitate careful monitoring to avoid complications from overcorrection or delayed treatment. Incorporating graphical representations of laboratory trends and fluid status may further aid clinicians in understanding and managing these evolving electrolyte derangements.

Key takeaway

This case highlights the interplay between TBI, mannitol use, and arginine vasopressin deficiency, showing how effective early intervention and accurate diagnosis can optimize patient outcomes.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^115qCho3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of study

The limitations of this study include its retrospective design and determination of serum osmolality by calculation rather than laboratory measurement. We may have underestimated serum osmolality where osmotically active substances other than glucose and sodium are present in the serum as we calculated rather than measured the serum osmolality. Another limitation is that results of urine osmolality, urine specific gravity and urine electrolytes concentrations were not provided as these are not routinely done in our practice.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Prognosis of patients with severe hyponatraemia is related not only to hyponatraemia but also to comorbidities and to medical management: results of an observational retrospective study [^114DsC5p]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder observed in hospitalised patients and is closely associated with in-hospital mortality even in mild cases. The high mortality rate associated with severe hyponatraemia suggests a causal relationship. However, the relationship between the magnitude of hyponatraemia and mortality remains a matter of debate and the disease causing hyponatraemia may be more responsible for the observed mortality than hyponatraemia per se.

Severe hyponatraemia is symptomatic in nearly half of patients, while neurologic symptoms secondary to cerebral oedema require urgent therapeutic care, guided by a rigorous diagnostic approach. However, quality of care is often inadequate, which can further contribute to mortality.

The present study, conducted in a cohort of patients with severe hyponatraemia in our institution, aimed to analyse the short- and medium-term prognosis, the factors associated with mortality, as well as the diagnostic and therapeutic management of these patients. The main objective was to analyse the medical care delivered and its relationship with the prognosis, while the secondary objectives were to examine whether prognosis was influenced by the severity of the hyponatraemia and to analyse the link between severity of hyponatraemia and comorbidity.

### Outcome of older patients with acute neuropsychological symptoms not fulfilling criteria of delirium [^113rX7B5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although delirium is often investigated, little is known about the outcomes of patients having acute neuropsychological changes at a single time point without fulfilling the criteria of full delirium. Our aim was to determine point prevalence, predictors, and long-term outcomes of delirium and acute neuropsychological changes in patients aged 60years and older across different departments of a university hospital with general inpatient care.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

University hospital excluding psychiatric wards.

Participants

At baseline, 669 patients were assessed, and follow-ups occurred at months 6, 12, 18, and 36.

Measurements

Measurements were obtained using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), comprehensive geriatric assessment, health-related quality of life, functional state (month 6), and mortality rates (months 6, 12, 18, and 36). Subjects were classified into (1) patients with delirium according to the CAM, (2) patients with only two positive CAM items (2-CAM state), and (3) patients without delirium.

Results

Delirium was present in 10.8% and the 2-CAM state in an additional 12.7% of patients. Highest prevalence of delirium was observed in medical and surgical intensive care units and neurosurgical wards. Cognitive restrictions, restricted mobility, electrolyte imbalance, the number of medications per day, any fixations, and the presence of a urinary catheter predicted the presence of delirium and 2-CAM-state. The mean Karnofsky Performance Score and EuroQol-5D were comparable between delirium and the 2-CAM state after 6 months. The 6-, 12-, 18-, and 36-month mortality rates of patients with delirium and the 2-CAM state were comparable. The nurses' evaluation of distinct patients showed high specificity (89%) but low sensitivity (53%) for the detection of delirium in wide-awake patients.

Conclusion

Patients with an acute change or fluctuation in mental status or inattention with one additional CAM symptom (ie, disorganized thinking or an altered level of consciousness) have a similar risk for a lower quality of life and death as patients with delirium. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1469–1475, 2020.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^113jbNZE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Heat cramps, heat edema, heat syncope, and heat exhaustion — definitions and clinical features — are summarized as follows: Heat cramps are involuntary diffuse large muscle contractions associated with exertion in hot environments; dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are associated but causation is not clearly established, and exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) are potentiated in heat with a unifying hypothesis that altered neuromuscular control is the underlying mechanism. Heat edema is a benign self-limiting condition with interstitial fluid accumulation in dependent extremities due to hydrostatic pressure, vascular leak, and cutaneous vasodilation. Heat syncope is a transient loss of consciousness with a rapid return to normal neurologic baseline during heat exposure; contributing factors can include peripheral vasodilatation, orthostatic pooling, prolonged standing, advanced age, dehydration, medications, dietary supplements, and coexisting conditions reducing cardiac output such as ischemic heart disease; it generally resolves with rest and rehydration at comfortable ambient temperatures, and exercise-associated collapse is a differential consideration. Heat exhaustion results from high ambient temperature or strenuous exertion, presents with symptoms that may limit continued exercise in the heat (weakness, fatigue, thirst, headache, nausea, dizziness, muscle aches), and is a mild-to-moderate heat illness that may progress to heat stroke if untreated in a hot environment.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Anticholinergic burden as a precipitating factor for delirium spectrum disorders in schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders: a case-crossover study based on the French nationwide claims database [^117Xe8Wg]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Delirium spectrum disorders (DSD) are acute conditions marked by cognitive disturbance and altered consciousness associated with prolonged hospitalization. Schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders are severe and persistent mental disorders (SPMD) predisposing to delirium. Many medications for SPMD have anticholinergic properties, a known precipitating factor for delirium in older people. We investigated the age threshold beyond which high anticholinergic burden becomes a significant precipitating factor for DSD in SPMD. We identified adults with SPMD with DSD diagnoses during non-psychiatric hospitalizations (2012–2022) using data from one of the largest claims databases, i.e., the French nationwide claims database, enabling the study of such an underdiagnosed event. In a case-crossover design with an active control period, we compared anticholinergic burden before the hospitalization with a DSD diagnosis with that before a control hospitalization for the same patient, controlling for variables stable in time. Over an 11-year period, 8.9% of adults with SPMD received a diagnosis of DSD during hospitalization. High anticholinergic burden was significantly associated with higher risks of in-hospital DSD in patients aged > 60 years (OR (95% CI) = 1.11 (1.04–1.18)), but not in younger adults. Electrolyte imbalance, urodigestive disorders, anemia or hemorrhage, and substance use disorders, including tobacco use disorders, were significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital DSD diagnoses in all adults. Overall, at age 61, anticholinergic burden emerges as a risk factor for in-hospital DSD in individuals with SPMD, while somatic precipitating factors are a concern for all adults with SPMD.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^113jN5YP]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cognition

Chronic hyponatremia is associated with impaired cognitive function — an effect accentuated at lower serum sodium concentrations. A prospective population cohort study in 2550 older Australians correlated serum sodium with results from the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screening tool, finding that scores for individuals with mild hyponatremia (130 mmol/L) were lower than those with normal sodium, representing a 5% reduction in cognitive function. A more extensive cognitive evaluation was performed in a prospective observational study of 130 hospitalized patients with moderate-profound euvolemic hyponatremia (mean 122 mmol/L; range, 119–126 mmol/L) comparing results in a comprehensive battery of validated neurocognitive, mood, and motor assessments (ie, the Mini-Mental State Examination, Timed Up-and-Go Test, Trail-Making Tests, among others) undertaken before treatment for hyponatremia, then repeated at the time of discharge, and compared to 50 matched normonatremic hospitalized controls. Scores across all domains were significantly worse in hyponatremic patients compared to those with normal serum sodium (P < .001), and the odds of pathological test results in the aforementioned measures were significantly increased for those with more profound hyponatremia of less than 120 mmol/L. In this study, correction of hyponatremia led to improvement in cognitive performance. This built on the work of earlier, smaller studies of fewer than 20 hyponatremic individuals that found impairment in attention and alertness when serum sodium was low improved when levels normalized.

Symptoms, Morbidity, and Mortality of Hyponatremia

Acute Severe Hyponatremia

Acute severe hypotonic hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It can lead to cerebral edema, due to osmotic influx of water into the brain, causing raised ICP within the confined skull, and potential cerebral herniation and death (see Fig. 3). "Severe" symptoms indicative of imminent adverse outcomes may include vomiting, seizure, somnolence (GCS score < 8), coma, or cardiorespiratory manifestations of increased ICP (Cushing reflex) such as bradycardia, widened pulse pressure, and irregular breathing. The presence of severe symptoms warrants urgent intervention (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Moderately severe symptoms that may precede these include nausea, confusion, and headache. Rapid progression can occur, especially in the case of acute water ingestion when there is water in the stomach that is still to be absorbed, or in the context of inappropriate hypotonic IV fluid administration.

### Risk of developing hyperkalemia in patients with hypertension treated with combination antihypertensive therapy-a retrospective register-based study [^1157d2D2]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

BB + RASi + MRA

No previous studies have reported increased hyperkalemia risk in patients treated with BB + RASi + MRA. We found that the use of BB is associated with increased hyperkalemia risk, especially in patients with hypertension and concomitant renal dysfunction and insulin insufficiency, while use of RASi such as MRA, ACEIs, and ARBs is associated with increased hyperkalemia. A systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the antihypertensive effects of MRA + RASi combination therapy in patients with hypertension and DM. It found that combining MRA and RASi induced a significant reduction in SBP and DBP, a reduction in urinary albumin excretion, and a slight elevation in blood serum potassium concentrations. This aligns with our findings that BB + RASi + MRA are associated with hyperkalemia.

The mechanisms through which RASi cause hyperkalemia are principally similar, through their influence on the production or activity of aldosterone. ACEIs and ARBs reduce aldosterone secretion and thereby limit urinary excretion of potassium, predisposing to hyperkalemia. In contrast, MRAs increase the resistance to aldosterone by blocking the interaction between aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptors.

As observed in Supplementary Table 4 among patients with hyperkalemia administered MRA a great majority of patients were prescribed RASi and potassium supplementation as well. All three drugs are known to induce hyperkalemia. This combination is not common for the general hypertension population, yet it can be used in resistant hypertension or heart failure.

Risk of electrolyte abnormalities due to antihypertensive drugs

Antihypertensive drugs are not only associated with the risk of developing hyperkalemia. They are also associated with a general risk of electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypokalemia can be a serious condition as it can lead to muscle weakness and lethal arrhythmias. Hyponatremia is known to increase the risk of neurological abnormalities such as impaired consciousness. This study found that patients treated with RASi + thiazides had the lowest incidence of hyperkalemia. These results align with a study that finds an association between the development of hypokalemia and the treatment with antihypertensive combination therapy with thiazide diuretics and CCB, RASi or BB. Regarding hyponatremia, ACE and ARBs can reduce the ability to regulate natrium and water balance in the body. Additionally hyponatremia is more frequent in patients treated with thiazide diuretics. Another study showed an association between the use of CCBs, ACE, BB and ARB and an increased risk of hyponatremia as the cause of hospitalization.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^114yLj4f]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Sodium and water perturbations are common in patients who had an acute stroke, with signs and symptoms that can range from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifestations such as seizures, cerebral oedema, coma or even death. Infection with COVID-19 can further increase the risk of negative outcomes in these patients presenting with concurrent sodium and water perturbations. Despite the lack of consensus guidelines for the management of sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke, neurologists need to be well versed in identifying the different aetiologies of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in order to implement an effective management strategy to ensure optimal outcomes for these patients. Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had a stroke that present acutely require emergent intervention but only after any intravascular volume losses have been corrected first, often best achieved by isotonic saline infusion. As hyponatraemia is typically caused by a defect in water excretion, and hypernatraemia by water deficit or a defect in thirst regulation, chronic sodium perturbations (> 48 hours) should only be corrected in approximately the same time frame as it initially occurred because if corrected too rapidly, serious neurological consequences may ensue. Neurologists should collaborate with endocrinologists, especially when the sodium and water perturbations are complex and difficult to correct.

### Serum sodium improvement: change in comprehensive geriatric assessment parameters in geriatric patients with hyponatremia [^113AgYgC]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is said to exist when the serum sodium value is < 135 meq/L. It is the commonest electrolyte disturbance, seen in about 16–30% of in-hospital subjects. Sodium has many functions, including maintaining blood volume, fluid homeostasis, membrane potentials, and acid-base balance. Symptoms may include seizures, altered mental status, and drowsiness. Hyponatremia is seen in approximately 22% of the geriatric population in comparison with about 6% in others. Hyponatremia can present with subtle clinical symptoms, considered age-associated. This electrolyte abnormality may present numerous outcomes in the elderly, like common falling and balance disorders. Other disorders associated include osteoporosis, falls, fractures, delirium, loss of cognition, and forgetfulness. This may result in a reduction in living level. Still, as the geriatric age group has many underlying diseases like adrenal insufficiency, heart failure, liver disorders, and cancer, which can alter the cognition themselves, the impact of hyponatremia in cognitive changes remains unknown. Given this, we used four easy and routinely utilized comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) parameters for our study. These include Hindi mental state examination (HMSE), Barthel's index of activities of daily living (ADL), Timed up and go Test (TUG test), and handgrip strength utilizing hand dynamometer (HG) for analyzing the relation of CGA parameters in the elderly with the degree of hyponatremia, along with the analysis of the impact of improvement in serum sodium levels on various CGA parameters. "Geriatric syndrome" is often used to refer to common health conditions in older adults (> 60 years of age) that do not fit into defined organ-system based categories and often have multifactorial causes. It includes conditions like cognitive impairment, delirium, incontinence, malnutrition, falls, gait disturbances, sleep disorders, and dizziness. Geriatric assessment refers to the evaluation by the primary care clinician, geriatrician, or a more intensive multidisciplinary program, also known as CGA.

### Advanced age, altered level of consciousness and a new diagnosis of diabetes are independently associated with hypernatreamia in hyperglycaemic crisis [^112xPha5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serum sodium measurement is useful in the management of hyperglycaemic crisis as it enables the determination of serum osmolality and anion gap. Hyponatreamia, albeit, a pseudo phenomenon is the predominant serum sodium abnormality reported in hyperglycaemic emergencies. While there is considerable literature on hypernatreamia in general, data on hypernatreamia occurring in the context of hyperglycaemic crisis is limited. Hypernatreamia can have varied aetiology including diabetes insipidus, mineralocorticoid excess, infusions of hypertonic saline and sodium bicarbonate. However, a raised serum sodium level at presentation of hyperglycaemic crisis usually reflects marked dehydration due to excessive free water loss from osmotic diuresis. Measures such as vigorous fluid replacement, use of hypotonic fluids and prophylactic anticoagulation may be recommended in the setting of hypernatreamia complicating hyperglycaemic crisis. We assessed the prevalence and factors associated with hypernatreamia in a cohort of patients admitted with hyperglycaemic crisis at the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital (NMAH). The NMAH is a tertiary public health facility situated in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and serves a predominantly indigent rural population of about 1.7 million people. The NMAH receives referrals from primary and secondary health care facilities in its area of drainage.

### Severe alkalosis and hypokalemia with stanozolol misuse [^114KczYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Stanozolol is a popular androgenic anabolic steroid, used by body builders and athletes for physical performance enhancement. There are few data on its potential adverse effects and no documented cases of it causing severe electrolyte imbalance. Here, we report a patient presenting to a tertiary care emergency department with reduced conscious level, profound hypokalemia, and severe metabolic alkalosis, resulting from stanozolol misuse. This is the first such case reported.

### Starvation ketoacidosis and refeeding syndrome [^116VYfqK]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Starvation ketoacidosis (SKA) is a rarer cause of ketoacidosis. Most patients will only have a mild acidosis, but if exacerbated by stress can result in a severe acidosis. We describe a 66-year-old man admitted with reduced consciousness and found to have a severe metabolic acidosis with raised anion gap. His body mass index (BMI) was noted to be within the healthy range at 23 kg/m 2; however, it was last documented 1 year previously at 28 kg/m 2 with no clear timeframe of weight loss. While his acidosis improved with intravenous fluids, he subsequently developed severe electrolyte imbalance consistent with refeeding during his admission. Awareness of SKA as a cause for high anion gap metabolic acidosis is important and knowledge of management including intravenous fluids, thiamine, dietetic input and electrolyte replacement is vital.

### Changes in potassium concentration during opioid antagonist induction: comparison of two randomized clinical trials [^115kcyVp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Opioid antagonist induction under general anesthesia or heavy sedation has been criticized due to its associated morbidity and mortality. Information on the potential causes of these complications is limited. We aimed to compare electrolyte concentration changes during rapid opioid antagonist induction under general anesthesia and conscious sedation, and to find out whether these changes are associated with cardiovascular complications.

Methods

We used a pooled database analysis of 2 prospective randomized controlled clinical trials carried out in Lithuania between 2002 and 2014. Opioid-dependent patients underwent opioid antagonist induction under general anesthesia (n = 50) or conscious sedation (n = 68). Electrolyte levels were measured before the procedure, 3hours after antagonist induction, and 3hours after the end of the procedure.

Results

General anesthesia was associated with initial hyperkalemia, which was followed by rapid reduction in potassium concentration (P < 0.01). Plasma potassium increase was noted in 92% of cases, and in 24%, these levels increased above 6.0mmol/L, with a highest value of 6.7mmol/L. Potassium concentration changes in the conscious sedation group were not statistically significant. There were no differences in sodium, calcium, chloride, and magnesium concentrations in both groups.

Conclusions

Plasma potassium concentration changes in the general anesthesia group were significant, whereas conscious sedation had no effect on electrolyte levels. Our data support the recommendation of the American Society of Addiction Medicine and other professional societies that opioid antagonist induction under general anesthesia must not be offered.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Mannitol [^113Xa6a1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests

During and following infusion of Mannitol Injection for the reduction in intracranial pressure, monitor:

serum osmolarity, serum electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate) and acid/base balance,
the osmol gap
signs of hypo- or hypervolemia, including urine output
renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function
intracranial pressure
Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal, cardiac, or pulmonary status worsens or CNS toxicity develops [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].

5.6 Infusion Site Reactions

The infusion of hypertonic solutions through a peripheral vein, including Mannitol Injection, may result in peripheral venous irritation, including phlebitis. Other severe infusion site reactions, such as compartment syndrome and swelling associated with extravasation, can occur with administration of Mannitol Injection [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6)]. Mannitol Injection is preferably administered through a central venous catheter [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

5.7 Interference with Laboratory Tests

High concentrations of mannitol can cause false low results for inorganic phosphorus blood concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Mannitol may produce false positive results in tests for blood ethylene glycol concentrations [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.6)].

Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis: Stop infusion immediately if hypersensitivity reactions develop. (5.1)
Renal Complications Including Renal Failure: Risk factors include pre-existing renal disease, conditions that put patients at risk for renal failure and concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics. Avoid use of nephrotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if renal function worsens. (5.2, 8.6)
Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity: Confusion, lethargy, and coma may occur during or after infusion. Concomitant neurotoxic drugs may potentiate toxicity. Avoid use of neurotoxic drugs. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if CNS toxicity develops. (5.3)
Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances, Hyperosmolarity: Hypervolemia may exacerbate congestive heart failure; hyponatremia can lead to encephalopathy; hypo/hyperkalemia can result in cardiac adverse reactions in sensitive patients. Discontinue Mannitol Injection if fluid and/or electrolyte imbalances occur. (5.4)
Monitoring/Laboratory Tests: Monitor fluid and electrolytes, serum osmolarity and renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function. Discontinue if toxicity develops. (5.5)
Infusion Site Reactions: May cause irritation and inflammation, as well as severe reactions (compartment syndrome) when associated with extravasation. (5.6)
Interference with Laboratory Tests: High concentrations of mannitol may cause false low results of inorganic phosphorus blood concentrations. Mannitol may produce false positive results for blood ethylene glycol. (5.7, 7.6)

### Acute and chronic neurological disorders in COVID-19: potential mechanisms of disease [^112njsuu]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-inflammatory encephalopathy

Many patients with COVID-19 and altered mental status (e.g. lethargy, confusion, coma) have clinical courses complicated by hypoxia, renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, sedating medications and underlying comorbidities. A third of critically ill patients with COVID-19 present with encephalopathy, often with frontal lobe-associated features, either at the onset of illness or during the course of hospitalization, and encephalopathy is associated with increased mortality and poor functional outcome. Although encephalopathy has been reported in COVID-19 patients at all ages, patients beyond the sixth decade of life and those with pre-existing neurologic conditions (stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease) are most affected, particularly in the context of severe respiratory illness. While encephalopathy in the aforementioned circumstances is probably multifactorial, reports of patients with encephalopathy in the absence of severe respiratory illness suggest other possible mechanisms including bioenergetic failure and vascular dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between encephalopathy and morbidity exists independently of respiratory disease, similar to that observed in sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Encephalopathy in non-COVID-19 patients is attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity and macro- or micro-ischaemic injury. One recent post-mortem analysis in New York revealed cerebral microthrombi in a subset of 67 hospitalized, deceased COVID-19 patients. Small, subcortical ischaemic events may result in confusion and cognitive dysfunction. Patients can also manifest multifocal cerebral microhaemorrhages or vascular leakage (Fig. 2) due to compromise of the cerebral endothelial cells. Radiographic findings in COVID-associated encephalopathy include non-specific white matter hyperintensities, diffusion restriction, microhaemorrhage and leptomeningeal enhancement. In one study of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 and encephalopathy, bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion was evident in all patients who underwent perfusion imaging for altered mental status, although this finding was disputed and has not been replicated. Surprisingly, brain MRI was normal in up to 46% of patients with COVID-19 and associated encephalopathy. In another study, patients with COVID-19 and cognitive impairment showed decreased metabolism in the fronto-parietal regions on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET scans. Indeed, correlations between neuropathology and brain MRI findings (including normal imaging) have yet to be established.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^113wkSSX]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A considerable number of patients are admitted to the ICU with dysnatremia, a deranged serum sodium concentration. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients develop dysnatremia during ICU admission.

Hypernatremia ([Na] > 145 mmol/L) is relatively rare at ICU admission but develops in up to 24% of patients during ICU stay and is an independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU. ICU patients are predisposed to developing hypernatremia because of the administration of hypertonic solutions, renal-free water loss due to renal disease, diuretics, and gastrointestinal fluid losses.

Hyponatremia ([Na] < 135 mmol/L) is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients. It is a disorder of water excretion and can occur in many different conditions. Severe hyponatremia ([Na] < 125 mmol/L) can result in neurologic symptoms, coma, and death especially if the decrease in plasma sodium develops rapidly. In ICU patients hyponatremia is often mild and is most often already present at ICU admission. Hyponatremia is independently associated with mortality, which may be due to a direct causal relationship. If this association is causal, correction of hyponatremia would decrease mortality. However, we hypothesize that mild hyponatremia could also be an evolutionary adaptive mechanism in critical illness, as it is common in a wide variety of disease states. If so, the higher mortality rate in patients with mild hyponatremia would reflect the severity of the underlying illness, but increase of serum sodium, either intentional or as side effect of other treatments, would not be beneficial and could even paradoxically be harmful and decrease survival.

The objective of this study was to assess the independent association of changes in serum sodium concentration in the first 48 hours of ICU admission with mortality specifically in patients admitted with mild hyponatremia but also for severe hyponatremia, normonatremia, and hypernatremia in a large cohort of ICU patients.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide (triamterene hydrochlorothiazide) [^117YSfp7]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE AND BUN INCREASES

Patients receiving triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be carefully monitored for fluid or electrolyte imbalances; i.e., hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are especially important and should be frequently performed when the patient is vomiting or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.

Any chloride deficit during thiazide therapy is generally mild and usually does not require any specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.

Hypokalemia may develop with thiazide therapy, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, amphotericin B or after prolonged thiazide therapy. However, hypokalemia of this type is usually prevented by the triamterene component of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide.

Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide may produce an elevated blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), creatinine level or both. This is probably not the result of renal toxicity but is secondary to a reversible reduction of the glomerular filtration rate or a depletion of the intravascular fluid volume. Elevations in BUN and creatinine levels may be more frequent in patients receiving divided dose diuretic therapy. Periodic BUN and creatinine determinations should be made especially in elderly patients, patients with suspected or confirmed hepatic disease or renal insufficiencies. If azotemia increases, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued.

HEPATIC COMA

Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

### Tonicity balance, and not electrolyte-free water calculations, more accurately guides therapy for acute changes in natremia [^114ayGms]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The usual way to decide why hyponatremia or hypernatremia has developed and to plan goals for its therapy is to analyze events in electrolyte-free water (EFW) terms. We shall demonstrate that an EFW balance does not supply this information. Rather, one must calculate mass balances for water and sodium plus potassium separately (a tonicity balance) to understand the basis for the change in natremia and the proper goals for its therapy. These points are illustrated with a clinical example.

### Characteristics, symptoms, and outcome of severe dysnatremias present on hospital admission [^1178N7Up]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Dysnatremias are common in critically ill patients and associated with adverse outcomes, but their incidence, nature, and treatment rarely have been studied systematically in the population presenting to the emergency department. We conducted a study in patients presenting to the emergency department of the University of Bern.

Methods

In this retrospective case series at a university hospital in Switzerland, 77,847 patients admitted to the emergency department between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2011, were included. Serum sodium was measured in 43,911 of these patients. Severe hyponatremia was defined as less than 121 mmol/L, and severe hypernatremia was defined as less than 149 mmol/L.

Results

Hypernatremia (sodium > 145 mmol/L) was present in 2% of patients, and hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mmol/L) was present in 10% of patients. A total of 74 patients had severe hypernatremia, and 168 patients had severe hyponatremia. Some 38% of patients with severe hypernatremia and 64% of patients with hyponatremia had neurologic symptoms. The occurrence of symptoms was related to the absolute elevation of serum sodium. Somnolence and disorientation were the leading symptoms in hypernatremic patients, and nausea, falls, and weakness were the leading symptoms in hyponatremic patients. The rate of correction did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Patients with symptomatic hypernatremia showed a further increase in serum sodium concentration during the first 24 hours after admission. Corrective measures were not taken in 18% of hypernatremic patients and 4% of hyponatremic patients.

Conclusions

Dysnatremias are common in the emergency department. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia have different symptoms. Contrary to recommendations, serum sodium is not corrected more rapidly in symptomatic patients.

### Dysnatremia among runners in a half marathon performed under warm and humid conditions [^115XfS9t]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An adequate fluid and electrolyte balance is of great importance for metabolic regulation, as water and electrolytes provide the medium for physiological reactions and determine the maintenance of both an adequate blood volume and integrity of the cardiovascular system as a whole.

Sodium is one of the most important electrolytes involved in the homeostasis of the human body: as the major extracellular cation, it mediates the regulation of cell volume, transport across the cell membrane, electric potential and cell signalling. The normal range for blood sodium is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per litre (mEq/L). Dysnatremias are values that fall outside this range (either hyponatremia or hypernatremia) and either can cause cellular dysfunction and systemic symptoms.

Under optimal functioning, renal and hormonal systems maintain the plasma osmolality within tight limits, reflecting the physiological importance of osmolality regulation for cell volume and function, as previously mentioned. Exercise represents a situation of stress that can lead to electrolyte imbalance and the body has mechanisms to defend itself when faced to this, such as the ability to redistribute water and electrolytes within its fluid compartments, providing a reservoir to minimise the effects of water deficit or electrolyte imbalances, and the hormonal secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates the secretion and reabsorption of electrolytes, and stimulates the thirst centre to ensure an adequate fluid intake during exercise. These mechanisms can, however, fail; for athletes, high-endurance competitions represent a higher risk for such failures.

In athletic competitions, acute hypernatremia and dehydration can present as a result of water loss through sweat associated with low or insufficient fluid intake. This is a state of hyperosmolality, hence it induces water movement from cells into the extracellular compartment, which is especially important for the central nervous system as it may cause cell shrinkage, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, muscle weakness, muscle twitching and even death. Although it is uncommon for hypernatremia to progress to serious complications in such settings, it has occasionally been associated with collapse. On the other hand, exercise-associated hyponatremia is usually the result of excessive water intake. In most cases, it presents with no symptoms or mild symptoms of weakness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, but in cases involving a major drop in serum sodium levels, there is higher risk of a fast inflow of water into the cells leading to oedema which, in the central nervous system, is manifested as altered mental status, seizures and even death.

### Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide [^116xddYR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes

Caution should be exercised when administering triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules to patients with diabetes, since thiazides may cause hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and alter insulin requirements in diabetes. Also, diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration.

Impaired Hepatic Function

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. They can precipitate hepatic coma in patients with severe liver disease. Potassium depletion induced by the thiazide may be important in this connection. Administer triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules cautiously and be alert for early signs of impending coma such as confusion, drowsiness, and tremor; if mental confusion increases, discontinue triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules for a few days. Attention must be given to other factors that may precipitate hepatic coma, such as blood in the gastrointestinal tract or pre-existing potassium depletion.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia is uncommon with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules; but, should it develop, corrective measures should be taken such as potassium supplementation or increased intake of potassium-rich foods. Institute such measures cautiously with frequent determinations of serum potassium levels, especially in patients receiving digitalis or with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. If serious hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3 mEq/L) is demonstrated by repeat serum potassium determinations, triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules should be discontinued and potassium chloride supplementation initiated. Less serious hypokalemia should be evaluated with regard to other coexisting conditions and treated accordingly.

Electrolyte Imbalance

Electrolyte imbalance, often encountered in conditions such as heart failure, renal disease, or cirrhosis of the liver, may also be aggravated by diuretics and should be considered during therapy with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide when using high doses for prolonged periods or in patients on a salt-restricted diet. Serum determinations of electrolytes should be performed and are particularly important if the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving fluids parenterally. Possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance may be indicated by warning signs such as: dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113o2BgS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal seizure — monitoring and observation: Patients should be monitored for alcohol withdrawal seizures even in the absence of other clinically prominent alcohol withdrawal signs or symptoms. Following an alcohol withdrawal seizure, patients should be admitted to a setting with close monitoring available, and should be re-assessed every 1–2 hours for 6–24 hours; patients should be closely monitored for delirium and to receive intravenous (IV) fluids, due to potential electrolyte imbalances. Alcohol withdrawal seizures typically occur between 6–48 hours after cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use with risk peaking around 24 hours, and patients should be observed for at least 24 hours, or if continuous observation is not feasible, for a minimum of 6 hours before discharge to a setting with continuous monitoring, with re-assessment at least every 1–2 hours during the post-seizure monitoring period.

One of the most common forms of hyponatremia found in clinical grounds is related to the Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti Diuresis (SIAD), which is classified as a hypotonic hyponatremia with a normal EFV. Additional diagnostic criteria of this condition include a urinary osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg and a urinary [Na +] > 40 mEq/L with normal dietary salt intake, normal adrenal and thyroid function and no recent use of diuretics. SIAD, which is due in most cases to arginine vasopressin (AVP) release not caused by increased serum osmolality (hence the previous name Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti Diuretic Hormone secretion), may be secondary to a number of different pathologies (e.g. tumors, central nervous system diseases, pulmonary diseases), as well as to treatment with different drugs.

The clinical features of hyponatremia depend on the degree of serum [Na +] reduction, but also on the time of onset. In principle, patients with severe acute hyponatremia are more compromised (e.g. seizures, delirium, stupor, coma) than those with chronic hyponatremia (e.g. dizziness, gait alterations, headache, neurocognitive impairment, nausea, vomit). Interestingly, hyponatremia has been associated with bone loss and an increased risk of fractures, independent of bone density. Noteworthy, hyponatremia has been identified as an independent risk of death in several morbidities, including cancer. Besides its clinical impact, low serum [Na +] represents a social and economic burden, because it causes an increased use of healthcare resources and a longer stay in the hospital, overall resulting in higher health-related costs.

### Hyponatremia in patients with infectious diseases [^112KbL7m]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Hyponatremia may not infrequently be present during the course of an infection, does not cause specific symptoms and may be overlooked by clinicians. Nonetheless, it may reflect the severity of the underlying process. This review focuses on the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of hyponatremia associated with infectious diseases. In the majority of cases, the fall in serum sodium concentration is of multifactorial origin owing to increased secretion of the anti-diuretic hormone either appropriately or inappropriately. Inadvertent administration of fluids may worsen hyponatremia and prolong morbidity.

### Association between bipolar episodes and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis: a retrospective longitudinal study [^115C7PZn]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Imbalance of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis has been suggested to be associated with the neuropathological processes underlying bipolar disorder. However, longitudinal data regarding the association of bipolar episodes with fluid balance are still lacking. We hypothesized that mania may be associated with a relative fluid retention and hemodilution, and depression with a relative hemoconcentration.

Methods

Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 43) admitted to a mental health center, both with depressive and manic episodes, were retrospectively followed between 2005 and 2013. Fluid balance and electrolyte serum indices were compared between their manic and depressive episodes. We adjusted for physical and psychiatric comorbidities and for psychotropic treatment, using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures.

Results

There was a significant reduction in serum fluid balance indices during mania compared to depression: mean hemoglobin concentration 13.9 ± 1.4 g/dL versus 14.5 ± 1.4 g/dL, paired t = -4.2, p < 0.0005; mean hematocrit 41.1 ± 4.1% versus 42.3 ± 3.7%, paired t = -3.0, p < 0.005; mean albumin concentration 4.2 ± 0.3 g/dL versus 4.5 ± 0.3 g/dL, paired t = -4.5, p < 0.0001; and mean sodium concentration 140.3 ± 2.0 mEq/L versus 141.0 ± 2.0 mEq/L, paired t = -2.1, p = 0.04, respectively. Controlling for physical and psychiatric comorbidities and psychotropic treatment did not alter these associations.

Conclusions

Our results support the notion of an imbalance of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis among bipolar episodes, which is suggestive for relative hemoconcentration during depressive episodes and relative hemodilution during manic episodes. These findings may eventually lead to novel therapeutic targets.

### Analysis of electrolyte abnormalities in adolescents and adults and subsequent diagnosis of an eating disorder… [^115fXh5Z]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

These results suggest that otherwise unexplained outpatient electrolyte abnormalities may serve to identify individuals who should be screened for an underlying eating disorder. Importance Eating disorders lead to increased mortality and reduced quality of life. While the acute presentations of eating disorders frequently involve electrolyte abnormalities, it remains unknown whether electrolyte abnormalities may precede the future diagnosis of an eating disorder. These electrolyte abnormalities are often severe and predispose to such adverse and potentially fatal health consequences as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and mental status changes. The pathogenesis underlying these electrolyte abnormalities can be explained by a number of etiologies relating to behaviors directly tied to the eating disorder including purging by vomiting, diuretic or laxative abuse, inadequate intake, and dehydration.

However, it remains largely unknown whether early electrolyte abnormalities, prior to the acute presentation of an eating disorder, are associated with the future diagnosis of an eating disorder. Our findings were consistent when we examined more severe electrolyte abnormalities including severe hypokalemia and severe hyponatremia, which were associated with over 7-fold and 5-fold higher odds for the diagnosis of an eating disorder, respectively. In the population of Ontario, Canada, we found the most common electrolyte abnormality to precede an eating disorder diagnosis to be hypokalemia though there was also a significant association with a number of other electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

This is not surprising as there is a large evidence base of the frequent overlap between eating disorders and comorbid psychiatric illness. 1, 25–28 However, the strong association between electrolyte abnormalities and subsequent eating disorder diagnosis persisted despite adjusting for these factors within our analyses. Second, comprehensive medication data in Ontario was only available for individuals ages 65 years or older, which represented only a minority of our study population. In this population-based case-control study, we found that outpatient electrolyte abnormalities may serve as a precursor to future eating disorder diagnoses. Electrolyte abnormalities commonly occurred well ahead of the time at which an eating disorder diagnosis was made. Hypokalemia was the most common electrolyte abnormality identified while hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and metabolic alkalosis were the most specific for a subsequent eating disorder diagnosis.

### The role of electrolytes in affective disorders… [^115F8ehG]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

THE demonstration by Hodgkin and Katz1 that the process of polarization and depolarization of the cell membrane depends upon the gradients of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane has become a cornerstone to our understanding of the propagation of action potentials. The possibility that abnormalities in Na or K metabolism might account for altered neuronal excitability and might be manifest clinically as disturbed behavior has intrigued clinicians and investigators. In early studies, reviewed by Altschule, 2 concentrations of electrolytes in body fluids of patients with affective disorders usually were found to be normal. Changes in electrolyte balance during the course of a psychiatric illness have also been studied; cyclic mood disorders, such as manic-depressive disease, are especially suitable for this research approach. A number of early reports indicated that Na retention occurred during depression and that Na. Baer L, Platman SR, Fieve RR.

The author feels that this subject is "generally considered complex, unpredictable, and bewildering. " Most texts are "physiologically and chemically oriented. " This monograph approaches the problem of "describing the clinical syndromes. " The author is an internist, but his first chapter, on alkalosis, is devoted to five cases seen in consultation on the surgical service. These must have been seen some time ago, since four of them had infusions of sodium lactate in conjunction with sulfadiazine therapy. Gastric suction also contributed to the alkalosis. "In the author's opinion intravenous ammonium chloride is always necessary" in the treatment of alkalosis.

The reviewer has always found saline satisfactory since it has a 50 mEq/L excess of chloride. We both agree that potassium chloride must often be added. The second chapter presents and discusses a patient with congestive failure and stresses the renal and hormonal basis for fluid retention.
