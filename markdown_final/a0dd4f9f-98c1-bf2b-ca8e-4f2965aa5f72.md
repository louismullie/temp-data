## Question

What's the dosage in tabs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the correct number of tablets to take for a given medication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying the exact drug and formulation. Then, I should verify the labeled tablet strength and the recommended dose in milligrams. Next, I will calculate the tablet count from dose divided by strength, and I need to check for any special instructions like splitting, crushing, or food effects. Finally, I should confirm safety constraints such as maximum daily dose, tapering, or population-specific adjustments before concluding the answer.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and formulation, because dosing in "tabs" depends entirely on which medication and which tablet strength we are discussing. For example, moxidectin for adults is 8 mg as a single dose, which equals four 2 mg tablets, whereas aspirin/omeprazole delayed-release is one tablet daily, and varenicline uses a titration from 0.5 mg to 1 mg tablets over time, so I need to ensure I am not mixing these up before calculating anything [^34fcb103] [^386bcf71].

> Wait, let me verify the tablet strength and the labeled dose. I should confirm the exact milligram content per tablet and the recommended dose in milligrams from the FDA label or a trusted compendium. For instance, rosuvastatin tablets come in 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg strengths with a typical starting dose of 10–20 mg once daily, so a 20 mg dose could be one 20 mg tablet or two 10 mg tablets depending on what is dispensed, and I need to check the specific product on hand before advising a count.

> I will now examine the basic calculation: number of tablets equals the prescribed dose in milligrams divided by the tablet strength in milligrams. For example, if the dose is 300 mg and each tablet is 150 mg, that is 300 ÷ 150 = 2 tablets; if the dose is 8 mg and each tablet is 2 mg, that is 8 ÷ 2 = 4 tablets, which matches the moxidectin adult regimen, so the math is straightforward once I have the right inputs.

> Hold on, I should verify special administration instructions that can change the tablet count or how tablets are handled. Some tablets must be swallowed whole and cannot be split, crushed, or chewed, such as extended-release formulations like diazoxide choline or certain lamotrigine products, whereas others are designed to be split or chewed, like raltegravir chewables, so I need to check the label's administration section before assuming tablet division is acceptable [^60933679] [^cf4741ea].

> Let me consider pediatric and weight-based dosing, because the "number of tabs" often varies with body weight. For example, pediatric antiretroviral fixed-dose combinations are dosed by weight bands, and hydrocortisone in children is commonly 1 mg/kg/day using 5 mg tablets, which means a 10 kg child would receive 10 mg/day, or two 5 mg tablets, though tablet splitting can introduce dose variability and mini-tablets may be preferable when available, so I should confirm the child's weight and the exact formulation before finalizing the count [^c654d8b2] [^5d45e55e].

> I should double-check maximum daily doses and tapering rules, because these can constrain the total tablet count. For instance, tramadol/acetaminophen is not approved for more than 5 days and has explicit warnings about exceeding recommended doses, and tapentadol ER has a maximum of 500 mg/day with titration limits, so even if the arithmetic suggests more tablets, I must not exceed labeled maxima or ignore tapering guidance for opioids and other controlled drugs [^7fb7de86].

> But wait, what if the formulation affects bioavailability and thus the effective dose per tablet. I need to ensure I am not substituting different formulations as if they were milligram-equivalent. Raltegravir chewables and suspension have different bioavailability than film-coated tablets, and dolutegravir dispersible tablets have 60–80% greater bioavailability than film-coated tablets, so the same milligram count across formulations is not interchangeable and would lead to under- or overdosing if I misapply it [^3c950f2e] [^7e7fcea3].

> Let me reconsider the original question framing. "What's the dosage in tabs" is incomplete without the drug name, strength, and patient context. The safest, referenceable answer I can give is a method: identify the drug and tablet strength, divide the prescribed milligram dose by the milligram per tablet, then verify administration constraints, maximum doses, and any weight-based or population-specific adjustments before stating a final tablet count, and I should explicitly ask for the specific medication and patient details to avoid errors.

The number of tablets per dose depends on the **drug, strength, and prescribed dose**. For example, moxidectin 8 mg is **four 2 mg tablets** [^c835dd80], and olaparib 300 mg is **two 150 mg tablets** [^c9df4b37]. Always check the **label or prescription** for the exact tablet strength and dose, and follow administration instructions (e.g. swallow whole, do not crush or split) [^34fcb103] [^60933679]. If unsure, confirm with your pharmacist or prescriber.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^2571af43]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].

### Potassium chloride (K-tab) [^608b4639]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The usual dietary potassium intake by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.

Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40–100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.

K-TAB tablets provide 10 mEq and 20 mEq of potassium chloride.

K-TAB tablets should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation (see WARNINGS).

NOTE: K-TAB tablets are to be swallowed whole without crushing, chewing or sucking the tablets.

### Manipulation of drugs to achieve the required dose is intrinsic to paediatric practice but is not supported by guidelines or evidence [^8dac65ce]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A lack of commercially-available, age-appropriate formulations makes it difficult to administer medication to children accurately. Many medicines given to children use dosage forms designed for adults. The magnitude of doses required throughout childhood can vary up to 100-fold. A proportion of the dose in the available marketed dosage form may be required. Medicines are thus manipulated by the physical alteration of a dosage form with the aim of achieving the required (usually smaller) dose for administration. Examples include splitting a tablet and administering a proportion or the further dilution of an injection when the available concentrations do not permit the paediatric dose to be measured accurately without dilution. Although commonly acknowledged among professionals as a widespread practice, reports about manipulations with the aim of achieving the required dose are limited. Manipulations may be time-consuming, can be inaccurate, and have unknown effects on the stability and bioavailability of the drug. This risks the administration of toxic or sub-therapeutic doses. Drug manipulations may also increase the risk of errors. Dose calculation errors are the most common medication error in neonatal and paediatric practice. Tablet manipulations have been encouraged (for adults) in some countries because of economic considerations. There may be little cost difference between different tablet strengths of the same drug. Therefore it may be significantly cheaper to split tablets than buy the tablet with the optimal dose. A systematic review completed in this area identified only one study (involving suppositories) that was not related to splitting tablets. Studies in the systematic review included drugs which are used in paediatric practice, though there were only two papers that included paediatric participants. Further research and practice guidance is needed.

A key barrier to good practice and research is the lack of understanding about the scope of manipulations in paediatric practice. There are few reports about the settings in which manipulations occur or the types of manipulations that are performed. Accordingly the aim of this study was to scope which dosage forms and drugs are routinely manipulated in paediatric practice. This study also investigated reasons for undertaking manipulations and concerns raised by those undertaking manipulations.

### Dose-optimization of a novel Co-formulated triple combination antimalarial therapy: artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine [^822fb048]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) is the first‐line therapy for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Artemisinin‐resistant P. falciparum was first identified in Southeast Asia, but artemisinin resistance has recently emerged in East Africa. Triple‐ACTs have emerged as a viable alternative treatment to combat declining ACT efficacy due to multi‐drug‐resistant malaria.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Artemether‐lumefantrine is the most commonly used antimalarial today and has been proposed for development into a fixed‐dose combination with amodiaquine to address potential adherence issues associated with loose‐tablet regimens. This study aimed to select and evaluate a novel fixed‐dose regimen of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine through population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

Based on simulated total exposure and peak concentrations, an optimal dose regimen was developed resulting in an extension of the current 4 weight bands to a total of 5 weight bands to generate equivalent exposures in all body weight groups and minimize the fluctuation in exposure between patients.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

Using a modeling and simulation approach, we propose a fixed‐dose formulation of artemether‐lumefantrine‐amodiaquine (20:120:40 mg) to simplify manufacturing, implementation, and further development of a co‐formulated product. The proposed dosing should maximize the chance of patient cure by providing an increased artemether‐lumefantrine dose in small children and large adults while minimizing the risk of increased adverse events linked to higher doses of amodiaquine by splitting the standard once‐daily dose into twice‐daily dosing to be co‐formulated with artemether‐lumefantrine.

### Naproxen sodium (naproxen) [^21e3bc89]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of naproxen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Naproxen tablets Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with Naproxen tablets or the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Naproxen-containing products such as naproxen tablets and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.

2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis

The recommended dosages of naproxen tablets are shown in Table 1.

 Table 1: Recommended dosages for Naproxen Tablets

During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration.

The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response.

In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.

2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

Naproxen solid-oral dosage forms may not allow for the flexible dose titration needed in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for weight-based dosing and due to the need for dose flexibility in children.

In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]. The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses. Dosing with naproxen tablets are not appropriate for children weighing less than 50 kilograms.

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) dosing comparability — Do not assume dosing equivalence between SLIT tablets and extracts of the same allergen. There are no direct comparisons between the same allergen extract administered as a SLIT tablet vs as an aqueous SLIT extract, and it is unknown whether equal efficacy and/or safety exists when using similar doses of these 2 preparations; each formulation requires its own safety profile (Strength of Recommendation: Weak; Evidence: C). There are no FDA-approved SLIT aqueous formulations and thus no basis for comparison.

### Clarithromycin sustained-release tablet may be an improper therapy for the eradication of… [^43adf720]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clarithromycin is a macrocyclic lipid antibiotic that is widely utilized in the treatment of H. pylori infection as reported previously. However, guidelines do not specify the preferred form of clarithromycin dosage for treating H. pylori infection. At our hospital, both dispersible and sustained-release tablets have been used and both forms of dosage have exhibited similar rates of adverse events, with sustained-release tablets featuring lower drug concentrations than dispersible tablets. Further research is required to determine whether they have the same efficacy as the regular formulation in the treatment of H. pylori, especially in the context of drug resistance.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage for the treatment of H. pylori infection. In this retrospective study, the eradication rate and risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, age, sex, and PPI type that could affect the efficacy of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy were compared among different dosage forms of clarithromycin for eradicating H. pylori infection.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (nortrel) [^9c8400ba]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

21-Day Regimen (Day 1 Start):

The dosage of Nortrel 1/35 (norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol tablets) (21) Day Regimen, for the initial cycle of therapy is one "active" tablet administered daily from the 1st day through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as "Day 1". For subsequent cycles, no tablets are taken for 7 days, then a new course is started of one tablet a day for 21 days. The dosage regimen then continues with 7 days of no medication, followed by 21 days of medication, instituting a three-weeks-on, one-week-off dosage regimen.

If the patient misses one (1) "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control, such as a condom or spermicide, if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more "active" tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling ("How to Take the Pill" section).

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (aranelle) [^ff1e879d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, oral contraceptives must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.

For a DAY 1 START, count the first day of menstrual flow as Day 1 and the first light yellow tablet is then taken on Day 1. For a SUNDAY START when menstrual flow begins on or before Sunday, the first light yellow tablet is taken on that day. With either a DAY 1 START or SUNDAY START, 1 light yellow tablet is taken for 7 days, then 1 white tablet for 9 days, then 1 light yellow tablet for 5 days, then 1 peach tablet (inert) for 7 days, whether bleeding has stopped or not. With either a DAY 1 START or SUNDAY START 1 tablet is taken each day at the same time for 28 days. After all 28 tablets are taken, whether bleeding has stopped or not, the same dosage schedule is repeated beginning on the following day.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENTS

To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, the oral contraceptive pill must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
Important: Women should be instructed to use an additional method of protection until after the first 7 days of administration in the initial cycle.
Due to the normally increased risk of thromboembolism occurring postpartum, women should be instructed not to initiate treatment with oral contraceptives earlier than 4 weeks after a full-term delivery. If pregnancy is terminated in the first 12 weeks, the patient should be instructed to start oral contraceptives immediately or within 7 days. If pregnancy is terminated after 12 weeks, the patient should be instructed to start oral contraceptives after 2 weeks.33, 77
If spotting or breakthrough bleeding should occur, the patient should continue the medication according to the schedule. Should spotting or breakthrough bleeding persist, the patient should notify her physician.
If the patient misses 1 pill, she should be instructed to take it as soon as she remembers and then take the next pill at the regular time. The patient should be advised that missing a pill can cause spotting or light bleeding and that she may be a little sick to her stomach on the days she takes the missed pill with her regularly scheduled pill. If the patient has missed more than one pill, see DETAILED PATIENT LABELING, HOW TO TAKE THE PILL, WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS.

### Safety of chewable tablets for children [^94ddb099]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

New emphasis on pediatric drug development makes the availability of safe, easy-to-use dosage formulations imperative for clinical practice. Chewable tablets are a widely used pediatric dosage form; however, a literature review on the safety of this formulation has not been published. We have, therefore, determined the safety of chewable tablets in the pediatric age group based on the published literature. A search of safety information on chewable tablets was performed from the published literature dating from January 1966 to January 1999. Search terms included tablet, chewable tablet, drug formulation, aspiration, choking, asphyxia, airway obstruction, and foreign body. Additional information was obtained from the Physician's Desk Reference, by purchasing products at a local drug store, from calls to manufacturers, and from the IMS Health National Prescription Audit Plus 7. Human, English-language studies of two types were included, clinical articles with any mention of chewable tablets, and aspiration case series. The results of this review showed that more than 60 chewable tablet formulations are approved for use in the United States. Medical issues, including foreign-body injuries, related to the chewable-tablet formulation were extremely rare. The advantages of chewable tablets include palatability, stability, precise dosing, portability, and ease of delivery. It is concluded that the available literature suggests that chewable tablets provide a safe, well-tolerated alternative to traditional pediatric drug formulations and offer significant advantages in children 2 years of age and older.

Nilotinib is available in different formulations, recommended dosages, and tablet strengths, and for different indications. DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets may not be substitutable with other nilotinib products, including other nilotinib tablets, on a milligram per milligram basis. When switching patients between other nilotinib products and DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets, a dose conversion may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 and 2.2)]. Substitution of DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets for another nilotinib product to achieve the same daily nilotinib dosage on a milligram per milligram basis may result in a clinically significant:

- Increase in nilotinib exposure which may increase the risk of nilotinib-associated adverse reactions.

- Decrease in nilotinib exposure which may reduce DANZITEN effectiveness.

Confirm that the intended nilotinib product is being prescribed and dispensed.

5.2 Myelosuppression

Treatment with DANZITEN can cause Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Perform CBCs every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding DANZITEN temporarily or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### The effect of tablet moistening on labor induction with intravaginal misoprostol: a randomized trial [^6f8dfeea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether a dosage of 50 microg of misoprostol tablets moistened with 3% acetic acid and administered intravaginally is more efficacious for labor induction than a similar dosage regimen using dry tablets.

Methods

A total of 177 women who presented with an indication for cervical ripening and labor induction were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) intravaginal misoprostol in dry tablet form, or 2) intravaginal misoprostol moistened with 1 mL of 3% acetic acid solution. The primary outcome assessed was the interval from start of induction to vaginal delivery. To detect at least a 3.5-hour difference in the primary outcome with 80% power, 87 subjects were required in each group.

Results

Among 162 patients evaluated, 80 were allocated to the misoprostol dry group and 82 to the misoprostol moistened group. No significant difference was noted for the mean ± standard deviation interval to vaginal delivery: 1130 ± 636 minutes for the group who received dry tablets and 1004 ± 636 minutes for those who received moistened misoprostol tablets (P = 0.25). Additionally, no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to need for oxytocin, proportion of patients delivered after a single dose, intrapartum complications (including tachysystole and uterine hyperstimulation), mode of delivery, or perinatal outcomes.

Conclusion

Tablet moistening with 3% acetic acid solution does not seem to improve the efficacy of intravaginally administered misoprostol for labor induction.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ea5663d7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Posaconazole — indications, formulations, and dosing: Posaconazole does not have an indication for primary candidiasis therapy and, although in vitro activity against Candida species is similar to voriconazole, clinical data are inadequate to make an evidence-based recommendation for treatment of candidiasis other than oropharyngeal candidiasis. Posaconazole is available as an extended-release tablet, an oral suspension, and an intravenous solution. The tablet formulation, given as 300 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 300 mg daily produces predictable serum concentrations and excellent drug exposure and requires only once-daily dosing, whereas the oral suspension has unpredictable bioavailability. Intravenous posaconazole is given as 300 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 300 mg daily.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^81de2d35]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective dose or the longest dosing interval should be sought for each patient (see WARNINGS), especially in the elderly. After observing the initial response to therapy with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets, the dose and frequency of dosing should be adjusted to suit the individual patient's need, without exceeding the total daily dose recommended.

Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse (see WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse). Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Discontinuation of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets

When a patient who has been taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets in a physically dependent patient (see WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

### Fixed-dose single tablet antidiabetic combinations [^80fe4b1e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Combinations of two or more oral agents with different mechanisms of action are often used for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. While these combinations have customarily been taken as separate tablets, several fixed-dose single tablet combinations are now available. These are based on bioequivalence with the separate tablets, giving similar efficacy to the separate tablets and necessitating the same cautions and contraindications that apply to each active component. Fixed-dose combinations can offer convenience, reduce the pill burden and simplify administration regimens for the patient. They increase patient adherence compared with equivalent combinations of separate tablets, and this is associated with some improvements in glycaemic control. Presently available antidiabetic fixed-dose combinations include metformin combined with a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor or meglitinide as well as thiazolidinedione-sulphonylurea combinations, each at a range of dosage strengths to facilitate titration. Anticipated future expansion of multiple drug regimens for diabetes management is likely to increase the use of fixed-dose single tablet combinations.

### Dosage and duration of medication for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: two questions without definitive answers [^9c07f68e]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, the dosage and duration of medication in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia are discussed. There is no official guideline, however, and even no professional agreement on these points.

Recent Findings

Considering the dosage, dose-titration is probably not a drawback as there is a high risk of undertreatment or overtreatment when using a single dosage for every patient. Duration of treatment is a matter of concern. A quarter of patients discontinue their treatment early. For the others, a long period of treatment may be mandatory for those patients who are at risk of progression. After a course of medication (6 months to 1 year), a trial without treatment may help to decide whether treatment must be continued if symptoms relapse.

Summary

For men with lower urinary tract symptoms, there seems to be no definitive answer about the appropriate dosage and duration of medicine.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets (Lojaimiess) [^577f015c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Counsel patients about the following information:

Cigarette Smoking

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use. Women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use LoJaimiess [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Venous Thromboembolism

Increased risk of VTE compared to non-users of COCs is greatest after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4-week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Use during Pregnancy

Instruct females to stop further intake of LoJaimiess if pregnancy is confirmed during treatment.

Sexually Transmitted Infections

LoJaimiess does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.

Dosing and Missed Pill Instructions

Patients should take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event tablets are missed. See, "What to do if you miss pills" section of FDA-Approved Instructions for Use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Need for Additional Contraception

Postpartum females who have not yet had a period when they start LoJaimiess need to use an additional method of contraception until they have taken a white to off-white tablet for 7 consecutive days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. There is a need to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with LoJaimiess [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Lactation

LoJaimiess may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established. When possible, nursing women should use other methods of contraception until they have discontinued breastfeeding [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Amenorrhea and Possible Symptoms of Pregnancy

Amenorrhea may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Advise patients to contact a healthcare provider in the event of amenorrhea with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness.

Depression

Depressed mood and depression may occur. Women should contact their healthcare provider if mood changes and depressive symptoms occur, including shortly after initiating the treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Effect of high vs low doses of chloroquine diphosphate as adjunctive therapy for patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a randomized clinical trial [^1fe99154]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Procedures

Dosages in the literature are heterogeneous. The reasons that guided the high dosage in this study were as follows: (1) in principle, antiviral dosages should be high, as per in vitro studies' results; (2) the toxic effects of high doses, such as HCQ 600 mg twice daily for 28 days, were already studied in patients with cancer, showing good safety even in phase I trials; (3) in an unknown disease that has proved to be more lethal than expected, the benefits for critically ill patients were thought to be superior to the adverse effects of high-dose CQ; (4) only 150 mg chloroquine base tablets are available in Brazil, which needed to be adjusted for a routine daily prescription to avoid tablet partition; (5) patients with high body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) in the study population (ie, median [interquartile range], 28.1 [26.0–31.6]); and (6) critically ill patients in shock usually present limited gastrointestinal absorption, and no intravenous drug was available. The low dosage was what was recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, based on expert opinion.

The interventions tested in this study were based on different regimens using CQ base 150 mg tablets (241.9 mg of the phosphate CQ per tablet) (Farmanguinhos). Eligible participants were allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive orally (or via nasogastric tube in case of orotracheal intubation) either high-dosage CQ (600 mg CQ; 4 × 150 mg tablets twice daily for 10 days; total dose 12 g) or low-dosage CQ (450 mg CQ; 3 × 150 mg tablets and 1 placebo tablet twice daily on day 0, 3 × 150 mg tablets plus 1 placebo tablet once a day followed by 4 placebo tablets from day 1 to day 4, then 4 placebo tablets twice daily from day 5 to day 9; total dose 2.7 g). Placebo tablets, also produced by Farmanguinhos, were used in the low-dosage group to standardize treatment and masking of research team and participants.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol (Balziva) [^95054503]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The following is a summary of the instructions given to the patient in the "HOW TO TAKE THE PILL" section of the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING.

The patient is given instructions in five (5) categories:

1. **IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER**: The patient is told (a) that she should take one pill every day at the same time, (b) many women have spotting or light bleeding or gastric distress during the first one to three cycles, (c) missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, (d) she should use a back-up method for contraception if she has vomiting or diarrhea or takes some concomitant medications, and/or if she has trouble remembering the pill, (e) if she has any other questions, she should consult her physician.

2. **BEFORE SHE STARTS TAKING HER PILLS**: She should decide what time of day she wishes to take the pill, check whether her pill pack has 28 pills, and note the order in which she should take the pills (diagrammatic drawings of the pill pack are included in the patient insert).

3. **WHEN SHE SHOULD START THE FIRST PACK**: The Day-One start is listed as the first choice and the Sunday start (the Sunday after her period starts) is given as the second choice. If she uses the Sunday start she should use a back-up method in the first cycle if she has intercourse before she has taken seven pills.

4. **WHAT TO DO DURING THE CYCLE**: The patient is advised to take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty. If she is on the 28 day regimen, she should start the next pack the day after the last inactive tablet and not wait any days between packs.

5. **WHAT TO DO IF SHE MISSES A PILL OR PILLS**: The patient is given instructions about what she should do if she misses one, two or more than two pills at varying times in her cycle for both the Day-One and the Sunday start. The patient is warned that she may become pregnant if she has unprotected intercourse in the seven days after missing pills. To avoid this, she must use another birth control method such as condom, foam, or sponge in these seven days.

### Varenicline [^386bcf71]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim to quit by the end of the 12th week of treatment, or sooner if you feel ready. Continue to take varenicline tablets for another 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of treatment.

Starting varenicline tablets before your quit date gives varenicline tablets time to build up in your body. You can keep smoking during this time. Take varenicline tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.

- Varenicline tablets come as a white tablet (0.5 mg) and a white tablet (1 mg). You start with the white tablet (0.5 mg) and then usually go to the white tablet (1 mg). See the chart below for dosing instructions for adults.

- Make sure that you try to stop smoking on your quit date. If you slip-up and smoke, try again. Some people need to take varenicline tablets for a few weeks for varenicline tablets to work best.

- Most people will take varenicline tablets for up to 12 weeks. If you have completely quit smoking by 12 weeks, your healthcare provider may prescribe varenicline tablets for another 12 weeks to help you stay cigarette-free.

- Take varenicline tablets after eating and with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^456dc6d2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Some available guidance points to the availability of liquid formulations for some BZD medications (e.g. diazepam oral solution concentrate) and the use of compounding pharmacies for custom dosage tablets. However, these options come with a higher cost, and not all patients have access to them. In addition, measuring out liquid doses can be challenging for some patients. These strategies are discussed in detail in The Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines. See Appendix 7 for resources on managing challenging dosage reductions with available formulations.

Patients who have been taking lower doses of BZDs for shorter periods of time may desire or be able to taper from the medication more quickly than recommended in this Guideline. Clinicians can reasonably consider if a faster taper may be indicated or if a taper is necessary for patients whose presentation and history suggest a low risk of significant physical dependence and withdrawal.

Clinicians should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies. For example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first. See Appendix 3 for case descriptions and associated sample tapering strategies.

The CGC emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences. The FDA also underscored the importance of developing individualized tapering strategies in a 2020 Drug Safety Communication (2):

To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition.

### Acceptability of different oral dosage forms in paediatric patients in hospital setting [^08d23a03]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The understanding of acceptability of existing dosage forms is limited in most of the world and hinders the development of acceptable, age-appropriate medicines. The attributes of paediatric medicine acceptability may differ from country to country based on culture, healthcare infrastructure and health policies. This study was designed to map the acceptability of oral medicines in paediatric patients treated in hospital in India.

Methods

An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in patients aged below 18 years and taking any form of oral medication. Acceptability scores were obtained using CAST-ClinSearch Acceptability Score Test tool.

Findings

490 patients were recruited and 193 evaluations of different pharmaceutical products available in 20 dosage forms and 7 routes of administration were studied. Oral liquids (50%) and tablets (35%) were the most commonly prescribed and administered forms. Regardless of the therapeutic class and age, the oral liquids were 'positively accepted' in infants and toddlers. Acceptability of tablets improved with age and appeared to be generally good from the age of 6.

Conclusion

This study indicates the limited progress towards adoption of age-appropriate dosage forms in India and thus impact on the acceptability of existing oral dosage forms. The key challenges posed by the adoption of age-appropriate formulations in India are (1) awareness of importance of appropriate administration and acceptability of medicines to children in India, (2) availability of age-appropriate dosage forms and (3) lack of child-appropriate medicine policies.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^322d2051]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### The national list of essential medicines of India 2022 (NLEM 2022): tommy, toe the line [^9a62fabc]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Unaligned with the concept of essential medicines

Essential medicines must always be available in adequate quantities at an affordable cost. The process of selection of essential medicines involves the evaluation of scientific evidence for comparative effectiveness, safety, cost effectiveness, suitability, and tolerability. The available therapeutic alternatives should also be considered. WHO appoints an expert committee to prepare the model list of essential medicines. This committee undertakes the above-mentioned process and recommends the selected drug along with the dosage form and strength. But in the case of NLEM 2022, instead of choosing the appropriate dosage form and the strength for every selected drug, all the available dosage forms and their strengths are included in the list. This indicates a possibility that the selection process as defined by the WHO was not followed. For example, five different strengths (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg) of tablet fluconazole are included in NLEM 2022 but WHO EML 2021 includes only one strength (50 mg) of solid oral dosage form (capsule) of fluconazole. Similarly, all the available strengths are included for the parenteral preparations of all drugs in NLEM 2022 and is also same for liquid oral dosage forms. Including all the available dosage forms and strengths for every drug is against the concept of essential medicines. Such a list also defeats the purpose of having an essential medicines list.

### Higher strength lanthanum carbonate provides serum phosphorus control with a low tablet burden and is preferred by patients and physicians: a multicenter study [^a30c1f24]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Management of hyperphosphatemia, a predictor of mortality in chronic kidney disease, is challenging. Nonadherence to dietary phosphate binders, in part, contributes to uncontrolled serum phosphorus levels. This phase IIIb trial assessed the efficacy of increased dosages (3000 to 4500 mg/d) of reformulated lanthanum carbonate (500-, 750-, and 1000-mg tablets) in nonresponders to dosages of up to 3000 mg/d.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This 8-wk study with a 4-mo open-label extension enrolled 513 patients who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Patients who achieved serum phosphorus control at week 4 with ≤ 3000 mg/d lanthanum carbonate entered cohort A; nonresponders were randomly assigned to receive 3000, 3750, or 4500 mg/d (cohort B). The primary outcome measure was the control rate for predialysis serum phosphorus levels at the end of week 8, among patients in cohort B.

Results

At the end of week 4, 54% of patients achieved serum phosphorus control at dosages ≤ 3000 mg/d administered as one tablet per meal. Among patients who entered cohort B, control rates of 25, 38, and 32% for patients who were randomly assigned to 3000, 3750, or 4500 mg/d lanthanum carbonate, respectively, were achieved, with no increase in adverse events. Patients and physicians reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction with reformulated lanthanum carbonate compared with previous phosphate binders, partly because of reduced tablet burden with higher dosage strengths. Physicians and patients also expressed a preference for lanthanum carbonate over previous medication.

Conclusions

Reformulated lanthanum carbonate is an effective phosphate binder that may reduce daily tablet burden.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e816c74a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.

Main Results

We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Inappropriate oral formulations and information in paediatric trials [^95e94ae0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously, quality of formulations information provided for oral medications used in paediatric clinical trials published in 10 highly cited journals between 2002 and 2004 raised concerns. This short report explores if there was any subsequent improvement on how the formulations used in trials involving children < 12 years reported in the same journals. Studies published between 2004 and 2008 were hand-searched and classified as containing adequate, some or no formulation information. Those involving solid dosage forms were further analysed. Only 31% (44/140) of publications provided adequate information, 5% less compared to 2002–2004 (28/76). There was a significant 12% rise (p < 0.05) of no formulation information at all (37/140) and in tablets/capsules use (53/140), of which 3/4 gave no administration details, even for those under 6 years old, but a 12% decline in suitable paediatric formulations use (52/140 compared to 37/76). Contrary to expectations, overall quality of formulation information reported markedly deteriorated, jeopardising validity of clinical outcomes. The situation may reflect continued lack of awareness among investigators and other stakeholders of the importance of using suitable age-appropriate formulations.

### Acceptability of vaginal film, soft-gel capsule, and tablet as potential microbicide delivery methods among African women [^78bfc7a3]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal microbicides are in development for the prevention of HIV transmission to women via sexual intercourse. Acceptability of the microbicide delivery method in the targeted population is important to product adherence and, therefore, product effectiveness. It is anticipated that multiple delivery methods will be required to satisfy personal preferences among future microbicide users.

Methods

A total of 526 sexually active women aged 18–30 years participated in a consumer product preference study in Burkina Faso, Tanzania, and Zambia. Screened women who had given consent were instructed to use each of the three products (placebo formulations of a vaginal tablet, film, and soft-gel capsule) once daily for 7 consecutive days for a total of 21 days. Women were interviewed about their impressions of the product at the completion of each 7-day trial period.

Results

Over 80% of women reported they liked using each dosage form, and over 85% said they would definitely use it. The film and soft-gel capsule were chosen significantly more often than the tablet as the preferred dosage form (39% and 37% vs. 25%, respectively) mainly because of faster dissolving time and easier insertion. Women in Burkina Faso and Tanzania preferred the soft-gel capsule (42%-46%), whereas Zambian women preferred the film (51%). Age, socioeconomic status, and marital status did not significantly affect product preference.

Conclusions

All three dosage forms were acceptable to the women surveyed. Preferred dosage forms varied by country. These data suggest that the availability of microbicides in multiple dosage forms may increase acceptability, adherence, and, therefore, effectiveness.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^dce80199]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is temporarily to replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 132 trials; 111 with over 40,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50–70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Clarithromycin sustained-release tablet may be an improper therapy for the eradication of… [^88ed3432]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clarithromycin plays an important role in eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) through quadruple therapy. However, there is limited research on whether different forms of clarithromycin dosage have similar efficacies against H. pylori.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage in bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for eradicating H. pylori.

Design

A single-center retrospective analysis comparing the efficacy of different forms of clarithromycin dosage in eradicating H. pylori.

Methods

An analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection through the ¹³C-urea breath test (¹³C-UBT) at Henan Provincial People's Hospital, China from 2020 to 2022 who were treated with either a dispersible or sustained-release clarithromycin tablet (500mg each), alongside amoxicillin (1000mg), a standard dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and bismuth citrate (220mg), administered twice daily as part of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Treatment efficacy was assessed using ¹³C-UBT at least 4weeks after treatment completion. The H. pylori eradication rate was the primary outcome of this study, and factors influencing it were analyzed.

Results

Among 2094 screened patients, 307 with H. pylori infection (mean age, 41.8 ± 0.7years; 43% men) received bismuth-containing quadruple therapy. Univariate analysis of the dispersible and sustained-release tablet groups revealed a lower eradication rate with the sustained-release tablet compared with the dispersible clarithromycin tablet regimen (75.26% (73/97) vs 95.26% (200/210), respectively; p < 0.05). Other factors, such as smoking, age, and PPI type, were not significantly associated with the cure rate. Multivariate analysis identified the form of clarithromycin dosage (dispersible vs sustained-release) to be an independent risk factor for eradication failure using the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (odds ratio = 0.145, 95% confidence interval: (0.065–0.323); p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The clarithromycin dispersible tablet demonstrated a higher H. pylori eradication rate, and the sustained-release clarithromycin tablet may be inappropriate for H. pylori eradication.

### Varenicline tartrate [^191c56d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim to quit by the end of the 12th week of treatment, or sooner if you feel ready. Continue to take varenicline tablets for another 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of treatment.

Starting varenicline tablets before your quit date gives varenicline tablets time to build up in your body.

You can keep smoking during this time. Take varenicline tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.

Varenicline tablets come as a white tablet (0.5 mg) and a blue tablet (1 mg). You start with the white tablet and then usually go to the blue tablet. See the chart below for dosing instructions for adults.

Make sure that you try to stop smoking on your quit date. If you slip-up and smoke, try again. Some people need to take varenicline tablets for a few weeks for varenicline tablets to work best.
Most people will take varenicline tablets for up to 12 weeks. If you have completely quit smoking by 12 weeks, your healthcare provider may prescribe varenicline tablets for another 12 weeks to help you stay cigarette-free.
Take varenicline tablets after eating and with a full glass (8 ounces) of water.
This dosing schedule may not be right for everyone. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are having side effects such as nausea, strange dreams, or sleep problems. Your healthcare provider may want to reduce your dose.
If you miss a dose of varenicline tablets, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Just take your next dose at your regular time.

### Lamotrigine extended-release (lamotrigine) [^dbf68603]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Potential Medication Errors

Medication errors involving Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets have occurred. In particular, the names Lamotrigine Tablets or lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of Lamotrigine Tablets. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets clearly. Depictions of the Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets can be found in the Medication Guide. Each Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablet has a distinct color, and is printed with Y31, Y32, Y33, Y34, Y35 or Y36 on one side. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets are supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles with white caps containing 30 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets and the specific tablet strength included in the bottle. The unit-of-use bottle with a distinctive bottle label features serves to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help to reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets each time they fill their prescription.

5.9 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives

Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur.

### Administration of the tablet formulation of olaparib in patients with ovarian cancer: practical guidance and expectations [^c9df4b37]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Olaparib is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme inhibitor that is approved for use in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) and genetic BRCA1/2 mutations who have received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy for maintenance treatment of recurrent OC that is in response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of BRCA mutation status and for human epidermal growth receptor factor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations who have previously been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. Because olaparib is poorly soluble and requires advanced drug delivery techniques to ensure bioavailability, the originally approved 400 mg dose is taken as eight 50 mg capsules twice daily. An alternative melt-extrusion tablet formulation was developed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of olaparib and reduce the pill burden for patients. The recommended tablet dose is 300 mg twice daily (two 150 mg tablets). Phase III studies with the tablet formulation are ongoing for multiple tumor types. Two studies conducted with the olaparib tablet formulation have reported results: one in platinum-sensitive, BRCA -mutated recurrent OC (SOLO-2) and one that included patients with germline BRCA -mutated metastatic breast cancer (OlympiAD). The tablet is the approved formulation based on the SOLO-2 trial results. Because the capsule and tablet formulations have different bioavailability, physicians must strictly adhere to the dosing instructions provided in the prescribing information. The tablet offers greater convenience for most patients, especially when using olaparib for maintenance therapy. This review discusses the differences between the two formulations, dose determination, and guidance for use of olaparib tablets by patients with OC. Prior to implementing any changes in therapy, health care providers should engage their patients in discussion to support an informed transition between the formulations.

Implications For Practice

Olaparib has recently been approved for maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) that is in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The originally approved capsule formulation was dosed as 400 mg twice daily (eight 50 mg capsules). The recommended olaparib tablet dose is 300 mg twice daily (two 150 mg tablets). The tablet is the new approved formulation based on the SOLO-2 trial results. Because the capsule and tablet formulations have different bioavailability, physicians must strictly adhere to the dosing instructions provided in the prescribing information. The tablet offers greater convenience for most patients, especially when using olaparib for maintenance therapy. This review discusses the differences between the two formulations, dose determination, and guidance for use of olaparib tablets by patients with OC.

### Safe and effective pharmacotherapy in infants and preschool children: importance of formulation aspects [^3415ebba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Safe and effective paediatric pharmacotherapy requires careful evaluation of the type of drug substance, the necessary dose and the age-appropriateness of the formulation. Generally, the younger the child, the more the attention that is required. For decades, there has been a general lack of (authorised) formulations that children are able to and willing to take. Moreover, little was known on the impact of pharmaceutical aspects on the age-appropriateness of a paediatric medicine. As a result of legislative incentives, such knowledge is increasingly becoming available. It has become evident that rapidly dissolving tablets with a diameter of 2 mm (mini-tablets) can be used in preterm neonates and non-rapidly dissolving 2 mm mini-tablets in infants from 6 months of age. In addition, uncoated 4 mm mini-tablets can be used in infants from the age of 1 year. Also, there is some evidence that children prefer mini-tablets over a powder, suspension or syrup. Other novel types of age-appropriate oral formulations such as orodispersible films may further add to the treatment possibilities. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on oral formulations for infants and preschool children, the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of dosage forms and the age groups by which these can likely be used.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tratinterol hydrochloride tablets in bronchial asthma: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-finding clinical trial [^2f3cfd8f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this study were to determine the efficacy and tolerability of different dosages of, and to identify the best dosage of, tratinterol hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of bronchial asthma.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-finding clinical research study was completed at 3 centers in the People's Republic of China from March 2008 to February 2009. Each center selected patients with bronchial asthma whose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values were < 80% of predicted normal (pretreatment). Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 groups, based on daily dosage: low, 50 μg/d; intermediate, 100 μg/d; and high, 150 μg/d. Doses were administered orally twice daily for 10 days. The primary end points were the changes from baseline (0 minutes) in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and FEV1 at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours after administration. Secondary end points were changes from baseline in forced vital capacity and asthma scores. Tolerability was monitored throughout the study period using physical examinations, laboratory testing, and spontaneous reporting.

Findings

A total of 72 patients were selected in this study (24 per group; 40 men; 32 women; mean age, 43.48 years). The efficacy analysis (per-protocol set) included 20, 20, and 22 patients in the low-, intermediate-, and high-dosage groups, respectively. In terms of the primary and secondary end points, the intermediate dosage was most efficacious, followed by the high and low dosages, respectively. All 3 dosages were well-tolerated.

Implications

In these patients with bronchial asthma, 100 μg/d was the dosage of tratinterol hydrochloride tablets most efficacious in terms of improvement in lung function. All 3 dosages were well-tolerated.

### Dose-optimization of a novel Co-formulated triple combination antimalarial therapy: artemether-lumefantrine-amodiaquine [^dafcc222]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Artemether‐lumefantrine and artesunate‐amodiaquine, the two most widely recommended ACTs, are currently dosed according to body weight in four bodyweight bands (Table S1 and S2). Artemether‐lumefantrine is available as a dispersible formulation or as standard fixed‐dose tablets. The World Health Organization dose range target is 5–24 mg/kg/day of artemether and 29–144 mg/kg/day of lumefantrine, given twice daily for 3 days. Artesunate‐amodiaquine is available as a standard fixed‐dose tablet formulation. The World Health Organization dose range target is 2–10 mg/kg/day of artesunate and 7.5–15 mg/kg/day of amodiaquine, given once a day for 3 days. Although used for decades with great success, these two ACTs have been shown to have reduced efficacy in children, and it has been proposed to revise and expand the four weight bands currently used to achieve a more equivalent exposure in all patient groups.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — dose timing definitions and risk context: A dose is considered late when < 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken, and a dose is considered missed if ≥ 24 hours have elapsed since the dose should have been taken. For combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the recommendations only apply to late or missed hormonally active pills and not to placebo pills. Extending the hormone-free interval (e.g., missing hormonally active pills either directly before or after the placebo or pill-free intervals) is considered to be a particularly risky time to miss CHCs, and seven days of continuous CHC use is deemed necessary to reliably prevent ovulation. Recommendations are provided for late or missed pills (Figure 1), the patch (Figure 2), and the ring (Figure 3).

2	DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose is 150 mg of Depo-Provera CI every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1)

2.1	Prevention of Pregnancy

Both the 1 mL vial and the 1 mL prefilled syringe of Depo-Provera CI should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension.

The recommended dose is 150 mg of Depo-Provera CI every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection.

Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term Depo-Provera CI treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period or within the first 5-days post‑partum. In post‑partum mothers who exclusively breastfeed, administer Depo‑Provera CI during or after the sixth post‑partum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of Depo-Provera CI depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration.

2.2	Switching from Other Methods of Contraception

When switching from other contraceptive methods, Depo-Provera CI should be given in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage based upon the mechanism of action of both methods, (e.g., patients switching from oral contraceptives should have their first injection of Depo-Provera CI on the day after the last active tablet or at the latest, on the day following the final inactive tablet).

### Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and comparative bioavailability of single, oral 2-mg doses of dexamethasone liquid and tablet formulations: a randomized, controlled, crossover study in healthy adult volunteers [^399529a5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid used widely worldwide for immunosuppressive treatment, allergies, bronchiolitis, and croup, among others. For children, liquid formulations are especially suitable because, compared with other dosage forms, both exact dosing and proper intake are facilitated.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and comparative bioavailability of a commercial liquid oral dexamethasone formulation intended for pediatric use relative to those of a tablet.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled, crossover study in 24 healthy adult volunteers, we administered single doses of the liquid and tablet formulation, containing 2 mg of dexamethasone each. Blood samples were taken up to 24 hours postdose. Quantification was carried out using a validated specific and sensitive high-pressure liquid chromatography with UV detector method. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between treatments according to European Medicines Agency (EMA) bioequivalence guidelines. For AUC(0-t) and C(max), the 90% CI for the ratio of the test and reference products should be contained within the predetermined acceptance interval of 80% to 125%. As a pharmacodynamic variable, we measured suppression of endogenous cortisol (predose and postdose).

Results

Both preparations showed similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles but high between-subject variability of pharmacokinetic key parameters and endogenous cortisol concentrations (> 30%). Mean AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), and C(max) were 37.8 ng/mL/h, 46.0 ng/mL/h, and 9.35 ng/mL, respectively, for the liquid and 41.3 ng/mL/h, 48.1 ng/mL/h, and 9.17 ng/mL, respectively, for the tablet formulation. T(max) was 0.89 hour (liquid) and 0.97 hour (tablet). The point estimates and 90% CIs for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), and C(max) ratios (liquid vs tablet) were 91.42% (82.05%-101.86%), 95.72% (84.46%-108.5%), and 102.04% (86.94%-119.76%), respectively. Thus, point estimates and 90% CIs were within the bioequivalence range of 80% to 125% for all relevant parameters, including the pharmacodynamic parameter AUEC (area under the effect curve).

Conclusions

This single-dose study suggests that the test and reference products met the EMA regulatory criteria to assume bioequivalence in these fasting healthy male and female volunteers. German Register of Clinical Trials registration number: DRKS00000785.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^5d45e55e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocortisone is the preferred cortisol replacement therapy in childhood, because it is of lower potency than the synthetic glucocorticoids and may be associated with fewer side effects. Hydrocortisone doses of 8 mg/m²/day, given in three to four divided doses, are thought to be adequate for cortisol replacement therapy in childhood. Higher, supraphysiological doses of 10–15 mg/m²/day are used to treat patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), in whom the goal of treatment is to achieve suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive to the adrenal gland, while avoiding the adverse effects of glucocorticoid excess.

Liquid hydrocortisone formulations, such as a 1 mg/mL oral suspension, are only available as unlicensed specials and in addition to the general limitations of transport, storage and stability there are potential concerns relating to the bioavailability of liquid hydrocortisone formulations. In paediatric practice, 2.5 mg hydrocortisone doses are prescribed frequently and to achieve these doses, it is recommended that tablets are divided or crushed. Crushing and dissolving tablets may result in unacceptably high variability of dosingand it may be preferable to quarter 10 mg tablets. The hydrocortisone 10 mg tablets licensed for oral administration are quarter scored, allowing them to be divided into equal halves or quarters. However, despite the presence of functional break lines, splitting may result in unequal parts thereby producing unequal doses and loss of mass due to crumbling.

To date, most data relating to the medium-term/long-term outcomes of children with CAH report features more likely to represent over, rather than under, dosing: obesity, insulin resistance, elevated leptin levels, dyslipidaemia and impaired glucose metabolism. However, working memory performance is lower in children with CAH than in unaffected relatives, and health-related quality of life is also reported to be reduced, with boys and girls equally affected, suggesting that this is not simply related to androgen excess in girls and associated disorders of sex development. Erratic and inadequate doses of hydrocortisone may contribute to these adverse effects.

No current licensed oral hydrocortisone formulation adequately meets the dosing requirements of children. Mini-tablets provide an alternate to standard tablets and oral liquids mainly for paediatric patients, ≥ 4 years of age. Variations exist in the defined size of mini-tablets in literature, but a diameter of ≤ 3 mm is commonly compatible with paediatric patients. Mini-tablets can be administered to paediatric patients as young as 6 months old with their food/beverages and recent studies have demonstrated mini-tablets to be more acceptable than oral syrups.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension) [^6dfdc73c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2	DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep, intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. (2.1)

2.1		Prevention of Pregnancy

The 1 mL vial of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension should be vigorously shaken just before use to ensure that the dose being administered represents a uniform suspension.

The recommended dose is 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension every 3 months (13 weeks) administered by deep intramuscular (IM) injection using strict aseptic technique in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, rotating the sites with every injection. As with any IM injection, to avoid an inadvertent subcutaneous injection, body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection to determine if a longer needle is necessary particularly for gluteal IM injection.

Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended (unless other birth control methods are considered inadequate) due to the impact of long-term medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

To ensure the patient is not pregnant at the time of the first injection, the first injection should be given ONLY during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period; ONLY within the first 5-days postpartum if not breast-feeding; and if exclusively breast-feeding, ONLY at the sixth postpartum week. If the time interval between injections is greater than 13 weeks, the physician should determine that the patient is not pregnant before administering the drug. The efficacy of medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension depends on adherence to the dosage schedule of administration.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of itraconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis [^cb90b58b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Itraconazole, approved for treatment of toenail fungal infection onychomycosis, provides antifungal activity at a dosage requiring once-daily (QD) administration of 2 100-mg capsules for 12 weeks. Utilizing the Meltrex® technology delivery system, a novel 200-mg formulation of itraconazole was developed delivering the same dosage as 2 capsules in a single tablet.

Methods

This phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigated the noninferiority of 1 itraconazole 200-mg tablet to 2 itraconazole 100-mg capsules dosed QD for 12 weeks, with a 40-week follow-up period. Clinical Cure (Investigator's Global Assessment plus mycological examination) was the primary outcome measure and Clinical Improvement was a secondary endpoint. Safety and efficacy of itraconazole 200-mg tablets were also compared with placebo.

Results

Significantly more patients in the intent-to-treat per-protocol populations on itraconazole (200-mg tablet or 2 100-mg capsules) achieved Complete Cure and Clinical Improvement compared with placebo. For both endpoints, itraconazole 200-mg tablet QD was noninferior to itraconazole 100-mg capsules and superior to placebo. All treatment groups demonstrated a similar safety profile with no new safety signals identified.

Limitations

Absolute patient blinding was not possible; the number of tablets versus capsules differed, and the appearance of the active drugs could not be masked. However, efficacy was based on objective assessments from blinded investigators.

Conclusions

Once-daily itraconazole 200-mg was well-tolerated, and may be an effective alternative to 2 itraconazole 100-mg capsules for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. The convenience of a simpler dosing regimen may improve patient compliance

### Acceptability of different oral formulations in infants and preschool children [^92bea0df]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

For decades, oral liquid dosage forms, such as syrups and suspensions, have been considered as the favourable type of dosage form in which to administer medicines to young children. However, oral liquid medicines may have disadvantages, such as a bad taste, portability problems or refrigerated storage conditions. Therefore, WHO currently favours that young children, particularly in developing countries, be treated with oral solid medicines.

Oral liquid medicines are more commonly available for use in infants and preschool children than oral solid (flexible) medicines, such as powders or orodispersible tablets. Small-sized tablets, also referred to as minitablets, have been identified as a new type of oral solid dosage form in which to administer medicines to young children. However, only few of such tablets have been authorised for children below 4 years of age. Nevertheless, small tablets have been widely used in this age group as food supplements, for example, 4 mm sodium fluoride tablets for caries prevention, or 4 mm vitamin AD tablets.

The selection of an oral dosage form and the pharmaceutical aspects of the formulation, such as the palatability of an oral suspension or the size of a tablet, are important factors in the overall acceptability of an oral paediatric medicine. As adequate child and parent acceptability are prerequisites for good drug adherence, paediatric treatment outcomes may be enhanced by a careful selection of the formulation including the type of the dosage form. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the acceptability of and preference among four oral formulations in domiciliary, infants and preschool children in The Netherlands.

### A method for tapering antipsychotic treatment that may minimize the risk of relapse [^8e8cb6ef]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

The tapering process should be conceptualized as finding a new minimum effective dose. The process could be individualized by observing patients for 3–6 months following an initial reduction of 5–10 percentage points of D₂ receptor blockade, and gauging response, to determine a tolerable rate of decrease thereafter. As outlined recently, it is possible that there would be an increase in symptoms following a dose reduction, but it might be expected that these symptoms would resolve over time, as underlying adaptations resolve (though this can take weeks or even months); increased psychosocial support may be necessary to manage this period if risks are manageable.

An example tapering regime for haloperidol, taking into account ease of administration and D₂ occupancy, might be a reduction in dose from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1.5 to 1 to 0.75 to 0.5 to 0.375 to 0.25 to 0.125 to 0.06 to 0 mg, with tablet splitting and liquid formulations required for the lower doses (figures 2c and tables 3 and 4). The size of reductions may be decreased or the time between reductions increased if patients experience a significant increase in symptoms. Holding the dose for a prolonged period or increasing to a previously tolerated dose may be advisable if the patient experiences significant symptoms; some may be able to tolerate slower or more gradual reductions subsequently. Similar regimes for other antipsychotics are shown in table 4 (with further detail in the supplementary material). One of the major barriers to the pharmacologically informed tapering proposed is achieving doses intermediate between commonly available tablet formulations and the very small doses suggested at the end of the taper: tablet cutters can be helpful, some antipsychotics are available in liquid formulations, and "tapering strips" developed in Holland are another option, providing small formulations of tablets that can be combined to facilitate a wide variety of doses for incremental tapers.

Tapentadol extended-release (ER) tablets — formulations, initiation, titration, and precautions include the following: Available as tablets containing 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg tapentadol for twice daily dosing. In opioid-naïve and non-tolerant patients: Initiate therapy with 50 mg twice daily; use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioid to tapentadol ER; convert current opioid to an estimated equianalgesic daily dose of tapentadol; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose. Dose change increments: May increase dose by no more than 50 mg twice daily every 3 days. Maximum daily dose: 500 mg daily. Tapentadol ER tablets must be taken whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tapentadol and can lead to overdose. Steady state is attained after the third dose (24 hr after the first twice daily multiple dose administration). Special populations: Elderly — No dosing adjustment needed, consider starting at lowest recommended dosage; patients with renal dysfunction — No dosage adjustment for mild or moderate renal impairment; not recommended in severe renal impairment; patients with hepatic dysfunction — Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Other considerations: Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol which can increase serum tapentadol concentration and cause fatal overdose, and use with or within 14 days of MAOIs is contraindicated.

### Pediatric integrative medicine [^6acf3d06]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Regulation of dietary supplements — United States definition, oversight, and labeling are delineated by the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 and, in Canada, by Health Canada. Under DSHEA, a dietary supplement is "a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains 1 or more of the following ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, or an amino acid"; is "intended for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form"; is "not used as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or a diet"; and is "labeled as a dietary supplement". The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can demonstrate that a supplement is unsafe only after it reaches the market and must prove that the product is unsafe before it can restrict a product's use or take other legal action, and it "relies largely on the MedWatch voluntary reporting system to collect safety data on dietary supplements". Under labeling provisions, "any claims to prevent, treat, or cure a specific disease are expressly prohibited (unless approved by the FDA)", whereas labels may describe "structure and function" or general "well-being" effects if truthful and bearing the statement, "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease". Labels may include suggested dosages and must bear nutritional labeling; the label must include the name and quantity of each dietary ingredient and, for botanicals, the part of the plant from which the ingredient is derived. In Canada, products manufactured or distributed are required to have a product license by Health Canada, certifying premarket safety, efficacy, and quality. To maximize patient safety, all primary care providers should be knowledgeable about correct labeling of dietary supplements.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Altavera) [^1b565977]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.

7. Lactation

 Risk Summary

Contraceptive hormones and/or metabolites are present in human milk. COCs can reduce milk production in breast-feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. When possible, advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast-feeding. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Altavera and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Altavera or from the underlying maternal condition.

8. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Altavera have been established in females of reproductive potential. Use of Altavera before menarche is not indicated.

9. Geriatric Use

Altavera has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.

10. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs (see BOXED WARNING and CONTRADICATIONS).
Counsel patients that this product does not protect against HIV-infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections.
Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day. Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION).
Counsel patients to use a back-up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs (see PRECAUTIONS (4.1)].
Counsel patients who are breastfeeding or who desire to breastfeed that COCs may reduce breast milk production. This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established COCs (see PRECAUTIONS (7)].
Counsel any patient who starts Altavera postpartum, and who has not yet had a period, to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light-orange tablet for 7 consecutive days (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION).
Counsel patients that amenorrhea may occur. Pregnancy should be considered in the event of amenorrhea, and should be ruled out if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness [see WARNINGS (9)].
Depression may occur. Women should contact their healthcare provider if depression occurs, including shortly after initiating the treatment [see WARNINGS (10)].

### Lamotrigine extended release [^4b2a8a59]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Potential Medication Errors

Medication errors involving lamotrigine extended-release have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine extended-release clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine extended-release tablets can be found in the Medication Guide. Each lamotrigine extended-release tablet has a distinct color and is printed with Par and 561, 562, 563, 564, 604 or 605. These distinctive features serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. Lamotrigine extended-release is supplied in round, unit-of-use bottles containing 30 tablets. Lamotrigine extended-release is also available in bottles of 100 and 500 tablets. The label on the bottle includes a depiction of the tablets that further communicates to patients and pharmacists that the medication is lamotrigine extended-release and the specific tablet strength included in the bottle. The unit-of-use-bottle with a distinctive bottle label feature serves to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help to reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine extended-release each time they fill their prescription.

5.9 Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives

Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine extended-release [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur.

### Quality testing of difficult-to-make prescription pharmaceutical products marketed in the US [^a2fee45e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

When tested for dosage unit uniformity (Figure 2), all of the 277 active ingredient samples in the 252 drug products sampled met the USP criteria of 75% to 125% of the label claim. All active ingredient samples easily met these criteria as the lowest and highest 95% CI bounds for dosage unit uniformity of all samples were 89.4% and 106.4% of the label claim.

Figure 2.
Dissolution vs Dosage Unit Uniformity for Each Active Ingredient in Each Sample

Dissolution bounds depicted by dashed vertical lines.

The active ingredients sampled here have lower dissolution bounds of 70%, 75%, 80%, or 85% that define the 4 cohorts of the study. When tested for dissolution (Figure 2), all samples met the appropriate USP criteria. The lowest 95% CI bound for all active ingredients in each dissolution cohort was also above the lower dissolution bound for that cohort (72.2%, 84.5%, 81.9%, and 88.3%, respectively). For 5 active ingredients, the lower 99% tolerance intervals fell below the lower dissolution bounds: (1) amoxicillin in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets, (2) hydrochlorothiazide in metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, (3) pravastatin in pravastatin tablets, (4) simvastatin in simvastatin tablets (including simvastatin and niacin extended release tablets), and (5) venlafaxine in venlafaxine tablets.

When sorting by region, all cohorts for all regions had dosage unit uniformity Ppks (Figure 3) above 1.73, exceeding 5-sigma capability. By contrast, variability in dissolution performance led to 4 of the 5 regions having a generics cohort fall below a 4-sigma benchmark Ppk of 1.33 (Figure 3): India (75%, 80%, and 85% cohorts), Canada (80% cohort), Europe (80% and 85% cohorts), and the US (80% cohort). Conversely, no brand-name drug cohorts fell below a dissolution Ppk of 1.60 for any region. Although all drugs met the tested standards, brand-name drugs generally had higher process performance for dissolution.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^5a3bcc91]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Posaconazole pediatric use and dosing — there is limited experience with posaconazole in children; formulations include an oral suspension and extended-release tablet approved for patients 13 years and older, and an IV formulation approved for patients aged ≥ 18 years. For the oral suspension, effective absorption strongly requires taking with food, and taking posaconazole on an empty stomach will result in approximately one-fourth of the absorption as in the fed state. For tablets, if the patient is unable to take food, the tablet is recommended, but there is potential for overdosing if this tablet formulation is dosed inappropriately. For invasive disease in children, the dose recommended by some experts is posaconazole 18 mg/kg/day divided three times daily, while pediatric IV or extended-release tablet dosing is completely unknown and under study, though adolescents can likely follow adult dosing schemes. Adult IV and extended-release tablet dosing is 300 mg twice daily on the first day, then 300 mg once daily starting on the second day, and the oral suspension maximum is 800 mg per day, which has been given as posaconazole 400 mg twice daily or 200 mg four times a day in severely ill patients.

RAL pediatric formulations — bioavailability, dosing differences, and administration are described: The RAL chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability than the 400-mg, film-coated tablet, and compared with the RAL 400-mg tablet formulation, the RAL 600-mg tablet has higher relative bioavailability; interpatient and intrapatient variability for PK parameters of RAL are considerable, especially with the film-coated tablets. Because of differences in bioavailability, the dosing recommendations for each formulation differ, and the formulations are not interchangeable; when prescribing RAL, clinicians should refer to the appropriate dosing table for the chosen formulation. According to the manufacturer, the film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole, whereas the chewable tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of liquid and are stable in various liquids, including water, apple juice, and breast milk. The use of RAL chewable tablets as dispersible tablets in children aged < 2 years has been studied in infants and toddlers with TB/HIV coinfection receiving rifampin, and RAL chewable tablets dispersed in water at a dose of RAL 12 mg/kg per dose twice daily safely achieved PK targets; the chewable tablets are approved for infants and young children 4 weeks of age and older and weighing at least 2 kg.

### The national list of essential medicines of India 2022 (NLEM 2022): tommy, toe the line [^6fbd28f4]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

WHO EML contains name, dosage form and strength of each drug, which makes it a complete source of reference (ready reckoner). In NLEM 2022, instead of exactly mentioning the dosage form and strength, it is mentioned as "As licensed" for some items. As a result, those who first use NLEM 2022 as a reference are forced to consult other sources like the website of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to obtain complete information about the licensed dosage form. Hyperlinking to other websites in the electronic copy of NLEM might obviate this. But the more important problem is that multiple formulations/strengths for a particular drug are licensed. Hence the readers of NLEM 2022 are confused on whether all the licensed formulations of a drug are to be selected to the list or any one among the licensed formulations alone needs to be considered. For example, the dosage forms and strengths for oral rehydration salts (ORS) is mentioned as "As licensed" in NLEM 2022. As numerous products of ORS (some of them irrational) are licensed, each differing in composition and quantity, one is perplexed on which among these licensed preparations must be chosen. In contrast to this, the WHO EML 2021 clearly mentions the composition of ORS setting aside all these confusions.

### General practitioners' perspectives, preferences, and practices in prescribing antihypertensive medication in primary, uncomplicated hypertension [^2552994d]. Family Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Some GPs appreciated the guideline recommendations that offered greater flexibility in choosing an antihypertensive class for patients with primary, uncomplicated hypertension, while others expressed a desire for more explicit guidance.

I feel that if there's no clear-cut preference, it gives me the freedom to handle it in my own way — which I really appreciate. (GP12)

I would actually welcome a bit more guidance, even though I used to regularly deviate from the old guidelines. (GP11)

All other quotes related to this theme are presented in Table 2, categorized by AHM class.

Table 2.
General practitioners' quotes on AHM class characteristics.

Abbreviations: Quotes are organised by specific beneficial effects, side effects, and other considerations across the different AHM classes. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; AHM = antihypertensive medication; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB = calcium channel blocker; GP = general practitioner; RAS = renin–angiotensin system.

Considerations on combination therapy

Most GPs found that, with some persuasion, patients were generally willing to accept adding a second AHM class rather than increasing the dosage when hypertension was not yet adequately controlled.

I don't leave much room for discussion in that regard. A combination [of two classes] works much better for me than simply increasing the dosage of one. And if you explain to them that it's scientifically proven that multiple medications are more effective than increasing the dosage, they generally accept this approach. (GP3)

However, some acknowledged that persuading patients to take an additional medication can sometimes be challenging.

But it is often harder to motivate people; they prefer to go from Lisinopril 10 to 20mg rather than take an additional tablet, and I can see why they feel that way. (GP2)

### Favorable acceptance of mini-tablets compared with syrup: a randomized controlled trial in infants and preschool children [^a765034c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate acceptability of 2 mm solid dosage forms (mini-tablets) as an alternative administration modality in young children in comparison with syrup.

Study Design

Three hundred six pediatric in- and outpatients aged 6 months-5 years (51 in each of 6 age groups) were recruited. An open, randomized cross-over study was conducted to compare acceptability and capability to swallow 2 mm uncoated or coated mini-tablets vs 3 mL syrup.

Results

In the overall patient population of 306 children, the acceptability of uncoated mini-tablets was superior to syrup (difference in proportions 14.8%, 95% CI 10.2–19.4; P < .0001). In line with this finding, the level of capability to swallow was higher for uncoated mini-tablets compared with syrup as well (difference in proportions 12.3%, 95% CI 5.4–19.3; P = 0.0008). All 3 pharmaceutical formulations were well tolerated, and none of the 306 children inhaled or coughed because of the syrup or the uncoated mini-tablet; only 2 of the 306 children (both in age group 0.5–1 year) coughed because of the coated mini-tablet, in both cases without clinical relevance.

Conclusions

Mini-tablets are a valuable alternative to syrup for children 6 months-6 years of age and are more acceptable compared with liquid formulation. Regulatory bodies such as Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Agency are encouraged to take our data into account for guideline updates and future drug approval processes.

### The facial nerve palsy and cortisone evaluation (FACE) study in children: protocol for a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, in a Borrelia burgdorferi endemic area [^cc93e6b0]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The intervention group receives prednisolone (tablet Prednisolone 5 mg) for oral intake once daily for 10 days without taper. The dosage is set in weight intervals aiming at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 50 mg/day) (Table 2). The control group receives the corresponding amount of placebo tablets. Investigator and child/parents are blinded to the intervention. Thus, the prescription to the specific participant only includes the specific number of tablets of study drug, for oral intake once daily for 10 days. The study drug intervention and the protocol as a whole have been reviewed and approved by the Swedish medical products agency (EudraCT nr 2017–004187–35).

Table 2
Dosage of study drug (tablet Prednisolone 5 mg or placebo)

Weigh intervals and number of tablets for oral intake once daily. Treatment period is 10 days. All bottles contain 100 tablets

The choices of corticosteroid and dosage are based on previous studies in adults and children. Engström et al. used prednisolone 60 mg/day for oral intake once daily for 5 days, and 5 days of taper in the Scandinavian Bell's palsy study in adults. Sullivan et al. used prednisolone 50 mg/day for oral intake once daily for 10 days without taper, in the corresponding study in adults in Scotland. The dosage of 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 50 mg/day) is considered an equivalent dose in children and has been used in several small treatment studies in children, with or without taper. Thus, based on previous studies mentioned above, and to facilitate and uphold compliance with treatment, a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 50 mg/day) in weight intervals (Table 2) without taper, was chosen for the FACE study. Furthermore, the chosen dosage strategy is in line with the treatment protocol of an ongoing trial on FNP in children in Australia and New Zeeland, using a 10-day course of prednisolone, aiming at 1 mg/kg/day for oral intake once daily without taper.

### Diazoxide choline (Vykat xr) [^60933679]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Recommendations Prior to VYKAT XR Initiation

Laboratory Testing Prior to VYKAT XR Initiation

Prior to initiating treatment with VYKAT XR, test fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c and optimize blood glucose in patients who have hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

For fasting glucose and HbA1c monitoring recommendations during VYKAT XR treatment and for dosage modifications based on results, see Dosage and Administration (2.3).

Important Information Regarding Substitution

Do not substitute VYKAT XR with diazoxide oral suspension because the pharmacokinetic profiles are different [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Dosage and Administration Recommendations

Administer VYKAT XR orally with or without food once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Swallow tablets whole. Do not split, crush, or chew the extended-release tablets because doing so may compromise the extended-release characteristics, efficacy, or safety of VYKAT XR.

The recommended oral dosage of VYKAT XR is based on body weight. The recommended starting dosage and titration schedule of VYKAT XR are shown in Table 1.

The maximum recommended dosage of VYKAT XR is 5.8 mg/kg/day or 525 mg per day. Dosages above 5.8 mg/kg/day or 525 mg per day have not been evaluated in patients with PWS.

### Manipulation of solid dosage forms for oral administration to paediatric patients for drug-resistant tuberculosis in south Africa: an observation study [^28871408]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There is an increasing number of children worldwide needing treatment for DR-TB. Paediatric DR-TB patients have traditionally been treated with off-label adult pharmaceuticals or extemporaneous compounding, which is not ideal for paediatric patients due to a lack of product safety, efficacy, and evidence-based guidelines. Furthermore, there are limited formulations suitable for children that are widely available. This has resulted in the manipulation of existing formulations to liquid preparations, either by dissolving tablets or opening capsules, to administer to paediatric patients. Establishing the correct dose and our ability to administer it to the child successfully are equally important. We need to encourage and work with manufacturers to adapt medicines to the needs of children but should also ensure that pharmacists and carers have information to adapt dosage forms safely and to extemporaneously formulate if necessary. Although there has been development of child-friendly dosage forms in recent years these drugs lack availability and registration in many countries. The healthcare sector needs to focus on identifying cases of children with DR-TB to build evidence to advocate for registration of child-friendly dosage forms thereby ensuring a sustainable supply of medication.

### Content uniformity of quartered hydrocortisone tablets in comparison with mini-tablets for paediatric dosing [^5af7b7aa]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The availability of age-appropriate medicines for children as solid dosage forms remains a pressing need. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Paediatric Committee's Formulation Working Group recommends that for younger patients, those aged 6–8 years, tablets of 6–7 mm with appropriate shape are acceptable. Growing evidence suggests that some children may have already acquired the ability to swallow tablets from an earlier age or can be taught using behavioural training interventions, especially those with severe diseases, such as children with HIV as young as 3 years who were prescribed stavudine as a solid dosage form.

There is limited evidence to support the use of dosage from manipulation to obtain an intended dose in paediatric practice. A study in UK hospitals reported that in paediatric practice, 42%–62% of manipulations involved tablets and 6% of total manipulations were steroid drugs. In the absence of an age-appropriate solid dosage form of hydrocortisone, parents/carers, young people and healthcare professionals are required to manipulate 10 mg tablets to derive an intended dose for use in paediatric practice. The data presented in this report clearly demonstrate that children treated with 2.5 mg doses of hydrocortisone derived from quartered 10 mg tablets are subject to unacceptable variability in hydrocortisone doses.

### Dosage form design and development [^e506eefa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Drugs must be properly formulated for administration to patients, regardless of age. Pediatric patients provide some additional challenges to the formulator in terms of compliance and therapeutic efficacy. Due to the lack of sufficient drug products for the pediatric population, the pharmaceutical industry and compounding pharmacies must develop and provide appropriate medications designed for children.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of drug substances and pharmaceutical ingredients to be used in preparing a drug product. In addition, stability, appearance, palatability, flavoring, sweetening, coloring, preservation, packaging, and storage are discussed.

Methods

Information for the current article was gathered from a literature review; from presentations at professional and technical meetings; and from lectures, books, and publications of the author, as well as from his professional experience. Professional society meetings and standards-setting bodies were also used as a resource.

Results

The proper design and formulation of a dosage form requires consideration of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of all of the drug substances and pharmaceutical ingredients (excipients) to be used in fabricating the product. The drug and pharmaceutical materials utilized must be compatible and produce a drug product that is stable, efficacious, palatable, easy to administer, and well tolerated. Preformulation factors include physical properties such as particle size, crystalline structure, melting point, solubility, partition coefficient, dissolution, membrane permeability, dissociation constants, and drug stability.

Conclusions

Successful development of a formulation includes multiple considerations involving the drug, excipients, compliance, storage, packaging, and stability, as well as patient considerations of taste, appearance, and palatability.
