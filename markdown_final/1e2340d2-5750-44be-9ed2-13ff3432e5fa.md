## Question

Tylenol contraindications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Tylenol (acetaminophen) contraindications, including absolute and relative constraints as well as combination product–specific issues and dose limits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core drug identity and formulations, since contraindications can differ by IV vs oral and by single-ingredient vs combination products. Then, I should verify true absolute contraindications for acetaminophen itself. Next, I will examine high-risk conditions that warrant caution rather than absolute avoidance. After that, I need to review opioid- or barbiturate-combination product–specific contraindications. Finally, I should confirm dose ceilings and boxed warnings and reconcile any ambiguities that might look like "dose-related contraindications" but are actually safety limits, not formal contraindications [^1115tvee] [^115Zc8Fx] [^114QB8L5] [^115N882Y].

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and context. Tylenol is acetaminophen, available as single-ingredient oral and rectal OTC/prescription products, an IV formulation (Ofirmev), and in numerous fixed-dose combinations, most notably with opioids such as oxycodone/acetaminophen and hydrocodone/acetaminophen; these contexts matter because some contraindications are formulation- or co-ingredient–specific rather than intrinsic to acetaminophen itself [^1115tvee] [^115Zc8Fx] [^114QB8L5].

> Now, I should enumerate true absolute contraindications for acetaminophen as a molecule and verify them against FDA labeling. First, known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or any product excipients is an absolute contraindication, with serious cutaneous adverse reactions (e.g. SJS/TEN) and anaphylaxis reported, so prior severe allergy or severe cutaneous reaction mandates avoidance and immediate discontinuation if it occurs again [^115Zc8Fx] [^115HJLZ1] [^115bQ5cG]. Second, hold on, I should verify hepatic disease language carefully before I overgeneralize: the IV acetaminophen label explicitly contraindicates use in severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease, and also specifies not to use in Child-Pugh C cirrhosis, which constitutes a true absolute contraindication for the IV formulation; oral labeling emphasizes hepatotoxicity warnings and dose ceiling rather than a universal "contraindication", but in clinical practice we avoid acetaminophen in severe hepatic failure and restrict dose in milder disease, so the strict "contraindication" applies at least to IV in Child-Pugh C and severe active liver disease [^115Zc8Fx] [^114Gxxiq] [^115HJLZ1].

> Next, I should review high-risk conditions that require caution rather than categorical avoidance, and I need to ensure I separate warnings from formal contraindications. The IV label highlights that hepatic impairment (mild to moderate), active hepatic disease short of severe, chronic alcohol use, chronic malnutrition or prolonged fasting, severe hypovolemia, and severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) increase risk and warrant dose reduction, careful monitoring, or avoidance if risks outweigh benefits, but they are not absolute contraindications to acetaminophen per se; these risks reflect increased susceptibility to hepatotoxicity or hypotension with IV infusion in hypovolemia rather than a binary prohibition [^115HJLZ1] [^113fk4Vk]. Wait, let me verify renal dosing consistency because I do not want to overstate it: multiple FDA SPL sources note no dose adjustment is required in a wide renal function range, and use is acceptable even with intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy, which supports that renal impairment is a caution rather than a formal contraindication for acetaminophen when dosed carefully, particularly outside of the IV product's specific warnings [^112RxA2v] [^1134KyMb] [^111G5Mgj].

> I will now examine combination product–specific contraindications, because these are frequently overlooked and pertain to the co-ingredient rather than acetaminophen. For oxycodone/acetaminophen and similar opioid–acetaminophen combinations, they are contraindicated in significant respiratory depression, in acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting, in known or suspected GI obstruction (including paralytic ileus), and in hypersensitivity to either component; these are true absolute contraindications derived from the opioid label and apply regardless of acetaminophen's intrinsic profile [^113kyx7J] [^114QB8L5]. But wait, what if the combination uses butalbital with acetaminophen rather than an opioid? In that case, products containing butalbital are contraindicated in patients with porphyria and in those with hypersensitivity to any component, again a combination-driven contraindication and not intrinsic to acetaminophen itself [^113XfpR4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "dose-related contraindications". Exceeding the maximum daily dose is not a formal contraindication; it is a safety ceiling with boxed warnings due to risk of acute liver failure, transplant, and death. I should confirm the ceiling: do not exceed 4,000 mg/day total acetaminophen from all sources, and many labels or clinical protocols advise lower maxima (e.g., 3,000 mg/day) in higher-risk patients such as those with hepatic impairment or chronic alcohol use; policy changes also limited acetaminophen per opioid tablet to 325 mg to reduce inadvertent overdose, reflecting risk mitigation rather than a new contraindication [^115N882Y] [^115HJLZ1] [^115bmyVX] [^1179yguq] [^1121BgG2] [^116miCmv]. Let me reconsider the phrasing: the correct clinical takeaway is that dosing above recommended maxima constitutes misuse with major hepatotoxic risk, so it should be treated as an absolute "do not do", but technically it is not labeled as a contraindication term, which is important for accuracy in documentation and decision support [^115N882Y] [^1179yguq].

> Next, I should review serious skin and hypersensitivity signals because they often define future contraindications. Acetaminophen can rarely cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions including SJS/TEN and AGEP, and any prior severe hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or excipients renders future use contraindicated; fixed drug eruptions have been reported and can be perpetuated by inconsistent nomenclature, so confirming that "Tylenol" and "acetaminophen" are the same active is critical to prevent re-exposure and recurrence [^115HJLZ1] [^115bQ5cG] [^114SQhAf].

> I should double-check that the synthesis is coherent and clinically actionable. In summary, absolute contraindications include: known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or formulation components across all products, and for IV acetaminophen specifically, severe hepatic impairment or severe active liver disease including Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. Conditions requiring strong caution and risk mitigation (not absolute contraindications) include mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, chronic alcohol use, chronic malnutrition or prolonged fasting, and severe hypovolemia for IV use, with careful attention to total daily dose from all sources. For combination products, apply the co-ingredient's absolute contraindications, notably opioid-related respiratory depression, severe unmonitored asthma, and GI obstruction, and barbiturate-related porphyria, in addition to acetaminophen's own profile [^115Zc8Fx] [^114Gxxiq] [^115HJLZ1] [^113kyx7J] [^114QB8L5] [^113XfpR4]. Finally, I need to ensure I've emphasized universal dose ceilings: never exceed 4,000 mg/day total acetaminophen (and consider 3,000 mg/day in higher-risk patients), given the boxed hepatotoxicity warnings and epidemiologic and regulatory data supporting limits in combination products, and counsel patients explicitly to avoid duplicative acetaminophen across OTC and prescription medications to prevent unintentional overdose [^115N882Y] [^1179yguq] [^115bmyVX] [^1121BgG2] [^116miCmv].

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^112feXf7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, response to treatment, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].

Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, and adjust the dosage accordingly [see WARNINGS].

- **Patient access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose**: Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers). Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program).

Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or a prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of opioid therapy.

### Association of FDA mandate limiting acetaminophen (paracetamol) in prescription combination opioid products and subsequent hospitalizations and acute liver failure [^1121BgG2]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

In January 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a mandate to limit acetaminophen (paracetamol) to 325 mg per tablet in combination acetaminophen and opioid medications, with manufacturer compliance required by March 2014.

- **Objective**: To assess the odds of hospitalization and the proportion of acute liver failure (ALF) cases with acetaminophen and opioid toxicity before and after the mandate.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This interrupted time-series analysis utilized hospitalization data from 2007 to 2019, involving ICD-9/ICD-10 codes consistent with both acetaminophen and opioid toxicity from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), a large US hospitalization database. ALF cases from 1998 to 2019 involving acetaminophen and opioid products were gathered from the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG), a cohort of 32 US medical centers. For comparison, hospitalizations and ALF cases consistent with acetaminophen toxicity alone were extracted from the NIS and ALFSG.

- **Exposures**: Time periods before and after the FDA mandate limiting acetaminophen to 325 mg in combination acetaminophen and opioid products.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The study aimed to determine the odds of hospitalization involving acetaminophen and opioid toxicity and the percentage of ALF cases from acetaminophen and opioid products before and after the mandate.

- **Results**: In the NIS, among 474,047,585 hospitalizations from Q1 2007 through Q4 2019, there were 39,606 hospitalizations involving acetaminophen and opioid toxicity; 66.8% of cases were among women. The median age of affected individuals was 42.2 years (IQR, 28.4–54.1). In the ALFSG, from Q1 1998 through Q3 2019, cases involving both acetaminophen and opioid products were documented.

### Acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and hypertension [^112mKam5]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is widely regarded as a safe therapy for pain and fever in patients with cardiovascular disease and those taking anticoagulants. However, recent studies report that acetaminophen, like most other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, increases blood pressure, and a formulation containing sodium increases cardiovascular risk. These findings call into question guidelines recommending acetaminophen for patients with cardiovascular disease and pain, and those taking anticoagulants. We review evidence that acetaminophen has effects in common with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and its influence on coagulation via effects on vitamin K metabolism. Possible alternatives to acetaminophen for patients with pain are discussed.

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients — a multicenter randomized study [^113PQzDi]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen was purchased from a retail store (Extra Strength Tylenol® tablets, 500 mg per caplet; McNeil Consumer and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, Fort Washington, PA, USA). Placebo capsules contained granulated sugar. To maintain blinding, both placebo and acetaminophen doses were placed in identical pill casings and stored in uniquely coded individual bags by study personnel not involved in the evaluation or management of subjects.

---

### Xodol [^112dLHVD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

**Contraindications**: This product should not be administered to patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to hydrocodone or acetaminophen. Patients known to be hypersensitive to other opioids may exhibit cross sensitivity to hydrocodone.

### Emergency department patient knowledge concerning acetaminophen (paracetamol) in over-the-counter and prescription analgesics [^1174Ri8s]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate patient knowledge of the acetaminophen (paracetamol) content of commonly used pain medications and the maximum daily recommended dose of acetaminophen.

- **Methods**: A prospective, convenience sample of emergency department patients were enrolled. Data were recorded using a standardised questionnaire over 4 months.

- **Results**: A total of 1009 patients were enrolled. 492 patients (49%) did not know if Tylenol contained acetaminophen (paracetamol). The majority (66–90%) of patients did not know if Lortab, Vicodin, Percocet, non-aspirin pain reliever, ibuprofen, Motrin, or Advil contained acetaminophen. Additionally, 568 patients (56%) reported not knowing the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen, and only 71 patients (7%) reported the correct daily dose.

- **Conclusions**: Patient knowledge of the acetaminophen content of commonly used analgesic medications and its maximum recommended daily dose is limited. This may contribute to unintentional repeated supratherapeutic ingestion (RSTI) of acetaminophen, or overdose.

### Removal of opioid/acetaminophen combination prescription pain medications: Assessing the evidence for hepatotoxicity and consequences of removal of these medications [^116FuZRU]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Opioid/acetaminophen combination products are widely prescribed for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain. Acetaminophen, when improperly used, can lead to liver damage and even acute liver failure. In June 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended the elimination of prescription acetaminophen combination products because of the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of these medications. The FDA advisory committee reviewed numerous observational studies and adverse event reporting data.

- **Summary and epidemiologic critique**: This article provides a summary and critique of the studies and evidence reviewed by the FDA advisory committee.

- **Potential consequences**: It examines the potential consequences, such as poorly managed pain or a shift to treatment with other medications that have greater potential toxicity and/or restricted availability, if the FDA follows the advisory committee's vote.

- **Alternate strategies**: The article outlines alternate strategies the FDA should consider for reducing hepatotoxicity associated with opioid/acetaminophen combination products.

### Norco [^1179yguq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Boxed warning**: Hepatotoxicity

Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses exceeding 4000 milligrams per day and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product.

---

### Advice from professional societies: appropriate use of NSAIDs [^111sDVr2]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are some of the most commonly used medications due to their well-known analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic actions. Due to their known benefits and inherent risks, there have been multiple guidelines from national professional societies that suggest appropriate use to provide both maximum benefit and mitigate the risk of adverse events, particularly in older individuals.

- **Design**: A literature search was undertaken using PubMed with search terms including pain, aging, treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis, older patients, and guidelines. Reviews of practice guidelines were conducted from the following sources: the American Geriatric Society, the American College of Rheumatology, and the European League Against Rheumatism. These sources suggest appropriate and safer use of NSAIDs, along with references to guidelines produced by Osteoarthritis Research International and the American Gastroenterological Association.

- **Conclusions**: Literature-based and professional society guidelines provide clinicians with means to optimize the efficacy and safety of NSAIDs in clinical practice. Summary recommendations are provided in this review.

### Developing consumer-centered, nonprescription drug labeling a study in acetaminophen [^111uj7P6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

In the US, acetaminophen overdose has surpassed viral hepatitis as the leading cause of acute liver failure and contributes to more than 30,000 hospitalizations annually. Half to two-thirds of acetaminophen overdoses are unintentional, suggesting the root cause is likely poor understanding of medication labeling or failure to recognize the consequences of exceeding the recommended maximum daily dosage.

- **Purpose**: Elicit subject feedback about active ingredient and dosing information on over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and elicit feedback on proposed plain-language text and icons.

- **Methods**: Six focus groups, preceded by individual interviews, were conducted in April 2010 among 45 adults in two cities from two clinics and an adult basic education center. The individual interviews evaluated knowledge of OTC pain relievers, attention to product label information, and literacy level, while the group discussion elicited preferences for label messages and icons. Analyses were conducted from April to June 2010.

- **Results**: Forty-four percent read at or below the 6th-grade level. Individual interviews revealed that less than 50% of participants routinely examine product label information. Only 31% know acetaminophen is in Tylenol®. The groups reached a consensus on a preferred icon for acetaminophen and expressed a desire for an explicit statement of potential liver damage in the warning against simultaneous use of acetaminophen products. They also indicated a preference for an icon and wording for the maximum dose.

- **Conclusions**: With the high prevalence of OTC use, a consumer-centered approach to develop comprehensible drug labeling is critical in mitigating the risk of unintentional overdose.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^115ozYHB]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and implementing a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects. Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects.

- **Cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs**: For example, celecoxib must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs.

If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions, such as tapentadol, are also an option.

There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Due to the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.

### Acetylcysteine for paracetamol: Will one size ever fit all [^116HCEvd]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The 2-bag regimen is not without its own controversy. Clearly, for most patients, this simplification will likely reduce adverse events and interruptions. Can more be done? If survival is the only desired outcome, the 2-bag regimen will succeed as no therapy and virtually any NAC therapy will suffice for most patients. For some, however, reductions in rates of hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure, and intensive care unit utilization are more meaningful endpoints. Unfortunately, small non-randomized studies are unlikely to address these outcomes.

Readers are reminded that the original definition of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity was an ALT or AST over 1000 U/L. Although somewhat arbitrary, this definition is valuable since historical patients with lower peak aminotransferases uniformly did well with no therapy at all. While patients with elevated aminotransferases that remain below 1000 U/L must have hepatic injury, this endpoint is likely inconsequential. Although, for many clinicians, it triggers continued NAC therapy, that decision may be arbitrary.

Most concerning are patients with very high APAP concentrations who might benefit from the high initial NAC concentrations delivered by the standard IV protocol. Until this group is studied in randomized controlled trials using patient-centered definitions of hepatotoxicity, it is premature to universally adopt the 2-bag regimen. That being said, the work by Wong and colleagues represents a significant advance that could benefit the vast majority of APAP-poisoned patients.

### Ofirmev (acetaminophen) [^115HJLZ1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

- **Hepatic injury**: Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Overdosage (10)]. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. The maximum recommended daily dose includes all routes and acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products. Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with hepatic impairment, active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g. due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

- **Serious skin reactions**: Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and the use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

- **Risk of medication errors**: Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Ofirmev (acetaminophen) Injection to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused.

### Incidence of side effects associated with acetaminophen in people aged 65 years or more: A prospective cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [^111UEPau]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

Almost all clinical guidelines advocate acetaminophen as the first-line oral pharmacological treatment for pain due to osteoarthritis (OA), mainly because of its perceived safety over other oral analgesics. However, recent studies have raised concerns that acetaminophen may not be as safe as previously thought.

- **Significance & innovations**:
	- Acetaminophen is a relatively weak analgesic but has been recommended as the first-line oral analgesic, especially in older people, largely because of its perceived safety. However, this study shows a significant incidence of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects in older individuals prescribed acetaminophen repeatedly in the United Kingdom. Although the incidence may be lower, the side effect profile aligns with that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, reflecting the now-recognized COX inhibitory effect of acetaminophen. These findings support reconsideration of acetaminophen as an oral analgesic by guideline development groups who currently recommend its repeated prescription for long-term conditions such as osteoarthritis.

Acetaminophen can cause cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent side effects analogous to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK highlighted this concern over the safety of acetaminophen in its 2014 updated guidance on the management of OA and no longer recommends acetaminophen as a regular treatment in the 2022 update.

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^1176HSdV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapy. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is also important to consider. This update to the original 2003 review includes nine additional RCTs.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, Arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (up to July 2005), EMBASE (2002-July 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ACP Journal Club, DARE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all from 1994 to July 2005). Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand-searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Pain, physical function, and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMD). Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk (RR), and the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated.

- **Main results**: Fifteen RCTs involving 5986 participants were included in this review. Seven RCTs compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten RCTs compared acetaminophen to NSAIDs.

### Intravenous acetaminophen does not reduce morphine use for pain relief in emergency department patients: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1153aps8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

We are aware that this study has its limitations. First, we included patients presenting with pain of different origin, location, and quality. It is possible that acetaminophen may have morphine-sparing potential in certain subgroups, as has been shown in postoperative patients. However, our group size was too small to perform subgroup analyses.

Second, we only included patients at two sites, both in academic emergency departments in cities with a similar population. External validity is therefore limited. Third, we did not include patients with mild to moderate pain, but rather with severe pain (around 8/10 on the NRS) and administered about 12 mg (or 0.15 mg/kg) of morphine for pain relief. Totally administered doses of about 16 mg (or 0.2 mg/kg) within 4 hours could be considered high. However, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg has been shown to lack an effect in most emergency department patients. Doses of 0.15 mg/kg have been shown to be statistically — but not clinically — superior. We can only speculate whether results might be similar in patients with less pain or in other locations (about half of our patients suffered from abdominal or flank pain).

Fourth, we had a number of exclusion criteria, particularly previous analgesia, and were therefore only able to recruit about 5% of all patients presenting during the daytime, in spite of extensive screening. We did not screen at night, which could also cause an inclusion bias, as patients presenting at night could be different.

Fifth, despite a nonsignificant difference in the two groups, the lower CI in the acetaminophen group in the time-to-pain-relief analysis could theorize effects worth investigating further.

### The use of intravenous acetaminophen for acute pain in the emergency department [^115DJkby]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is a mainstay for pain management worldwide. The intravenous (IV) formulation has been widely used in Europe for more than 20 years in adults and children. In the United States, IV APAP obtained full approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. There is emerging literature to suggest the use of IV APAP for pain reduction in the emergency department (ED). This evidence-based review examines the evidence pertaining to the use of IV APAP for acute pain control in the ED.

- **Methods**: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that described or evaluated the use of IV APAP for acute pain in the ED were included. Duplicate articles, unpublished reports, abstracts, review articles, and non-English literature were excluded. The primary outcome of interest in this review was the difference in pain score between IV APAP and active comparator or placebo from baseline to a cutoff time specified in the original trials. Secondary outcome measures were the incidence of adverse events and reduction in the amount of adjuvant analgesics consumed by patients who received IV APAP. Methodologic quality of the trials was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria.

- **Results**: Fourteen RCTs with various methodologic flaws, which enrolled a total of 1,472 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The level of evidence for the individual trials ranged from very low to moderate. In three of the 14 trials, a significant reduction in pain scores was observed in patients who…

### Acetaminophen and asthma [^115XKCSK]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is a widely used medication for the treatment of pain and fever in children and pregnant women. There is substantial epidemiological evidence in adults and children indicating that acetaminophen use is associated with asthma symptoms. Additionally, there is a considerable body of evidence supporting a modest but consistent association between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and early infancy and the development of asthma in later childhood. This relationship remains robust after adjustments for a broad range of potential confounding factors and, in some studies, shows clear evidence of a dose-dependent association. However, the possibility of confounding by indication has been a persistent concern. Nonetheless, the epidemiological evidence is compelling, highlighting the need to establish causation to develop appropriate advice and interventions for children at risk of asthma. This necessitates randomized trials of analgesics and antipyretics, including acetaminophen, in various clinical settings.

### Relation of health literacy to exceeding the labeled maximum daily dose of acetaminophen [^116aq4Hx]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic/antipyretic; overdoses can lead to liver damage. Little is known about the relationship between health literacy and exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose of 4 grams.

- **Methods**: Subjects were recruited at 23 U.S. malls in 2011. Health literacy was measured by the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), classified as very low (VLL, score ≤ 60). Participants completed a 7-day acetaminophen use diary via daily telephone interview. An exit interview covered demographics, physical/mental health, medical history, medication label reading, and medication-taking knowledge/attitudes. Acetaminophen products were identified from a comprehensive list; subjects were not required to know their medications contained acetaminophen. Seven hundred fifty-six subjects aged ≥ 18 years had taken acetaminophen in the past 30 days and completed 7 diary days with at least one day of acetaminophen use, plus the exit survey. Analysis was conducted between 2012 and 2014.

- **Results**: VLL individuals were more likely than those with adequate literacy (AL) to exceed 4 grams on at least one day (OR [95% CI] = 3.8 [1.5, 9.6]; 4.0 [1.3, 12] after controlling for five REALM score-related factors). On usage days, VLL individuals were also more likely to exceed 4 grams (3.3 [1.1, 10], by generalized estimating equations; 2.4 [0.9, 6.6], direct effect after accounting for mediation by other deviations from label recommendations).

- **Conclusions**: VLL individuals exceed the recommended maximum acetaminophen dose more often than AL individuals. Other identified characteristics related to health literacy also influenced acetaminophen usage patterns.

### Tylenol or acetaminophen: A recurrent fixed drug eruption perpetuated through the use of inconsistent drug terminology [^114SQhAf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

An 87-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis presented with worsening knee pain. He was prescribed acetaminophen with codeine. A few days later, he developed a rash on his right buttock and proximal thigh, similar to a rash he experienced in the past when he took over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen and an unknown lozenge to treat a presumed viral illness. A fixed drug eruption (FDE) was diagnosed, and the patient was asked to avoid Tylenol and other OTC lozenges. Tylenol was entered as an allergy in the electronic medical records. However, since Tylenol, not acetaminophen, was listed in the allergy profile, the order for acetaminophen and codeine did not generate an alert for the prescribing physician. Additionally, the dispensing pharmacist did not question the prescribing physician, and the patient, unaware that acetaminophen in the pain medication is the same drug as Tylenol, took it and developed recurrent FDE.

### Interventions for paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose [^112vKcRF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most widely used non-prescription analgesic in the world and is commonly taken in overdose either deliberately or unintentionally. In high-income countries, paracetamol toxicity is a prevalent cause of acute liver injury. Various interventions exist to treat paracetamol poisoning, depending on the clinical status of the individual. These include inhibiting the absorption of paracetamol from the gastrointestinal tract (decontamination), removal of paracetamol from the vascular system, and antidotes to either prevent the formation of or detoxify metabolites.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of interventions for paracetamol overdosage, irrespective of the cause of the overdose.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (January 2017), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2017), Embase (1974 to January 2017), and Science Citation Index Expanded (1900 to January 2017). Additionally, we searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov database (US National Institute of Health) for any ongoing or completed trials as of January 2017. Reference lists of relevant papers identified by the search and other published reviews were also examined.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized clinical trials assessing the benefits and harms of interventions in individuals who have ingested a paracetamol overdose. The interventions could have included gastric lavage, ipecacuanha, activated charcoal, or various extracorporeal treatments.

### Evaluation of dosing strategies of N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity in patients greater than 100 kilograms: Should the dosage cap be used [^115uP552]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2021). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is a commonly used analgesic and antipyretic, with the potential to cause significant injury when ingested in toxic amounts. Although the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is available, evidence supporting dose recommendations for patients weighing over 100 kg is lacking. We performed a retrospective, multi-center analysis to determine if a capped NAC dosing scheme is similar to a non-capped dosing scheme in patients weighing over 100 kg.

- **Methods**: Between January 2009 and January 2016, we identified patients presenting to 12 different centers who were evaluated for acetaminophen poisoning treatment. Patients must have weighed greater than 100 kg and were evaluated and identified as needing treatment for acetaminophen-related poisoning with NAC. The primary outcome was the occurrence of hepatic injury, defined as an AST or ALT ≥ 100 IU/L. Secondary endpoints included the number of drug-related adverse events, occurrence of hepatotoxicity, cumulative NAC dose, regimen cost, length of hospital and intensive care unit stays, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Results**: There were 83 patients identified as meeting the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. A capped NAC dosing scheme resulted in no difference in hepatic injury when compared to a non-capped regimen (49.4% vs 50%, p = 1.000). The capped dosage regimen was associated with a lower cumulative dose (285.2 mg/kg vs 304.6 mg/kg, p < 0.001) and cost. No other statistically significant differences were identified among the secondary endpoints.

A capped NAC dosing scheme was not associated

### Acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid exposure in a preterm infant after maternal overdose [^113fpaKV]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Low credibility.

Here, we review the case of a 26 1/7 weeks' gestation premature female infant born to a mother who intentionally ingested a large quantity of Tylenol, aspirin, quetiapine, and prenatal vitamins. The neonate subsequently had markedly elevated levels of both Tylenol and aspirin when checked on the first day of life. While overall clinically stable, the neonate did demonstrate coagulopathy as evidenced by abnormal coagulation studies. Both poison control and a pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist were consulted. She successfully tolerated a course of N-acetylcysteine; her subsequent Tylenol level was markedly decreased, and the neonate exhibited no further effects of toxicity. The salicylate level decreased on its own accord. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a neonate at 26 weeks' gestation that has been successfully managed for supratherapeutic concentrations of acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid secondary to maternal ingestion. While rare, this case may serve as a reference for the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine in premature infants in such instances.

### Chronic acetaminophen toxicity: A case report and review of the literature [^112gfwoG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen is one of the most frequently used medications in the United States. While the usual dosing of acetaminophen is considered harmless, both acute and chronic overdoses can be fatal. The majority of reported cases of chronic acetaminophen toxicity in adults occur in chronic alcohol abusers, patients taking P450-inducing medications, or following massive dosing. We describe a case of toxic hepatitis free of the aforementioned risk factors associated with chronic ingestion of moderately excessive doses of acetaminophen. Our patient ingested approximately 5.0 to 6.5 g of acetaminophen daily for 6 to 8 weeks via multiple medications. The inclusion of acetaminophen in numerous medications, combined with the frequency of use of acetaminophen, necessitates an increased concern for not only acute but also chronic acetaminophen toxicity.

Employ other supportive measures, including oxygen and vasopressors, in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.

- **Opioid antagonists**: Naloxone and similar medications are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer an additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

- **Physical dependence considerations**: In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### Acetadote [^1167ywi1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Determine the need for continued treatment with Acetadote after the loading dose. Choose one of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration:

- **The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible treatment line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1)**: Continue Acetadote treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

- **The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained**: Continue Acetadote treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of either two or three separate doses over an infusion time of 20 or 21 hours, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

- **For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the "possible" treatment line (see Figure 1) and time of ingestion is known, and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion**: Discontinue Acetadote.

- **The acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but the time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours**: Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue Acetadote treatment. If there is any uncertainty as to the patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course.

### Oral analgesics for acute nonspecific pain [^1165k5m9]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Physicians most often recommend or prescribe oral medication for relief of acute pain. This review of the available evidence supports the use of acetaminophen in doses up to 1,000 mg as the initial choice for mild to moderate acute pain. In some cases, modest improvements in analgesic efficacy can be achieved by adding or changing to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The safest NSAID is ibuprofen in doses of 400 mg. Higher doses may offer somewhat greater analgesia but with more adverse effects. Other NSAIDs have failed to demonstrate consistently greater efficacy or safety than ibuprofen. Although they may be more expensive, these alternatives may be chosen for their more convenient dosing.

Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide equivalent efficacy to traditional NSAIDs but lack a demonstrable safety advantage for the treatment of acute pain. For more severe acute pain, the evidence supports the addition of oral narcotic medications such as hydrocodone, morphine, or oxycodone. Specific oral analgesics that have shown poor efficacy and side effects include codeine, propoxyphene, and tramadol.

### Acetaminophen for osteoarthritis [^111iD7PK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Published guidelines and expert opinions are divided over the relative roles of acetaminophen (also called paracetamol or Tylenol) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line pharmacologic therapies. The comparative safety of acetaminophen and NSAIDs is crucial to consider, as NSAIDs have the potential for serious gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicities. Acetaminophen, in high dosages (greater than or equal to 2 grams per day), may also pose a risk for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus NSAIDs (ibuprofen, arthrotec, celecoxib, naproxen, rofecoxib) for treating OA.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (up to July 2002), and Contents (up to March 2002) were searched. Reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles were also hand-searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in OA were considered for inclusion.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Pain, physical function, and global assessment outcomes were reported. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk, and the number needed to treat was calculated.

- **Main results**: Six RCTs and 1,689 participants were included in the review. One study compared acetaminophen to a placebo.

### Acetylcysteine [^115LH7SF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Determine the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine after the loading dose. Choose **one** of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration:

- **Acetaminophen concentration above toxicity line**:
	- If the acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram (see Figure 1), continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

- **Acetaminophen concentration unavailable**:
	- If the acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained, continue acetylcysteine treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment.

- **Acetaminophen concentration below toxicity line**:
	- For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the "possible" toxicity line (see Figure 1) and the time of ingestion is known, and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, discontinue acetylcysteine.

- **Non-toxic concentration but unknown ingestion time**:
	- If the acetaminophen concentration was in the non-toxic range, but the time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours, obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient's clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine treatment. If there is any uncertainty regarding the patient's risk of developing hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course.

- **Continued therapy after completion of loading and maintenance doses**:
	- In cases of suspected massive overdose, or with concomitant ingestion of other medications/toxins, consider additional therapy or monitoring.

### Antipyretic efficacy of an initial 30-mg/kg loading dose of acetaminophen versus a 15-mg/kg maintenance dose [^117KQKEc]. Pediatrics (2001). High credibility.

To compare the antipyretic efficacy of an initial 30-mg/kg acetaminophen loading dose versus a 15-mg/kg maintenance dose, a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial was conducted. A total of 121 febrile, but otherwise healthy, outpatients aged 4 months to 9 years and weighing between 4 to 26 kg were randomly assigned to one of the dose groups: 15 mg/kg (n = 62) and 30 mg/kg (n = 59).

In an "intention to treat" analysis, the time to achieve a temperature lower than 38.5 degrees C was significantly shorter in the 30-mg/kg group compared to the 15-mg/kg group (110 ± 94 minutes vs. 139 ± 113 minutes). The maximum temperature decrease was also significantly higher in the 30-mg/kg group than in the 15-mg/kg group (2.3 ± 0.7 degrees C vs. 1.7 ± 0.6 degrees C). Additionally, the duration of maintaining a rectal temperature below 38.5 degrees C was significantly longer in the 30-mg/kg group compared to the 15-mg/kg group (250 ± 92 minutes vs. 185 ± 121 minutes). Adverse events were reported in six children in the 30-mg/kg group compared to five in the 15-mg/kg group (including hyperthermia, hypothermia, and vomiting), but the difference was not statistically significant.

These findings suggest that an initial 30-mg/kg acetaminophen loading dose is more effective at reducing fever than a 15-mg/kg maintenance dose, without differences in clinical tolerance. This data indicates that acetaminophen treatment for fever may be more efficient when administered initially as a loading dose.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^112v8aUY]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acetaminophen overdose:

- **Definition**: Acetaminophen overdose is defined as the ingestion of a dose of acetaminophen that exceeds the recommended limit, typically greater than 4 grams within a 24-hour period or excessive doses over several days.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acetaminophen overdose involves its action as a dose-dependent hepatotoxin, causing acute pericentral liver injury. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in overdose situations, its toxic metabolite can cause hepatocellular necrosis. In some cases, renal insufficiency can also occur, attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney.

- **Epidemiology**: In 2021, US poison control centers recorded over 80,000 cases related to acetaminophen products. The incidence of acetaminophen overdose in Iceland is estimated at 16 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of acetaminophen overdose can include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, mental status changes. Hepatotoxicity is indicated by elevated liver enzymes, and in severe cases, it can lead to acute liver failure, characterized by encephalopathy and coagulopathy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The severity of liver damage, as indicated by laboratory tests such as serum transaminases and coagulation profile, is a key determinant of prognosis. The prognosis in acetaminophen-related acute liver failure is related to the degree of encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and acidosis.
