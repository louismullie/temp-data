## Question

Lifestyle modification for type 1 diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step discussion on lifestyle modification for type 1 diabetes, preserving natural self-verification language and any initial missteps with subsequent corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about foundational education and psychosocial readiness. Then, I should review medical nutrition therapy and carbohydrate management. Next, I will examine physical activity prescription and exercise-related glucose strategies. After that, I need to integrate weight management, cardiovascular risk reduction, and technology. Finally, I should consider special populations, barriers and behavior change, and monitoring and evaluation with continuous quality improvement [^113SLi6X].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: lifestyle modification in type 1 diabetes is an adjunct to, not a substitute for, physiologic insulin therapy and continuous glucose monitoring; it must be grounded in structured diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) delivered by qualified professionals, ideally including a registered dietitian nutritionist with diabetes expertise and a certified diabetes care and education specialist, with content tailored to individual numeracy, literacy, culture, and life stage [^115dH2RA] [^117J9XDK] [^113SLi6X].

> Wait, let me verify the initial claim that structured education is "mandatory for all patients" because that sounds too absolute; the ADA 2025 Standards state that DSMES should be offered to all patients with diabetes, which is a strong recommendation rather than a universal mandate, and many patients do not receive or attend these programs due to access and engagement barriers, so I should correct that wording to "recommended for all" while acknowledging real-world implementation gaps [^115dH2RA] [^111cNmSW].

> I need to ensure that DSMES curricula are comprehensive and actionable: education must include insulin-to-carb matching for meals and corrections, hypoglycemia prevention and treatment, sick-day management, and exercise-related insulin and carbohydrate adjustments; in pediatrics, family-centered, age-appropriate content and hypoglycemia training are essential, and programs like TELSA demonstrate that culturally adapted, peer-supported education can be effective [^112KrFgn] [^115bEMp8] [^114K4bB5] [^1117e6iR].

> Next, I should review medical nutrition therapy (MNT) principles and avoid overpromising any single diet pattern; the ADA emphasizes individualized meal plans with high-nutrient-quality foods and moderation of saturated fat, refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultraprocessed foods, and there is no one-size-fits-all macronutrient distribution, so MNT should be personalized to preferences, metabolic goals, and insulin strategy [^115xCM8Y] [^112U4mYL].

> Hold on, I should verify carbohydrate guidance carefully; for patients using fixed insulin doses, consistent timing and amount of carbohydrates relative to insulin action reduces hypoglycemia and improves glycemic predictability, whereas for flexible regimens, education on carbohydrate counting and, for advanced users, fat and protein dosing improves outcomes and quality of life, and fiber intake should be emphasized with minimally processed, nutrient-dense sources when possible [^1115sGsZ] [^116AadwB] [^114U2RBS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "low-carbohydrate diets are universally recommended for adults with type 1 diabetes"; I should double-check that. The ADA notes that reducing overall carbohydrate intake can improve glycemia in some adults and may be applied within various eating patterns to meet individual needs, but evidence remains heterogeneous and should be individualized, especially in patients using SGLT-2 inhibitors where ketogenic eating patterns should be avoided due to euglycemic ketoacidosis risk [^116xJviG] [^112ZTe93].

> I will now examine beverage guidance; sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juices, should be replaced with water or low/no-calorie options, and while nonnutritive sweeteners can be used short term in moderation, water remains the preferred choice; for fasting periods, plans should be individualized to mitigate hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis risk [^114DSCkd] [^111p5QAi] [^112DpMEF].

> Let me think about physical activity next; most adults with type 1 diabetes should aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity spread over at least three days, with resistance training 2–3 times per week on nonconsecutive days, and interrupting prolonged sitting every 30 minutes improves glucose control; individualized assessment for cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications should guide modifications and supervision [^111mhGyA] [^1143VN5G] [^1146bFLN] [^116Y5DsP].

> But wait, what if the patient fears hypoglycemia during exercise; I need to ensure a pragmatic, evidence-based approach: check pre-exercise glucose and have simple carbohydrates available, adjust pre-exercise insulin and/or consume additional carbohydrates as needed, monitor during and after activity, and consider reducing overnight basal insulin after intense exercise to mitigate delayed hypoglycemia; these strategies should be rehearsed and documented in the care plan [^113KgcEQ] [^114K4bB5].

> I should confirm weight management guidance in type 1 diabetes; excess weight is increasingly common and insulin therapy can promote weight gain, so when indicated, aim for at least 3–7% weight loss using nutrition, activity, and behavioral therapy within a personalized framework, with caution in older adults to avoid sarcopenia and nutrient deficits, and in those on weight-loss pharmacotherapy or metabolic surgery, emphasize muscle-strengthening exercise to preserve lean mass [^111vgt32] [^114EobXK] [^113HcU4H].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular risk modification; even though most outcome trials are in type 2 diabetes, ADA recommends lifestyle therapy to improve lipids and reduce ASCVD risk: weight loss when indicated, Mediterranean or DASH patterns, reduced saturated and trans fats, higher omega-3s, viscous fiber, and plant stanols/sterols, alongside at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity; blood pressure targets and lifestyle interventions follow the same population principles [^116WUZhE] [^113Fo82z] [^112HQytv].

> I need to check implementation supports; MNT should be delivered by a registered dietitian when feasible, but where access is limited, team-based care with nurse-led or primary-care–delivered counseling can still be effective if guided by a dietitian; given persistent gaps, clinicians should advocate for DSMES coverage and consider telehealth and digital tools to extend reach and reinforce behavior change [^117J9XDK] [^111cNmSW] [^111zWk5W].

> Let me consider technology integration; continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended early for most adults with type 1 diabetes to improve time-in-range and reduce hypoglycemia, and automated insulin delivery can further optimize outcomes; for exercise, emerging digital tools and apps can deliver individualized insulin and carbohydrate guidance before, during, and after activity, addressing a commonly cited unmet need [^115dH2RA] [^113CYQFo].

> I should confirm special population considerations; in older adults, prioritize adequate protein intake, balance weight loss with sarcopenia risk, and align activity to ability with strength, balance, and flexibility training; in pediatrics, family-based DSMES, school coordination, and hypoglycemia training are essential; for women contemplating pregnancy, preconception counseling on glycemic optimization and nutrition is critical to reduce congenital anomalies and maternal complications [^113PbLAE] [^111RgJHS] [^115b4Xch].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about barriers; fear of hypoglycemia, lack of exercise knowledge, limited dietitian access, and competing priorities are common, so motivational interviewing, teach-back, and small, achievable action steps paired to routines improve adherence; peer support and culturally tailored programs can enhance engagement, and digital nudges may sustain behavior over time [^113n3XE1] [^1117e6iR] [^116hYE5i].

> I should double-check monitoring and follow-up cadence; insulin plans and lifestyle behaviors should be reassessed every 3–6 months, with continuous data review from CGM and home logs, periodic labs for lipids and blood pressure, and use of validated tools for diabetes distress and disordered eating risk; this supports iterative adjustment and early detection of safety issues or adherence barriers [^115dH2RA] [^113Fo82z].

> Let me reconsider the overarching synthesis to ensure coherence: lifestyle modification in type 1 diabetes is a dynamic, patient-centered process anchored in DSMES, supported by MNT, and enabled by physical activity, weight and cardiometabolic risk management, and technology; it requires anticipatory guidance for special situations like exercise and fasting, proactive behavior-change strategies, and equitable access to multidisciplinary care, all aimed at improving time-in-range, reducing complications, and enhancing quality of life [^113SLi6X] [^117J9XDK] [^111mhGyA].

---

Lifestyle modification is essential in type 1 diabetes to **improve glycemic control** [^115dH2RA], reduce complications, and enhance quality of life [^113CYQFo]. The key elements are **individualized medical nutrition therapy** (carbohydrate counting, consistent intake, and nutrient-dense foods) [^117J9XDK] [^115xCM8Y], regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic plus resistance training) [^111mhGyA] [^1143VN5G], and weight management to achieve 3–7% weight loss when overweight or obese [^111vgt32]. Additional measures include smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, stress management, and adequate sleep [^112HQytv] [^116D3SEu]. These interventions should be **coordinated with insulin therapy** [^115dH2RA] and glucose monitoring [^117Lm1F5] to minimize hypoglycemia and optimize outcomes [^113P6ySw].

---

## Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)

MNT is a cornerstone of T1D management, **individualized to preferences, culture, and insulin regimen** [^117J9XDK] [^112U4mYL]:

- **Carbohydrate counting**: Essential for matching insulin to intake and improving glycemic control [^115dH2RA] [^112iddPi].
- **Consistent carbohydrate intake**: Regular timing and amounts reduce hypoglycemia and improve glycemia [^1115sGsZ].
- **Nutrient-dense foods**: Emphasize nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, lean proteins, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and low-fat dairy [^115xCM8Y].
- **Limit added sugars and refined grains**: Minimize sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains [^114DSCkd].
- **Fiber intake**: Aim for ≥ 14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal [^114U2RBS].
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men) with food and hydration [^112iddPi].

---

## Physical activity

Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health, and quality of life [^113CYQFo]; **individualize to fitness and glycemic targets** [^111mhGyA] [^113KgcEQ]:

- **Aerobic activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous activity, spread over ≥ 3 days [^111mhGyA].
- **Resistance training**: 2–3 sessions/week on nonconsecutive days [^1143VN5G].
- **Break sedentary time**: Interrupt sitting every 30 minutes [^1146bFLN].
- **Hypoglycemia prevention**: Educate on pre-, during, and post-exercise glucose management and carry fast-acting carbs [^113KgcEQ] [^114K4bB5].

---

## Weight management

Weight management is critical, as obesity increases insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk; **aim for 3–7% weight loss** in those with overweight/obesity using nutrition, activity, and behavior therapy [^111vgt32] [^111RLmLv]. For those on weight-loss pharmacotherapy or surgery, emphasize muscle-strengthening exercise to **preserve lean mass** [^113HcU4H].

---

## Smoking cessation and alcohol moderation

Smoking cessation is essential to reduce cardiovascular and microvascular risk [^113oaQeM], and **alcohol should be used in moderation** with attention to hypoglycemia risk and hydration [^112iddPi].

---

## Stress management and sleep

Stress management reduces diabetes distress and improves adherence; consider mindfulness, relaxation, and counseling, and **aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep nightly** to support glycemic control and overall health [^notfound].

---

## Integration with insulin therapy and glucose monitoring

Lifestyle measures must be coordinated with insulin and glucose monitoring to balance glycemia and hypoglycemia risk [^115dH2RA]. Provide education on **matching insulin to carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake**, and adjust doses for activity and concurrent glycemia [^112KrFgn] [^116AadwB]. Use structured education for hypoglycemia prevention and treatment [^115bEMp8].

---

## Special considerations

- **Older adults**: Emphasize adequate protein, resistance training, and fall prevention [^113PbLAE] [^114EobXK].
- **Children and adolescents**: Address growth, development, and family engagement [^111RgJHS] [^112iddPi].
- **Pregnancy**: Optimize preconception and perinatal glycemic control with individualized MNT [^notfound].

---

Lifestyle modification in T1D requires **individualized, sustained interventions** in nutrition, activity, weight, and behavior, integrated with insulin therapy and glucose monitoring to improve outcomes and quality of life [^113SLi6X].

### Exercise management in type 1 diabetes: a consensus statement [^113P6ySw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a challenging condition to manage for various physiological and behavioural reasons. Regular exercise is important, but management of different forms of physical activity is particularly difficult for both the individual with type 1 diabetes and the health-care provider. People with type 1 diabetes tend to be at least as inactive as the general population, with a large percentage of individuals not maintaining a healthy body mass nor achieving the minimum amount of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week. Regular exercise can improve health and wellbeing, and can help individuals to achieve their target lipid profile, body composition, and fitness and glycaemic goals. However, several additional barriers to exercise can exist for a person with diabetes, including fear of hypoglycaemia, loss of glycaemic control, and inadequate knowledge around exercise management. This Review provides an up-to-date consensus on exercise management for individuals with type 1 diabetes who exercise regularly, including glucose targets for safe and effective exercise, and nutritional and insulin dose adjustments to protect against exercise-related glucose excursions.

### Understanding the increasing prevalence of obesity in patients with type 1 diabetes: strategies for improving clinical care [^112itm8v]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The presence of excess weight is no longer a distinguishing feature between patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Obesity treatment in patients with T2D improves glycemic control and reduces or even eliminates medication burden. Robust evidence and clear guidelines exist to support and direct effective weight management in patients with T2DM. Now, however, rates of obesity in patients with T1D rival those found in the general population, yet little is known about the efficacy, safety, and unique considerations of obesity treatment (lifestyle modifications, pharmacology, and surgery) in this population. This review tackles these topics and the gaps in evidence and clinical care.

### Obesity in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiology, clinical impact, and mechanisms [^111RLmLv]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in people with type 1 diabetes in recent years. Although obesity has long been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and a catalyst for complications, much less is known about the role of obesity in the initiation and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity contributes to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiometabolic complications in type 1 diabetes. Unique therapeutic strategies may be required to address these comorbidities within the context of intensive insulin therapy, which promotes weight gain. There is an urgent need for clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of obesity in type 1 diabetes. The development of these recommendations will require a transdisciplinary research strategy addressing metabolism, molecular mechanisms, lifestyle, neuropsychology, and novel therapeutics. In this review, the prevalence, clinical impact, energy balance physiology, and potential mechanisms of obesity in type 1 diabetes are described, with a special focus on the substantial gaps in knowledge in this field. Our goal is to provide a framework for the evidence base needed to develop type 1 diabetes-specific weight management recommendations that account for the competing outcomes of glycemic control and weight management.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

### Matching diabetes treatment and lifestyle [^11526jTu]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

Strict glycaemic control reduces the likelihood of complications in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, achieving such control as part of normal daily life can be difficult and may be further complicated by changes to daily routine. Here we highlight key ways of achieving good control without unduly restricting the patient's day-to-day activities. We also discuss the impact exercise, travel, changes in working patterns, and fasting can have on diabetic control and consider what practical advice healthcare professionals can offer to individuals facing such lifestyle changes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Establishment of a type 1 diabetes structured education programme suitable for Chinese patients: type 1 diabetes education in lifestyle and self adjustment (TELSA) [^1117e6iR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Various guidelines recommend that all adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) should be offered an evidence based, structured education programme (SEP) to optimize self-management care. China has a 13,000 annual increase in newly diagnosed T1D cases, of which 65% are adults. However, there is yet no validated SEP targeted to T1D patients in China. The purpose of this study is to establish a structured T1D self-management education programme — 'Type 1 Diabetes Education in Lifestyle and Self Adjustment' (TELSA) that is adapted to medical and cultural practices in China.

Methods

TELSA programme was developed based on the ADDIE model, following three steps: i) Semi-structured interviews were administered to 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 13 T1D patients. Different topic guides, focusing on 4 dimensions including goals, contents, format of delivery, and quality assurance, were designed for either HCPs or patients. The interviews were recorded and analysed with thematic analysis. ii) Extracted themes were modified according to Delphi consultation. iii) Preliminary courses were conducted as pilot study to evaluate the effects of TELSA and optimization of the curriculum was finalized accordingly.

Results

A total of 18 themes in 4 dimensions of the programme design were identified in the final version: i) goals: 'behaviour modification' and 'outcome improvement'; ii) contents: 'living with T1D', 'self-monitoring of blood glucose', 'knowing insulin', 'insulin dose adjustment', 'carbohydrates and carbohydrate counting', 'hypoglycaemia', 'complications of diabetes', 'managing psychological issues', 'physical activity', and 'question-and-answer'; iii) format: 'multidisciplinary team combined with peer support', 'face-to-face education followed by remote learning', and '2-day programme held on weekends'; and iv) quality assurance: 'after-class quiz', 'patients' feedback', and 'long-term evaluation on effectiveness'.

Conclusions

A type 1 diabetes structured education programme in China was set up and shown to be applicable under local medical, social, and cultural environment.

### Treatment of type 1 diabetes: synopsis of the 2017 American diabetes association standards of medical care in diabetes [^111bvBvR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2017 Standards of Care, the ADA Professional Practice Committee did MEDLINE searches from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations on the basis of new evidence. The committee rated the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards of Care were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

Recommendation

This synopsis focuses on recommendations from the 2017 Standards of Care about monitoring and pharmacologic approaches to glycemic management for type 1 diabetes.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113Fo82z]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease and risk management in diabetes — Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in diabetes is characterized as a history of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina or coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease (PAD) including aortic aneurysm and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Diabetes itself confers independent ASCVD risk, and among people with diabetes, major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are clustered and common; numerous studies have shown the efficacy of managing individual cardiovascular risk factors, and large benefits are seen when multiple factors (glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid management) are addressed simultaneously with evidence for long-lasting benefits. Most evidence supporting interventions comes from trials of people with type 2 diabetes, and no randomized trials have been specifically designed to assess cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in people with type 1 diabetes; therefore, recommendations for cardiovascular risk factor modification for people with type 1 diabetes are extrapolated from data in people with type 2 diabetes and are similar to those for type 2 diabetes. Under the current paradigm of comprehensive risk factor modification, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have notably decreased in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and a large cohort study confirmed no or only marginally increased mortality, MI, and stroke risk compared with the general population when all major cardiovascular risk factors are managed to goal levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

### The management of type 1 diabetes in adults. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^113SLi6X]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a writing group to develop a consensus statement on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults. The writing group has considered the rapid development of new treatments and technologies and addressed the following topics: diagnosis, aims of management, schedule of care, diabetes self-management education and support, glucose monitoring, insulin therapy, hypoglycemia, behavioral considerations, psychosocial care, diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreas and islet transplantation, adjunctive therapies, special populations, inpatient management, and future perspectives. Although we discuss the schedule for follow-up examinations and testing, we have not included the evaluation and treatment of the chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes as these are well-reviewed and discussed elsewhere. The writing group was aware of both national and international guidance on type 1 diabetes and did not seek to replicate this but rather aimed to highlight the major areas that health care professionals should consider when managing adults with type 1 diabetes. Though evidence-based where possible, the recommendations in the report represent the consensus opinion of the authors.

### Evaluation of cardiovascular risk in people with type 1 diabetes: a comprehensive and specific proposed practical approach [^113oaQeM]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

People living with T1D have an increased risk of CVD; however, most of the recommendations for cardioprotective measures and care have been based on other populations, such as people living with T2D. In this practical approach proposal, we highlight the key points for cardiovascular prevention specifically for individuals living with T1D. In addition to promoting a healthy lifestyle, including the Mediterranean diet, the cornerstones for reducing CVD burden include smoking cessation, BP control at < 130/80 mmHg, and the maintenance of optimal glycaemic control. We propose the use of the ST1RE scale and an evaluation of the presence of carotid plaques to tailor the targeting of LDL-C levels in each patient. Periodic personalized evaluation and control of each risk factor is recommended. The intention of our proposal for the management and follow-up of cardiovascular risk in patients living with T1D is to facilitate positive changes in the cardiovascular risk of this population.

Background

According to the International Diabetes Federation, 537 million people aged 20 to 79 years worldwide live with diabetes. Of these 5–15% have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune condition characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia which results in absolute endogenous insulin deficiency. Achieving glycaemia (target HbA1c ≤ 7.0% or < 53 mmol/mol) is associated with optimal diabetes management. Data available from T1D registries (2010–2013) for 324,501 patients across 19 countries in Europe, North America, and Australasia reported that 71% of adults' (aged ≥ 25 years) HbA1c was > 7.0% (> 53 mmol/mol). Chronic hyperglycaemia (HbA1c > 7.0%) contributes to the development of macro- and microvascular disease.

Background

Glycaemic control with insulin therapy is influenced by factors such as insulin dosage, absorption and timing, as well as physiological and lifestyle factors such as physical activity, meal intake, hormones and illness. These factors may contribute to the notable variability in insulin requirements, which makes self-management of type 1 diabetes challenging. As a result, the majority of people with type 1 diabetes are still unable to achieve their recommended therapeutic goals. Therefore, there is currently an unmet need to improve glycaemic control and alleviate the risk of hypoglycaemia whilst reducing the burden of type 1 diabetes self-management.

### Factors impeding the discovery of an intervention-based treatment for type 1 diabetes [^116mwDYu]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common and severe chronic diseases affecting both children and adults. The aetiology of the disease remains unknown, and thus far no 'true' cure for those affected is available. Indeed, exogenous insulin replacement therapy to manage glucose metabolism to the best degree possible remains the current standard of care. However, despite a recent array of truly impressive improvements designed to enhance disease management (e.g. insulin analogues, continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pumps), it is still difficult for the vast majority of patients to reach recommended target HbA1C levels (< 7.0%). As a result of suboptimal disease management, far too many patients with T1D have an increased risk for disease-associated complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, as well as hypoglycaemia. New treatment modalities are therefore needed urgently to bring a 'true' cure (disease prevention/disease reversal) to patients with T1D. Here we consider issues that collectively pose a major stumbling block in T1D research with respect to identifying a means to prevent and/or cure the disease. We begin this Perspective by discussing new insights emanating from studies of the pancreas in human T1D; findings which may, at least in part, explain why previous interventions seeking disease prevention/reversal have yielded insufficient benefit. We then turn to suggestions that could optimise the outcome of future clinical trials. Finally, we direct attention to recommendations for the global T1D research community; messages we deem to have the potential to improve our chances of finding the elusive T1D 'cure'.

Initial Evaluation and Follow-up

General Considerations

All patients with type 1 diabetes need age-appropriate care, with an understanding of their specific needs and limitations. Infants and toddlers are approached quite differently from adolescents; the needs of young adults may vary from middle-aged or older adults. Regardless of age, the patient's needs are the same: an individualized care plan with ongoing education and support, ongoing assessment for acute and chronic complications, and access to medical providers with type 1 diabetes expertise. Just as patients change, the therapeutic approach should change and should be evaluated at each visit and modified as needed.

Type 1 diabetes care must be an iterative process, adapted as the needs of the individual evolve. Clinical assessments for type 1 diabetes in children and adults should incorporate age-appropriate and complication-focused evaluations, based on the likelihood that an abnormality will be present. For example, a young adult with low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and no complications may need more of an assessment of lifestyle adjustment as opposed to an older adult with longer duration of the disease who may need more evaluation of vascular and neurological issues.

### Assessing the economic value of maintained improvements in type 1 diabetes management, in terms of HbA, weight and hypoglycaemic event incidence [^116dUDLb]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic autoimmune disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and an estimated loss in life expectancy of 11–13 years among young adults in the United Kingdom (UK) 1. The management of the condition and its long‐term complications impose significant direct costs on the National Health Service (NHS), and its societal burden is associated with additional indirect costs. While Type 1 diabetes affected 400 000 individuals in the UK during 2010–2011, recent projections suggest that Type 1 diabetes prevalence will rise to 652 000 individuals by 2035–2036, and the economic burden of the condition will grow accordingly 2. Between 2010–2011 and 2035–2036, the direct healthcare costs of Type 1 diabetes are predicted to rise from £1.0 billion to £1.8 billion, with indirect costs of Type 1 diabetes‐related morbidity and mortality predicted to rise from £900 million to £2.4 billion during the same period 2.

Micro‐ and macrovascular complications account for approximately 70% of NHS expenditure on Type 1 diabetes management 2. These include potentially avoidable complications that arise as a consequence of poor glycaemic control; thus, improved disease management may produce significant cost savings for the UK public healthcare system. Treatment regimens that mimic physiological insulin secretion serve to control HbA 1c levels in people with Type 1 diabetes, with a view to preventing the long‐term health complications associated with the condition. However, exogenous insulin is often associated with weight gain and the incidence of hypoglycaemic events, which in turn are barriers to optimal glycaemic management 3, 4. Updated guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend insulin therapy in combination with diet and lifestyle changes for the management of Type 1 diabetes, which collectively aim to normalize HbA 1c levels, control weight and minimize cardiovascular risk factors 5.

### The development of an exercise advisor app for type 1 diabetes: digitization facilitates more individualized guidance [^113CYQFo]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Regular exercise helps in achieving better glycemic control and decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. - Further, it enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces total daily insulin needs. Despite the benefits of regular physical activity for people with T1D, health-care professionals believe that the lack of formal education on exercise-related metabolism and limited time are common barriers to prescribing guidance around exercise management. Although guidelines for exercise management have been published, they are generally not readily accessible to clinicians or people living with T1D. With low activity levelsand an increased prevalence of obesity in this population, evidence-based exercise strategies, need to be easily accessible to people with T1D in their everyday lives. A recent study surveying 1542 adults with T1D found that glucose management during exercise was the most difficult task, with 85% of the people desiring application (app)-based technology to help manage glucose levels during this time. The potential value of digital apps for diabetes self-management has recently been highlighted by consensus reports from the joint European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Diabetes Technology Working Group. Despite surges in the use of technology by people with T1D, and their potential to improve HbA1c levels, there are still significant gaps between research and the technology in mobile health for T1D management.

Here we describe an app, based on the consensus guidelines for exercise management in T1D, which aims to provide personalized guidance on insulin dosing and carbohydrate intake strategies for facilitating glucose control around exercise.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^114EobXK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Lifestyle modifications for older adults with diabetes — 4.3 In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes who are ambulatory, we recommend lifestyle modification as the first-line treatment of hyperglycemia. (1⊕⊕⊕⊕) In overweight patients, lifestyle modifications resulting in as little as 5% weight loss can improve glycemic control, but weight loss should be approached with caution in older adults as both intentional and unintentional loss may lead to severe nutritional deficiencies. An increase in physical activity in older adults should reduce sedentary behavior, moderate-intensity aerobic activity should be emphasized, and the activity plan must consider abilities and aerobic fitness after careful medical evaluation including exercise testing and heart rate/blood pressure monitoring as needed; activities to increase flexibility, muscle strength, and balance are also recommended. Intensive education regarding carbohydrate and calorie counting and meal planning can be useful for active individuals to modify insulin dosing and improve glycemic control, whereas a simpler meal planning approach emphasizing portion control and healthful choices may be more suitable for older individuals with cognitive impairment or learning difficulties; in the case of sarcopenia, nutritional therapy coupled with exercise training is thought to be beneficial.

### Behavioral programs for type 1 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115GdGVH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Whether behavioral approaches for self-management programs benefit individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus is unclear.

Purpose

To determine the effects of behavioral programs for patients with type 1 diabetes on behavioral, clinical, and health outcomes and to investigate factors that might moderate effect.

Data Sources

6 electronic databases (1993 to June 2015), trial registries and conference proceedings (2011 to 2014), and reference lists.

Study Selection

36 prospective, controlled studies involving participants of any age group that compared behavioral programs with usual care, active controls, or other programs.

Data Extraction

One reviewer extracted and another verified data. Two reviewers assessed quality and strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

Moderate SOE showed reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 6 months after the intervention compared with usual care (mean difference, -0.29 [95% CI, -0.45 to -0.13] percentage points) and compared with active controls (-0.44 [CI, -0.69 to -0.19] percentage points). At the end of the intervention and 12-month follow-up or longer, there were no statistically significant differences in HbA1c (low SOE) for comparisons with usual care or active control. Compared with usual care, generic quality of life at program completion did not differ (moderate SOE). Other outcomes had low or insufficient SOE. Adults appeared to benefit more for glycemic control at program completion (-0.28 [CI, -0.57 to 0.01] percentage points) than did youth (-0.12 [CI, -0.43 to 0.19] percentage points). Program intensity appeared not to influence effectiveness; some individual delivery appears beneficial.

Limitations

All studies had medium or high risk of bias. There was scarce evidence for many outcomes.

Conclusion

Behavioral programs for type 1 diabetes offer some benefit for glycemic control, at least at short-term follow-up, but improvement for other outcomes has not been shown. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014010515).

Behavior Change in Persons with Diabetes: Does It Really Matter?

Management of diabetes is complex and challenging. Although medications and the approach to diabetes management are constantly changing, behavior is one component of diabetes management that remains constant. Behaviors associated with diabetes management among patients include timely administration of medication, calculating the appropriate dose based on available information, talking with others about diabetes, taking supplies and being prepared for unexpected events, and making timely appointments and ordering supplies. Behavioral management of diabetes has a positive impact on health outcomes.

The first step for a successful behavioral change in patients with diabetes includes providing information about the desired behavior change. The key considerations for advice on behavior change include:
Maintaining clarity in communication: Clearly communicating information on the desired behavior change may eliminate misunderstandings between physicians and patients with diabetes. Strategies to facilitate accurate understanding of recommendations include the following:
Simplifying the message: Focusing on a single recommendation at a time and providing a small quantity of information in multiple formats depending on the literacy level of the patient.
Focusing on a single recommendation at a time with small chunks of information.
Providing information in multiple formats (e.g. spoken, written, etc.) and at the literacy level of the individual.
Applying the teach-back method: For better comprehension of patients with low health literacy, they may be asked to teach the provider the key information that they have understood. In a direct observation study, which included 38 physicians and 74 patients with diabetes, it was reported that good glycemic control was achieved among patients with diabetes in whom the teach-back method was employed compared with those for whom this method was not used.
Avoiding 'one-size-fits–all' recommendations: Tailoring recommendations according to the patient's characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, age and resources, help in successful behavior change. Motivational interviewing is one of the clinical approaches that provides health behavior advice in the context of individual beliefs and preferences, with potential applications and benefit in diabetes. In a randomized controlled trial, which included 66 teenagers (14–17 years) with type 1 DM attending a diabetes clinic in South Wales, UK, motivational interviewing facilitated improved behavioral changes in terms of positive well-being and improved quality of life and subsequent improvement in glycemic control.
Planning proper timing for health behavior message delivery: Diabetes care visits are often scheduled quarterly, making it difficult to provide timely behavioral recommendations. Advising patients to pair the recommended behavior with an existing daily routine (e.g. pairing blood glucose monitoring with brushing teeth in the morning and evening) can help in sustaining the recommended behavior.
Being empathetic and supportive: Healthcare providers should be compassionate and supportive while communicating about self-management of diabetes. For example, the tone of the healthcare provider while providing recommendations for behavior change should be encouraging instead of discouraging. Shaming, guilt trips and scaring the patients do not help in implementing and sustaining behavior change.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^113KgcEQ]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Basic recommendations for physical activity are the same as those for all children and adults, independent of the diagnosis of diabetes: children should be encouraged to engage in at least 60 min of physical activity daily, and adults should be advised to perform at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50–70% of maximum heart rate) or a lesser amount (60–75 min/week) of vigorous-intensity activity. Exercise should also include resistance and flexibility training.

Individuals, particularly adults, should be assessed for cardiovascular risk and the presence of complications that might limit exercise as discussed more fully in the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes.

Recommendations

Exercise should be a standard recommendation as it is for individuals without diabetes; however, recommendations may need modifications due to the presence of macro- and microvascular diabetes complications. (E)
Patients of all ages (or caregivers of children) should be educated about the prevention and management of hypoglycemia that may occur during or after exercise. (E)
Patients should be advised about safe preexercise blood glucose levels (typically 100 mg/dL or higher depending on the individual and type of physical activity). (E)
Reducing the prandial insulin dose for the meal/snack preceding exercise and/or increasing food intake can be used to help raise the preexercise blood glucose level and reduce hypoglycemia. (E)
A reduction in overnight basal insulin the night following exercise may reduce the risk for delayed exercise-induced hypoglycemia. (C)
SMBG should be performed as frequently as needed (before, during, and after exercise) in order to prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. (E)
Source(s) of simple carbohydrate should be readily available before, during, and after exercise to prevent and treat hypoglycemia. (E)

### Dietary strategies for adult type 1 diabetes in light of outcome evidence [^115iLELD]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals who have type 1 diabetes need individualised medical nutrition therapies whose goals are to improve overall health and metabolic outcomes. However, interventions in the field of nutrition are challenging, as diet-related correlations with disease remain difficult to detect and the certainty of outcome in this area is elusive. Currently, patients are not meeting recommended dietary guidelines. Several alternative approaches for teaching meal planning to people with diabetes have been proposed: basic nutrition guidelines, basic diabetes guidelines, menu approaches to meal planning, exchange lists for meal planning and carbohydrate counting. The review provides an overview of suggested strategies for achieving the proposed goals and summarises evidence of outcomes.

### Dietary patterns for weight and glycemic management in persons with type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of clinical trials [^111Q8Vvi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of macrovascular disease in youth and adults with type 1 diabetes is markedly elevated relative to individuals without diabetes. Mitigation of this risk is contingent upon the attainment of glycemic targets in tandem with the prevention of excess weight gain and traditional risk factors such as hypertension. Despite considerable advances in the development of diabetes technologies, a small proportion of youth and adults with type 1 diabetes meet glycemic and weight targets. Although medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of glycemic and weight management, a dearth of literature investigating dietary patterns in persons with type 1 diabetes poses a barrier to achieving clinical targets. Without robust scientific evidence, clinicians may feel ill-equipped to recommend diet approaches to persons with type 1 diabetes.

Emerging findings from precision medicine highlight the possibility of augmenting treatment success by tailoring therapies to population subgroups, rather than recommending a one-size-fits-all approach. In 2018, the Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative was launched by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, with the first consensus report published in 2020. For the type 1 diabetes treatment group, initial efforts focused on the impact of diabetes technologies; however, several other areas of interest were identified, with medical nutrition therapy being a top priority. This aligned with a recent focus of the National Institutes of Health on precision nutrition, defined as the stratification of dietary recommendations by population subgroups. The most recent systematic review of diet patterns for type 1 and type 2 diabetes management included studies published through the year 2010 and included both observational and experimental evidence. Rapid advances in diabetes technology over the past decade have likely augmented the safety and feasibility of diet patterns for type 1 diabetes management, potentially limiting the generalizability of earlier research to contemporary populations. Accordingly, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize data from clinical trials published between January 2011 and June 2024 that investigated the effects of diet patterns on glycemia and/or weight in youth and adults with type 1 diabetes, with particular attention to subgroup analyses that indicate the need to tailor treatments according to individual characteristics.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^112iddPi]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Nutrition Therapy

Nutrition therapy is an important component of the treatment plan for all individuals with type 1 diabetes. Each patient should have an individualized food plan based on food preferences, schedule, and physical activity. Nutrition therapy aims to ensure that the patient and family understand the impact food has on blood glucose, how food interacts with exercise and insulin to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia and to achieve glucose goals, and how to implement the food plan in a variety of situations. The food plan takes into consideration the patient's numeracy, literacy, engagement, and ability to adjust insulin.

General diabetes nutrition principles, as defined in the ADA Standards of Care, apply to people with type 1 diabetes, particularly in reference to normal growth and development in youth and the maintenance of a healthy body weight at all ages. Specifically, with regards to individuals with type 1 diabetes, topics such as carbohydrate counting and meal composition should be addressed. For selected individuals who have mastered carbohydrate counting, education on the impact of protein and fat on glycemic excursions should be incorporated into diabetes management. Those who are overweight or obese may benefit from weight reduction counseling.

Recommendations

Individualized medical nutrition therapy is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes as an effective component of the overall treatment plan. (A)
Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (B)
If adults with type 1 diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per day or less for adult men). Discussion with a health care provider is advised to explore potential interactions with medications. Adults should be advised that alcohol can lower blood glucose levels and that driving after drinking alcohol is contraindicated. (E)

Recommendations

Our study suggests that implementation of CVRM guidelines can be improved. The intrinsic differences of the available guidelines should be noted, as well as the challenges in choosing which guideline to implement. Harmonisation of international guidelines may be beneficial in the approach of CVRM for individuals with type 1 diabetes. More studies on CVRM strategies and cardiovascular outcomes are necessary in individuals with type 1 diabetes to reduce this ambiguity in guideline recommendations, to reduce hesitation and to help motivate individuals with type 1 diabetes to start CVRM interventions early. Investigating determinants of CVRM guideline implementation can help address undertreatment of individuals with type 1 diabetes.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112JRWZ1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes guideline mentioned glycaemia management in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, it did not cover the treatment approaches for patients with T2DM having a high risk of CVD, and treatment and screening approaches for CVDs in patients with concomitant T2DM. This consensus guideline undertakes the data obtained from all the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) to propose approaches for the T2DM management in presence of CV comorbidities. For patients at high risk of CVD, metformin is the drug of choice to manage the T2DM to achieve a patient specific HbA1c target. In case of established CVD, a combination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefits is recommended along with metformin, while for chronic kidney disease or heart failure, a sodium-glucose transporter proteins-2 inhibitor with proven benefit is advised. This document also summarises various screening and investigational approaches for the major CV events with their accuracy and specificity along with the treatment guidance to assist the healthcare professionals in selecting the best management strategies for every individual. Since lifestyle modification and management plays an important role in maintaining the effectiveness of the pharmacological therapies, authors of this consensus recommendation have also briefed on the patient-centric non-pharmacological management of T2DM and CVD.

### A practical guide to delivering nutritional advice to people with diabetes [^111cNmSW]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating that dietary interventions are effective for the management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and there is now emerging evidence for the remission of type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, it is recommended that nutritional advice is delivered by registered dietitians, and although there is evidence that dietitian-led interventions are more effective than those without input from dietitians, both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Diabetes UK recognise that other health professionals have a role in delivering dietary advice, ideally guided by a registered dietitian. However, access to registered dietitians is limited, and a survey in the UK in 2002 reported that the level of dietetic support for those with diabetes was dramatically lower than recommendations, and had not increased since a survey conducted 5 years previously.

The current recommended gold standard of care is to deliver dietary advice as part of intensive multicomponent lifestyle programmes, and this is endorsed by both international and national bodies. However, in the UK for example, despite the fact that structured education was offered to 50% of those with type 1 diabetes and 90% of those with type 2 diabetes in 2015–2016, only 5–10% attended education programmes. In many areas of the world, there are no dietitians or education programmes available, and where there are, limited uptake and restricted access to these facilities mean that people with diabetes rely on their primary healthcare provider for dietary advice. Unfortunately, primary healthcare professionals have little training in delivering dietary advice to people with diabetes. Nutrition and lifestyle education for physicians is insufficient and more than 75% report that they are inadequately trained to counsel their patients on diet and physical activity. Nurses are often required to deliver dietary advice, but there is evidence that they have inadequate knowledge and skills to improve outcomes. This lack of professional support for people with diabetes is illustrated by data from the Helpline at Diabetes UK, where approximately 70% of the 20,000 calls received annually are diet-related queries.

This article aims to offer a practical guide for health professionals who deliver dietary information to people with diabetes.

### Effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^115rA4C4]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) defines that lifestyle management is a cornerstone of diabetes care and includes diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), physical activity, smoking cessation counseling, and psychosocial care. For people with type 1 diabetes, MNT is a key point in the management of the disease and is also a component of DSMES. Carbohydrate counting and insulin management are mainly targeted to enable people with type 1 diabetes to self-manage the disease; furthermore, education about how to use fat and protein content to determine insulin dosing is recommended to improve glycemic control. In addition, nutritional recommendations based on healthy dietary habits are included in the MNT of people with diabetes. Nutrition therapy has an integral role in overall diabetes management, and people with diabetes should be actively engaged in education, self-management, and treatment planning with the healthcare team.

During adolescence, attention to family dynamics, developmental stages, and physiological changes related with sexual maturity are essential for implementing an optimal diabetes treatment. Moreover, diabetes distress has been shown to be positively associated with disordered eating in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In addition, a poor adherence to nutritional recommendations has been observed in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Having a robust evidence-base regarding the effectiveness of MNT is important to inform healthcare professionals. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics published a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of MNT in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes so that healthcare professionals are knowledgeable about MNT for people with both types of diabetes. However, to our knowledge, a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of MNT in adolescents with type 1 diabetes has so far not been performed. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes have particular challenges: attention to family dynamics, developmental stages, and physiological changes related with sexual maturity are essential for implementing an optimal diabetes treatment. Moreover, diabetes distress has been shown to be positively associated with disordered eating in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, poor adherence to the nutritional recommendations has been observed in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. For this reason, in this systematic review, we aimed to identify, summarize, and interpret the published literature about MNT of adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

### Highlighting the new consensus guidelines for managing people at risk of, and with early-stage type 1 diabetes-relevance to clinical care in the UK [^114tzKWR]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There are four key areas.

First, guidance is provided around the frequency and intensity of follow‐up for single Ab as well as multiple Ab individuals, the different stages of early‐stage presymptomatic T1D, in adults and children. The pros and cons of the different approaches to glucose monitoring (glycated haemoglobin, continuous glucose monitoring, self monitoring of blood glucose) are outlined and the utility of these different approaches at different stages is discussed. Importantly, advice is also provided around safety. The importance of regular education about symptoms of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis is highlighted and all health professionals involved in monitoring and care of these individuals have a responsibility to provide this education. At this time there are no formal recommendations of how appropriate monitoring and follow‐up pathways may be practically implemented given this is likely to be a novel service, and this will require attention and careful consideration.

### 2022: position of Brazilian diabetes society on exercise recommendations for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes [^116N7fP3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, the practice of properly oriented physical exercises brings significant benefits to the individual's health and is considered an indispensable tool for metabolic management. The individualization of exercise routines is an essential aspect for therapeutic success, despite the need to consider some general recommendations. This review is an authorized literal translation of the Brazilian Society of Diabetes (SBD) Guidelines 2021–2022, which is based on scientific evidence and provides guidance on physical activities and exercises aimed at individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes.

Methods

SBD designated 9 specialists from its "Department of Diabetes, Exercise & Sports" to author chapters on physical activities and exercises directed to individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes. The aim of these chapters was to highlight recommendations in accordance with Evidence Levels, based on what is described in the literature. These chapters were analyzed by the SBD Central Committee, which is also responsible for the SBD 2021–2022 guidelines. Main clinical inquiries were selected to perform a narrated review by using MEDLINE via PubMed. Top available evidence, such as high-quality clinical trials, large observational studies and meta-analyses related to physical activity and exercise advisory, were analyzed. The adopted MeSh terms were [diabetes] [type 1 diabetes] [type 2 diabetes] [physical activity] [physical exercise].

Results

17 recommendations were defined by the members. For this review, it was considered different Evidence Levels, as well as different Classes of Recommendations. As to Evidence Levels, the following levels were contemplated: Level A) More than one randomized clinical trial or a randomized clinical trial meta-analysis with low heterogeneity. Level B) Meta analysis with observational studies, one randomized clinical trial, sizeable observational studies and sub-groups analysis. Level C) Small non-randomized studies, cross-sectional studies, case control studies, guidelines or experts' opinions. In respect to Recommendation Classes, the following criteria were adopted: I. "Recommended": Meaning there was a consent of more than 90% of the panel; IIa. "Must be considered": meaning there is a general preference of the panel which 70–90% agrees; IIb. "Can be considered". 50–70% agrees; III Not recommended: There is a consensus that the intervention should not be performed.

Conclusion

Physical exercise aids on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes individuals while also decreasing cardiovascular risk in individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Individuals diagnosed with diabetes should perform combined aerobic and resistance exercises in order to manage the disease. In addition, exercises focusing on flexibility and balance should be specially addressed on elderly individuals. Diabetes individuals using insulin as therapeutic treatment should properly monitor glycemia levels before, during and after exercise sessions to minimize health incidents, such as hypoglycemia.

### Dietary patterns for weight and glycemic management in persons with type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis of clinical trials [^115L2i8r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Precision Nutrition: Future Integration With Published Society Guidelines

The ADA and ISPAD recommend individualized medical nutrition therapy as an essential aspect of treatment for individuals living with type 1 diabetes. The ADA's clinical practice guidelines (ie, Standards of Care in Diabetes) emphasize whole diet patterns that represent dietary intake more globally, as opposed to a reductionist view of macro- and micronutrients. The ADA's Standards of Care also underscore the importance of individualizing eating patterns to incorporate a variety of foods that reflect personal and cultural preferences, given that there is no one-size-fits-all eating pattern that works for all persons with diabetes. Thus, the existing guidelines emphasize nutrient quality independent of macronutrient intake, as well as the adequacy (eg, nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains, whole fruits, legumes, lean proteins) and moderation (eg, red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, alcohol, foods high in sodium) of specific food groups. Nonetheless, evidence for stratifying recommendations to optimize health within population subgroups is lacking. The scant evidence base and lack of clinical practice guidelines addressing diet approaches for managing overweight and obesity in type 1 diabetes warrants particular attention. The ADA Standards of Medical Care focus exclusively on weight in the context of type 2 diabetes in the chapter titled Obesity and Weight Management. Our findings highlight that future research is urgently needed to rigorously examine the impact of dietary interventions on weight in those with type 1 diabetes, with particular attention to potential subgroups of interest. In the future, evaluating the effects of dietary interventions on clinical outcomes within specific subgroups, including by age (eg, in youth and older adults), type of insulin regimen, and weight status, will provide insight into the unique behavioral and metabolic factors that influence how diet patterns impact health outcomes in subgroups of persons with type 1 diabetes. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can help to determine whether other characteristics such as gut microbiome composition, genotype, and baseline diet impact behavioral or physiological responses to different diets.

### Proposed practical guidelines to improve glycaemic management by reducing glycaemic variability in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^117PJQM5]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The panel convened across virtual meetings with the final aim of proposing consensus guidelines to minimise GV in this population. Once the panel reached the consensus that physical activity, dietary habits and insulin therapy were the major areas to work on to find useful suggestions to improve glycaemic management, a comprehensive, updated review of the literature was planned. For this purpose, appropriate keyword combinations to identify articles of relevance to the different topics were agreed. These combinations are specified in the Supplementary Material (Table S2). Other minor causes of GV were also considered. Likewise, an additional search for reviews addressing the topic of GV in the last 5 years was also performed to ensure that other potential causes of GV had not been overlooked. For searches regarding insulin therapy, those articles addressing GV in people with T1D who are not users of pump-based systems were prioritised.

By sharing their proposals, the panel was able to reach an agreement on the final set of proposed practical guidelines to follow in each area to achieve low GV, appropriate TIR values and low risk of hypoglycaemia.

This article is based on previously conducted studies as well as on previous authors' observations and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Weight-loss practices and weight-related issues among youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [^112Q4gYg]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is one of the three most prevalent chronic diseases of youth, with the majority of affected youth having type 1 diabetes. However, type 2 diabetes is being diagnosed more frequently in youth than has been reported in previous decades. Although youth with type 2 diabetes are likely to be overweight or obese, the increase in overweight in the U.S. population is mirrored among youth with type 1 diabetes. Strategies used to lose or manage weight include those that are healthy, such as regular physical activity and consuming a healthy diet, as well as those that are unhealthy, such as using over-the-counter diet aids without physician's advice, fasting, taking laxatives or diuretics, and vomiting. In 2005, 12.3% of 9th to 12th graders went without eating for at least 24 hours, 6.3% used diet pills, powders, or liquids, and 4.5% vomited or took laxatives to maintain or lose weight. Females were significantly more likely than males to use these unhealthy strategies; some racial/ethnic differences were observed.

Certain features of diabetes and its management, including weight gain after the initiation of insulin treatment, dietary restraint, and the knowledge that withholding insulin can cause weight loss, may trigger eating disturbances in youth with type 1 diabetes. Eating disorders have been associated with poor metabolic control and microvascular complications in type 1 diabetic youth. There is limited information about weight-related concerns among youth with type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends that youth with type 2 diabetes implement lifestyle modifications to reduce their intake of high-fat, high-energy foods and to increase physical activity to optimize glycemic control as well as their cardiovascular risk profile, including their lipid levels and blood pressure. At the same time, medical nutrition therapy must take in to account the nutritional needs required to support normal growth and development during childhood and adolescence. In this article, we describe the approaches to healthy and unhealthy weight-loss practices reported by youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes by sex. In addition, we explore the associations between any unhealthy weight-loss practice, body weight perception, weight management goal, and worry about weight and glycemic control among youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes by sex.

Lifestyle modification: weight loss and diet

Being a microvascular complication of diabetes, DKD is associated with hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and increased body mass index (BMI) within the metabolic syndrome. A healthy lifestyle has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in the general population. The Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDane) study, a large cohort of 1400 participants with type 1 diabetes, demonstrated that the intensity of physical activity may have an impact on the progression of DKD. DKD was classified according to the degree of albuminuria, and progression during follow-up was defined as any change to a higher class of albuminuria or development of ESKD. After 8 years follow-up the cumulative progression rate was 5.9%, 6.9% and 15.4% among participants in the high, moderate, and low intensity physical activity groups, respectively. However, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), also examining risk factors for the development of complications in type 1 diabetes, found no association between intensity of physical activity and the development of albuminuria over a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. Of note, these studies were based on self-reported physical activity which is prone to significant bias.

In type 2 diabetes the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Trialwas a multicentre RCT examining the effect of intensive lifestyle modification on cardiovascular events in those patients who were also overweight or obese. The participants were randomly assigned to either an intensive lifestyle intervention or to a diabetes support and educational programme. The trial found no significant reduction in cardiovascular events but there was also an analysis of the impact of the intervention on other outcomes such as nephropathy. Defining very high risk CKD as either eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 with urine ACR (Albumin to Creatinine Ratio) > 30 mg/g or eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and urine ACR > 300 mg/g, the incidence of this end point was 31% lower in the intensive intervention arm. Over 10 years of follow-up those in the intensive intervention arm had a 4 kg weight reduction. Hence reducing the risk of DKD progression is likely to require a combination of lifestyle modification, weight loss and pharmacological interventions.

Treatment of Overweight/Obesity Focus on GLP-1 RAs

The recommendations for the treatment of obesity in patients with T2D have been changing over time. Currently, in addition to diet and physical activity modifications, behavioural therapy as well as metabolic surgery and new pharmacotherapies are suggested. Moreover, there is a strong focus on obesity management which reaches beyond BW loss alone, as it covers risk reduction and health improvement. The European guidelines for obesity management state that even a modest BW loss of 5–10% of initial BW combined with lifestyle modification brings significant clinical benefits. Loss of at least 15% of BW can exert a disease-modifying effect in T2D, which extends the results obtained using glucose-lowering intervention. The results of clinical trials have demonstrated that in 25–60% of patients with prediabetes, the progression to T2D can be prevented via lifestyle intervention that also leads to weight loss.

### Carbohydrate requirement for exercise in type 1 diabetes: effects of insulin concentration [^1146U1S2]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Physical activity is a keystone of a healthy lifestyle as well as of management of patients with type 1 diabetes. The risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, however, is a great challenge for these patients. The glycemic response to exercise depends upon several factors concerning the patient him/herself (eg, therapy, glycemic control, training level) and the characteristics of the exercise performed. Only in-depth knowledge of these factors will allow to develop individualized strategies minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. The main factors affecting the exercise-induced hypoglycemia in patients with T1D have been analyzed, including the effects of insulin concentration. A model is discussed, which has the potential to become the basis for providing patients with individualized suggestions to keep constant glucose levels on each exercise occasion.

### Mobile health in the management of type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hYE5i]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. This disease, also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, occurs in all age groups, but especially in children and adolescents. With an increasing worldwide incidence of approximately 3% to 4% a year. In the United States, the number of young patients with T1DM has been predicted to increase by 23% over the next 40 years. Although T1DM accounts for only 5–10% of all cases of diabetes, the prevalence of T1DM is increasing in most countries around the world. The significant effect that poor glycemic control can have on the health of patients with T1DM, includes failure to achieve adequate levels of glycemic control ultimately results in damage to a wide range of organs, most notably the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. With the growing number of individuals with T1DM, improving diabetes care to decrease the health and economic burden caused by the disease is viewed globally as an important goal.

Developing Countries: The Global Epidemic

Type 1 diabetes is an increasing global public health burden. The demands of daily management, chronicity of the disease, potential complications, paucity of diabetes specialists, and rising incidence are challenging in the U.S. but these issues, including the considerable cost of management, are crippling for those in the developing world. International organizations play a major role in improving care for individuals with type 1 diabetes in the developing world, but implementable, cost-saving, and sustainable strategies are needed to make such programs successful.

### Nonpharmacologic therapy and exercise in the prevention of type 2 diabetes [^112xevNE]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes with early lifestyle interventions.

Results

The results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower (on average approximately 50% reduced) incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive "usual care". Individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes. Thus, compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least the onset of the disease can be significantly delayed.

Conclusions

Randomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes. This evidence of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases.

### Contemporary management of patients with type 1 diabetes [^112KfwBL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The current standard of care for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) employs a system of intensive diabetes management aimed at near-normal glycemia, which reduces the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications. Optimal management is an ongoing process based on a patient-centered collaboration with a primary care clinician and a multidisciplinary diabetes team that provides diabetes management, including education and psychosocial support. Intensive diabetes therapy attempts to mimic physiologic insulin replacement. Over the past 15 years, there has been widespread use of multiple-dose insulin regimens using a variety of insulin analogs, administered either by injection or insulin pump therapy, together with medical nutrition therapy, frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose and, more recently, continuous logo glucose monitoring. It is now possible to achieve previously unattainable levels of glycemic control with less risk of severe hypoglycemia, and yet only a minority of patients achieves target hemoglobin A1c values. This review discusses contemporary management of T1D with a focus on health outcomes.

Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes — exercise education recommendations emphasize tailored glycemia management and hypoglycemia prevention training for families. The guidance states: "14.9 Youth and their parents or caregivers should receive education on goals and management of glycemia before, during, and after physical activity, individualized according to the type and intensity of the planned physical activity. C" and "14.10 Youth and their parents or caregivers should be educated on strategies to prevent hypoglycemia during, after, and overnight following physical activity and exercise. Treatment for hypoglycemia should be accessible before, during, and after engaging in activity. C".

### Health and economic benefits of diabetes interventions… [^116iuSc9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Strategies that work CDC is working to help millions of Americans reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes and prevent or delay serious diabetes complications, which will save lives and lower medical costs. Preventing type 2 diabetes While some risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as family history or age, cannot be changed, others can be avoided by maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active. To help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, CDC's National Diabetes Prevention Program delivers an affordable, evidence-based lifestyle change program. Studies show that the lifestyle change program, which focuses on healthy eating and physical activity, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than 50% for people at high risk. CDC and its partners are working to make the lifestyle change program available to more Americans. More than 750, 000 adults had participated as of March 2024.

To make more people aware of their risk of prediabetes, CDC partnered with the American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, and Ad Council to launch the first national prediabetes awareness campaign. The campaign includes a 1-minute online risk test and links people to organizations across the country that deliver the National DPP lifestyle change program. More than 12 million people now know their prediabetes risk as a result. Preventing diabetes complications To prevent complications in people living with diabetes, CDC and its partners are working to expand access to and participation in diabetes self-management education and support services. DSMES services reach over 1 million people with diabetes each year. DSMES services help people with diabetes effectively manage their blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and get preventive care. Keeping diabetes under control through effective disease management can lower risks of diabetes complications.

For example:

- Effective blood sugar management can reduce the risk of eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease by 40%.
- Blood pressure management can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke by 33% to 50%. Improved cholesterol levels can reduce cardiovascular complications by 20% to 50%.
- Regular eye exams and timely treatment could prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness.
- Intensive lifestyle modification to prevent type 2 diabetes among people at high risk costs $12, 500A per QALY, compared to no intervention.
- Self-monitoring of blood sugar levels three times a day by people with type 2 diabetes on insulin costs $3, 700A per QALY compared to self-monitoring once a day.
