## Question

For female in productive era, how many folic acid to take, and when to take high dose of folic acid, 2.5 and 5 mg and what's the duration

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about folic acid dosing for women of reproductive age, specifically how much to take, when to use higher doses like 2.5 or 5 mg, and the appropriate timing and duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline recommendation for average-risk women. Then, I should verify the high-risk indications and the specific 4–5 mg dosing. Next, I will review timing and duration, including preconception and first-trimester windows. After that, I need to check special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will consider safety, monitoring, and practical implementation, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the baseline recommendation for average-risk women of reproductive age. The USPSTF gives an A-grade recommendation for 0.4–0.8 mg (400–800 mcg) of folic acid daily for all who are planning or capable of pregnancy, ideally starting at least 1 month before conception and continuing through the first 2–3 months of pregnancy, which aligns with ACOG guidance of 400 mcg/day starting at least 1 month preconception through 12 weeks' gestation [^114HcCo7] [^111KWTzB] [^113WwUrk]. I should confirm that this applies broadly to reproductive-age women regardless of intent to conceive, given the high rate of unplanned pregnancies, and that the benefit is substantial with no serious harms at usual doses, which the USPSTF reaffirms [^114HcCo7] [^114SCDLg].

> Now, I need to identify who qualifies for high-dose folic acid and at what dose. High-risk indications include a prior pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect, a personal or family history of NTDs, certain maternal conditions such as epilepsy on antiseizure medications, and selected metabolic or malabsorption states; for these, 4–5 mg daily is recommended, typically 4 mg in U.S. guidance and 4–5 mg in Canadian/SOGC guidance, starting at least 3 months before conception and continuing through 12 weeks' gestation [^116hvZfQ] [^111T3io5]. Wait, let me verify the epilepsy point: although some older guidance emphasized 4 mg for anticonvulsant users, contemporary counseling still places many such patients in a higher-risk category warranting higher-dose folic acid, often 4–5 mg, given folate antagonism by several antiseizure drugs, so I should keep that nuance in mind and individualize based on regimen and risk profile [^113WwUrk] [^115v5RF1].

> Next, I should review timing and duration with precision. For average-risk women, start 0.4–0.8 mg daily at least 1 month before conception and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. For high-risk women, start 4–5 mg daily at least 3 months before conception and continue through 12 weeks, after which the dose should be reduced to 0.4–1.0 mg daily for the remainder of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues [^11118rKA] [^111T3io5]. Hold on, I should verify the post-12-week transition: SOGC explicitly recommends stepping down to 0.4–1.0 mg after 12 weeks, which is the approach I will adopt here to avoid unnecessary high-dose exposure beyond the neural tube closure window [^111T3io5].

> I will now examine special populations where higher doses may be considered even without a classic high-risk label. Women with obesity may benefit from higher doses, with FIGO suggesting consideration of up to 5 mg daily for at least 1–3 months before conception, acknowledging that evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized. Similarly, those with poor adherence, variable diet, or multiple modest risk factors may be reasonable candidates for higher dosing in some guideline frameworks, though this is more controversial and should be balanced against potential risks of excess intake [^114qxNSx] [^111Cbss7]. But wait, what if the patient is on sulfasalazine for IBD? I should confirm that sulfasalazine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and that guidelines often recommend 2 mg/day folic acid in that setting, which is a distinct, drug-specific indication rather than a blanket high-dose strategy [^113e1Ht1].

> Let me consider sickle cell disease, because I recall a potential need for higher folic acid. Initially, I thought the WHO 2025 guidance endorsed 5 mg daily for all pregnant patients with SCD, but wait, I should double-check the exact wording. The current WHO recommendation advises daily supplementation up to 5 mg for pregnant patients with SCD living outside malaria-endemic areas, which is a nuanced, geography-aware statement, so I should not overgeneralize it to all settings without context [^1113MSg7]. I need to ensure that any high-dose use in SCD is coordinated with hematology and obstetric care and that we avoid inadvertently interfering with antifolate antimalarials where relevant [^116rgTs1].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. High-dose folic acid is generally well tolerated in the periconceptional window, but prolonged supraphysiologic intake beyond the first trimester lacks proven maternal-fetal benefit and may carry theoretical risks. Large randomized data show no reduction in preeclampsia with 4–5 mg started after 8 weeks, and observational signals suggest a possible association between high-dose prescription folic acid and increased cancer risk, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma, though confounding is a concern and causality is unproven, so caution and time-limited use are prudent [^114dfnsZ] [^115tDRE3] [^114wW6NP]. I should confirm that masking of vitamin B12 deficiency is a concern with high-dose folic acid, reinforcing the need to assess B12 status when clinically indicated and to avoid chronic supraphysiologic dosing outside indications [^114y39w3].

> I need to ensure the practical implementation is clear. For average-risk women, an over-the-counter multivitamin with 0.4–0.8 mg folic acid is appropriate. For high-risk women, prescribe 4–5 mg folic acid as a separate tablet, not bundled in a prenatal multivitamin, to avoid excess vitamin A or other nutrients, and coordinate the start at least 3 months before conception when feasible. If pregnancy is already underway, start as soon as possible because neural tube closure occurs around day 28, and continue through 12 weeks before stepping down [^111T3io5] [^11118rKA]. Hold on, I should verify that the USPSTF emphasizes the critical window starting at least 1 month preconception through the first 2–3 months of pregnancy, which supports early initiation even in unplanned conceptions [^111KWTzB].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting statements before concluding. I initially implied that all women with obesity should take 5 mg, but I should correct that to "consider up to 5 mg" in selected higher-risk contexts rather than a blanket recommendation, and I should also emphasize that daily 0.4–0.8 mg remains the evidence-based standard for most women, with high-dose reserved for specific indications or carefully selected scenarios after shared decision-making [^114qxNSx] [^114HcCo7]. I should double-check that the final plan aligns with major guidelines: USPSTF for universal 0.4–0.8 mg, ACOG for 400 mcg with early initiation, and SOGC for 4–5 mg in high-risk women with a structured step-down after 12 weeks, which it does [^114HcCo7] [^11118rKA] [^111T3io5].

> Final synthesis: For women of reproductive age, the standard dose is 0.4–0.8 mg folic acid daily, started at least 1 month before conception and continued through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. For high-risk women, use 4–5 mg daily, started at least 3 months before conception and continued through 12 weeks, then reduce to 0.4–1.0 mg for the remainder of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum or during breastfeeding. Consider higher dosing in selected contexts such as obesity or specific drug interactions, but avoid chronic supraphysiologic dosing beyond the first trimester in the absence of a compelling indication, and tailor decisions to individual risk, adherence, and access to care [^114HcCo7] [^11118rKA] [^111T3io5] [^114qxNSx].

For women of reproductive age, the standard folic acid dose is **0.4–0.8 mg daily** [^114HcCo7], starting at least 1 month before conception and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy [^11118rKA]. High-dose folic acid (**4–5 mg daily**) is indicated for those with a prior NTD-affected pregnancy [^114cK4MK] [^111T3io5], certain medical conditions (e.g. epilepsy, diabetes, obesity, malabsorption) [^113WwUrk] [^114qxNSx] [^111Cbss7], or poor adherence, and should be started at least 3 months before conception and continued through the first 12 weeks [^114cK4MK]. After 12 weeks, reduce to 0.4–1.0 mg daily for the rest of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum or through breastfeeding [^111T3io5]. Weekly 2.8 mg folic acid is an alternative for women with adherence issues or in public health programs [^114RFGsV] [^111CKv3m].

## Standard folic acid supplementation

- **Dose**: 0.4–0.8 mg (400–800 mcg) daily [^114HcCo7].
- **Timing**: Start at least 1 month before conception and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy [^11118rKA].
- **Rationale**: Reduces NTD risk by ~70% when taken periconceptionally [^113e1Ht1].

---

## High-dose folic acid supplementation

High-dose folic acid (**4–5 mg daily**) is recommended for women at **increased risk of NTDs**, including:

- **Prior NTD-affected pregnancy**: 4–5 mg daily [^114cK4MK].
- **Medical conditions**: Epilepsy, diabetes, obesity, malabsorption, or poor adherence [^113WwUrk] [^114qxNSx].
- **Timing**: Start at least 3 months before conception and continue through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy [^114cK4MK].
- **Post-12 weeks**: Reduce to 0.4–1.0 mg daily for the remainder of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum or through breastfeeding [^1111wYKT].

---

## Alternative supplementation: weekly folic acid

Weekly folic acid (**2.8 mg**) is an alternative for women with adherence challenges or in public health programs [^114RFGsV] [^111CKv3m]. It is **effective at raising RBC folate** and reducing NTD risk when daily supplementation is not feasible [^114RFGsV].

## Folic acid supplementation guidelines

| **Risk category** | **Dose** | **Timing** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard risk | 0.4–0.8 mg daily | ≥ 1 month before conception | First 12 weeks of pregnancy |
| High risk | 4–5 mg daily | ≥ 3 months before conception | First 12 weeks of pregnancy |
| After 12 weeks | 0.4–1.0 mg daily | After 12 weeks | Rest of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum |
| Weekly alternative | 2.8 mg weekly | Before conception | Throughout pregnancy |

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Safety**: High-dose folic acid is safe and well tolerated; monitor for masking of B12 deficiency [^114y39w3].
- **Adherence**: Emphasize early initiation and consistent use to maximize NTD prevention [^114HcCo7].
- **Individualization**: Tailor dose and duration to risk factors, adherence, and clinical judgment [^111T3io5].

---

Women of reproductive age should take **0.4–0.8 mg folic acid daily** [^114HcCo7], starting at least 1 month before conception and continuing through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. High-dose folic acid (**4–5 mg daily**) is indicated for those with prior NTDs or specific medical conditions, starting at least 3 months before conception and continuing through the first 12 weeks, then reducing to 0.4–1.0 mg daily for the remainder of pregnancy and postpartum [^111T3io5].

### Multiple-micronutrient supplementation for women during pregnancy [^112J3Mk4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple-micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age in low- to middle-income countries. They are exacerbated in pregnancy due to the increased demands, leading to potentially adverse effects on the mother and developing fetus. Though supplementation with MMNs has been recommended earlier because of the evidence of impact on pregnancy outcomes, a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the replacement of iron and folic acid supplementation with MMNs. Since the last update of this Cochrane review, evidence from a few large trials has recently been made available, the inclusion of which is critical to inform policy.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits of oral multiple-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved articles and key reviews. We also contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

All prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating MMN supplementation during pregnancy and its effects on the pregnancy outcome were eligible, irrespective of language or the publication status of the trials. We included cluster-randomised trials, but quasi-randomised trials were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Nineteen trials (involving 138,538 women) were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review but only 17 trials (involving 137,791 women) contributed data to the review. Fifteen of these 17 trials were carried out in low and middle-income countries and compared MMN supplements with iron and folic acid versus iron with or without folic acid. Two trials carried out in the UK compared MMN with a placebo. MMN with iron and folic acid versus iron, with or without folic acid (15 trials): MMN resulted in a significant decrease in the number of newborn infants identified as low birthweight (LBW) (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.91; high-quality evidence) or small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.97; moderate-quality evidence), and a reduced rate of stillbirth (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98; high-quality evidence). No significant differences were shown for other maternal and pregnancy outcomes: preterm births (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; high-quality evidence), maternal anaemia in the third trimester (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10), miscarriage (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01), maternal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48), perinatal mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.12; high-quality evidence), neonatal mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; high -quality evidence), or risk of delivery via a caesarean section (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.43). A number of prespecified, clinically important outcomes could not be assessed due to insufficient or non-available data. Single trials reported results for: very preterm birth < 34 weeks, macrosomia, side-effects of supplements, nutritional status of children, and congenital anomalies including neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental outcome: Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) scores. None of these trials reported pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, cost of supplementation, and maternal well-being or satisfaction. When assessed according to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for the review's primary outcomes overall was good. Pooled results for primary outcomes were based on multiple trials with large sample sizes and precise estimates. The following outcomes were graded to be as of high quality: preterm birth, LBW, perinatal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality. The outcome of SGA was graded to be of moderate quality, with evidence downgraded by one for funnel plot asymmetry and potential publication bias. We carried out sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high levels of sample attrition (> 20%); results were consistent with the main analysis. We explored heterogeneity through subgroup analysis by maternal height and body mass index (BMI), timing of supplementation and dose of iron. Subgroup differences were observed for maternal BMI and timing of supplementation for the outcome preterm birth, with significant findings among women with low BMI and with earlier initiation of supplementation in the prenatal period. Subgroup differences were also observed for maternal BMI, maternal height and dose of iron for the outcome SGA, indicating a significant impact among women with higher maternal BMI and height, and with MMN supplement containing 30 mg of iron versus control receiving 60 mg of iron. The findings between subgroups for other primary outcomes were inconclusive. MMN versus placebo (two trials): A single trial in the UK found no clear differences between groups for preterm birth, SGA, LBW or maternal anaemia in the third trimester. A second trial reported the number of women with pre-eclampsia; there was no evidence of a difference between groups. Other outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings support the effect of MMN supplements with iron and folic acid in improving birth outcomes. The findings, consistently observed in several systematic evaluations of evidence, provide a strong basis to guide the replacement of iron and folic acid with MMN supplements containing iron and folic acid for pregnant women in developing countries where MMN deficiencies are common among women of reproductive age. Efforts should be focused on the integration of this intervention in maternal nutrition and antenatal care programs in developing countries.

### Management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity from the FIGO pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee: a FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guideline [^113W6eBv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

As is the case for all pregnant women, those with obesity should be encouraged to continue taking their folic acid supplementation daily throughout early pregnancy until the end of the first trimester 37. A dose of at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) daily is recommended and consideration can be given to higher‐dose supplements as appropriate 37, 43. Women with obesity are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency due to deposition of the vitamin in adipose tissue deposits 92. Therefore, while there is a lack of strong evidence to show that vitamin D supplementation can improve outcomes in women with obesity in pregnancy, to ensure that women with obesity are at least vitamin D replete, it is prudent to recommend a daily vitamin D supplement, in a safe dose, to women with obesity 37, 43. In making the decision whether to supplement with vitamin D, the circumstances of the mother (e.g. diet or sun exposure) and the available resources should be considered. Additional nutrient‐specific or multinutrient supplementation may be indicated in certain regions or with women with limited dietary intakes. This may include iron, vitamin B12 or folate to prevent anemia, calcium to prevent pre‐eclampsia, iodine, or others as appropriate 44, 64.

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to offer a diet of folate-rich foods and a daily oral multivitamin supplement containing 0.4 mg folic acid and vitamin B12 for at least 2–3 months before conception, throughout the pregnancy, and for 4–6 weeks postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues in females at low risk for neural tube defects or other folic acid-sensitive congenital anomalies if the male partner also has a low risk.

Pregnancy and birth health outcomes associated with FA intake 1

Although evidence is lacking to confirm a potential dose-dependent adverse effect of FA when supplemented across all trimesters, the "precautionary principle" could be considered in the re-evaluation or confirmation of periconceptional supplementation guidelines. The precautionary principle had its origin in environmental science and aims to anticipate, monitor, and prevent unintended adverse consequences of public health interventions. In the context of prenatal supplementation guidelines, the precautionary principle can be defined as a guide for decision making in the public health context and a policy tool for acknowledging scientific uncertainty by prompting a preventive intervention, call for more research, or both, in light of the existing state of the evidence.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^116twiP9]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

WHO recommends blanket weekly iron–folic acid (IFA) supplementation for all non-pregnant adolescent girls and women (15–49 years) of reproductive age to prevent anaemia in areas where the prevalence of anaemia is higher than 20%. Globally, WHO estimates that 50% of anaemia is caused by iron deficiency. However, the burden of anaemia caused by folate deficiency is very low, and the need to include folic acid in the weekly supplement is in question. Folic acid taken before and during early pregnancy can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (NTD), birth defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly. As standard practice, WHO recommends that all women, from the moment they begin trying to conceive until 12 weeks of gestation, take a daily 0.4 mg folic acid supplement. Unfortunately, many pregnancies are unplanned, especially among adolescent girls, and the neural tube closes early in pregnancy (~28 days) before most women know they are pregnant. At least 10 million unplanned pregnancies occur each year among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years in low-income and middle-income countries. Therefore, a potential benefit of retaining folic acid in weekly IFA supplements is that if a woman were to have an unplanned pregnancy, it might reduce her risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^116P2Vdh]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Plasma folate concentrations at week 16 by treatment group generally paralleled RBC folate. Plasma folate is affected by recent dietary intake, especially folic acid supplement use, and is less stable than RBC folate, which better reflects tissue folate concentrations. Moreover, WHO recommends that plasma folate not be used as a biomarker for NTD prevention, and no sufficiency threshold for plasma folate is given.

Strengths of this trial include the randomised placebo controlled design and high retention (98% at 16 weeks) and adherence rates (94% at 16 weeks). Further, there is no fortification with folic acid in Malaysia and the prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age is greater than 20%, suggesting that WHO recommended intermittent IFA programming is warranted in this population for non-pregnant women. We used a well-accepted biomarker of NTD risk, RBC folate, which is inversely associated with NTD risk in diverse populations, including Irish and Chinese women. Moreover, the finding that folic acid fortification, which typically provides women with less than 0.4 mg/daily, has increased RBC folate and lowered NTD risk in countries where it has been implemented further supports the use of this biomarker. The work was carried out in Malaysia because it had anaemia rates high enough to justify a weekly IFA programme and the necessary infrastructure and expertise to carry out a high-quality efficacy trial. However, we are confident that our results are generalisable to other countries where weekly IFA supplements are used and will reduce the burden of these devastating birth defects.

Management of IBD during pregnancy

Preconception management

Preconception counseling is an important component of IBD management (Figure 2). Gastroenterologists should proactively initiate preconception counseling conversations with all men and women of childbearing age. In addition to providing standard antenatal education, counseling should address patient misconceptions about infertility, medication safety, maternofetal complications, and IBD heritability, which are common concerns in IBD patients and contribute toward VC. – This is associated with improved medication adherence, folic acid supplementation, smoking cessation, reduced disease flares during pregnancy, and improved neonatal outcomes. – In women actively contemplating pregnancy, medication review for risk of teratogenicity and objective assessment of disease activity should be performed prior to conception, aiming to confirm disease remission to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Patients should be encouraged to join IBD support organizations, with membership predictive of significantly higher pregnancy-specific IBD knowledge.

Considerations for pregnancy management in women with inflammatory bowel disease.

IBD, inflammatory bowel disease.

Folic acid can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by 72%, without adverse neonatal effects; therefore, supplementation should be provided to all pregnant women and women contemplating conception. The recommended dose is 400–800 µg/day in combination with adequate dietary intake, commencing at least 1 month prior to conception and continuing at least throughout the first trimester. Higher doses of 2 mg/day are recommended for patients taking sulfasalazine, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thus impairing absorption and metabolism of folic acid. – Other congenital defects associated with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, such as cardiovascular and oral cleft deformities, may also be mitigated by folic acid supplementation.

### Long-term effect of low-dose folic acid intake: potential effect of mandatory fortification on the prevention of neural tube defects [^1155A728]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Understanding the full effect of chronic low-dose folic acid is important in interpreting the effect of the mandatory folic acid fortification program in North America.

Objective

We aimed to describe the rate of attainment and steady state (plateau) of red blood cell (RBC) folate in response to long-term intake of 140 μg (designed to mimic fortification) and 400 μg (recommended dose for the primary prevention of neural tube defects) folic acid/d in reproductive-aged women living in a country with minimal fortification.

Design

On the basis of pharmacokinetics principles, it was recently proposed that a steady state should be reached after 40 wk. Thus, 144 women aged 18–40 y were randomly assigned to receive a daily folic acid supplement of 140 (n = 49) or 400 (n = 48) μg or placebo (n = 47) for 40 wk. RBC folate was measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 29, and 40 wk.

Results

After 40 wk, RBC folate did not reach a plateau in either treatment group. Kinetic modeling of the data indicated that RBC folate would approximately double from 779 to 1356 nmol/L in response to 140 μg folic acid/d with only ≈50% of model-estimated steady state conditions achieved at 40 wk. An average RBC folate concentration of 1068 nmol/L after 12 wk of supplementation with 400 μg folic acid/d was readily achieved at 36 wk after continuous intake of 140 μg/d.

Conclusion

Our model shows the considerable length of time required to attain the full effect of low-dose folic acid, which suggests that 140 μg folic acid/d could be as effective as 400 μg folic acid/d taken during the periconceptional period if given sufficient time. This trial is registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12609000215224.

### Initiation and duration of folic acid supplementation in preventing congenital malformations [^112qsTkg]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Folic acid (FA) supplementation is associated with a lower risk of the neural tube and heart defects and is recommended for women of childbearing age. Although there are detailed recommendations, differences in the initiation time and duration of FA supplementation remain poorly studied.

Methods

A multicentre prospective study of 17,713 women was conducted. The incidence of congenital malformations in women taking a recommended dosage (e.g. 0.4 or 0.8 mg/day) of FA was compared with that in women without supplementation. The predicted probability of malformations by the initiation time and duration of FA use was estimated to determine optimal options.

Results

Periconceptional FA supplementation was associated with a lower and insignificant risk of congenital malformations (1.59% vs. 2.37%; odds ratio [OR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44–1.08), heart defects (3.8 vs. 8.0 per 1000 infants; OR, 0.47; 0.21–1.02), and neural tube defects (7.0 vs. 11.5 per 10,000 infants; OR, 0.64; 0.08–5.15). FA use after pregnancy provided greater protection against total malformations. Statistically significant associations were found in women who initiated FA supplementation in the first month of gestation (OR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33–0.91) and in those who supplemented for 1 to 2 months (OR, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36–0.98). Similar results were found for heart defects. The optimal initiation time was 1.5 (optimal range: 1.1 to 1.9) months before pregnancy and a duration of 4.0 (3.7 to 4.4) months was reasonable to achieve the lowest risk of congenital malformations. Heart defect prevention required an earlier initiation (2.2 vs. 1.1 months before pregnancy) and a longer duration (4.7 vs. 3.7 months) than the prevention of other malformations.

Conclusions

The timely initiation of FA supplementation for gestation was associated with a decreased risk of congenital malformations, which was mainly attributed to its protection against heart defects. The initiation of FA supplementation 1.5 months before conception with a duration of 4 months is the preferred option for congenital malformation prevention.

### Use of supplements containing folic acid among women of childbearing age – United States, 2007 [^116EofZG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are serious birth defects of the brain (anencephaly) and spine (spina bifida) that affect approximately 3,000 pregnancies each year in the United States. In 1992, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that all women of childbearing age in the United States capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 microg of folic acid daily to reduce their risk for having a pregnancy affected by NTDs. To assess awareness, knowledge, and behavior related to folic acid among women of childbearing age (aged 18–45 years), CDC analyzed the results of a national survey conducted annually by the Gallup Organization during the period 2003–2007. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, among all women of childbearing age, those aged 18–24 years had the least awareness regarding folic acid consumption (61%), the least knowledge regarding when folic acid should be taken (6%), and the lowest reported daily use of supplements containing folic acid (30%). Because women in this age group account for nearly one third of all births in the United States, promotion of folic acid consumption should be targeted to this population.

### Folic acid supplementation for women with epilepsy who might become pregnant [^115v5RF1]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Low folate levels are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations. Up to half of all pregnancies are unplanned, so official guidelines in a number of countries, including the US, recommend folic acid supplementation for all women who might become pregnant, before they actually start planning to have children. Children born to women who are taking antiepileptic medications, many of which antagonize folate action, are at an increased risk of birth defects. This article highlights a study by Pittschieler et al. that has suggested that supplementation with folic acid might be particularly important in women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic medications — especially valproate. However, the sample size in the study was too small to determine the optimum dose or to detect whether folic acid protects against birth defects. Nonetheless, it is clear that all women of reproductive age, especially those taking certain antiepileptic medications, should take folic acid supplements.

### Guideline: optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects [^113dxFX9]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for myelomeningocele, more specifically with respect to periconceptional folic acid supplementation, WHO 2015 guidelines recommend to aim RBC folate concentrations at > 400 ng/mL (906 nmol/L) in females of reproductive age to achieve the greatest reduction of neural tube defects at the population level. Consider using this threshold as an indicator of folate insufficiency in females of reproductive age. Use this threshold only at the population level as it cannot predict the individual risk of having a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy because low folate concentrations cannot explain all cases of neural tube defects.

### Folic acid supplementation for the prevention of neural tube defects: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114HcCo7]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Neural tube defects are among the most common major congenital anomalies in the United States and may lead to a range of disabilities or death. Daily folic acid supplementation in the periconceptional period can prevent neural tube defects. However, most women do not receive the recommended daily intake of folate from diet alone.

Objective

To update the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age.

Evidence Review

In 2009, the USPSTF reviewed the effectiveness of folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age for the prevention of neural tube defects in infants. The current review assessed new evidence on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation.

Findings

The USPSTF assessed the balance of the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age and determined that the net benefit is substantial. Evidence is adequate that the harms to the mother or infant from folic acid supplementation taken at the usual doses are no greater than small. Therefore, the USPSTF reaffirms its 2009 recommendation.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that all women who are planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400–800 µg) of folic acid. (A recommendation).

### Folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1111BUET]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Neural tube defects are among the most common congenital malformations in the US, with an estimated 3000 pregnancies affected each year. Many of these neural tube defects are caused by low folate levels in the body.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation.

Population

Persons who are planning to or could become pregnant.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that, for persons who are planning to or could become pregnant, there is high certainty that folic acid supplementation has a substantial net benefit to prevent neural tube defects in their offspring.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that all persons planning to or who could become pregnant take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 μg) of folic acid. (A recommendation).

This "applies to all persons who are planning to or could become pregnant" and "does not apply to persons who have had a previous pregnancy affected by neural tube defects or who are at very high risk due to other factors such as family history or those taking medication known to block the function of folic acid". Implementation specifies: "All persons who are planning to or could become pregnant should take a daily supplement or multivitamin containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 μg) of folic acid". Frequency and timing are explicit: "Supplementation should be taken daily. The critical period for folic acid supplementation starts at least 1 month before conception and continues through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy". The statement adds that "Daily supplementation with folic acid is shown to prevent neural tube defects".

### Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy for maternal health and pregnancy outcomes [^111pz9XC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During pregnancy, fetal growth causes an increase in the total number of rapidly dividing cells, which leads to increased requirements for folate. Inadequate folate intake leads to a decrease in serum folate concentration, resulting in a decrease in erythrocyte folate concentration, a rise in homocysteine concentration, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues with rapidly dividing cells

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of oral folic acid supplementation alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) during pregnancy on haematological and biochemical parameters during pregnancy and on pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012) and we contacted major organisations working in micronutrient supplementation, including UNICEF Nutrition Section, World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal and Reproductive Health, WHO Nutrition Division, and National Center on Birth defects and Developmnetal Disabilities, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Selection Criteria

All randomised, cluster-randomised and cross-over controlled trials evaluating supplementation of folic acid alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) in pregnancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Thirty-one trials involving 17,771 women are included in this review. This review found that folic acid supplementation has no impact on pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.38; three studies, 2959 participants), and stillbirths/neonatal deaths (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85; three studies, 3110 participants). However, improvements were seen in the mean birthweight (mean difference (MD) 135.75, 95% CI 47.85 to 223.68). On the other hand, the review found no impact on improving pre-delivery anaemia (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10; eight studies, 4149 participants; random-effects), mean pre-delivery haemoglobin level (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; 12 studies, 1806 participants), mean pre-delivery serum folate levels (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.27; eight studies, 1250 participants; random-effects), and mean pre-delivery red cell folate levels (SMD 1.59, 95% CI -0.07 to 3.26; four studies, 427 participants; random-effects). However, a significant reduction was seen in the incidence of megaloblastic anaemia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38, four studies, 3839 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence of benefit of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes.

### Impact of high-dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on biomarkers of folate status and 1-carbon metabolism: an ancillary study of the folic acid clinical trial (FACT) [^117362pX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Periconceptional folic acid (FA) supplementation is recommended to prevent the occurrence of neural tube defects. Currently, most over-the-counter FA supplements in Canada and the United States contain 1 mg FA and some women are prescribed 5 mg FA/d. High-dose FA is hypothesized to impair 1-carbon metabolism. We aimed to determine folate and 1-carbon metabolism biomarkers in pregnant women exposed to 1 mg or 5 mg FA.

Objectives

This was an ancillary study within the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT), a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III trial designed to assess the efficacy of high-dose FA to prevent preeclampsia.

Methods

For FACT, women were randomized at 8–16 gestational weeks to receive daily 4.0 mg FA (high dose) or placebo (low dose) plus their usual supplementation (≤ 1.1 mg). Women were recruited from 3 Canadian FACT centers and provided nonfasting blood samples at 24–26 gestational weeks for measurement of RBC and serum total folate, serum unmetabolized FA (UMFA), tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methylTHF, 5-formylTHF, 5,10-methenylTHF, and MeFox (pyrazino-s-triazine derivative of 4α-hydroxy-5-methylTHF, a 5-methylTHF oxidation product); total vitamins B-12 and B-6; and plasma total homocysteine. Group differences were determined using χ2, Fisher exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Results

Nineteen (38%) women received high-dose FA and 31 (62%) received low-dose FA. The median RBC folate concentration was 2701 (IQR: 2243–3032) nmol/L and did not differ between groups. The high-dose group had higher serum total folate (median: 148.4 nmol/L, IQR: 110.4–181.2; P = 0.007), UMFA (median: 4.6 nmol/L, IQR: 2.5–33.8; P = 0.008), and 5-methylTHF (median: 126.6 nmol/L, IQR: 98.8–158.6; P = 0.03) compared with the low-dose group (median: 122.8 nmol/L, IQR: 99.5–136.0; median: 1.9 nmol/L, IQR: 0.9–4.1; median: 108.6 nmol/L, IQR: 96.4–123.2, respectively). Other biomarkers of 1-carbon metabolism did not differ.

Conclusions

High-dose FA supplementation in early pregnancy increases maternal serum folate but not RBC folate concentrations, suggesting tissue saturation. Higher UMFA concentrations in women receiving high-dose FA supplements suggest that these doses are supraphysiologic but with no evidence of altered 1-carbon metabolism.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^111Cbss7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC)'s first policy statement in 1993 on the use of FA to reduce NTDs categorized women of childbearing age as either low, intermediate, or high NTD risk (Table 1). Low-risk women planning a pregnancy were recommended to consume 400 μg supplemental FA/d. High-risk women (those with a previous pregnancy affected by an NTD) were recommended to consume 4000 μg supplemental FA/d. The doses for low- and high-risk women were based on the doses used in clinical trials and observational studies. Intermediate-risk women, defined as having had no previous NTD history but being at increased risk owing to certain medical conditions or family history (Table 1), were recommended to consume 1000–4000 μg supplemental FA/d. The intermediate-risk category was based on observations that certain medical conditions are associated with higher NTD risk. Multivitamin supplements sold in Canada at the time generally contained 800 μg FA.

The SOGC guidelines for FA supplement use have since undergone 3 revisions, each of which resulted in modifications to the risk category definitions and/or the recommended doses (Table 1). They have all recommended consuming an FA-containing supplement, in addition to consuming a healthy folate-rich diet. Importantly, in 2007, the SOGC defined low-risk women as those with no personal health risks, having a planned pregnancy, and with good compliance; the recommended dose of supplemental FA was 400–1000 μg. All other women were recommended to consume 5000 μg supplemental FA/d (plus dietary intake) based on an expanded list of risk characteristics including women with obesity, belonging to certain ethnic groups, with a history of poor medication compliance, and with lifestyle issues such as variable diet, inconsistent use of birth control, and possible teratogenic substance use (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, recreational nonprescription drugs). In response to confusion and concern among health care professionals about the 2007 SOGC guideline, Health Canada published a Questions and Answers for Health Professionals document to clarify the approach to identifying women that might benefit from high-dose FA supplementation. The current SOGC guideline, published in 2015, narrowed the 2007 risk definitions and eliminated dose ranges for risk groups. The daily recommended dose for the low-risk group is 400 μg FA, and the low-risk group includes women when they and their male partners have no personal or family history of an NTD or another FA-sensitive birth defect.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^1132T8w5]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Here, we provide the first evidence that the recommended weekly dose of 2.8 mg folic acid, rather than the commonly used 0.4 mg weekly dose, is more effective at increasing RBC folate. Therefore, we would expect the 2.8 mg dose to be more protective against NTDs should a woman or adolescent girl become pregnant. After 16 weeks of treatment, 68% of women in the 2.8 mg group attained an RBC folate > 748 nmol/L, compared with only 8% in the 0.4 mg weekly group. Moreover, at 16 weeks, women receiving 0.4 mg folic acid were not more likely to achieve RBC folate > 748 nmol/L than women receiving 0 mg — further highlighting the minimal impact of providing 0.4 mg once weekly.

With respect to the reduction in NTD, Crider et al estimated a risk reduction from 35.9 (95% CI 28.1 to 46.2) NTDs per 10 000 births to 14.6 (12.4 to 17.0) NTDs per 10 000 births following a 300 nmol/L increase in RBC folate among US women with RBC folate concentrations in the fifth percentile. Given that women in our trial receiving 2.8 mg folic acid per week had a similar increase in RBC folate concentrations, a large risk reduction, such as the one demonstrated above, would be predicted — especially among women with low baseline status. Overall, weekly IFA supplements that contain 60 mg of elemental iron and 2.8 mg of folic acid could not only prevent anaemia but also reduce the risk of NTD if a woman were to become pregnant. The 2.8 mg dose of folic acid would be particularly benefit adolescent girls beause of their high rate of unplanned pregnancies.

### Too much of a good thing? Cancer risk and high dose folic acid in epilepsy [^114wW6NP]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

To address this gap, Vegrim et al conducted a new population-based analysis examining cancer risk among women who have given birth. This medical register-based cohort study included all women with a first birth (at 22 weeks or more of gestation) during 11–21 year timeframes in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden and observed for a first cancer diagnosis during follow-up. High-dose folic acid was defined as filling prescription(s) for 1 mg or 5 mg formulations of folic acid (as recorded in national prescription registers) from 2 years before 22 weeks of a first pregnancy to end of follow-up. Overall, the sample included 1,465,785 women, with 64,485 having received a high dose folic acid prescription. Median follow-up was 5 years for those who received high dose folic acid and 7 years for those who did not, and longest follow-up was 21 years among the cohort.

The main finding was a 20% increase in cancer risk during follow-up among those who had filled high dose folic acid prescriptions (adjusted hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.2), which was slightly lower but still significant when the first 6 months of follow-up were removed (as cancer would not be expected to develop that soon after exposure; hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 1.04–1.2). Specific cancers were also analyzed using rigorous techniques to account for multiple comparisons, and the findings demonstrated a statistically significant 2-fold increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma but no significant risk for other cancers. Cumulative overall dosing of prescription folic acid during follow-up was analyzed, with quartiles of cumulative exposure examined separately for cancer risk. No dose-response relationship was identified, with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.3 for the 2 lowest quartiles (up to 299 mg and 300–999 mg), yet only 1.1 and 1.0 for 1000–1999 mg and ≥ 2000 mg respectively. The analysis did not explore for associations separately among individuals prescribed the 1 mg dosage form versus 5 mg dosage form.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^113TSwpd]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

As per US CDC instructions: if all QC results were within mean (2 SD) limits, the assay was accepted; if more than one of the QC results were outside of the mean (2 SD) limits or any of the QC results were outside of the mean (3 SD) limits, then the assay was rejected. Results from assay runs that passed QC were recorded only when the quadruplets were below 15%. If the coefficient of variation (CV) of the quadruplets was above 15%, the largest outlier was removed and the results recorded as long as the CV of the remaining triplicates was below 10%; otherwise, the sample measurement was repeated.

At the population level, WHO recommends RBC folate concentrations be > 906 nmol/L in women of reproductive age to prevent NTDs. This RBC folate value was generated using folic acid as the calibrator. We used a newer method recommended by the US CDC that uses 5‐methyl tetrahydrofolate as the calibrator. Since 5‐methyl tetrahydrofolate gives lower RBC folate concentrations than folic acid, we used a cut-off of > 748 nmol/L to define the optimal RBC folate concentration for NTD risk reduction.

### Effect of high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on pre-eclampsia (FACT): double blind, phase III, randomised controlled, international, multicentre trial [^114dfnsZ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results of our international randomised controlled multicentre trial did not show evidence that supplementation with high dose folic acid (4.0–5.1 mg) initiated between eight and 16 completed weeks of gestation and continued until delivery prevents pre-eclampsia in at risk women. We adjusted analyses for potential confounders by parity, maternal age, and cigarette smoking and confirmed there was no effect of folic acid on the prevention of pre-eclampsia. When we explored the effect of high dose folic acid on risk of pre-eclampsia by country, no difference in effect was observed.

Comparison with other studies

Supplementation with folic acid during pregnancy is now common in many countries of the world. In our previous cohort study, of 2951 pregnant women recruited between 2002 and 2005 in Ottawa and Kingston, Canada, 2713 (91.9%) took folic acid supplements during pregnancy, and of women who used folic acid supplementation, only 544 (20.0%) discontinued in the third trimester, whereas 447 (16.5%) used more than 2.0 mg/day. Similar patterns were observed in our trial population, with more than 80% of women taking supplemental folic acid. Supplementation with high dose folic acid (usually 4.0–5.0 mg daily) in pregnant women has already become widespread beyond the first trimester. Anecdotal evidence suggests that supplementation with high dose folic acid is occurring outside the recommendations for use only in early pregnancy for prevention of neural tube defects, even though the most recent Cochrane review of folic acid in pregnancy for maternal health outcomes was not able to report on pre-eclampsia owing to lack of data from clinical trials. Caution should always be exercised in recommending treatments before thorough evaluation has been completed, including follow-up of offspring when possible.

### Parity and the use of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy [^112L27Xn]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). High credibility.

Results

The study population consisted of 578 204 children and 228 555 mothers. The mean age of women on their first birth was 29.34 (SD = 5.52), 37.7% of the women had their first birth before the age of 27 years, while 17.6% of the women had their first birth after the age of 35 years. The majority of women lived in the centre of the country (67.3%) and more than half of the women had a medium to high SES (66.7%, table 1).

Table 1
Study population characteristics at index date, for all mothers at the birth of their first child

Overall, 18.6% of women did not purchase FA at all in the year preceding birth of their child, with this value being lower for women with no previous live births (14.2%) and higher for those with parity ≥ 3 (25.2%, table 2).

Table 2
Comparison of mothers who purchased at least once or did not purchase FA within year before birth of each child, by parity

The median dose of FA purchased 12 months before the birth of the first child during the study period (120 mg, IQR = 48–240) was significantly higher than the dose purchased 12 months before the birth of the second and third child (90 mg, IQR = 39–202 and 84 mg, IQR = 36–182 respectively; p < 0.001). For the fourth birth and over, the dose was even lower (75 mg, IQR = 36–165, table 3). The dose reported is the total dose in mg purchased for the whole period; therefore, for nulliparous women, the median daily dose was 120/365 = 0.328 mg.

### A review of European guidelines on periconceptional folic acid supplementation [^114pGEMH]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Strong evidence that folic acid (FA) prevents the majority of cases of neural tube defects (NTDs) has led to national organisations developing guidelines for women concerning periconceptional supplementation. In Europe, there is evidence of national variations in the incidence of NTDs, with a recent Irish study reporting an increase in the rate. This review compares the periconceptional FA supplementation guidelines between the different countries in Europe. An online search of country-specific guidelines produced before 2015 concerning periconceptional FA supplementation was conducted. If an English version was not available directly, the EUROCAT register was searched for the English version of the recommendations. We identified national guidelines from 20 European countries. Over half recommended that FA supplements be taken by women planning a pregnancy, but three recommended that they should be taken by all women of child-bearing age. Four guidelines recommended starting FA at least 4 weeks preconceptionally, but no country recommended starting FA at least 12 weeks preconceptionally as suggested by recently published studies. There is a need for further consideration of the duration of preconceptional FA supplementation specifically. The latest scientific evidence in this area should inform the development of European guidelines on FA, as there is wide variation in current recommendations. Overall, the wide variation in national guidelines concerning periconceptional FA supplementation may in part explain the differences in national rates of NTDs reported by EUROCAT. National guidelines on FA supplementation should be standardised across European countries.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^111CKv3m]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

To help prevent NTDs, WHO recommends weekly IFA supplementation with 2.8 mg folic acid. This dose of folic acid was chosen because it is seven times the daily 0.4 mg dose found to be effective in reducing NTDs in controlled trials. Most weekly supplements currently available contain 60 mg iron and 0.4 mg folic acid, as this formulation is the standard for anaemia prevention and is readily available. Moreover, 0.4 mg folic acid with 60 mg of iron is what is recommended daily during pregnancy, thus, the 2.8 mg requires a different formulation. Of the 4.2 million IFA packs distributed by UNICEF in 2019, only 284 000 contained the WHO recommended folic acid dose of 2.8 mg (Personal communication, Andreas Tjornehoj, UNICEF Supply Division, Copenhagen, 2020). There is a reluctance to switch to IFA supplements containing 2.8 mg of folic acid because of a lack of evidence this dose, or any weekly dose, would prevent NTDs. New folic acid trials with NTD as an outcome are unlikely. Fortunately, cohort studies have found that red blood cell (RBC) folate in early pregnancy is inversely associated with subsequent NTD risk. RBC folate is now a well-accepted biomarker of NTD risk at the population level. While the optimal RBC folate for NTD prevention is not known with certainty, WHO has recommended a concentration > 748 nmol/L for women of reproductive age as desirable at the population level. However, the relationship between RBC folate and NTD risk is continuous, and any increase in RBC folate would be expected to decrease NTD risk. Although the relationship is continuous, there appears to be little additional benefit above this threshold, as the reduction in risk approaches an asymptote at concentrations of ~1058–1216 nmol/L (calibrator adjusted).

Our primary aim was to determine the effect of 16 weeks of weekly iron (60 mg) with 0 mg, 0.4 mg or 2.8 mg of folic acid on RBC folate concentrations in women of reproductive age. We also examined the percentage of women by treatment group who achieved an RBC folate concentration > 748 nmol/L, the concentration associated with a low risk of NTDs. As IFA supplementation is commonly initiated during adolescence in school settings, we secondarily assessed the effect of a 4-week washout period on RBC folate concentrations in an attempt to mimic the effect of school holiday periods.

### Blood folate level needed for fully effective fortification in the prevention of neural tube defects [^114NFaNp]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Countries that have mandated folic acid fortification have done so insufficiently, resulting in mean serum folate levels that are too small to achieve fully effective fortification. Current levels of fortification have resulted in serum folate levels of about 10–16 ng/mLand an approximate 20% reduction in NTD risk. Until fully effective fortification is implemented, all women who may become pregnant should be advised to take a daily folic acid supplement of 4 mg (or 5 mg if 4 mg is not available) instead of 0.4 mg, but folic acid fortification designed to achieve a median serum folate level of about 44 ng/mL is the policy of choice. It obviates the need to take a daily folic acid supplement, which is, anyway, of limited effectiveness because most women do not take supplements when it is needed, immediately before pregnancy. A result that is not surprising given that many pregnancies are unintentional, accidental or unplanned. Moreover, the conscientious preconceptual folic acid supplement takers tend to be wealthier and more highly educated, which unfortunately exacerbates health inequalities.

### Prevention of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes with 4.0 mg of folic acid: community-based randomized clinical trial in Italy and the Netherlands [^115svDrE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Wald et al. addressed the issue of the efficacy of high FA dosage more comprehensively, assessing the effect of increasing FA intake on serum folate levels and on the relation between these levels and the risk of having NTDs during pregnancy. They found that from a typical western background serum folate level of 5 ng/mL, an increase of 0.4 mg/day would reduce the risk of NTDs by about 36%, while taking 5 mg/day would reduce the risk by about 85%. A working group convened by the WHO Regional Office in Europe and Istituto Superiore di Sanità on 11–12 November 2002 endorsed these estimations.

Actually there is no good evidence to advise a different dose to women without an increased risk, women with a foetal NTD during a previous pregnancy or women with another well-known risk factor. If a dose of 4–5 mg/day can prevent recurrence or occurrence in women with well-known risk factors, it should be the same for the occurrence and in women with no known risk factors.

The question remains concerning the best dose of FA supplementation, as the prevalence of CMs worldwide is still high.

Overall, from all these studies it can be speculated that an increased peri-conceptional intake of FA can cause a greater reduction in the risk of NTDs as well as a greater and measurable reduction in the risk of other CMs, including trisomy 21 syndrome.

The hypothesis that a higher intake of FA is related to a higher risk reduction of NTDs and of other CMs is the main rationale for the Italian and Dutch RCTs.

FA supplementation in second and third trimester of pregnancy

During pregnancy, increased folate intake is required for rapid cell proliferation and tissue growth of the uterus and placenta, growth of the foetus, and expansion of the maternal blood volume.

Continued FA supplementation with 0.4 mg/day in trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy can increase maternal and cord blood folate status and prevent the increase in homocysteine concentration that otherwise occurs in late pregnancy.

However, the effect of folate supplementation throughout pregnancy on several other health outcomes is unclear. Observational studies suggest a potential benefit of good maternal folate status on birth weight, placental weight or length of gestation. In contrast, supplementation trials have shown equivocal results.

The meta-analysis of Fekete et al. demonstrated significant dose–response relationship between folate intake and birth weight. However, the results indicated no evidence of any effect of supplementation on placental weight or length of gestation.

### Quantifying the effect of folic acid [^116ey7BZ]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Folic acid is known to prevent neural-tube defects (NTDs) but the size of the effect for a given dose is unclear. We aimed to quantify such an effect.

Methods

We used published data from 13 studies of folic acid supplementation on serum folate concentrations and results from a large cohort study of the risk of NTDs according to serum folate, to measure the preventive effect of specified increases in intake of folic acid.

Findings

Serum folate concentrations increase by 0.94 ng/mL (95% CI 0.77–1.10) for every 0.1 mg/day increase in folic acid intake in women aged 20–35 years, and about double that in people aged 40–65. Every doubling of serum folate concentration roughly halves the risk of an NTD. These two effects can be combined to predict the reduction in risk according to intake of extra folic acid and background serum folate concentration. Such results predict that the preventive effect is greater in women with low serum folate than in those with higher concentrations. The results have also been used to predict direct observations from large randomised trials and the effect of food fortification. From a typical western background serum folate of 5 ng/mL, about 0.2 mg/day (the US level of folic acid fortification) would be expected to reduce NTDs by about 20%; a similar effect can be expected from the current British recommendation (0.24 mg/day). An increase of 0.4 mg/day would reduce risk by about 36%, of 1 mg/day by 57%, and taking a 5-mg tablet daily would reduce risk by about 85%.

Interpretation

Folic acid fortification levels should be increased. Additionally women planning a pregnancy should take 5 mg folic acid tablets daily, instead of the 0.4 mg dose presently recommended.

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^113TWfyf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

The Government of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada both recommend a daily multivitamin supplement containing 400 µg folic acid (FA) for the primary prevention of neural tube defects among low-risk women from before conception and throughout lactation. Prenatal supplements marketed and prescribed in Canada typically exceed the recommended dose, usually providing ≥ 1000 µg FA/d. This high daily dose, coupled with staple-food FA fortification, has resulted in the observation of very high blood folate concentrations among reproductive-aged women consuming FA-containing supplements. The long-term consequences of high folate status on fetal development are unknown; however, evidence from animal studies and some human epidemiologic data suggest potential adverse consequences. To address this issue, a workshop was convened with the overall goal to identify challenges and solutions to aligning supplemental FA intakes with current evidence-based recommendations. Thirty-eight stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and health professional groups participated. Group discussions facilitated the identification and prioritization of 5 key challenges for which solutions and implementation strategies were proposed. The 5 themes encompassed clarity and harmonization of evidence-based guidelines, reformulation or relabeling of FA-containing supplements, access to FA for all women, knowledge dissemination strategies and education of the public and health care professionals, and attitude change to overcome the perception of "more is better". A combination of the proposed implementation strategies involving all key stakeholders and directed to health care professionals and the public may enable a sustainable change to align FA intake during the periconceptional period with evidence-based recommendations.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^113WwUrk]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — folic acid supplementation and caffeine: Female pregnancy folic acid supplementation should be encouraged to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). All women of reproductive age (15–45 years) should take folic acid supplementation, and for average-risk women, supplementation with 400 micrograms per day is adequate. Women at increased risk of NTDs, including those with a prior pregnancy with an NTD or seizure disorders, should be counseled to take 4 mg of folic acid daily; because of the risk of vitamin A toxicity, women who need additional folic acid should not take additional prenatal vitamins and instead should be prescribed additional folic acid supplements. Most prenatal multivitamins contain adequate amounts of folic acid for average-risk women. Prenatal vitamin use is also associated with a lower risk of miscarriage, and moderate caffeine consumption (less than 200 mg per day) does not appear to be a major contributing factor in miscarriages or preterm birth.

Folate status, FA intake, and NTD risk

The WHO defined serum and RBC folate cutoffs for classical folate deficiency based on the relation between these biomarkers and hematologic symptoms of anemia and circulating homocysteine. For RBC folate, this cutoff is 340 nmol/L. The WHO also endorsed a higher RBC folate concentration cutoff of 906 nmol/L, as originally observed by Daly et al. that has been associated with maximal NTD risk reduction for women of reproductive age.

In the United States, where FA is consumed in enriched cereal grain products and ready-to-eat cereals in addition to supplements, intake modelling studies showed that women consuming enriched cereal grain products as their only source of folate had lower RBC folate status and higher predicted NTD prevalence than women consuming additional supplemental sources of FA. Further findings have shown that achieving the optimal RBC folate concentration for NTD risk reduction requires a daily intake of ∼600 μg dietary folate equivalent (∼400 μg FA/d), an intake that is only achieved in women consuming FA-containing supplements in addition to fortified foods.

Canadian recommendations for periconceptional FA supplement use for the prevention of NTDs

Health Canada's first recommendation for FA intake in 1993 stated that women should consult their physician about FA supplements as early as possible when planning a pregnancy (Table 1). It noted that women who have had a previous pregnancy with an NTD are at higher risk of having another NTD-affected pregnancy and should consult their physician. The guideline recommended that all women of childbearing potential follow Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating and take care to choose foods higher in folate. Subsequent iterations of the Health Canada recommendation, and later also the Public Health Agency of Canada recommendation, stated that all women who could become pregnant and those who are pregnant should consume a multivitamin supplement containing 400 μg FA and women at higher risk of an NTD-affected pregnancy, such as those with a previous NTD-affected pregnancy, a family history of NTDs, diabetes, or taking an anticonvulsant drug, may require a higher dose and should refer to their physician about an appropriate FA supplement dose.

### Blood folate level needed for fully effective fortification in the prevention of neural tube defects [^1138wkhL]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2014, Crider and colleaguesused data from two studies carried out in China. One of the studies described as a Folic Acid Dosing trial estimated the relationship between folic acid supplement dose and RBC folate concentration using a single dose of supplements (0.4 mg/day) and assessing dose by duration of supplement use at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months among 317 women. The other study, described as a Community Intervention Project, was performed on about 230 000 women. The women were advised to take 0.4 mg of folic acid supplements per day, and the NTD prevalence was recorded. About 60% did not take any supplements during the study period. Crider and colleagues used the first study to estimate RBC folate in the second study based on consumption of folic acid supplement use in the second study and then combined information from both studies to estimate the relationship between RBC folate and NTD risk. The authors concluded that there was a threshold at an RBC folate level of about 1000 nmol/L (441 ng/mL).

We here explore the basis for the long-standing difference in opinion on the issue of whether or not there is a threshold and the implications for folic acid fortification policy.

A number of research priorities and activities to facilitate the proposed solutions are described in Table 4. At a high level, solutions focused on strategies to increase awareness of the SOGC and Health Canada harmonized guidelines for FA and NTD prevention among low-risk women for both health care professionals and consumers. A refreshed public health campaign was proposed that would use innovative marketing strategies (e.g. front-of-package messaging on or coupons in sanitary products) and online social media targeting all women of childbearing age, not just those planning a pregnancy.

TABLE 4
Research priorities and other activities to facilitate solutions 1

Based on the discussions, workshop participants felt that if health care professionals are going to advise women to take a multivitamin supplement containing 400 μg/d of FA, one will need to be made widely available. Further, ownership by all stakeholders and not deflection of responsibility will be required to move this forward. There was a general appreciation amongst workshop participants that education regarding FA recommendations for the prevention of NTDs and availability of the supplement need to occur in concert, and industry would require time to make the change. Finally, although the best available evidence in Canada suggests that 80% of women have blood values that are maximally protective against an NTD, very little is known about the remaining 20% in terms of who they are and whether they are capable of becoming pregnant, or have access to prenatal supplements and family planning services. An improved understanding of this group of women and how to reach them was identified as a key research priority.

### Effect of high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on pre-eclampsia (FACT): double blind, phase III, randomised controlled, international, multicentre trial [^113m4yhx]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia is a serious medical condition, affecting about 3–5% of pregnancies, accounting for more than 35 000 maternal deaths annually worldwide and an important factor in maternal morbidity. Pre-eclampsia affects multiple organ systems and leads to an increased risk of severe complications in pregnancy. Since delivery of the placenta is the only known cure, pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of indicated preterm delivery, perinatal morbidity, mortality, and long term disability. Epidemiological studies of the association between folic acid supplementation and the incidence of pre-eclampsia have shown a potential protective effect, although findings have been inconsistent. In a randomised trial of supplementation with a multivitamin containing 0.8 mg folic acid and hypertension in pregnancy in a high risk population of women positive for antibodies to HIV, a 38% reduction was observed in the primary composite outcome of gestational hypertension (including pre-eclampsia or eclampsia) in the intervention group compared with placebo group. Other forms of folate, including 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, have been investigated with similar results, whereas folic acid antagonists have shown the opposite effect, increasing the risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas [^116rgTs1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition Malaria, an infectious disease transmitted by the bite of female mosquitoes from several Anopheles species, occurs in 87 countries with ongoing transmission (WHO 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that, in 2019, approximately 229 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, with 94% occurring in the WHO's African region (WHO 2020). Of these malaria cases, an estimated 409,000 deaths occurred globally, with 67% occurring in children under five years of age (WHO 2020). Malaria also negatively impacts the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period (WHO 2020). Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP), an antifolate antimalarial, has been widely used across sub-Saharan Africa as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria since it was first introduced in Malawi in 1993 (Filler 2006). Due to increasing resistance to SP, in 2000 the WHO recommended that one of several artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) be used instead of SP for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Global Partnership to Roll Back Malaria 2001). However, despite these recommendations, SP continues to be advised for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi), whether the person has malaria or not (WHO 2013). Description of the intervention Folate (vitamin B9) includes both naturally occurring folates and folic acid, the fully oxidized monoglutamic form of the vitamin, used in dietary supplements and fortified food. Folate deficiency (e.g. red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations of less than 305 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L); serum or plasma concentrations of less than 7 nmol/L) is common in many parts of the world and often presents as megaloblastic anaemia, resulting from inadequate intake, increased requirements, reduced absorption, or abnormal metabolism of folate (Bailey 2015; WHO 2015a). Pregnant women have greater folate requirements; inadequate folate intake (evidenced by RBC folate concentrations of less than 400 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL), or 906 nmol/L) prior to and during the first month of pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects, preterm delivery, low birthweight, and fetal growth restriction (Bourassa 2019). The WHO recommends that all women who are trying to conceive consume 400 micrograms (µg) of folic acid daily from the time they begin trying to conceive through to 12 weeks of gestation (WHO 2017). In 2015, the WHO added the dosage of 0.4 mg of folic acid to the essential drug list (WHO 2015c). Alongside daily oral iron (30 mg to 60 mg elemental iron), folic acid supplementation is recommended for pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects, maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birthweight, and preterm birth in settings where anaemia in pregnant women is a severe public health problem (i.e. where at least 40% of pregnant women have a blood haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 110 g/L). How the intervention might work Potential interactions between folate status and malaria infection The malaria parasite requires folate for survival and growth; this has led to the hypothesis that folate status may influence malaria risk and severity. In rhesus monkeys, folate deficiency has been found to be protective against Plasmodium cynomolgi malaria infection, compared to folate-replete animals (Metz 2007). Alternatively, malaria may induce or exacerbate folate deficiency due to increased folate utilization from haemolysis and fever. Further, folate status measured via RBC folate is not an appropriate biomarker of folate status in malaria-infected individuals since RBC folate values in these individuals are indicative of both the person's stores and the parasite's folate synthesis. A study in Nigeria found that children with malaria infection had significantly higher RBC folate concentrations compared to children without malaria infection, but plasma folate levels were similar (Bradley-Moore 1985). Why it is important to do this review The malaria parasite needs folate for survival and growth in humans. For individuals, adequate folate levels are critical for health and well-being, and for the prevention of anaemia and neural tube defects. Many countries rely on folic acid supplementation to ensure adequate folate status in at-risk populations. Different formulations for folic acid supplements are available in many international settings, with dosages ranging from 400 µg to 5 mg. Evaluating folic acid dosage levels used in supplementation efforts may increase public health understanding of its potential impacts on malaria risk and severity and on treatment failures. Examining folic acid interactions with antifolate antimalarial medications and with malaria disease progression may help countries in malaria-endemic areas determine what are the most appropriate lower dose folic acid formulations for at-risk populations. The WHO has highlighted the limited evidence available and has indicated the need for further research on biomarkers of folate status, particularly interactions between RBC folate concentrations and tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antifolate antimalarial drugs (WHO 2015b). An earlier Cochrane Review assessed the effects and safety of iron supplementation, with or without folic acid, in children living in hyperendemic or holoendemic malaria areas; it demonstrated that iron supplementation did not increase the risk of malaria, as indicated by fever and the presence of parasites in the blood (Neuberger 2016). Further, this review stated that folic acid may interfere with the efficacy of SP; however, the efficacy and safety of folic acid supplementation on these outcomes has not been established. This review will provide evidence on the effectiveness of daily folic acid supplementation in healthy and malaria-infected individuals living in malaria-endemic areas. Additionally, it will contribute to achieving both the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030 (WHO 2015d), and United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (to ensure healthy lives and to promote well-being for all of all ages) (United Nations 2021), and evaluating whether the potential effects of folic acid supplementation, at different doses (e.g. 0.4 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg daily), interferes with the effect of drugs used for prevention or treatment of malaria.

Objectives

To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, at various doses, on malaria susceptibility (risk of infection) and severity among people living in areas with various degrees of malaria endemicity. We will examine the interaction between folic acid supplements and antifolate antimalarial drugs. Specifically, we will aim to answer the following. Among uninfected people living in malaria endemic areas, who are taking or not taking antifolate antimalarials for malaria prophylaxis, does taking a folic acid-containing supplement increase susceptibility to or severity of malaria infection? Among people with malaria infection who are being treated with antifolate antimalarials, does folic acid supplementation increase the risk of treatment failure?

Search methods for identification of studies A search will be conducted to identify completed and ongoing studies, without date or language restrictions. Electronic searches A search strategy will be designed to include the appropriate subject headings and text word terms related to each intervention of interest and study design of interest (see Appendix 1). Searches will be broken down by these two criteria (intervention of interest and study design of interest) to allow for ease of prioritization, if necessary. The study design filters recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), and those designed by Cochrane for identifying clinical trials for MEDLINE and Embase, will be used (SIGN 2020). There will be no date or language restrictions. Non-English articles identified for inclusion will be translated into English. If translations are not possible, advice will be requested from the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group and the record will be stored in the "Awaiting assessment" section of the review until a translation is available. The following electronic databases will be searched for primary studies. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Embase. MEDLINE. Scopus. Web of Science (both the Social Science Citation Index and the Science Citation Index). We will conduct manual searches of ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Evaluation and Research Database (ERD), in order to identify relevant ongoing or planned trials, abstracts, and full-text reports of evaluations, studies, and surveys related to programmes on folic acid supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Additionally, manual searches of grey literature to identify RCTs that have not yet been published but are potentially eligible for inclusion will be conducted in the following sources. Global Index Medicus (GIM). African Index Medicus (AIM). Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (IMEMR). Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRO). Index Medicus for the South-East Asian Region (IMSEAR). The Spanish Bibliographic Index in Health Sciences (IBECS) (ibecs.isciii.es/). Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) (journals.lww.com/ijmr/pages/default.aspx). Native Health Database (nativehealthdatabase.net/). Scielo (www.scielo.br/). Searching other resources Handsearches of the five journals with the highest number of included studies in the last 12 months will be conducted to capture any relevant articles that may not have been indexed in the databases at the time of the search. We will contact the authors of included studies and will check reference lists of included papers for the identification of additional records. For assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished studies, we will contact the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) and the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM) of the CDC, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Nutrition International (NI), Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), and Hellen Keller International (HKI). Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two review authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts of articles retrieved by each search to assess eligibility, as determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies deemed eligible for inclusion by both review authors in the abstract screening phase will advance to the full-text screening phase, and full-text copies of all eligible papers will be retrieved. If full articles cannot be obtained, we will attempt to contact the authors to obtain further details of the studies. If such information is not obtained, we will classify the study as "awaiting assessment" until further information is published or made available to us. The same two review authors will independently assess the eligibility of full-text articles for inclusion in the systematic review. If any discrepancies occur between the studies selected by the two review authors, a third review author will provide arbitration. Each trial will be scrutinized to identify multiple publications from the same data set, and the justification for excluded trials will be documented. A PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process will be presented to provide information on the number of records identified in the literature searches, the number of studies included and excluded, and the reasons for exclusion (Moher 2009). The list of excluded studies, along with their reasons for exclusion at the full-text screening phase, will also be created. Data extraction and management Two review authors will independently extract data for the final list of included studies using a standardized data specification form. Discrepancies observed between the data extracted by the two authors will be resolved by involving a third review author and reaching a consensus. Information will be extracted on study design components, baseline participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes. For individually randomized trials, we will record the number of participants experiencing the event and the number analyzed in each treatment group or the effect estimate reported (e.g. risk ratio (RR)) for dichotomous outcome measures. For count data, we will record the number of events and the number of person-months of follow-up in each group. If the number of person-months is not reported, the product of the duration of follow-up and the number of children evaluated will be used to estimate this figure. We will calculate the rate ratio and standard error (SE) for each study. Zero events will be replaced by 0.5. We will extract both adjusted and unadjusted covariate incidence rate ratios if they are reported in the original studies. For continuous data, we will extract means (arithmetic or geometric) and a measure of variance (standard deviation (SD), SE, or confidence interval (CI)), percentage or mean change from baseline, and the numbers analyzed in each group. SDs will be computed from SEs or 95% CIs, assuming a normal distribution of the values. Haemoglobin values in g/dL will be calculated by multiplying haematocrit or packed cell volume values by 0.34, and studies reporting haemoglobin values in g/dL will be converted to g/L. In cluster-randomized trials, we will record the unit of randomization (e.g. household, compound, sector, or village), the number of clusters in the trial, and the average cluster size. The statistical methods used to analyze the trials will be documented, along with details describing whether these methods adjusted for clustering or other covariates. We plan to extract estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for each outcome. Where results are adjusted for clustering, we will extract the treatment effect estimate and the SD or CI. If the results are not adjusted for clustering, we will extract the data reported. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors (KSC, LFY) will independently assess the risk of bias for each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias 2' tool (RoB 2) for randomized studies (Sterne 2019). Judgements about the risk of bias of included studies will be made according to the recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021). Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, or by involving a third review author. The interest of our review will be to assess the effect of assignment to the interventions at baseline. We will evaluate each primary outcome using the RoB2 tool. The five domains of the Cochrane RoB2 tool include the following. Bias arising from the randomization process. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions. Bias due to missing outcome data. Bias in measurement of the outcome. Bias in selection of the reported result. Each domain of the RoB2 tool comprises the following. A series of 'signalling' questions. A judgement about the risk of bias for the domain, facilitated by an algorithm that maps responses to the signalling questions to a proposed judgement. Free-text boxes to justify responses to the signalling questions and 'Risk of bias' judgements. An option to predict (and explain) the likely direction of bias. Responses to signalling questions elicit information relevant to an assessment of the risk of bias. These response options are as follows. Yes (may indicate either low or high risk of bias, depending on the most natural way to ask the question). Probably yes. Probably no. No. No information (may indicate no evidence of that problem or an absence of information leading to concerns about there being a problem). Based on the answer to the signalling question, a 'Risk of bias' judgement is assigned to each domain. These judgements include one of the following. High risk of bias Low risk of bias Some concerns To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the randomized studies, we will use the Excel template, available at www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob-2–0-tool/current-version-of-rob-2. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Risk of bias in cluster randomized controlled trials For the cluster randomized trials, we will be using the RoB2 tool to analyze the five standard domains listed above along with Domain 1b (bias arising from the timing of identification or recruitment of participants) and its related signalling questions. To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the cluster RCTs, we will use the Excel template available at https://sites.google.com/site/riskofbiastool/welcome/rob-2-0-tool/rob-2-for-cluster-randomized-trials. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Risk of bias in cross-over randomized controlled trials For cross-over randomized trials, we will be using the RoB2 tool to analyze the five standard domains listed above along with Domain 2 (bias due to deviations from intended interventions), and Domain 3 (bias due to missing outcome data), and their respective signalling questions. To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the cross-over RCTs, we will use the Excel template, available at https://sites.google.com/site/riskofbiastool/welcome/rob-2-0-tool/rob-2-for-crossover-trials, for each risk of bias judgement of cross-over randomized studies. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Overall risk of bias The overall 'Risk of bias' judgement for each specific trial being assessed will be based on each domain-level judgement. The overall judgements include the following. Low risk of bias (the trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains). Some concerns (the trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain but is not judged to be at high risk of bias for any domain). High risk of bias (the trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain, or is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result). The 'risk of bias' assessments will inform our GRADE evaluations of the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables and will also be used to inform the sensitivity analyses; (see Sensitivity analysis). If there is insufficient information in study reports to enable an assessment of the risk of bias, studies will be classified as "awaiting assessment" until further information is published or made available to us. Measures of treatment effect Dichotomous data For dichotomous data, we will present proportions and, for two-group comparisons, results as average RR or odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs. Ordered categorical data Continuous data We will report results for continuous outcomes as the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs, if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. Where some studies have reported endpoint data and others have reported change-from-baseline data (with errors), we will combine these in the meta-analysis, if the outcomes were reported using the same scale. We will use the standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% CIs, to combine trials that measured the same outcome but used different methods. If we do not find three or more studies for a pooled analysis, we will summarize the results in a narrative form. Unit of analysis issues Cluster-randomized trials We plan to combine results from both cluster-randomized and individually randomized studies, providing there is little heterogeneity between the studies. If the authors of cluster-randomized trials conducted their analyses at a different level from that of allocation, and they have not appropriately accounted for the cluster design in their analyses, we will calculate the trials' effective sample sizes to account for the effect of clustering in data. When one or more cluster-RCT reports RRs adjusted for clustering, we will compute cluster-adjusted SEs for the other trials. When none of the cluster-RCTs provide cluster-adjusted RRs, we will adjust the sample size for clustering. We will divide, by the estimated design effects (DE), the number of events and number evaluated for dichotomous outcomes and the number evaluated for continuous outcomes, where DE = 1 + ((average cluster size 1) * ICC). The derivation of the estimated ICCs and DEs will be reported. We will utilize the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), derived from the trial (if available), or from another source (e.g., using the ICCs derived from other, similar trials) and then calculate the design effect with the formula provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021). If this approach is used, we will report it and undertake sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of variations in ICC. Studies with more than two treatment groups If we identify studies with more than two intervention groups (multi-arm studies), where possible we will combine groups to create a single pair-wise comparison or use the methods set out in the Cochrane Handbook to avoid double counting study participants (Higgins 2021). For the subgroup analyses, when the control group was shared by two or more study arms, we will divide the control group (events and total population) over the number of relevant subgroups to avoid double counting the participants. Trials with several study arms can be included more than once for different comparisons. Cross-over trials From cross-over trials, we will consider the first period of measurement only and will analyze the results together with parallel-group studies. Multiple outcome events In several outcomes, a participant might experience more than one outcome event during the trial period. For all outcomes, we will extract the number of participants with at least one event. Dealing with missing data We will contact the trial authors if the available data are unclear, missing, or reported in a format that is different from the format needed. We aim to perform a 'per protocol' or 'as observed' analysis; otherwise, we will perform a complete case analysis. This means that for treatment failure, we will base the analyses on the participants who received treatment and the number of participants for which there was an inability to clear malarial parasitaemia or prevent recrudescence after administration of an antimalarial medicine reported in the studies. Assessment of heterogeneity Heterogeneity in the results of the trials will be assessed by visually examining the forest plot to detect non-overlapping CIs, using the Chi2 test of heterogeneity (where a P value of less than 0.1 indicates statistical significance) and the I2 statistic of inconsistency (with a value of greater than 50% denoting moderate levels of heterogeneity). When statistical heterogeneity is present, we will investigate the reasons for it, using subgroup analysis. Assessment of reporting biases We will construct a funnel plot to assess the effect of small studies for the main outcome (when including more than 10 trials). Data synthesis The primary analysis will include all eligible studies that provide data regardless of the overall risk of bias as assessed by the RoB2 tool. Analyses will be conducted using Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020). Cluster-RCTs will be included in the main analysis after adjustment for clustering (see the previous section on cluster-RCTs). The meta-analysis will be performed using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model or the generic inverse variance method (when adjustment for clustering is performed by adjusting SEs), as appropriate. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity The overall risk of bias will not be used as the basis in conducting our subgroup analyses. However, where data are available, we plan to conduct the following subgroup analyses, independent of heterogeneity. Dose of folic acid supplementation: higher doses (4 mg or more, daily) versus lower doses (less than 4 mg, daily). Moderate-severe anaemia at baseline (mean haemoglobin of participants in a trial at baseline below 100 g/L for pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months, and below 110 g/L for other populations) versus normal at baseline (mean haemoglobin above 100 g/L for pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months, and above 110 g/L for other populations). Antimalarial drug resistance to parasite: known resistance versus no resistance versus unknown/mixed/unreported parasite resistance. Folate status at baseline: Deficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration of less than 305 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration of less than 7nmol/L) and Insufficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration from 305 to less than 906 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration from 7 to less than 25 nmol/L) versus Sufficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration above 906 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration above 25 nmol/L). Presence of anaemia at baseline: yes versus no. Mandatory fortification status: yes, versus no (voluntary or none). We will only use the primary outcomes in any subgroup analyses, and we will limit subgroup analyses to those outcomes for which three or more trials contributed data. Comparisons between subgroups will be performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020). Sensitivity analysis We will perform a sensitivity analysis, using the risk of bias as a variable to explore the robustness of the findings in our primary outcomes. We will verify the behaviour of our estimators by adding and removing studies with a high risk of bias overall from the analysis. That is, studies with a low risk of bias versus studies with a high risk of bias. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence For the assessment across studies, we will use the GRADE approach, as outlined in (Schünemann 2021). We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations based on RoB2 judgements, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the primary outcomes. The GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GRADEpro) will be used to import data from Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020) to create 'Summary of Findings' tables. The primary outcomes for the main comparison will be listed with estimates of relative effects, along with the number of participants and studies contributing data for those outcomes. These tables will provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall certainty of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude of the effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we considered. We will include only primary outcomes in the summary of findings tables. For each individual outcome, two review authors (KSC, LFY) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2011). For assessments of the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome that includes pooled data from included trials, we will downgrade the evidence from 'high certainty' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias).

### Folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^115vHtuj]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation status — reaffirmation: This recommendation is a reaffirmation of the USPSTF 2017 recommendation statement; in 2017 the USPSTF found convincing evidence that the benefits of supplementation substantially outweigh the harms (A recommendation), and in the current update the USPSTF found no new substantial evidence that could change the recommendation and reaffirms its recommendation that all persons planning to or who could become pregnant take a daily supplement of folic acid.

### Folic acid supplementation for the prevention of neural tube defects: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114k6Wx1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in the United States. In 1996, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that all women planning a pregnancy or capable of conception take a supplement containing folic acid to reduce the risk for NTDs.

Purpose

To search for new evidence published since 1996 on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation for women of childbearing age to prevent neural tube defects in offspring, to inform an updated USPSTF recommendation.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials searches from January 1995 through December 2008, recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

English-language randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; case-control studies; systematic reviews; and meta-analyses were selected if they provided information on the benefits and harms of folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age to reduce NTDs in offspring.

Data Extraction

All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.

Data Synthesis

Four observational studies reported benefit of reduction of risk for NTDs associated with folic acid-containing supplements. Differences in study type and methods prevent the calculation of a summary of the reduction in risk. The one included study on harms reported that the association of twinning with folic acid intake disappeared after adjustment for in vitro fertilization and underreporting of folic acid intake.

Limitations

The evidence on dose was limited. No evidence was found on the potential harm of masking vitamin B(12) deficiency in women of childbearing age. The search focused on the association of NTDs with supplementation only and therefore does not provide a comprehensive review of the effects of folic acid on all possible outcomes or of the effects of dietary intake of folic acid.

Conclusion

New observational evidence supports previous evidence from a randomized, controlled trial that folic acid-containing supplements reduce the risk for NTD-affected pregnancies. The association of folic acid use with twin gestation may be confounded by fertility interventions.

Folic acid supplementation — harms and safety signals show that the USPSTF "found adequate evidence that folic acid supplementation at usual doses is not associated with serious harms". Regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD), "Six fair-quality cohort studies and 1 fair-quality case-control study… (n = 761 225)" were reviewed, and "No study reported statistically significant associations between supplementation and increased risk of ASD". Additional findings include: "Two studies reported statistically significant reductions of autism associated with folic acid supplementation", while "Three studies reported on associations between folic acid supplementation and ASD by dose and found no differences". For timing, "Two studies reported on associations between folic acid supplementation and ASD by timing. Neither reported harms; however, 1 study reported a statistically significant reduction of ASD associated with folic acid supplementation initiation in weeks 5 to 8 of the pregnancy". One trial "found no differences between an exposure of 4 mg vs 0.4 mg of folic acid daily", and "One cohort study (n = 429 004) found no association between folic acid supplementation and maternal cancer".

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^111BGvXc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

The Government of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada both recommend a daily multivitamin supplement containing 400 µg folic acid (FA) for the primary prevention of neural tube defects among low-risk women from before conception and throughout lactation. Prenatal supplements marketed and prescribed in Canada typically exceed the recommended dose, usually providing ≥ 1000 µg FA/d. This high daily dose, coupled with staple-food FA fortification, has resulted in the observation of very high blood folate concentrations among reproductive-aged women consuming FA-containing supplements. The long-term consequences of high folate status on fetal development are unknown; however, evidence from animal studies and some human epidemiologic data suggest potential adverse consequences. To address this issue, a workshop was convened with the overall goal to identify challenges and solutions to aligning supplemental FA intakes with current evidence-based recommendations. Thirty-eight stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and health professional groups participated. Group discussions facilitated the identification and prioritization of 5 key challenges for which solutions and implementation strategies were proposed. The 5 themes encompassed clarity and harmonization of evidence-based guidelines, reformulation or relabeling of FA-containing supplements, access to FA for all women, knowledge dissemination strategies and education of the public and health care professionals, and attitude change to overcome the perception of "more is better". A combination of the proposed implementation strategies involving all key stakeholders and directed to health care professionals and the public may enable a sustainable change to align FA intake during the periconceptional period with evidence-based recommendations.

### Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects: World Health Organization guidelines [^115CEShF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Adoption and Implementation of the Guidelines

Countries could undertake five major activities when implementing the WHO guidelines: 1) assess the RBC folate status among women of reproductive age; 2) based on population status, determine the need for interventions, such as fortification of staple foods with folic acid or periconceptional folic acid supplementation, and how to best reach populations at risk for insufficient folate concentrations; 3) implement interventions; 4) reassess population RBC folate status (at least 6–12 months after the intervention); and 5) make adjustments to the prevention program as necessary. Applying the guidelines is not necessarily a sequential process following the preceding order. For example, countries that are considering fortifying staple foods with folic acid (or countries with existing fortification policies) could proceed with those interventions and not wait to assess RBC folate concentrations because the public health benefit of this intervention is clearly established. In such circumstances, a country might choose to measure RBC folate status after fortification implementation to determine the proportion of the population meeting or exceeding the WHO-recommended RBC folate cutoff concentration and identify populations at increased risk for NTDs because of insufficient concentrations. Furthermore, although the guidelines provide an important tool to assist with NTD prevention interventions, birth defects surveillance continues to be critical for monitoring the prevalence of birth defects because not all NTDs are folate sensitive.

### Folic acid [^114y39w3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Except during pregnancy and lactation, folic acid should not be given in therapeutic doses greater than 0.4 mg daily until pernicious anemia has been ruled out. Patients with pernicious anemia receiving more than 0.4 mg of folic acid daily who are inadequately treated with vitamin B12may show reversion of the hematologic parameters to normal, but neurologic manifestations due to vitamin B12deficiency will progress. Doses of folic acid exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) should not be included in multivitamin preparations; if therapeutic amounts are necessary, folic acid should be given separately.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^114RFGsV]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Finally, we did not measure MTHFR genotype nor account for differences in efficacy based on BMI. The MTHFR TT variant is associated with lower plasma and RBC folate concentrations; however, the prevalence of the TT variant is thought to be relatively low in the Malay population. A higher BMI has been shown to alter distributions of plasma and cellular folate, leading to lower plasma concentrations and higher RBC folate concentrations.WHO guideline states that weekly IFA supplementation is to be targeted to all menstruating adolescent girls and women in populations where the prevalence of anaemia in non-pregnant women of reproductive age is 20% or higher. In practice, there is unlikely to be different doses of IFA supplements for populations depending on their BMI or MTHFR genotype.

Daily supplementation with folic acid remains the best practice to prevent NTDs in women planning a pregnancy. Where women are not planning to become pregnant, or do not take a daily supplement, our findings show that weekly IFA supplements containing the WHO recommended dose of 2.8 mg folic acid are more effective at improving RBC folate concentrations and reducing the risk of NTDs than the dose currently used in practice (0.4 mg folic acid per week). In order to achieve success in a real world setting, weekly IFA programmes must be designed using evidence-based best practices that encourage maximal coverage and adherence. We recommend that countries currently using weekly IFA supplements containing 0.4 mg folic acid be enabled and supported to switch to 2.8 mg.

### Folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1121boJn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

In 1996, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a multivitamin supplement containing folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects. This recommendation is an update of the 1996 USPSTF recommendation.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on folic acid supplementation in women of childbearing age published since the 1996 USPSTF recommendation. The USPSTF did not review the evidence on folic acid food fortification, counseling to increase dietary intake, or screening for neural tube defects.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that all women planning or capable of pregnancy take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 microg) of folic acid. (Grade A recommendation).

### Effect of high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on pre-eclampsia (FACT): double blind, phase III, randomised controlled, international, multicentre trial [^115tDRE3]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion and policy implications

Future directions for this research include exploration of the increased risk of pre-eclampsia in mothers carrying twins and using high dose folic acid, and the potential protective effect of folic acid on perinatal death warrants ongoing study. Perhaps most importantly, FACT provides a unique opportunity to follow the participants and their offspring to study the effects of high dose folic acid during prenatal development on long term maternal and child health, given the potential epigenetic effects of folic acid. Funding has been obtained to follow these FACT offspring for mortality and neurocognitive development through to six years of age.

Our well powered trial did not find benefit for high dose folic acid supplementation beyond the first trimester for the prevention of pre-eclampsia or related maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. The trial deals with an important public health issue: the lack of demonstrated benefit of high dose folic acid supplementation beyond the first trimester for women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia indicates that high dose recommendation should now cease, and the search for an effective and acceptable strategy to prevent pre-eclampsia must continue.

CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS IN ALIGNING SUPPLEMENTAL FA INTAKE WITH EXPERT GUIDELINES

After the formal presentations, the 38 workshop participants were assigned to 1 of 5 working groups. Equal representation in each group from each stakeholder group (i.e. academia, industry, government, and professional associations) was ensured by random assignment before the workshop. To facilitate open and frank discussion, participants were advised that although they would be identified as a workshop participant, no statement would be attributed to any individual or organization in the workshop proceedings. The working groups first convened to identify challenges in aligning FA intake for women of childbearing age with recommendations to reduce NTD-affected pregnancies in low-risk women. Once these challenges were shared with the larger group and summarized into statements, participants were asked to individually prioritize what they thought were the 5 most important challenges by placing a sticker on ≤ 5 of the summary statements posted around the room. The smaller working groups were then asked to reconvene to develop potential solutions to the top 5 challenges, which were then shared with the larger group. The last session consisted of a full group discussion focusing on prioritization of the solutions. The top 5 challenges and the proposed solutions are detailed in Table 3.

### Using FIGO nutrition checklist counselling in pregnancy: a review to support healthcare professionals [^112zCtLC]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

9 FOLIC ACID

Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, a B vitamin naturally found in leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, and liver. Deficiency increases the risk of neural tube defects in children. As a result, supplementation of 400 μg per day, paired with a healthy balanced diet, is recommended in many countries for women of childbearing age, regardless of their intention to conceive given the high rates of unplanned pregnancy worldwide. The folic acid supplement can continue throughout pregnancy. Some women are at increased risk of neural tube defects, including those with obesity, and may require a higher dose (up to 5 mg/day) for at least the first 12 weeks of pregnancy,(Table 2). More than 40 countries have adopted mandatory folic acid fortification policies to prevent neural tube defects, and this may affect maternal levels. Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause anemia.

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^117NtMEi]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

While no studies have compared iron with different weekly folic acid doses on RBC folate, weekly dosing has been compared with daily supplementation in at least two trials. Unsurprisingly, daily dosing is more effective than weekly at increasing blood folate indices. Among New Zealand women (18–40 years), daily supplementation with 0.4 mg folic acid was more effective than 2.8 mg weekly at increasing RBC folate after 12 weeks (MD (95% CI) 411 (325 to 504) and 265 (192 to 345) nmol/L, respectively) compared with the 0 mg group. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that 2.8 mg folic acid weekly would still be expected to decrease NTD risk. Moreover, in the New Zealand study, over half of the women taking the weekly folic acid supplement achieved an RBC folate concentration associated with a low risk of NTD at week 12 compared with nearly three-quarters in the daily 0.4 mg group. Compared with their respective placebo groups, the MD in RBC folate among women receiving 2.8 mg folic acid weekly in the New Zealand study was not as great as the difference reported in our study (MD 265 vs 355 nmol/L). The greater difference in mean RBC folate observed in our study may be due to the longer duration of our study compared with the New Zealand study (16 vs 12 weeks), as baseline RBC folate concentrations were similar after calibrator adjustment.

### Optimal serum and red blood cell folate concentrations in women of reproductive age for prevention of neural tube defects: World Health Organization guidelines [^111k8q3B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida, anencephaly, and encephalocele are serious birth defects of the brain and spine that occur during the first month of pregnancy when the neural tube fails to close completely. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies have shown that adequate daily consumption of folic acid before and during early pregnancy considerably reduces the risk for NTDs. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that women capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 µg of folic acid daily for NTD prevention. Furthermore, fortification of staple foods (e.g., wheat flour) with folic acid has decreased folate-sensitive NTD prevalence in multiple settings and is a highly cost-effective intervention.

### Multiple-micronutrient supplementation for women during pregnancy [^117MR2Bk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple-micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. They are exacerbated in pregnancy due to the increased demands of the developing fetus, leading to potentially adverse effects on the mother and baby. A consensus is yet to be reached regarding the replacement of iron and folic acid supplementation with MMNs. Since the last update of this Cochrane Review in 2017, evidence from several trials has become available. The findings of this review will be critical to inform policy on micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits of oral multiple-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes.

Search Methods

For this 2018 update, on 23 February 2018 we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

All prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating MMN supplementation with iron and folic acid during pregnancy and its effects on pregnancy outcomes were eligible, irrespective of language or the publication status of the trials. We included cluster-randomised trials, but excluded quasi-randomised trials. Trial reports that were published as abstracts were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 21 trials (involving 142,496 women) as eligible for inclusion in this review, but only 20 trials (involving 141,849 women) contributed data. Of these 20 trials, 19 were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and compared MMN supplements with iron and folic acid to iron, with or without folic acid. One trial conducted in the UK compared MMN supplementation with placebo. In total, eight trials were cluster-randomised.MMN with iron and folic acid versus iron, with or without folic acid (19 trials)MMN supplementation probably led to a slight reduction in preterm births (average risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.01; 18 trials, 91,425 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and babies considered small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97; 17 trials; 57,348 participants; moderate-quality evidence), though the CI for the pooled effect for preterm births just crossed the line of no effect. MMN reduced the number of newborn infants identified as low birthweight (LBW) (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.91; 18 trials, 68,801 participants; high-quality evidence). We did not observe any differences between groups for perinatal mortality (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; 15 trials, 63,922 participants; high-quality evidence). MMN supplementation led to slightly fewer stillbirths (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; 17 trials, 97,927 participants; high-quality evidence) but, again, the CI for the pooled effect just crossed the line of no effect. MMN supplementation did not have an important effect on neonatal mortality (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 14 trials, 80,964 participants; high-quality evidence). We observed little or no difference between groups for the other maternal and pregnancy outcomes: maternal anaemia in the third trimester (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15; 9 trials, 5912 participants), maternal mortality (average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.54; 6 trials, 106,275 participants), miscarriage (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; 12 trials, 100,565 participants), delivery via a caesarean section (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.29; 5 trials, 12,836 participants), and congenital anomalies (average RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.25 to 7.12; 2 trials, 1958 participants). However, MMN supplementation probably led to a reduction in very preterm births (average RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93; 4 trials, 37,701 participants). We were unable to assess a number of prespecified, clinically important outcomes due to insufficient or non-available data. When we assessed primary outcomes according to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for the review overall was moderate to high. We graded the following outcomes as high quality: LBW, perinatal mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. The outcomes of preterm birth and SGA we graded as moderate quality; both were downgraded for funnel plot asymmetry, indicating possible publication bias. We carried out sensitivity analyses excluding trials with high levels of sample attrition (> 20%). We found that results were consistent with the main analyses for all outcomes. We explored heterogeneity through subgroup analyses by maternal height, maternal body mass index (BMI), timing of supplementation, dose of iron, and MMN supplement formulation (UNIMMAP versus non-UNIMMAP). There was a greater reduction in preterm births for women with low BMI and among those who took non-UNIMMAP supplements. We also observed subgroup differences for maternal BMI and maternal height for SGA, indicating greater impact among women with greater BMI and height. Though we found that MMN supplementation made little or no difference to perinatal mortality, the analysis demonstrated substantial statistical heterogeneity. We explored this heterogeneity using subgroup analysis and found differences for timing of supplementation, whereby higher impact was observed with later initiation of supplementation. For all other subgroup analyses, the findings were inconclusive.MMN versus placebo (1 trial)A single trial in the UK found little or no important effect of MMN supplementation on preterm births, SGA, or LBW but did find a reduction in maternal anaemia in the third trimester (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85), when compared to placebo. This trial did not measure our other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest a positive impact of MMN supplementation with iron and folic acid on several birth outcomes. MMN supplementation in pregnancy led to a reduction in babies considered LBW, and probably led to a reduction in babies considered SGA. In addition, MMN probably reduced preterm births. No important benefits or harms of MMN supplementation were found for mortality outcomes (stillbirths, perinatal and neonatal mortality). These findings may provide some basis to guide the replacement of iron and folic acid supplements with MMN supplements for pregnant women residing in low- and middle-income countries.

### Folic acid [^112JqdAD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of folic acid IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Appropriate maternal folic acid intake is essential to the fetus during pregnancy, and no problems with maternal supplementation to achieve adequate intake goals are known. There is significant evidence that fetal neural tube defects can be prevented if folic acid therapy is initiated before pregnancy and continued during pregnancy. Very high folic acid doses have caused fetal abnormalities in lab animals. Harmful effects on human fetuses have not been reported. The drug folic acid IV is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

Vitamins — folic acid and multivitamins: We suggest a daily multivitamin that includes at least 400 micrograms of folic acid be taken starting 1 month before conception and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Supplementation with multivitamins and minerals has also been associated with improved outcomes, including lower risks of preeclampsia and three forms of childhood cancer (pediatric brain tumors, neuroblastomas, and leukemia). Studies have found that preconception folic acid supplements, either alone or combined with other vitamins or minerals (e.g., in a multivitamin), reduce the risk of NTDs and should be continued through the first trimester of pregnancy. Higher doses of folic acid are recommended in certain patients at high risk for NTDs (e.g., patients with a history of an NTD-affected pregnancy).

Regarding specific circumstances for folate deficiency, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to offer a diet of folate-rich foods and daily oral supplementation with 4.0–5.0 mg folic acid and vitamin B12 for at least 3 months before conception and until 12 weeks gestation in females at high risk for neural tube defects or with a male partner with a neural tube defect affecting himself or his children. Continue daily supplementation from 12 weeks gestation with a multivitamin with 0.4–1.0 mg of folic acid throughout the pregnancy and for 4–6 weeks postpartum or as long as breastfeeding continues.

Methods

Study design

This was a multicentre prospective cohort study of early pregnancy ultrasound screening, maternal exposures and risk of congenital malformations. This investigation was conducted between August 2017 and August 2020. Pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy who underwent early pregnancy ultrasound examinations at 23 tertiary hospitals between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation were recruited from August 2017 to March 2019. Data on maternal general characteristics (e.g. age, education level, region, history of adverse pregnancy outcomes), periconceptional maternal exposure and early pregnancy complications and treatments (e.g. medicine exposure, vaginal bleeding, FA supplementation, or progesterone supplementation) were collected by trained clinicians through face-to-face interviews at recruitment.

Congenital malformations were diagnosed through routine prenatal and postnatal exams (e.g. ultrasound examinations, serum marker detections, physical examinations, and abnormality surveillance) and checked by reviewing medical records. We excluded women who were lost to follow-up from the analysis.

Folic acid supplementation

During recruitment, women were surveyed regarding whether they received supplementation (e.g. FA alone or FA-containing multivitamin supplementation) by showing them a list of common FA products. Details (e.g. times and quantities of FA prescriptions) were extracted from the medical records to determine the initiation time and estimate the duration of supplementation. Daily intake of the recommended dosages (0.4 or 0.8 mg) of FA for at least 1 month was defined as having the supplementation. Since 12 weeks of supplementation is critical for effective folate concentrations and 3 months before pregnancy up to the third month of the pregnancy are key supplemental points in the guideline, we classified the women who took FA into three categories: preconception initiation for more than 3 months, preconception supplementation within 3 months, or FA supplementation after becoming pregnant according to the initiation time. The time of pregnancy was estimated based on a reliable last menstrual period and/or confirmed by the size of the gestational sac or embryo measured by ultrasound in early pregnancy. We also subgrouped the women by duration into groups with durations ≤ or > 3 months. Women without FA supplementation were referred to as the no supplement group.

No women in the no supplement group took periconceptional FA in the current pregnancy. Among the included women, 16 women whose supplementation information was not available were marked as the FA unknown group. These women and an additional 252 persons whose supplemental details were missing were excluded from the assessment of the association of the initiation time and duration of FA use with congenital malformations.

Recommended dose for NTD risk reduction

In the United States, it is recommended that women at high risk of having an NTD-affected pregnancy take 4000 μg FA/d, which is based on the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Trial (Table 1). The MRC Trial was a randomized double-blind prevention trial to determine whether supplementation with FA around the time of conception could prevent NTDs. The dose used in the MRC Trial was selected based on observations from a small nonrandomized trial for the prevention of NTD recurrence. It is noteworthy that in that trial, the 4000-μg dose was chosen because that was the dose available in the hospital pharmacy at the time of the study. A dosage of 400 μg FA/d was recommended for women considered to be at low risk of an NTD, based on the knowledge that a prenatal vitamin containing 800 μg FA prevented NTD occurrence and that 4000 μg FA prevented NTD recurrence (MRC), and the pragmatic reality that earlier observational studies associated multivitamins, which usually contained 360–400 μg FA, with reduced occurrence of NTDs. In the late 1990s, a population-based community intervention project in China was the first to show that 400 μg FA/d alone (not in the context of a multivitamin) significantly reduced the primary occurrence of NTDs (from 4.8 to 1.0/1000 in northern China and from 1.0 to 0.6/1000 in southern China). The Institute of Medicine published the Dietary Reference Intakes for folate in 1998, also recommending that women of reproductive age consume 400 μg FA/d from fortified foods or supplements.

### Effect of high dose folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on pre-eclampsia (FACT): double blind, phase III, randomised controlled, international, multicentre trial [^116nRcfi]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Based on large randomised trials, supplementation of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects has been recommended worldwide during the preconception period and the first trimester of pregnancy. Recommended doses are 4.0–5.0 mg daily up to 12 weeks' gestation for women at high risk of having an affected fetus, and 0.4–1.0 mg daily for women at low risk. Although the neural tube closes in the first trimester, pre-eclampsia is a two stage disorder, with the first stage occurring in the late first trimester (after eight weeks) and the second stage occurring in the third trimester. Supplementation of high doses of folic acid in early gestation may work at both stages of pre-eclampsia development, and a larger dose in the late first or early second trimester (between eight and 16 week's gestation) during the peak period of placental growth and development may be most effective in preventing pre-eclampsia. Findings from the Ottawa and Kingston (OaK) Birth Cohort suggested a 60% reduction in risk of pre-eclampsia and a dose-response association between folic acid and risk of pre-eclampsia in women with identified risk factors. A high daily dose (4.0 mg) of folic acid might be needed for these women because they may have placental, endothelial, and metabolic defects (including those of folate metabolism) leading to an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Previous studies have been observational in nature and thus warranted a large randomised controlled trial. The current study, the Folic Acid Clinical Trial (FACT), was designed and conducted to evaluate the effect of daily supplementation with 4.0 mg folic acid beyond the first trimester on the risk of developing pre-eclampsia among pregnant women at high risk for this condition.

### The clinical content of preconception care: nutrition and dietary supplements [^1167jWbJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Women of child-bearing age should achieve and maintain good nutritional status prior to conception to help minimize health risks to both mothers and infants. Many women may not be aware of the importance of preconception nutrition and supplementation or have access to nutrition information. Health care providers should be knowledgeable about preconception/pregnancy-related nutrition and take the initiative to discuss this information during preconception counseling. Women of reproductive age should be counseled to consume a well-balanced diet including fruits and vegetables, iron and calcium-rich foods, and protein-containing foods as well as 400 microg of folic acid daily. More research is critically needed on the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements and the role of obesity in birth outcomes. Preconception counseling is the perfect opportunity for the health care provider to discuss a healthy eating guideline, dietary supplement intake, and maintaining a healthy weight status.

### Management of prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum obesity from the FIGO pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee: a FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) guideline [^114qxNSx]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, factors related to weight management, such as depression, should be considered and addressed where appropriate to support weight loss before conception 44.

If preconception weight loss interventions include bariatric surgery, where possible, women should wait at least 12–18 months after treatment to conceive 54. This is to allow for body weight stabilization and the identification and treatment of any nutritional deficiencies, especially in the case of malabsorptive surgery 44, 55. Therefore, appropriate contraceptive advice should be given 55. Women after bariatric surgery have been found to have any of a variety of vitamin and mineral deficiencies in pregnancy including vitamins A, C, D, B1, B6, B12, and K, iron, calcium, selenium, and phosphorous 56. In fact, long‐term periodic screening for vitamin and mineral deficiencies is recommended for women after bariatric surgery along with prescribed multivitamin and mineral supplementation 57. In cases of advanced maternal age, a shorter interval after surgery could be considered, including the effect of nutritional and other obesity‐related issues that are associated with a reduced time to pregnancy 54. Due to the associated complexities of nutritional requirements in addition to the usual preconception needs, where possible women with a history of bariatric surgery should be referred to a dietitian before pregnancy 37, 49

Recommendation A.4. All women with obesity should be advised to take at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) and consider up to 5 mg folic acid supplementation daily for at least 1–3 months before conception.

Periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects across resource settings 58. While there are some differences within published guidelines, FIGO's advice is that all women of childbearing age should consume at least 0.4 mg (400 μg) supplementary folic acid a day for at least 1 month before conception, continuing until at least the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of neutral tube defects 33, 44, 59. Consideration should be given to the potential use of a higher dose (5 mg/d) for women with obesity, for example in those who may have other additional risk factors for neural tube defects, for example pregestational diabetes or family history, in line with local and national guidelines and resources 37, 60, 61.

Randomization procedures

Italian RCT

After giving informed consent, women are randomly assigned to receive a pill containing 4 mg of FA (treatment in study) or 0.4 mg of FA (referent treatment) daily. The randomization code is generated by a web-based patient randomization system, stratified according to the enrolment site and the maternal age group. The study is double-blinded: subjects, investigators and research staff are blinded to the randomization assignments.

Dutch RCT

After giving informed consent, women are randomized to one of the four groups. Randomization is not stratified. Every four participants per research centre are assigned to a different study group, resulting in equal distributions among the study groups. The study is double-blinded: subjects, investigators and research staff are blinded to the randomization assignments.

Interventions

Italian RCT

At the enrolment visit, full pre-conceptional counselling is offered to women according to standard guidelines. All the eligible women are interviewed by the investigators using a structured form to evaluate socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, past and present health status, previous pregnancy outcomes, and the previous four months of food intake.

Subjects who show interest in participating in the study and who meet the inclusion criteria, in the absence of exclusion criteria and after giving informed consent, are randomized to either 4 mg or 0.4 mg of FA.

All women are given a box containing 130 pills, according to the blinded randomization arm. All women are then recommended to take one pill per day and to contact the enrolment centre when only 20 pills are left in the box so that they get another box of 130 pills. After randomization, enrolled women are interviewed every 4 months by the investigators (when they contact the randomization centre to get another box of FA pills), to evaluate the pregnancy status.

If women become pregnant, they will take the FA until the end of the 12th completed gestational week. If they have not become pregnant after 12 months of FA supplementation, the women will be removed from the study.

Dutch RCT

Women in all intervention groups receive identical pills, containing two different doses of FA (4 or 0.4 mg). Women start taking the pills after randomization, but at least 4 weeks before conception, and will receive new pills from their pharmacy every 4 months.

At 12 weeks of gestation, all women will receive a new set of pills, half of them receiving 0.2 mg supplements and half 0.8 mg of FA. Again the pills are identical. New pills are issued once more during pregnancy (25 weeks of gestation).

### Periconceptional intake of folic acid among low-risk women in Canada: summary of a workshop aiming to align prenatal folic acid supplement composition with current expert guidelines [^1112vBcP]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

TABLE 3
Top 5 challenges and potential solutions identified by workshop participants in aligning FA intake among women with recommendations for primary prevention of NTDs 1

The challenges and solutions were interrelated and general themes emerged. First, there was a perception that the gaps in the literature on the effective FA supplement dose and duration for NTD prevention inherently resulted in different guidelines. Different guidelines have led to confusion among health care professionals and consumers. Second, a prenatal supplement containing the recommended amount of FA for low-risk women is not generally available in the marketplace, hindering health care professionals and women from adhering to the recommendations. Third, there remain barriers in Canada for some women, particularly vulnerable women, in accessing FA-containing supplements and family planning services. Fourth, there was a low level of awareness, even among workshop participants, of the harmonization of the SOGC guideline for women at low NTD risk with that of Health Canada at 400 μg FA in 2015. The SOGC guideline remains a preferred resource among health care professionals, but lack of free access to the guideline constitutes a barrier to its active implementation more broadly by other stakeholders. Finally, when it comes to vitamin and mineral supplements, there seems to be a "more is better" attitude and a low level of awareness that FA intake in high amounts may not have any added benefit and might even cause harm.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111rswse]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV opportunistic infections — folic acid and TMP-SMX in pregnancy: Folic acid supplementation at 0.4 mg/day is routinely recommended for all women of reproductive potential (AI). There are no trials evaluating whether higher-dose folic acid (e.g., 4 mg/day) reduces the risk of birth defects associated with first-trimester TMP-SMX use, though other studies have found that higher doses (4–6 mg/day) are associated with less frequent adverse outcomes. In a population-based, case-control study, increased odds of congenital cardiovascular anomalies with TMP-SMX in pregnancy were not seen in women also receiving folic acid supplementation, most of whom received 6 mg/day (OR 1.24; 95% CI, 0.94–1.62), and the OR for multiple congenital abnormalities decreased from 6.4 without folic acid to 1.9 with folic acid. For people on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), clinicians should consider giving supplemental folic acid 4 mg/day before pregnancy or as soon as possible in the first trimester (BIII). Leucovorin (folinic acid) is not interchangeable with folic acid, and adding leucovorin to TMP-SMX for the treatment of PCP was associated with an increased risk of therapeutic failure and death, with case reports also describing failure of TMP-SMX prophylaxis with concurrent leucovorin use. If a higher dose of supplemental folic acid is given, its use should be limited to the first trimester (AIII), and whether or not folic acid is given, a follow-up ultrasound is recommended at 18 weeks to 20 weeks to assess fetal anatomy with consideration for subsequent scans (BIII).

### Weekly iron-folic acid supplements containing 2.8 mg folic acid are associated with a lower risk of neural tube defects than the current practice of 0.4 mg: a randomised controlled trial in Malaysia [^111EdKhF]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Limitations include that no trial has shown that weekly folic acid, at any dose, lowers NTDs. Evidence supporting weekly folic acid comes from México, where a 50% reduction in NTDs was found following a public health campaign that recommended women take 5 mg folic acid weekly. Moreover, the 16-week duration of our intervention likely underestimates the full potential of the intervention effect on RBC folate concentrations. It has been previously shown that women consuming 0.4 mg folic acid daily for 40 weeks had still not yet reached a steady-state of RBC folate concentrations. Houghton et al estimated that it would likely require 96 weeks for women to achieve 90% of the estimated steady-state when supplementing with 0.4 mg folic acid per day. While our intervention was short, intermittent IFA supplementation is recommended to commence after menarche and continue through to menopause, meaning that adolescent girls and women participating in IFA programmes could be consuming the supplements for long periods and will reach a steady-state. Also, our secondary analyses examining the dichotomized outcome presented for RBC folate > 748 does not have the same degree of statistical precision as our pre-specified primary outcome on which the trial's sample size was based, RBC folate as a continuous variable (which had excellent statistical precision (table 2)).

### Folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111iJ3wP]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — folic acid supplementation to prevent neural tube defects: The USPSTF recommends that all persons planning to or who could become pregnant take a daily supplement containing 0.4 to 0.8 mg (400 to 800 μg) of folic acid (A recommendation). To achieve benefit, persons planning to or who could become pregnant should start daily folic acid supplementation at least 1 month prior to anticipated conception and continue through the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy. The USPSTF concludes that, for persons who are planning to or could become pregnant, there is high certainty that folic acid supplementation has a substantial net benefit to prevent neural tube defects in their offspring. Neural tube defects are among the most common congenital malformations in the US, with an estimated 3000 pregnancies affected each year, and many of these neural tube defects are caused by low folate levels in the body.

### Steady state folate concentrations achieved with 5 compared with 1.1 mg folic acid supplementation among women of childbearing age [^114UzoaA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Synthetic folic acid (0.4–1.0 mg) consumed during the periconceptional period has been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Women with poor supplement adherence or a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect may need to take higher doses of folic acid (4–5 mg). However, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics of higher folic acid doses.

Objective

Our aim was to compare steady state folate concentrations in women of childbearing age who took 5 or 1.1 mg folic acid daily for 30 wk.

Design

Forty nonpregnant women aged between 18 and 45 y, who did not take folic acid supplements, were enrolled in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either 5 or 1.1 mg folic acid daily for 30 wk. Plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations were measured at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, and 30.

Results

There was no significant difference in baseline RBC folate concentrations between the 2 groups (1121 ± 410 and 1035 ± 273 nmol/L for the 5- and 1.1-mg folic acid groups, respectively). Significant differences in RBC folate were detected between groups at weeks 4, 6, 12, and 30. RBC folate concentrations by week 30 were 2339 ± 782 and 1625 ± 339 nmol/L for the 5- and 1.1-mg folic acid groups, respectively.

Conclusion

The use of 5 mg folic acid among women of childbearing age produced higher blood folate concentrations, with a faster rate of folate accumulation, compared with 1.1 mg folic acid.

### Folic acid supplementation during the preconception period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116QLeWs]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that women take folic acid supplements in the preconception period to prevent neural tube defects (NTDs) in their offspring. Estimates of adherence to this recommendation across different countries worldwide have not been synthesized. Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE were systematically searched to identify studies reporting the prevalence of preconception folic acid supplementation. Pooled prevalence estimates for each country (where data were available) were calculated; and differences based on demographic, methodological, and study quality characteristics were examined. Of 3372 titles and abstracts screened, 722 full-texts were reviewed and 105 articles that reported 106 estimates of preconception folic acid supplementation in 34 countries were included. Pooled prevalence estimates were 32–51% in North America, 9–78% in Europe, 21–46% in Asia, 4–34% in the Middle East, 32–39% in Australia/New Zealand, and 0% in Africa. No South American studies were identified. Higher supplementation prevalence was observed in studies that had more highly educated samples, were conducted in fertility clinics, and assessed folic acid use via self-report. Of note, only 32% and 28% of studies reported timing of folic acid use and adherence to folic acid, respectively. Preconception folic acid supplementation is highly variable worldwide and many women may not achieve sufficient folate levels to prevent NTDs. To better understand non-adherence, recommendations for future research include: more explicit reporting of methodology, more detailed assessment of folic acid use, assessment of variables potentially relevant to folic acid use, and surveillance of folic acid use in a greater diversity of countries, especially in the developing world.
