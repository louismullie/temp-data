## Question

Bronchitis diagnosis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic criteria and how to apply them at the bedside. Then, I should verify the key exclusions, especially pneumonia, and when to image. Next, I will review the differential and what to test for if suspected. After that, I need to check which routine investigations to avoid and which to consider only if symptoms persist or worsen. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm with explicit decision points and safety nets.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnostic criteria so I don't jump to conclusions. Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis defined by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks, in the absence of clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and with no better alternative explanation such as the common cold, acute asthma, or COPD exacerbation; I should double-check that duration threshold and the exclusion framework, which are consistently endorsed by ACCP/CHEST and reflected in contemporary primary care guidance.

> Wait, let me verify the pneumonia exclusion step because that drives imaging decisions. In otherwise healthy adults with normal vital signs and a normal lung exam, the likelihood of pneumonia is low and routine chest radiography is not indicated; specifically, if heart rate is ≤ 100, respiratory rate ≤ 24, temperature ≤ 38°C, and the chest exam is normal, pneumonia is highly unlikely and CXR can be avoided, whereas abnormal vitals or focal findings should prompt consideration of imaging to exclude pneumonia [^116m7gc6] [^112Nmytv] [^116zSTZN].

> Hold on, I should verify the differential and the mimics I must actively exclude before labeling this as acute bronchitis. The key conditions include community-acquired pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma or wheeze-predominant presentations, COPD exacerbation, pertussis, and less commonly influenza or COVID-19 depending on season and exposure; I need to ensure I screen for wheeze, exertional dyspnea, chronic cough/sputum, and epidemiologic clues such as paroxysmal cough with whoop or posttussive vomiting that raise suspicion for pertussis, which warrants targeted testing and treatment if confirmed [^112fAS6d].

> I will now examine which routine investigations to avoid so I don't overtest. Routine chest radiography, spirometry or peak flow, sputum cultures, viral PCR panels, CRP, and procalcitonin are not recommended at initial presentation for immunocompetent adults with suspected acute bronchitis; I should confirm that this is an ungraded consensus-based suggestion from CHEST and aligns with AAFP guidance emphasizing minimal testing unless the clinical picture changes [^1124oGih] [^114spc5q] [^112WRnjT].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist or worsen beyond the expected window? I need to ensure a safety net: if cough persists beyond about 3–4 weeks or deteriorates clinically, reassessment and targeted investigations are appropriate, including chest radiography, spirometry or peak flow to assess for airflow limitation, CBC or inflammatory markers, and consideration of pertussis testing; I should double-check that this escalation pathway is explicitly suggested by CHEST and AAFP and that it helps catch missed asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis, or bacterial complications [^112fAS6d] [^112BptYu] [^1124oGih].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances so I don't miss important exceptions. In older adults or those with comorbidities, my threshold for imaging and broader testing may be lower when clinical suspicion for pneumonia is higher; in patients with wheeze suggesting airflow limitation, a cautious trial of inhaled beta-agonist may be reasonable, but I should confirm that routine bronchodilator use is not recommended for most patients without asthma/COPD due to limited benefit and adverse effects such as tremor and palpitations [^116zSTZN] [^112eykiT] [^113ggfTC].

> Next, I should review how to communicate the diagnosis and prognosis to set expectations. Acute bronchitis is predominantly viral and self-limited, with cough typically lasting 2–3 weeks; I should explain that antibiotics are not routinely indicated, that discolored sputum alone is not a reliable bacterial signal, and that describing the illness as a "chest cold" can improve satisfaction when antibiotics are withheld; I need to ensure shared decision-making and provide clear return precautions if red flags develop [^115uFvJ7] [^113wvMtz].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and double-check each branch point. Start with history and exam to confirm cough ≤ 3 weeks and screen for red flags; if vitals and lung exam are normal, pneumonia is unlikely and no routine testing is needed; if vitals are abnormal or focal lung findings are present, obtain CXR to exclude pneumonia; if cough persists or worsens beyond 3–4 weeks, reassess and pursue targeted testing for alternative diagnoses such as asthma, COPD, pertussis, or bacterial complications; throughout, avoid routine labs and imaging unless guided by evolving clinical suspicion [^116m7gc6] [^1124oGih] [^117PueHE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "routine spirometry might help differentiate bronchitis from asthma", but hold on, I should verify that against guidelines; CHEST advises against routine spirometry or peak flow at initial presentation for suspected acute bronchitis, reserving pulmonary function testing for persistent or atypical courses after reassessment, so I need to correct that impulse and align with the consensus to avoid unnecessary testing [^112WRnjT] [^1124oGih].

> Finally, I need to ensure my diagnostic threshold remains conservative and that I document exclusions and patient counseling. The diagnosis is one of exclusion; I should record that pneumonia, common cold, acute asthma, and COPD exacerbation were considered and deemed unlikely based on the clinical findings, and I should provide written instructions for follow-up if symptoms persist, to close the loop on safety and diagnostic stewardship [^117PueHE].

Acute bronchitis is a **clinical diagnosis** [^117PueHE] characterized by cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks [^115h3E4f] without pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, asthma, or other causes [^114VGSCJ]. Routine testing is **not indicated** [^1124oGih]; reserve chest radiography for abnormal vitals or lung exam [^116m7gc6], and avoid CBC, sputum, or inflammatory markers unless the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms persist [^113aeKUe] [^1124oGih]. Antibiotics are **not recommended** unless bacterial infection is suspected [^1179Kpu9] [^116yCD45]. Management is supportive, with patient education on the typical 2–3 week cough duration [^115uFvJ7] to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use [^117PueHE].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

- **Cough**: Predominant symptom, with or without sputum, lasting ≤ 3 weeks [^114VGSCJ] [^115h3E4f].
- **Exclusion of pneumonia**: No clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia [^114VGSCJ] [^113TnNEJ].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: No COPD exacerbation, asthma, or other respiratory conditions [^114VGSCJ] [^1154DeX8].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Pneumonia | - Fever <br/> - Crackles <br/> - Consolidation on CXR [^112K3q2G] [^116zSTZN] |
| COPD exacerbation | - Chronic cough <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Wheezing <br/> - Known COPD history [^116uRvT4] |
| Asthma | - Wheezing <br/> - Bronchodilator responsiveness <br/> - Personal/family history [^notfound] |
| Pertussis | - Paroxysmal cough <br/> - Whoop <br/> - Post-tussive vomiting [^112fAS6d] |
| Upper respiratory infection (URI) | - Nasal congestion <br/> - Sore throat <br/> - Mild cough [^112K3q2G] |

---

## Diagnostic tests and investigations

Routine diagnostic testing is **not recommended** for uncomplicated cases [^1124oGih]. Testing may be considered when:

- **Chest radiography**: Abnormal vital signs (HR ≥ 100, RR ≥ 24, T ≥ 38°C) or abnormal lung exam [^116m7gc6] [^116zSTZN].
- **CBC, sputum cultures, inflammatory markers**: Not routine; consider if diagnosis uncertain or symptoms persist [^114spc5q] [^111GjJUf].
- **Spirometry**: Not routine; consider if asthma or COPD suspected [^112WRnjT].

---

## Role of chest radiography

Chest radiography is **not routine** [^112Ybv6k] and should be reserved for patients with abnormal vital signs, abnormal lung examination, or persistent symptoms suggesting pneumonia or alternative diagnoses [^116m7gc6] [^116zSTZN].

---

## Laboratory tests and inflammatory markers

Routine laboratory tests and inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin) are **not recommended** for diagnosing acute bronchitis or guiding antibiotic use [^114spc5q] [^1124oGih]. They do not reliably distinguish bacterial from viral infections and do not predict symptom resolution [^112CV6vC].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACCP 2020**: No routine investigations or medications for immunocompetent adult outpatients with suspected acute bronchitis [^1124oGih] [^114hBege].
- **AAFP 2025**: No routine antibiotics; provide patient education on expected cough duration (2–3 weeks) [^115uFvJ7] [^117PueHE].
- **ACP/CDC 2016**: Do not prescribe antibiotics unless pneumonia is suspected [^1128x35v].

---

## Common pitfalls and challenges

Common pitfalls include **overdiagnosis of bacterial infection** and unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, despite evidence of viral predominance and limited bacterial involvement [^111Ltura] [^112K3q2G]. Differentiating acute bronchitis from pneumonia, asthma, and COPD exacerbation can be challenging, particularly in patients with underlying respiratory conditions [^1154DeX8]. Patient expectations for rapid symptom resolution often drive inappropriate antibiotic use [^115uFvJ7].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should emphasize the **self-limited nature** of acute bronchitis, the typical 2–3 week cough duration, and the lack of benefit from antibiotics [^115uFvJ7] [^117PueHE]. Follow-up is recommended if symptoms persist beyond 3 weeks or worsen, prompting reassessment and targeted investigations [^113iPdig] [^112BptYu].

---

Acute bronchitis is a **clinical diagnosis** defined by cough ≤ 3 weeks without pneumonia or other respiratory conditions [^114VGSCJ]. Routine testing is unnecessary; reserve chest radiography for abnormal vitals or lung exam, and avoid routine labs or inflammatory markers [^1124oGih] [^114spc5q]. Management is supportive, with patient education to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use [^117PueHE].

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116Kxyq1]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis" for acute bronchitis.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this common respiratory condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby guiding appropriate treatment and management strategies.

The diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis are based on four key components. The first component is the presence of symptoms indicative of an acute respiratory infection, predominantly cough, with or without sputum production. The second component is the duration of these symptoms, which should be less than three weeks. The third component involves ruling out pneumonia, both clinically and radiographically, as the cause of the cough. The final component requires the exclusion of other potential causes of the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered likely if all four components are met. Conversely, if these criteria are not fully met, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis is considered unlikely. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the clinical assessment of patients presenting with cough and other symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection, helping to distinguish acute bronchitis from other respiratory conditions.

The diagnostic criteria for determining the likelihood of acute bronchitis involve assessing four key factors. The diagnostic tool articulates these factors as follows:

- Symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, specifically a cough, with or without sputum production.
- Symptoms persisting for less than 3 weeks.
- Exclusion of pneumonia as the cause of the cough, established through clinical evaluation and radiographic evidence.
- Elimination of other potential causes for the cough, such as the common cold, acute asthma, or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

For evaluating the likelihood of acute bronchitis, the diagnostic process simplifies to checking each of these criteria. If all four criteria are confirmed as true, it suggests that acute bronchitis is likely. Conversely, if any of these criteria are not met, the likelihood of acute bronchitis is considered improbable.

This structured approach aids in distinguishing acute bronchitis from other conditions that might present similar respiratory symptoms, providing a clear pathway for diagnosis based on clinical markers and exclusions.

### Beta2-agonists for acute cough or a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis [^113ggfTC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is made on clinical grounds and a variety of clinical definitions have been used. There are no clearly effective treatments for the cough of acute bronchitis. Beta2-agonists are often prescribed, perhaps because clinicians suspect many patients also have reversible airflow restriction (as seen in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) contributing to the symptoms.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve acute bronchitis symptoms in people with no underlying pulmonary disease (such as asthma, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2015, Issue 5, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2015), EMBASE (1974 to May 2015), Web of Science (2011 to May 2015) and LILACS (1982 to May 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which allocated people (adults, or children over two years of age) with acute bronchitis or acute cough and without known pulmonary disease to beta2-agonist versus placebo, no treatment or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected outcomes and extracted data while blinded to study results. Two review authors independently assessed each trial for risk of bias. We analysed trials in children and adults separately.

Main Results

Two trials of moderate quality in children (n = 134) with no evidence of airflow restriction did not find any benefits from oral beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults (n = 418) had mixed results but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from oral (three trials) nor from inhaled (two trials) beta2-agonists. Three studies with low-quality evidence demonstrated no significant differences in daily cough scores, nor in the percentage of adults still coughing after seven days (control group 71%; risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.18; 220 participants). In one trial, subgroups with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists. The trials that noted quicker resolution of cough with beta2-agonists were those with a higher proportion of people wheezing at baseline. Low-quality evidence suggests that adults given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness or nervousness (RR 7.94, 95% CI 1.17 to 53.94; 211 participants; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the use of beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow restriction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists is helpful for adults with acute cough. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in people with evidence of airflow restriction. However, this potential benefit is not well supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with their use.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^114hBege]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence for the diagnosis and management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients was reviewed as an update to the 2006 "Chronic Cough Due to Acute Bronchitis: American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines".

Methods

Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation. Two clinical population, intervention, comparison, outcome questions were addressed by systematic review in July 2017: (1) the role of investigations beyond the clinical assessment of patients presenting with suspected acute bronchitis, and (2) the efficacy and safety of prescribing medication for cough in acute bronchitis. An updated search was undertaken in May 2018.

Results

No eligible studies relevant to the first question were identified. For the second question, only one relevant study met eligibility criteria. This study found no difference in number of days with cough between patients treated with an antibiotic or an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent compared with placebo. Clinical suggestions and research recommendations were made based on the consensus opinion of the CHEST Expert Cough Panel.

Conclusions

The panelists suggested that no routine investigations be ordered and no routine medications be prescribed in immunocompetent adult outpatients first presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, until such investigations and treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, a reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations should be considered.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^111FGJZY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and to assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11 (accessed 13 January 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 January 2017), and LILACS (1982 to 13 January 2017). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov on 5 April 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in people without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this 2017 update. We included 17 trials with 5099 participants in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. At follow-up there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between the antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15). Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (4 studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and a night cough (4 studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7). Participants given antibiotics had a shorter mean cough duration (7 studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated participants were more likely to be improved according to clinician's global assessment (6 studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 11) and were less likely to have an abnormal lung exam (5 studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6). Antibiotic-treated participants also had a reduction in days feeling ill (5 studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and days with impaired activity (6 studies with 767 participants, MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional harmful outcome 24).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence of clinical benefit to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens, and cost of antibiotic treatment.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1128uXE6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis background and prior evidence indicate that currently, the diagnosis is clinical with emphasis on excluding differential diagnoses, and the CHEST 2006 guidelines recommended that acute bronchitis be diagnosed only if there was no evidence of pneumonia, the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD. Previous retrospective cohort studies found that at initial presentation just over one-third would also meet criteria for asthma, and that 3 years after diagnosis 34% fulfilled criteria for either asthma or chronic bronchitis; in a retrospective study of 46 patients with at least two similar physician-diagnosed episodes of acute bronchitis, 65% episodes were found to have mild asthma. It is not known whether routine ordering of investigations such as chest x-rays, sputum cultures, or serum inflammatory markers at initial presentation adds value, and although acute bronchitis is considered self-limiting, there remains data to suggest that practitioners frequently prescribe both antibiotics and other medication.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^113TnNEJ]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis — case definition for study inclusion describes an acute lower respiratory infection predominantly with cough with or without sputum, lasting no more than 3 weeks, with no clinical findings to suggest pneumonia such as heart rate ≥ 100 beats/min, respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, or oral temperature ≥ 37.8°C, with no recent radiographic evidence of pneumonia and no other alternative explanation.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^117PueHE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis and accounts for more than 3 million outpatient office visits in the United States annually. The differential diagnosis includes exacerbations of preexisting conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure or other causes of acute cough, including pertussis, COVID-19, influenza, and community-acquired pneumonia. Acute cough may present with or without sputum production. Diagnostic testing is not indicated unless there is concern for other potential causes, such as community-acquired pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19. Acute bronchitis is a self-limiting disease. Evidence does not support the use of antitussives, honey, antihistamines, anticholinergics, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Antibiotics do not contribute to the overall improvement of acute bronchitis; although they may decrease the duration of cough by approximately 0.5 days, their use exposes patients to antibiotic-related adverse effects. Therefore, symptom relief and patient education regarding the expected duration of cough (2–3 weeks) are recommended for the management of acute bronchitis. Strategies shown to decrease antibiotic prescribing include delayed antibiotic prescriptions and describing acute bronchitis as a chest cold.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^113ptkgp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes.2. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated.3.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis: background [^1152zHys]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute bronchitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. The evaluation of adults with an acute cough illness or a presumptive diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bronchitis should focus on ruling out serious illness, particularly pneumonia. In healthy, nonelderly adults, pneumonia is uncommon in the absence of vital sign abnormalities or asymmetrical lung sounds, and chest radiography is usually not indicated. In patients with cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, chest radiography may be warranted in the absence of other known causes. Routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis is not recommended, regardless of duration of cough. If pertussis infection is suspected (an unusual circumstance), a diagnostic test should be performed and antimicrobial therapy initiated. Patient satisfaction with care for acute bronchitis depends most on physician — patient communication rather than on antibiotic treatment.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^112idXny]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects over 40/1000 adults a year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, antibiotics (macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, penicillins, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [co-trimoxazole]), antihistamines, antitussives, beta(2) agonists (inhaled or oral), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JuhHm]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We performed systematic reviews using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) format to answer the following key clinical question: Are the CHEST 2006 classifications of acute, subacute and chronic cough and associated management algorithms in adults that were based on durations of cough useful?

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for the systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patient values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations or suggestions. Delphi methodology was used to obtain the final grading.

Results

With respect to acute cough (< 3 weeks), only three studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 CHEST Cough Guidelines, the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause, followed by exacerbations of underlying diseases such as asthma and COPD and pneumonia. The subjects resided on three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. With respect to subacute cough (duration, 3–8 weeks), only two studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and both had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were postinfectious cough and exacerbation of underlying diseases such as asthma, COPD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). The subjects resided in countries in Asia. With respect to chronic cough (> 8 weeks), 11 studies met our criteria for quality assessment, and all had a high risk of bias. As predicted by the 2006 guidelines, the most common causes were UACS from rhinosinus conditions, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, combinations of these four conditions, and, less commonly, a variety of miscellaneous conditions and atopic cough in Asian countries. The subjects resided on four continents: North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

Conclusions

Although the quality of evidence was low, the published literature since 2006 suggests that CHEST's 2006 Cough Guidelines and management algorithms for acute, subacute, and chronic cough in adults appeared useful in diagnosing and treating patients with cough around the globe. These same algorithms have been updated to reflect the advances in cough management as of 2017.

Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — PICO question 1 systematic review screening results indicate that the review targeted the added predictive value of chest x-rays, spirometry, peak flow, sputum culture, respiratory tract viral PCR, serum CRP, or procalcitonin over history and physical examination to rule out pneumonia, influenza, pertussis, asthma, or acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis; records identified were n = 483, records after title and abstract review were n = 8, full-text articles assessed for eligibility were n = 8, and eligible studies were n = 0. The PICO question 1 updated search retrieved 9 studies — 7 pediatric, 1 not acute bronchitis, and 1 that did not meet the definition for cough duration — and none were eligible. Nearly one-half of the 483 studies were excluded for not meeting study design criteria and almost another one-half were excluded for ineligible patient populations, with many exclusions for focusing on subjects with conditions such as the common cold, chronic bronchitis, acute exacerbations of COPD, asthma, pneumonia, and other respiratory conditions or for including children.

### Acute cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients: CHEST expert panel report [^1154DeX8]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Acute bronchitis — exclusion of mimics and outcome assessment emphasizes that patients with conditions that may mimic acute bronchitis such as cough variant asthma, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis, bacterial sinusitis, and the common cold should be excluded. Until these exclusionary conditions are considered and ruled out, the true frequency of acute bronchitis as a distinct clinical entity will not be known. Additionally, there is a need for studies to routinely use reliable and valid cough outcome measures to assess resolution of episodes of cough due to suspected acute bronchitis.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

### Bronchitis (acute) [^116AouQL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis affects more than 40 in 1000 adults per year in the UK. The causes are usually considered to be infective, but only around half of people have identifiable pathogens. The role of smoking or of environmental tobacco smoke inhalation in predisposing to acute bronchitis is unclear. One third of people may have longer-term symptoms or recurrence.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute bronchitis in people without chronic respiratory disease? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2015 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 420 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 306 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 245 studies and the further review of 61 full publications. Of the 61 full articles evaluated, three updated systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we categorised the efficacy for six intervention-comparison combinations, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, beta2 agonists (inhaled), and expectorants/mucolytics.

### Diagnosis and management of acute bronchitis [^112hWrZf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is one of the top 10 conditions for which patients seek medical care. Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^117ABtD6]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antibiotics associated with improved outcomes in patients with acute bronchitis?

Bottom Line

Prescribing antibiotics for acute bronchitis was associated with reduced overall and nighttime cough and with an approximately half-day reduction in duration of cough, in days feeling ill, and in days with impaired activities. However, at follow-up, there were no significant differences in patients receiving antibiotics compared with those receiving placebo in overall clinical improvements or limitations in work or other activities. There was a significant increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Acute bronchitis: rapid evidence review [^111Ltura]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute bronchitis:

- **Definition**: Acute bronchitis is a transient inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree in response to infection without a history of chronic pulmonary disease or evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common cause of acute bronchitis are viruses (90%) including adenovirus, influenza, measles, respiratory syncytial, parainfluenza, and HSV. Nonvirus (10%) causes include bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae) and inhaled lung irritants.
- **Disease course**: Inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree results in acute bronchitis, which causes clinical manifestations of cough (dry or productive), chest tightness, burning with or without wheezing, headache, low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, malaise, and myalgia.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute bronchitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^115ZLpNh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis, which is one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care, is controversial. Most clinicians prescribe antibiotics in spite of expert recommendations against this practice.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2004); EMBASE (January 2000 to December 2003); SciSearch from 1989 to 2004; reference lists of articles and the authors' personal collections up to 1996, and also wrote to study authors and drug manufacturers. EMBASE has previously been searched from 1974 to 2000).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough without other obvious cause in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Nine trials involving over 750 patients aged eight to over 65 and including smokers and non-smokers were included in the primary analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures were assessed. Overall, patients receiving antibiotics had better outcomes than did those receiving placebo. At a follow-up visit, they were less likely to have a cough (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.85; number-needed-to-treat (NNT) 5; 95% CI 3 to 14), show no improvement on physician assessment (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87; NNT 14; 95% CI 8 to 50), or have abnormal lung findings (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; NNT 11; 95% CI 6 to 50); and had shorter durations of cough (weighted mean difference 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.16 days), productive cough (weighted mean difference (WMD) 0.52 days; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.03 days), and feeling ill (WMD 0.58 days; 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16 days). There were no significant differences regarding the presence of night cough, productive cough, or activity limitations at follow up, or in the mean duration of activity limitations. The benefits of antibiotics were less apparent in a sensitivity analysis that included data from two other studies of patients with upper respiratory tract infections with productive cough. There was a non significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group, relative risk (RR) 1.22 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.58).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall, antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in patients who are diagnosed with acute bronchitis. The magnitude of this benefit, however, is similar to that of the detriment from potential adverse effects.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics for acute bronchitis? [^111s1h3S]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

People with acute bronchitis may show little evidence of bacterial infection. If effective, antibiotics could shorten the course of the disease. However, if they are not effective, the risk of antibiotic resistance may be increased. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Strategy

The authors searched MEDLINE, Embase, reference lists of articles, personal collections up to 1996 and Sci-search from 1989 to 1996.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo in acute bronchitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Primary Results

The results of eight trials involving 750 patients from eight years of age to 65 and older and including smokers and nonsmokers were included. The quality of the trials was variable. A variety of outcome measures was assessed. In many cases, only outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference between groups were reported. Overall, patients taking antibiotics had slightly better outcomes than those taking placebo. They were less likely to report feeling unwell at a follow-up visit (odds ratio, 0.42; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.22 to 0.82), to show no improvement on physician assessment (odds ratio, 0.43; CI, 0.23 to 0.79) or to have abnormal lung findings (odds ratio, 0.33; CI, 0.13 to 0.86), and had a more rapid return to work or usual activities (weighted mean difference, 0.7 days earlier; CI, 0.2 to 1.3). Antibiotic-treated patients reported significantly more adverse effects (odds ratio, 1.64; CI, 1.05 to 2.57), such as nausea, vomiting, headache, skin rash or vaginitis.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics appear to have a modest beneficial effect in the treatment of acute bronchitis, with a correspondingly small risk of adverse effects. The benefits of antibiotics may be overestimated in this analysis because of the tendency of published reports to include complete data only on outcomes found to be statistically significant.

### Antibiotics for acute bronchitis [^112JFNM3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and risks of antibiotics for acute bronchitis remain unclear despite it being one of the most common illnesses seen in primary care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in improving outcomes and assess adverse effects of antibiotic therapy for patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014) and LILACS (1982 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy with placebo or no treatment in acute bronchitis or acute productive cough, in patients without underlying pulmonary disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis. The quality of trials was generally good. There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22. Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04). The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance. Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04). The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date. However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — summary of suggestions indicates that for cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation with chest x-ray, spirometry, peak flow measurement, sputum for microbial culture, respiratory tract samples for viral PCR, serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If suspected acute bronchitis persists or worsens, we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and targeted investigation(s) be considered (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and suggested targeted investigations could include chest x-ray, sputum for microbial culture, peak expiratory flow rate recording(s), complete blood count and inflammatory markers such as CRP. For cough due to acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs or other therapies until such treatments have been shown to be safe and effective at making cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). If acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and differential diagnoses such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Labelling of acute respiratory illness: evidence of between-practitioner variation in the UK [^114YH1QT]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear which symptoms and signs GPs use when attributing diagnostic labels to patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI).

Objective

We sought to ascertain GPs' self-reported definitions of ARI.

Methods

A postal questionnaire concerned with the diagnosis of ARI was sent to all registered GPs in Avon Health Authority. GPs were asked to choose a clinical term that would describe the clinical presentation in four hypothetical patients, and the next three questions asked them to define acute bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and any other term they used for ARI (excluding pneumonia). We measured proportions and compared responses across the three diagnostic categories.

Results

The majority (88%) of GPs agreed that cough associated with fever should be labelled as a URTI. When sputum and chest signs were also present, opinion was more divided, with 62% diagnosing acute bronchitis in young patients and 72% lower respiratory tract infection in old patients.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that there is more consistent use of diagnostic labels for URTI than for acute bronchitis or other terms used to label ARI. In the future, researchers should quantify the prognostic significance of symptoms and signs in ARI and provide GPs with a more rational approach to the diagnosis and management of ARI.

### Is C-reactive protein testing useful to predict outcome in patients with acute bronchitis? [^112CV6vC]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A recent clinical trial could not find differences between anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and placebo in shortening the duration of symptoms in acute bronchitis.

Objectives

To investigate if C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at presentation are predictive of symptom resolution in these patients.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of the data from a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial carried out in primary care. Patients from 18 to 70 years of age presenting a respiratory tract infection of < 1 week of evolution, with cough as the predominant symptom and the presence of discoloured expectoration, were enrolled in the study. On the baseline visit, CRP was determined in capillary blood and a five-item symptom diary was given. Patients were followed up to 30 days. The main outcome measure was the number of days with persistent cough.

Results

A total of 312 subjects fulfilled all the criteria for the efficacy analysis and had undergone the CRP test; of these, 56.4% presented a CRP value < 8 mg/l and 76% presented < 20 mg/l. There were no significant differences in the median duration of cough: 10 days among patients with CRP concentrations < 8 mg/l [95% confidence interval (CI): 8–11 days], 11 days among those with concentrations ranging from 8 to 19 mg/l (95% CI: 8–16) and 11 days in those with CRP > 20 mg/l (95% CI: 9–12) (P = 0.337).

Conclusion

Among patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum, the CRP concentrations at presentation are not helpful for predicting symptom resolution.

Current definitions and diagnostic criteria

The development of an accurate definition and diagnostic criteria is impeded by the complexity and heterogeneity that characterises COPD exacerbations and our limited insight into their underlying mechanisms. As a result, all available definitions are solely based on clinical symptoms and have important limitations. An exacerbation is commonly described as an acute deterioration of the respiratory symptoms of patients with underlying COPD that results in additional therapy (table 1). These definitions have poor specificity, as numerous other respiratory or non-respiratory diseases may have a similar presentation. Their sensitivity is also poor, as patients who experience increased symptoms often do not seek medical advice and do not receive additional treatments. Most importantly, these definitions rely on patients' and clinicians' perceptions of the symptoms for diagnosis and severity assessment, without providing guidance for a standardised approach.

Table 1
Frequently used definitions and diagnostic criteria for COPD exacerbations

The Australian and New Zealand (COPD-X) and UK (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines also define exacerbations on the basis of symptoms, but administration of additional treatments is not a prerequisite. This approach may be more sensitive, but at the expense of an even lower specificity.

Clinical research studies often use more strict diagnostic criteria, aiming to select a more homogeneous group of events. In the 1980s, Anthonisen et al described exacerbations as acute, sustained deterioration of at least two symptoms of sputum volume, sputum purulence and breathlessness. These criteria were considered less sensitive to non-infective events and for this reason, a modified version was proposed, describing exacerbations as an acute deterioration of at least one of the aforementioned major criteria and either a second major or one minor criterion(cough, wheeze, nasal discharge, sore throat or fever). Daily monitoring of symptom intensity compared with baseline has also been suggested as a more accurate method to capture all exacerbations. Examples include the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) questionnaire or the London COPD diary cards. While daily monitoring is currently used mainly in clinical research, the development of effective mobile applications could facilitate their introduction to clinical care.

Acute cough in common cold and acute bronchitis

A number of overlapping terms are used throughout the world to describe the clinical syndrome of acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). We suggest that the terminology below really describes different aspects of the same common syndrome.

The common cold is defined as an acute viral URTI, with symptoms of sore throat, sneezing, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, cough and malaise.

Acute cough, that is a cough arbitrarily defined as being of < 2 weeks duration, is one of the most common reasons for patient visits to ambulatory care.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical term implying a self-limited inflammation of the large airways of the lung that is characterised by cough without pneumonia, the latter being diagnosed by focal consolidation on examination or on chest X-ray.

It is now recognised that distinguishing between acute cough due to acute bronchitis and/or common cold is not practicable. Only slight pathological differences, if any, exist due to the principal localisation of viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Epidemiological surveys have shown that acute cough in otherwise healthy adults is a self-limiting disease with an average duration of the main symptom, cough of 14 days. In children, however, acute cough can last an average of 25 days.

Acute bronchitis is caused by viruses (∼50% rhinovirus infection) in at least 90% of cases. For these infections, no curative (antiviral) treatment exists and antibiotic therapy has been repeatedly shown to be ineffective in patients without pre-existing lung disease. Despite being a self-limiting disease, acute bronchitis poses both a high symptom burden to individuals and a high financial burden to society, mainly due to work and school absenteeism. Over 50% of new patient consultations to primary care are due to acute cough and up to 85% of cases are erroneously treated with antibiotics — with no impact on recovery. Apparent success is due to rapid spontaneous recovery and a huge placebo effect. Unnecessary and uncontrolled use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis contributes to an impending doom of antibiotic resistance.

### Beta2-agonists for acute bronchitis [^1158yetd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for acute bronchitis is not clear. Because many patients with acute bronchitis have airflow limitation as well as cough, beta2-agonists may be useful.

Objectives

To determine whether beta2-agonists improve the symptoms of acute bronchitis in patients who do not have underlying pulmonary disease.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Conference Proceedings using "bronchodilator (exp)", "adrenergic beta-agonist (exp)", or "sympathomimetics (exp)" and "bronchitis" or "cough"; Science Citation Index for referenced publications; and letters to manufacturers of beta2-agonists.

Selection Criteria

Trials in which patients (adults or children age > 2 years) without known pulmonary disease who were diagnosed with acute bronchitis or acute cough without other cause were randomized to beta2-agonist vs. placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently first selected outcomes and evaluated trial quality while blinded to study results, and then extracted data. Trials in children and in adults were analyzed separately.

Main Results

Two trials in children with acute cough and no evidence of airway obstruction did not find any benefits from beta2-agonists. Five trials in adults with acute cough or acute bronchitis had mixed results, but overall summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from beta2-agonists. Subgroups of patients with evidence of airflow limitation had lower symptom scores if given beta2-agonists in one trial; and the trials that did note quicker resolution of cough in patients given beta2-agonists were those that had a higher proportion of patients with wheezing at baseline. Patients given beta2-agonists (whether oral or inhaled) were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than patients in the control groups (NNH for children 9, 95% CI 5 to 100; NNH for adults 2.3, 95% CI 2 to 3).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough who do not have evidence of airflow obstruction. There is also little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction; but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.

CHEST Expert Panel suggestions — management of cough due to acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients state there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the efficacy of prescribed treatments for cough due to acute bronchitis.

For immunocompetent adult outpatients with cough due to acute bronchitis, if the acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a complicating bacterial infection is thought likely (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement), and remarks note that differential diagnoses, such as exacerbations of chronic airways diseases (COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that may require other therapeutic management (such as with oral corticosteroids) should also be considered.

### Systematic review with meta-analysis of the epidemiological evidence relating smoking to COPD, chronic bronchitis and emphysema [^113zA7TK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Definition of the outcomes

COPD

The term COPD is quite recent, so studies with outcomes described otherwise were also included. These could be based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, on lung function criteria, on a combination of lung function criteria and symptoms, or on combinations of diagnosed conditions (such as CB or emphysema, or CB, emphysema or asthma), where diagnoses were extracted from medical records or reported in questionnaires. Unacceptable outcomes included CB or emphysema separately, acute or unspecified bronchitis, non-specific respiratory disease, or outcomes based only on symptoms and not on lung function. The range of ICD codes had to cover both CB and emphysema, and could also cover asthma, acute and unqualified bronchitis, bronchiectasis and some other defined lung conditions. Broader-ranging definitions (e.g. respiratory disease) were not accepted. Acceptable lung function criteria included those of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Use of a bronchodilator was not a requirement.

CB

Where based on the ICD, the range had to include the code(s) for CB and could also include codes for acute or unspecified bronchitis. Acceptable outcomes could also be based on medical records, in-study diagnosis, self-report of physician diagnosis or of history of the disease, or on symptoms. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) criterion of daily productive cough for at least three consecutive months for more than two successive years was recognized as a set of symptoms defining CB. Diagnoses or symptoms called "bronchitis" were accepted where the context clearly indicated it was chronic. Diagnoses based on symptoms not referred to as CB were also accepted, provided the definition included both chronic cough and phlegm.

Emphysema

The outcome could be based on the ICD code for emphysema, on medical records, in-study diagnosis, or on self-report of physician diagnosis or history of the disease.

Choice of outcome

Where a study provided data for multiple acceptable definitions of an outcome, results were entered only for one. Additional file 1 gives the rules specifying choice of outcome, and, for studies providing a choice, lists definitions selected and rejected. It also gives, for all studies, the description of the disease and the source of the diagnosis for all outcomes where data were entered.

### Antibiotics for persistent cough or wheeze following acute bronchiolitis in children [^115oPypm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiolitis is a common acute respiratory condition with high prevalence worldwide. This clinically diagnosed syndrome is manifested by tachypnoea (rapid breathing), with crackles or wheeze in young children. In the acute phase of bronchiolitis (≤ 14 days), antibiotics are not routinely prescribed unless the illness is severe or a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Although bronchiolitis is usually self-limiting, some young children continue to have protracted symptoms (e.g. cough and wheezing) beyond the acute phase and often re-present to secondary care.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) for reducing or treating persistent respiratory symptoms following acute bronchiolitis within six months of acute illness.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the World Health Organization (WHO) trial portal, the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov, up to 26 August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics versus controls (placebo or no treatment) given in the post-acute phase of bronchiolitis (> 14 days) for children younger than two years with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies against predefined criteria, and selected, extracted, and assessed data for inclusion. We contacted trial authors for further information.

Main Results

In this review update, we added one study with 219 children. A total of two RCTs with 249 children (n = 240 completed) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Both studies contributed to our primary and secondary outcomes, but we assessed the quality of evidence for our three primary outcomes as low, owing to the small numbers of studies and participants; and high attrition in one of the studies. Data show no significant differences between treatment groups for our primary outcomes: proportion of children (n = 249) who had persistent symptoms at follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.28; fixed-effect model); and number of children (n = 240) rehospitalised with respiratory illness within six months (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21; random-effects model). We were unable to analyse exacerbation rate because studies used different methods to report this information. Data showed no significant differences between treatment groups for our secondary outcome: proportion of children (n = 240) with wheeze at six months (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.06 to 3.95; random-effects model). One study reported bacterial resistance, but only at 48 hours (thus with limited applicability for this review). Another study reported adverse events from which all children recovered and remained in the study.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to inform whether antibiotics should be used to treat or prevent persistent respiratory symptoms in the post-acute bronchiolitis phase. Future RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics for reducing persistent respiratory symptoms. This is particularly important in populations with high acute and post-acute bronchiolitis morbidity (e.g. indigenous populations in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients: 2024 update [^114QxmG1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory illness is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality amongst infectious diseases worldwide and a major public health issue. Even though most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This document reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. Imaging recommendations for adults presenting with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations are discussed. Finally, guidelines for follow-up imaging in suspected pneumonia cases to ensure occult malignancy is not overlooked. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or intermediate, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Acute bronchitis in immunocompetent adult outpatients — evaluation and pharmacologic management is summarized as follows: For immunocompetent adult outpatients presenting with cough due to suspected acute bronchitis, we suggest no routine investigation. If the cough persists or worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration of targeted investigations. We suggest no routine prescription of antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, antitussives, inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral NSAIDs, or other therapies. If the cough due to suspected acute bronchitis worsens, we suggest reassessment and consideration for treatment with antibiotic therapy if a bacterial infection is thought likely or treatment for other alternative conditions deemed likely.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute respiratory illness in immunocompetent patients [^115BC6PU]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory illness, defined as cough, sputum production, chest pain, and/or dyspnea (with or without fever), is a major public health issue, accounting for millions of doctor office and emergency department visits every year. While most cases are due to self-limited viral infections, a significant number of cases are due to more serious respiratory infections where delay in diagnosis can lead to morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays a key role in the initial diagnosis and management of acute respiratory illness. This study reviews the current literature concerning the appropriate role of imaging in the diagnosis and management of the immunocompetent adult patient initially presenting with acute respiratory illness. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Where is the supporting evidence for treating mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with antibiotics? A systematic review [^113MyjFe]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

For the identification of antibiotics trials in COPD patients, we used a comprehensive literature search described elsewhere. In brief, information specialists (Bazian, London, UK,) searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, March 2006) for any randomised trials on antibiotics in COPD patients. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all the identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The full text of any article that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers was ordered. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of retrieved articles and selected those meeting the inclusion criteria. Each reviewer's decisions were recorded in the Endnote file and any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Study selection

We included randomised head-to-head trials comparing any antibiotics or an antibiotic with placebo for the treatment of mild to moderate exacerbations in COPD patients. Placebo-controlled trials allow for an estimation of the specific effects of the treatment and offer a proof of effectiveness.

As with any systematic review on this topic, a difficulty is that definitions of COPD have varied over time. In particular, spirometry criteria became widespread only after 1995 and we accepted a clinical diagnosis of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema. However, in order to include only trials whose patients were very likely to have COPD, we included studies only if patients with chronic bronchitis were at least 40 years of age and/or if at least 80% were smokers or ex-smokers. The presence of these characteristics (chronic bronchitis, age and smoking history) renders a diagnosis of COPD according to modern (spirometric) criteria extremely likely. We defined patients to have 'mild to moderate exacerbations' if they needed any outpatient treatment (level I exacerbation) according to the Operational Classification of Severity of the European Respiratory and American Thoracic Societies.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

Methods

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing any antibiotics with placebo or no antibiotics in COPD patients suffering from an acute exacerbation defined as a worsening of a previous stable situation with symptoms such as increased dyspnea, increased cough, increased sputum volume or change in sputum colour. We considered studies if > 90% of patients had a clinical (physician-based) diagnosis of COPD or, ideally, spirometrically confirmed COPD. We excluded studies of patients with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma or bronchiectasis.

We included trials evaluating any antibiotics that were administered orally or parenterally daily for a minimum period of at least three days. We chose three days because this is the minimum duration for which antibiotics are usually prescribed in clinical practice for COPD exacerbations.

The outcome measure of primary interest was treatment failure defined as (1) no resolution of symptoms and signs as reported by patients or physicians or as (2) need for further antibiotics. Outcome measures of secondary interest were duration of hospital admission, admission to an intensive care unit, health-related quality of life, symptoms, mortality, and any adverse events registered during the study period.

Search strategy

The search was carried out by information specialists (Bazian, London, UK) and included searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2005 issue 4), PREMEDLINE (1960 to 1965), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE, March 2006). We entered all included studies into the Pub-med "related articles" function and the science citation index. In addition, we scrutinised the reference lists of included studies and review articles as well the conference proceedings of the international congresses of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society from 2000 to 2006 since these studies might not have been fully published yet. We also contacted representatives of the pharmaceutical industry for additional published or unpublished data (Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, BoehringerIngelheim, Pfizer and MSD). Finally, we searched international data bases for trial registration to identify ongoing or recently completed trials.

Study selection

Two members of the review team independently assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified citations without imposing any language restrictions. The reviewers then evaluated the full text of articles that seemed potentially eligible by one of the reviewers. Final decisions on in- and exclusion were recorded in the Endnote file and agreement was assessed using chance-adjusted kappa statistics.

### Efficacy of anti-inflammatory or antibiotic treatment in patients with non-complicated acute bronchitis and discoloured sputum: randomised placebo controlled trial [^113wvMtz]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute bronchitis implies a self limiting infection of the large airways and is characterised by cough without pneumonia. It is a prevalent disease and one of the most common reasons for visits in primary care. Patients often return to their doctor or seek other medical help as symptoms may persist for two or three weeks, mainly cough, which may be bothersome for some patients and could last for up to four weeks or more.

Acute bronchitis is mainly a viral infection. The role of bacteria in this infection continues to be controversial since bronchial biopsy samples have never shown bacterial invasion. It is thought that acute bronchitis reflects an inflammatory response of the epithelium of the bronchi to infections. Microscopic examination shows a thickening of the bronchial and tracheal mucosa corresponding to the inflamed areas. These findings are consistent with proximal lower airway inflammation observed with positron emission tomography.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^112EoMEf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients. Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Chronic cough due to stable chronic bronchitis: CHEST expert panel report [^115f7gpq]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic bronchitis (CB) PICO question 1 — search yield and study characteristics: PubMed identified 831 studies, Scopus identified 154 after removing duplicates, and systematic review searches found 31 after removing duplicates, totaling 1,016 studies retrieved; 89 of the 1,016 proceeded to full-text review. After full-text review and quality assessment, 25 studies were initially determined to meet all inclusion criteria and quality standards; however, none met the full population definition requiring exclusion of other respiratory or cardiac causes of chronic productive cough. Nearly all studies (24 of 25) used only self-report of symptoms to diagnose CB; only one study asked about physician-diagnosed CB or emphysema, and some studies (7 of 25) included pulmonary function testing.
