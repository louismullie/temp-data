## Question

vienva and depression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Vienva (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol) relates to depression, including risk, mechanisms, special populations, and management guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Vienva is and its regulatory status. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about depression and related precautions. Next, I will review the broader epidemiologic evidence on combined hormonal contraception and mood. After that, I need to consider mechanistic hypotheses and vulnerable subgroups. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations, including screening, monitoring, and alternatives, and I should double-check for any conflicting guidance or caveats before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the product and its classification. Vienva is a combined oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg, which places it among low-dose combined hormonal contraceptives, and its FDA labeling addresses mood-related adverse effects and precautions, which I should verify carefully [^113oH6Mb] [^114NqTTM].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA language on depression. The Vienva labeling lists depression among common side effects and instructs clinicians to monitor patients with a history of depression, discontinuing the drug if depression recurs to a serious degree; it also advises stopping the medication if a patient becomes significantly depressed while taking it and to consider an alternate contraceptive method to determine drug-relatedness, which is a key management signal I need to emphasize [^114NqTTM] [^1126BqzS] [^111sV34o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. The FDA notes that data on the association of combined hormonal contraceptives with onset or exacerbation of depression are limited, so while the label acknowledges risk, it does not establish a uniform causal effect across all users; I should frame counseling accordingly and avoid overstating certainty [^111sV34o].

> Next, I should review large-scale epidemiology. A Danish nationwide cohort of over 1 million women found that combined oral contraceptive users had a modestly increased risk of first antidepressant use and first depression diagnosis, with the highest relative risks in adolescents and a peak around 6 months after initiation; this supports a small but real signal at the population level, though confounding and indication bias remain possible [^114B9n2F]. Let me also consider prospective adolescent data: TRAILS showed higher depressive symptom scores among 16-year-old oral contraceptive users, particularly for crying, hypersomnia, and eating problems, reinforcing age-related vulnerability in early reproductive years [^114LSkKk].

> I will now examine perinatal data because timing matters. Large registry studies show that initiating hormonal contraception postpartum is associated with higher instantaneous risk of depression within 12 months, with the risk rising with earlier initiation; importantly, women with prior hormonal contraception–associated depression have a higher risk of postpartum depression than women with non–hormonal-contraception–associated depression, suggesting a hormonally sensitive phenotype that recurs across reproductive transitions [^1122jrSL] [^113JwLRC] [^115bk65C] [^117VrCqG].

> But wait, what about mechanisms? Let me consider biologic plausibility. Combined oral contraceptives alter endogenous estrogen and progestin signaling, which can modulate serotonergic neurotransmission; emerging evidence links estrogen receptor pathways and serotonin-related brain mechanisms to hormone-triggered depressive symptoms in susceptible women, and twin data suggest a genetic substrate for contraceptive-associated depressive symptoms, which helps explain heterogeneity of response [^1123TWKs] [^115rAppx].

> I need to ensure I identify who is most vulnerable. Adolescents appear at higher risk of mood effects with combined oral contraceptives, women with a personal history of depression or prior hormonal contraception–associated mood changes are at increased risk of recurrence or exacerbation, and the immediate postpartum period is a window of heightened susceptibility; these groups warrant enhanced screening and closer follow-up if combined hormonal contraception is used [^114LSkKk] [^111sV34o] [^1122jrSL] [^113JwLRC].

> Let me think about clinical management and monitoring. Before prescribing Vienva, I should screen for current or past depression, including episodes temporally linked to hormonal transitions, and document baseline mood; during use, I should reassess mood within the first 3 months and again around 6 months, given the observed peak in risk, and advise patients to report emergent mood symptoms promptly; if significant depression emerges or recurs, I should consider discontinuation and an alternative method, consistent with FDA guidance [^111sV34o] [^1126BqzS] [^114B9n2F].

> Hold on, I should verify what alternatives are reasonable if mood symptoms occur. Nonhormonal methods such as copper IUD or barrier methods avoid exogenous hormones entirely, while progestin-only methods may have a different mood profile; systematic reviews suggest minimal association between progestin-only contraception and depression overall, though individual responses vary, so shared decision-making and close follow-up remain essential if switching within hormonal methods [^114AStWr] [^115rAppx].

> I should double-check for conflicting guidance. The U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria classify depressive disorders as category 1 for combined hormonal contraceptives, indicating no restriction on use, but they advise reviewing drug interactions if the patient is on psychotropics or St. John's wort; this means CHCs are generally permissible, but clinicians should remain vigilant for mood changes and manage interactions that could lower contraceptive efficacy or alter mood stability [^111NatgE] [^111RUt7B].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure balance. The evidence indicates a small increase in depression risk with combined oral contraceptives at the population level, with stronger signals in adolescents and in women with prior hormonal sensitivity; Vienva's FDA labeling reflects this by advising monitoring and discontinuation if depression emerges or worsens, and large perinatal datasets suggest that prior hormonal contraception–associated depression identifies a subgroup at higher risk of postpartum depression, which is clinically actionable for anticipatory guidance and follow-up planning [^114B9n2F] [^111sV34o] [^113JwLRC] [^117VrCqG].

---

Vienva (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol) **can worsen or trigger depression** in some users, especially those with a history of depression or mood disorders [^111sV34o] [^114NqTTM]. The FDA label advises **monitoring for mood changes** and discontinuing use if significant depression occurs [^1126BqzS]. Large observational studies link hormonal contraception to **increased antidepressant use** and depression diagnoses, with higher risk in adolescents and young women [^114B9n2F] [^114LSkKk]. Clinicians should screen for depression before prescribing, monitor closely during use, and consider non-hormonal options if mood symptoms arise [^113oH6Mb] [^1126BqzS].

---

## Evidence linking Vienva to depression

### Clinical studies and observational data

- **Danish cohort (2016)**: Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) were associated with higher rates of antidepressant use and depression diagnoses, especially in adolescents and young women [^114B9n2F].

- **TRAILS study (2020)**: Adolescent users of oral contraceptives had higher depressive symptom scores than nonusers, indicating increased risk in younger users [^114LSkKk].

- **Postpartum cohort (2025)**: Initiating hormonal contraception postpartum was associated with a 1.49-fold higher risk of depression within 12 months, with earlier initiation increasing risk [^1122jrSL].

---

### Biological mechanisms

- **Neurotransmitter modulation**: Hormonal contraceptives may alter serotonin and other neurotransmitters, potentially triggering mood changes [^1123TWKs].

- **Hormonal sensitivity**: Some women appear uniquely sensitive to hormonal shifts, increasing susceptibility to mood disturbances [^1123TWKs].

---

## FDA warnings and clinical guidelines

FDA labeling for Vienva explicitly lists **depression** as a possible adverse effect and advises monitoring for mood changes, especially in patients with a history of depression [^114NqTTM]. The label also recommends **discontinuing Vienva** if significant depression recurs or develops during use [^1126BqzS]. U.S. medical eligibility criteria classify depressive disorders as **category 1** for CHCs (no restriction), but advise monitoring and caution, particularly in patients with severe or recurrent depression [^111NatgE].

---

## Risk factors for depression associated with Vienva

Several factors **increase the risk** of depression with Vienva:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Adolescents and young women have higher risk [^114B9n2F] [^114LSkKk] |
| History of depression | Personal or family history increases susceptibility [^notfound] |
| Hormonal sensitivity | Women with PMDD or prior HC-associated mood changes [^115SNHk1] |
| Postpartum period | Initiating HC postpartum increases depression risk [^1122jrSL] |

---

## Clinical management and recommendations

- **Screening**: Assess for depression and mood disorders before prescribing Vienva [^113oH6Mb].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor mood during use, especially in the first few months [^114B9n2F].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop Vienva if significant depression or mood changes occur [^1126BqzS].

- **Alternative contraception**: Consider non-hormonal methods (e.g. copper IUD, condoms) for patients with a history of depression or mood sensitivity [^113oH6Mb].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patients should be informed about the **potential risk** of depression with Vienva and advised to report mood changes promptly [^114NqTTM]. They should also be educated on non-hormonal alternatives and supported in choosing a method that aligns with their mental health history and preferences [^113FL2A6].

---

Vienva can **worsen or trigger depression**, particularly in adolescents, young women, and those with a history of depression. Clinicians should screen, monitor, and be ready to switch methods if mood symptoms emerge, with non-hormonal options as safer alternatives for high-risk patients [^114B9n2F] [^114LSkKk] [^111NatgE].

Tell your health-care provider if you have had any of these conditions. Your health-care provider can recommend another method of birth control.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Tell your health-care provider if you or any family member has ever had:

Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast X-ray or mammogram
Diabetes
Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides
High blood pressure
A tendency to form blood clots.
Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy
Depression
Gallbladder, liver, heart, or kidney disease
History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods

Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their health-care provider if they choose to use oral contraceptives. Also, be sure to inform your health-care provider if you smoke or are on any medications.

Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use in healthy, non-smoking women over 40 (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.

RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Risks of developing blood clots

Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.

2. Possible cancer that is sensitive to female hormones or possible cancer of the cervix

Women who have or have ever had breast cancer, or any cancer sensitive to female hormones – such as skin cancer (melanoma), lung cancer, and brain cancer, should not use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. However, birth control pills do not seem to cause cancer.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons, such as having more sexual partners.

3. Contact lenses

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your health-care provider.

4. Fluid retention

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your health-care provider.

5. Melasma

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

6. Other side effects

Other side effects may include nausea, breast tenderness, change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, vaginal infections, inflammation of the pancreas, and allergic reactions.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (vienva TM) [^1126BqzS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Liver Function

If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

5. Fluid Retention

Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.

6. Emotional Disorders

Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related. Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.

7. Contact Lenses

Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.

8. Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations.

9. Drug Interactions

Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products

Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a back-up nonhormonal method of birth control should be considered.

5. Fluid Retention

Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.

6. Depression

Monitor females with a history of depression and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of CHCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited.

7. Contact Lenses

Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.

8. Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations. If a patient vomits or has diarrhea after taking an active tablet, instruct the patient to not take an additional active tablet on that day and to continue the regimen the next day as prescribed. In case of vomiting or diarrhea that continues for 48 hours or greater, instruct the patient to contact the health care provider and use back-up or alternative contraception until active tablets have been taken for 7 consecutive days after vomiting and diarrhea have resolved.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Unscheduled or breakthrough vaginal bleeding or spotting

Unscheduled vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral-contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your health-care provider.

2. Contact lenses

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your health-care provider.

3. Fluid retention

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your health-care provider.

4. Melasma

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.

5. Other side effects

DETAILED PATIENT LABELING

This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.

INTRODUCTION

Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the "birth-control pill" or "the pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your health-care provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your health-care provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill.

EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Oral contraceptives or "birth-control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other nonsurgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates are approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during each 28-day cycle of use.

### A longitudinal study of the subjective birth experience and the relationship to mental health [^116BE1g9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present analysis was to systematically examine the different facets of the birth experience in a large sample of women aiming to give birth vaginally and to explore the development of the subjective birth experience over time until 6 months postpartum. Due to the high significance for the birth experience, the influence of FOC was included in the analysis. It is likely that the perceived changes over time in the remembered birth experience are also be influenced by prepartum FOC. In addition, the birth mode was included as a further factor. Because the desire for a sense of control over birth is also significant, the mode of birth may also play a role in the subjective birth experience. In a second step, the connection between the different facets of the birth experience and depressive and traumatic symptoms were examined. Although a link between birth assessment and development of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms is suggested by the literature, it would be important to understand which aspects of the birth experience are of particular importance in this regard and how these connections develops over time. The aim is to investigate the change in the birth experience over time and the influence of FOC and birth mode on the birth experience. In addition, the connection between the various birth dimensions and depressive and post-traumatic symptoms will be investigated.

### Prospective associations between prepartum physical activity, birth experience, and maternal depressive symptoms in the postpartum period: insights from the population-based DREAM cohort study [^111BbThy]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aims to examine whether physical activity (PA) before and during pregnancy and birth experience predict incident postpartum depressive (PPD) symptoms. Because PA may increase endurance and feelings of physical control, it may contribute to a positive birth experience and birth experience may mediate the association between PA before and during pregnancy and PPD symptoms.

Methods

The study is part of the prospective-longitudinal cohort study "Dresden Study on Parenting, Work, and Mental Health" (DREAM). Participants were n = 1,254 (expectant) mothers. PA was assessed during pregnancy, birth experience and PPD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum. Multiple regression analyses were performed, including potential confounders.

Results

A negative birth experience was linked to PPD symptoms, when controlling for relevant confounders. There was no evidence for a link between PA before and during pregnancy and birth experience or between PA during pregnancy and PPD symptoms. PA at low and at vigorous intensity before pregnancy was associated with PPD symptoms, but not when controlling for confounders. Because PA was not associated with birth experience, no mediation analysis was performed.

Limitations

The current sample was relatively homogenous (i.e., mostly German native speakers, primiparous, highly educated). Birth experience was assessed retrospectively at 8 weeks following birth.

Conclusions

Our results highlight the importance of the birth experience in the development of PPD symptoms. Promoting a positive birth experience represents a promising approach to prevent PPD symptoms. Further research on the association between PA and PPD symptoms is warranted.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^113JwLRC]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is prior hormonal contraception (HC)–associated depression associated with a higher risk of postpartum depression compared with prior depression not associated with HC use?

Findings

In this cohort study of 188 648 first-time mothers, prior depression after initiation of HC was associated with a higher risk of postpartum depression than prior depression not associated with HC initiation.

Meaning

The study's findings suggest that depression associated with HC use can indicate postpartum depression susceptibility and may provide evidence for a link between depressive episodes with possible hormonal contributions and point to the existence of a subgroup of women sensitive to hormonal transitions across their reproductive life spans.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (vienva) [^113FL2A6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.

Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your health-care provider. Your health-care provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the health-care provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your health-care provider.

HOW TO TAKE VIENVA

IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER

BEFORE YOU START TAKING VIENVA:

BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS:
Before you start taking Vienva.
And
Anytime you are not sure what to do.
THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME.
If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" below.
MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1–3 PACKS OF PILLS.
If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking Vienva. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your health-care provider.
MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills.
On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
IF YOU HAVE VOMITING (within 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well.
Use a back-up nonhormonal method (such as condoms or spermicide) until you check with your health-care provider.
IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your health-care provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your health-care provider.

### Depression and violence in adolescence and young adults: findings from three longitudinal cohorts [^1131tCRv]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite recent research demonstrating associations between violence and depression in adults, links in adolescents are uncertain. This study aims to assess the longitudinal associations between young people's depression and later violent outcomes.

Method

We used data from three cohorts with different measurements of depression exposures and subsequent violent outcomes. In a Dutch community cohort Research on Adolescent Development And Relationships (RADAR; N = 623) and a population-based British birth cohort Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N = 4,030), we examined the longitudinal links between adolescent depressive symptoms and violent behaviors from age 13 to 17 years. In a total Finnish birth cohort (FBC 1987; N = 57,526), we estimated risk of violent convictions in individuals clinically diagnosed with depression from age 15 to 27 years.

Results

During a mean follow-up period of 4 years, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of violent behaviors per unit of increase in depressive symptoms was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.2–2.5) in the Dutch RADAR community sample and 1.8 (95% CI = 1.4–2.3) in the British ALSPAC birth cohort. In the FBC 1987 cohort, the aOR of violent convictions was 2.1 (95% CI = 1.7–2.7) among individuals with a depression diagnosis compared with general population controls without depression. All risk estimates were adjusted for family socioeconomic status and previous violence.

Conclusion

Consistent findings across three longitudinal studies suggest that clinical guidelines should consider recommending risk assessment for violence in young people with depression. The benefits of targeting risk management in subgroups by gender need further investigation.

### "I can' T believe it wasn' T perfect": childbirth experiences of Ghanaian birth tourists in the United States of America [^111VcZvf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Theoretical perspective: childbirth experience and obstetric violence

A person's experience is a constant flow of thoughts and feelings during moments of consciousness. Although intangible and immaterial, people value them highly because they are memorable. Regarding childbirth, Taheri et al. viewed the experience as a woman's self-evaluation of her labour and delivery, often recalled through long-term memory. This subjective assessment encompasses factors such as control, fulfilment of expectations, confidence, and involvement in decision-making. Childbirth experiences are shaped by multiple components, including decision-making (e.g. choices regarding place of birth and the presence of preferred health professionals), contextual factors (such as a serene environment, supportive midwives, and a sense of control during labour), meanings attached to the modes of delivery (e.g. vaginal births versus caesarean section), and the nature of interactions with healthcare workers, particularly in terms of respect, communication, and supportive care, or the lack thereof. No two people can thus have the same experience owing to the complex interplay between individual expectations, provider behaviour, and healthcare system dynamics. Consequently, childbirth can be experienced as empowering and transformative or, conversely, as traumatic and disempowering.

Positive birth experiences enhance women's feelings of accomplishment and self-esteem, leading to psychological growth, empowerment, and easier adaptation to motherhood. Conversely, negative experiences, common worldwide, are linked to complications such as postpartum anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress syndrome, breastfeeding and bonding difficulties, fear of childbirth, decreased future reproduction, caesarean requests, chronic pain, pelvic floor issues, and adverse effects on child development and health. Though brief, birth experiences have lasting impacts on mothers.

The theory of obstetric violence offers a critical framework for understanding negative childbirth experiences, especially those involving coercion, disrespect, and abuse, as manifestations of systemic violence within institutional maternity care, rather than isolated incidents. Shabot defines obstetric violence as a form of structural and epistemic violence that strips women of agency in clinical settings, where medicalisation often silences their autonomy and transforms them into passive recipients of care. Other scholars similarly view it as a human rights violation rooted in gendered power structures, normalised through routine practices such as non-consensual procedures, verbal abuse, and neglect.

### Postpartum hormonal contraceptive use and risk of depression [^1122jrSL]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is hormonal contraceptive (HC) initiation post partum associated with the risk of developing depression within 12 months after delivery?

Findings

In this cohort study of 610 038 first-time mothers, HC initiation post partum was associated with a 1.49 times higher instantaneous risk of depression compared with no HC use, and this was consistent across HC types, except for progestogen-only pills, for which it was initially reduced and subsequently increased late post partum. The earlier combined oral contraceptive use was initiated post partum the higher the associated rate ratio of depression.

Meaning

These findings suggest that starting HC post partum is associated with an increased risk of developing depression post partum.

---

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^115bk65C]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hormonal sensitivity may contribute to the risk of depression in some women, as observed during the premenstrual, postpartum, and perimenopausal phases, and when initiating hormonal contraception (HC). However, little evidence exists to support that such depressive episodes are linked across the reproductive life span.

Objective

To determine whether prior depression associated with HC initiation is coupled with a higher risk of postpartum depression (PPD) than prior depression not associated with HC initiation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used Danish health registry data collected from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2017, and analyzed from March 1, 2021, through January 1, 2023. All women living in Denmark born after 1978 with their first delivery between January 1, 1996, and June 30, 2017, were eligible for inclusion; 269 354 met these criteria. Women were then excluded if they had never used HC or if they had a depressive episode before 1996 or within 12 months prior to delivery.

Exposures

Prior depression associated with vs not associated with HC initiation, ie, if developed within 6 months after start of an HC exposure or not. Depression was defined as a hospital diagnosis of depression or filling a prescription for antidepressant medication.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the incidence of PPD defined as the development of depression within 6 months after first delivery.

Results

Of 188 648 first-time mothers, 5722 (3.0%) (mean [SD] age, 26.7 [3.9] years) had a history of depression associated with initiation of HC use, and 18 431 (9.8%) (mean [SD] age, 27.1 [3.8] years) had a history of depression not associated with the initiation of HC. Women with HC-associated depression had a higher risk of PPD than women with prior non-HC-associated depression (crude OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24–1.64]; adjusted OR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.17–1.56]).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that a history of HC-associated depression may be associated with a higher risk of PPD, supporting that HC-associated depression may indicate PPD susceptibility. This finding offers a novel strategy in clinical PPD risk stratification and points to the existence of a hormone-sensitive subgroup of women.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^111g21Cg]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Women are approximately twice as likely to develop depressive episodes compared with men. This gap between sexes starts during adolescence, which coincides with menarche in girls, and lasts until menopause. Hence, a woman's reproductive life span is a time of heightened vulnerability for depression, aligning with an increased risk of depression associated with hormonal transitions across the menstrual cycle, when 3% to 8% of women experience premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); the peripartum period, when approximately 13% of women experience postpartum depression (PPD); and the perimenopausal period, when large estradiol fluctuations predict risk of perimenopausal depression. Concerningly, initiating hormonal contraception (HC) also has been associated with an increased risk of developing a depressive episode.

Women experiencing depressive episodes associated with hormonal transitions may comprise a certain hormone-sensitive subgroup of women within the broader diagnostic category of major depressive disorder. Since treatment of major depressive disorder is far from optimal, identification of relevant subgroups with distinct etiologic contributions to the disorder and responsiveness to certain triggers or treatments would help to build a much-needed rationale for precision medicine in psychiatry. However, little is known about whether the depressive episodes across women's reproductive lives share similar etiology or whether they are linked. Some evidence supports that women with PPD are more likely to have a history of PMDD and that women who experience depressive symptoms in perimenopause are more likely to have a history of PPD and PMDD. However, the evidence is based on retrospective reports susceptible to recall and confirmation biases and lack the use of confirmed clinical diagnoses and, therefore, represent only limited evidence. The few studies that have investigated depressive symptoms associated with hormonal transitions and HC-associated mood deterioration are likely underpowered and have shown inconsistent results. Therefore, large-scale observational studies spanning the reproductive age are needed to shed light on the complex associations between depressive episodes occurring throughout women's lives.

This study takes advantage of Danish national health registers to evaluate the existence of a subgroup of women who are prone to develop depressive episodes across hormonal transitions, including transitions induced by exogenous hormone exposure in terms of HC. We examined whether such depressive episodes are associated with one another across a woman's reproductive life span; specifically, we examined whether a history of a depressive episode associated with initiation of HC poses a higher risk for later PPD compared with a history of depression not associated with HC initiation.

### Assessing the impact of contraceptive use on mental health among women of reproductive age-a systematic review [^11569TWK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies

While our study identified negative mental health effects among women using contraceptives, it's noteworthy to consider the contrasting findings from previous research. Schaffir's study, for instance, reported either no effect or even a beneficial effect on mood among combined hormonal contraceptive users with no history of mental health issues. In alignment with our study's outcomes, Pérez-López's investigation indicated a significantly higher risk of suicide among women treated with hormonal contraceptives. Interestingly, a study on levonorgestrel intrauterine device users found no adverse effects on mental health, a result inconsistent with our findings, which indicated a higher risk of depression and increased antidepressant use among these users. Moreover, this particular study highlighted a link between sexual dysfunction or low sexual function elevated depressive symptoms, and lower quality of life. It is worth noting that none of the studies explored the potential synergistic effect of sexual dysfunction and contraceptive use on mental health outcomes. Among women with pre-existing depressive or bipolar disorders who use hormonal contraceptives, we reported no association with increased depressive symptoms, similar to another review conducted. Regrettably, none of the included studies investigated the association between contraceptives and the development of postpartum depression, highlighting a notable gap in the existing literature. These nuanced insights underscore the need for comprehensive research addressing the multifaceted relationship between contraceptive use and mental health outcomes, including potential synergies with sexual dysfunction and the postpartum period.

Strengths

Initially, a comprehensive search was conducted in the databases for all relevant studies, encompassing outdated as well as current contraceptive methods, with a wide scope of coverage. Subsequently, our investigations covered diseases and conditions that are commonly observed in women of reproductive age, for each outcome category. For a few of these outcomes, we identified a handful of studies that produced larger pooled sample sizes, resulting in enhanced statistical power, narrower confidence intervals, and more trustworthy findings. Furthermore, in addition to exploring the efficacy of contraception for its intended contraceptive purposes, we also investigated its effectiveness as a treatment. This supplementary evidence supports the use of contraception as a treatment in clinical settings and justifies reasonable insurance coverage.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^117VrCqG]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence for the existence of a subgroup of women who are sensitive to hormonal transitions across the reproductive life span by showing that a history of depression coinciding with the initiation of HC may be associated with a higher risk of PPD beyond the risk of a history of depression not coinciding with HC initiation. Importantly, the findings do not imply that HC use leads to a higher risk of PPD but do indicate that a history of HC-associated depression may unmask PPD susceptibility, which may prove useful as a clinical tool in PPD risk stratification.

### Offspring outcomes in studies of antidepressant-treated pregnancies depend on the choice of control group [^116XqG92]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Antenatal depression complicates 14%-23% of pregnancies; if the depression is left untreated, there is an increased risk of a wide range of adverse maternal and offspring outcomes. However, antidepressant use, and, more specifically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, has also been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Regrettably, SSRIs have received bad press in this context even though the evidence linking them with the adverse outcomes has not disentangled depression effects from drug effects. The most important reason why depression and drug effects cannot be separated is that the evidence is derived mostly from retrospective observational studies and not from randomized controlled trials, which are necessary but which cannot be performed during pregnancy for ethical and practical reasons. In these observational studies, the control groups are formed from healthy women, depressed women, and/or propensity score-matched women who did not receive antidepressant drugs during pregnancy. A limitation of such control groups is that they cannot control for confounding arising from poorly measured, unmeasured, or unknown variables that influence the pregnancy outcomes being assessed. This article discusses problems involved in such research and illustrates how, when confounding is diminished by using sibling controls discordant for antidepressant exposure during pregnancy, the risks of adverse outcomes associated with antidepressant exposure diminish. However, a discordant sibling control group is associated with its own limitations, and these are also discussed.

### The relationship between progestin hormonal contraception and depression: a systematic review [^114AStWr]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review to look for an association between progestin-only contraception and depression.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Ovid and Web of Science for English-language articles including progestin-only contraception and depression from database inception to September 2016. We evaluated study quality with the procedures guiding reviews for the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools. We included studies that evaluated progestin-only contraception and depression, focusing on externally validated depression measures. We excluded case studies, review articles and other psychiatric disorders.

Results

We identified 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, including 5 randomized controlled trials, 11 cohort studies and 10 cross-sectional studies. We found minimal association between progestin-only methods and depression. No correlation with depression was found in five low-quality, high-risk-of-bias progestin subdermal implant studies and four out of five varying-quality and medium-risk-of-bias levonorgestrel intrauterine device studies. Three medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular injection trials with varying levels of quality and bias show no difference in depression. Two progestin-only contraceptive pill studies with varying levels of quality and bias indicate no increase in depression scores, while one good-quality, medium-bias study shows an association between progestin-only pills, the intrauterine device and depression.

Conclusion

Despite perceptions in the community of increased depression following the initiation of progestin contraceptives, the preponderance of evidence does not support an association based on validated measures (mostly level II-1 evidence, moderate quality, low risk of bias).

### Effects of three contraceptive methods on depression and sexual function: an ancillary study of the ECHO randomized trial [^112vi4Bm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contraceptive discontinuation is a major issue that impacts unintended pregnancy rates. Therefore, understanding the reasons for discontinuation is necessary to develop effective contraceptive services with appropriate counseling to inform women's contraceptive choices, and to manage adverse effects appropriately should these arise. Discontinuation rates for injectable progestins and the copper intrauterine device (IUD) in our setting are high, reported in a large locally conducted randomized trial as 16.5% and 14.7%, respectively, at a median of 20 months after initiation. Furthermore, in the recently published Evidence for Contraceptive options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) Trial in which our Effective Care Research Unit participated, contraceptive discontinuation was associated with 71% of 181 pregnancies that occurred during the course of the trial.

Despite their common occurrence, differences in adverse effects between contraceptive agents remain poorly elucidated. Specifically, the effect of contraception on mood has been under‐studied, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries, with published reports from high‐income countries suggesting the possibility of both an increase and a decrease in depression risk. A nationwide cohort study from Denmark found that, compared with non‐users, use of various types of hormonal contraception was associated with a higher risk of subsequent depression and use of antidepressants; hormonal contraception has also been linked with suicide attempts and suicide. In contrast, a national study from the United States reported reduced levels of depressive symptoms among sexually active women taking hormonal contraception. In addition, a Swedish cohort study found an association between contraception and the use of psychotropic medicine among adolescents. The effects of contraceptives on mood may be complex, including, for example, biological effects on endogenous steroid hormones and psychological effects, such as relief from anxiety about unintended conception. The only study to date that has evaluated biological and psychological effects related to contraception was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in South Africa, which found increased postnatal depression among women using progestin‐only contraception. Such confusing and contradictory findings suggest that robust evidence from randomized trials is needed, but such studies are rare because of anticipated difficulties in randomizing women to different contraceptive agents.

### Associations between reproductive health factors and sociodemographic characteristics and the severity of moderate to severe postmenopausal depression: a secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data [^116JM7j1]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Depression is a heterogeneous condition with significant gender differences, where women are at a greater risk of depression, the prevalence rates for women and men are 2:1, respectively. It appears that depression in women may also increase due to reproductive events, such as postpartum depression following childbirth, a premenstrual dysphoric disorder related to the menstrual cycle, and menopausal depression, possibly associated with factors such as sensitivity to changes in reproductive hormones.

Menopause, marked by 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, results in significant clinical consequences due to the significant loss of estrogen and progesterone caused by the cessation of ovarian function. Premature menopause, defined as cessation of menses before 45 or as premature ovarian failure before 40, reduces fertility and leads to metabolic, cardiovascular, osteoarticular, genitourinary, sexual, and mood disturbances. Late-onset menopause, defined as occurring at age 55 or older, results in prolonged estrogen exposure and an increased risk of hormone-dependent cancers. Menopause represents a critical window for the onset of depression, during which depressive symptoms often co-occur with various menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor disturbances, sleep disruption, fatigue, and urinary incontinence. These overlapping symptoms suggest a strong link between the hormonal changes of menopause and the exacerbation of depressive episodes. Postmenopausal women experience changes in estradiol levels, which may increase their sensitivity to psychosocial stress, making them more susceptible to developing depressive symptoms. The steady and ongoing reduction in hormone production and function, associated with aging, negatively affects human health by elevating the risk of chronic illnesses and shortening life expectancy.

### The association between postpartum depressive symptoms and contraception [^115dDTvu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum depression affects 10% to 20% of birthing people and is associated with changes in healthcare use. Little is known about the association between postpartum depressive symptoms and choice to use contraception; however, both untreated or undertreated depression and short interpregnancy intervals pose substantial perinatal health risks.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate whether postpartum depressive symptoms are associated with changes in decisions to use any method of contraception.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included birthing people who delivered between 2017 and 2022 and were referred to a collaborative care program for mental healthcare. Through this program, birthing people with mental health conditions have access to specialized perinatal mental healthcare and prospective symptom monitoring via a patient registry. Postpartum depressive symptoms are assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and scores were stratified by severity according to clinical cutoffs. Contraceptive method choice was determined by documentation in the electronic health record and dichotomized as "none" if the participant declined all forms of contraception both at delivery and at the postpartum visit. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed.

Results

Of the 1871 participants that met the inclusion criteria, 160 (8.5%) had postpartum Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of > 14, representing moderately severe or worse depressive symptoms, and 43 (2.3%) had severe (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 of > 19) depressive symptoms. Birthing people with higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were more likely to have medical comorbidities; to have a higher body mass index; to self-identify as Black, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or Hispanic or Latina; and to have a preterm delivery and less likely to be married or nulliparous than those with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of ≤ 14. There was no difference in any other sociodemographic or clinical characteristics. The choice to use any contraceptive method decreased with increasing depressive symptoms in bivariable and multivariable analyses, reaching statistical significance in birthing people with severe depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–5.84).

Conclusion

Severe perinatal depressive symptoms are associated with a declination of any form of postpartum contraception. This finding becomes increasingly relevant as abortion access continues to be threatened across the United States, compounding the potential effect of opting not to use contraception.

### Assessing causal links between age at menarche and adolescent mental health: a mendelian randomisation study [^114JWa3D]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mental health problems

Depressive symptoms were assessed through the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ; 13 items). We also computed a dichotomised version of the SMFQ (see Additional file 1). Anxiety symptoms were assessed through a short form of the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED; 5 items). Behaviour problems (CD, ODD, and ADHD) were assessed with the Rating Scale for Disruptive Behaviour Disorders (RS-DBD; 34 items). All symptom outcomes were log or square root transformed due to non-normal distributions. The measures were treated as continuous, and scores were standardised to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Information about the psychometric properties of the scales is provided in Additional file 2: Table S1. An overview of all variables included in the study and their processing is in Additional file 3: Table S2.

Psychiatric diagnoses

We linked to the "control and payment of health refunds" database (KUHR) and the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) to obtain psychiatric diagnoses from medical records (see Additional file 1 for diagnostic codes and further details). Individuals were classified as a "case" in the case–control analysis if they had received a relevant diagnosis in either primary (covered by KUHR) or secondary health care (covered by NPR) during adolescence (between ages 10 and 17).

Covariates

We included BMI at ages 8 and 14, age at questionnaire return, maternal and paternal age, parental education and income, financial problems, parental cohabitation, parity, and maternal prenatal and postnatal depression as covariates (see Additional file 3: Table S2).

Genotyping and quality control

In MoBa, blood samples were obtained from children (umbilical cord) at birth. The genotyping and quality control have been described in detail elsewhere.

### Contraception and mental health: a commentary on the evidence and principles for practice [^111qrNfT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Among the most prevalent and disabling chronic diseases affecting reproductive-aged women worldwide, depression and anxiety can contribute to adverse reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of unintended pregnancy and its health and social consequences. For women with these common mental health conditions who want to avoid an unintended pregnancy, effective contraception can be an important strategy to maintain and even improve health and well-being. Reproductive health clinicians play a critical role in providing and managing contraception to help women with mental health considerations achieve their desired fertility. In this commentary, we review the literature on relationships between mental health and contraception and describe considerations for the clinical management of contraception among women with depression and anxiety. We discuss issues related to contraceptive method effectiveness and adherence concerns, mental health-specific contraceptive method safety and drug interaction considerations, and clinical counseling and management strategies. Given important gaps in current scientific knowledge of mental health and contraception, we highlight areas for future research.

### Postpartum hormonal contraceptive use and risk of depression [^11639dqW]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hormonal contraceptive (HC) initiation has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression. It is unclear whether this also applies in the postpartum period, when women are already at a heightened risk of developing depression. In Denmark, as many as 40% of mothers initiate HC methods within the first year after delivery and throughout the past 20 years they have started at a shorter and shorter time interval after delivery. This raises the issue of whether the routine practice of HC initiation in the postpartum period inflates the already heightened risk of depression. Only a few studies have previously addressed this and found conflicting results; however, they were limited by lack of generalizability, insufficient follow-up time, and insufficient accounting for potential confounders.

Herein, we use the Danish national health registers to investigate HC initiation post partum and depression risk in a large, unselected population with a 1-year follow-up time while accounting for various potential confounders, such as medical indications for HC use. Specifically, the objective is to examine whether HC initiation post partum is associated with an increased risk of depression in the postpartum period compared with no HC exposure and whether it depends on age, HC type, and timing of initiation post partum.

### Postpartum hormonal contraceptive use and risk of depression [^115SNHk1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In contrast to studies outside the postpartum period, our study found no conclusive pattern of higher risk associated with HC use among the younger compared with older women after stratifying on covariates showing evidence of time-varying effects. It has been hypothesized that a younger brain under development, that is, in adolescence, may be more susceptible to exogenous hormones, but such a difference in susceptibility may attenuate due to the structural and functional brain changes happening in relation to pregnancy and childbirth.

The higher risk of depression in the postpartum period associated with HC initiation highlights the importance of considering HC exposure as a link to the already heightened risk of depression in women in the postpartum period. Furthermore, providing that our explorative analysis is replicated, the timing of initiation may be important to consider since the early postpartum period may represent a relevant window of vulnerability. This should be considered especially at postpartum contraceptive counseling where a history of HC-associated mood deterioration, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or postpartum depression may add to such risk profiling.

Strengths and Limitations

One strength of the study is the use of national health registers, providing a nationwide, unselected study population with information on various potential confounders. Furthermore, it involves a population of women who had all just given birth for the first time and who were advised to consider contraceptive methods at postpartum counseling. This approach may reduce some of the potential confounders related to the decision to start HC, which might be more present at other lifetime periods.

Our study also has several limitations. First, the study is observational; hence, it is not possible to infer a causal link. Second, depression is not always the indication for antidepressant use, which may lead to a misclassification bias; however, as many as 80% of antidepressants are prescribed for depression during pregnancy, and if such a misclassification is expected to be nondifferential, it would bias the results toward the null. Third, the day a prescription was filled may not mirror the day of initiation or whether HCs were actually used post partum, potentially leading to a misclassification that could bias toward the null. Fourth, the findings may also be attenuated by a healthy user bias due to women not starting HCs post partum because of previous adverse experiences. Fifth, our findings may not extend to milder cases of depression, which do not require medication or specialist referral and therefore go undetected. Undetected cases are a potential source of bias if the frequency of detection is exposure dependent beyond the covariates included in the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^113zXgHP]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Results

The study population included 188 648 first-time mothers (Figure 1). Of all 269 354 eligible women, 84% had used HC before their first child was born. Of the study population, 2457 developed PPD, corresponding to an incidence rate of 1.3%. Furthermore, 5722 first-time mothers (3.0%; mean [SD] age, 26.7 [3.9] years) had a history of HC-associated depression, 18 431 (9.8%; mean age [SD], 27.1 [3.8] years) had a history of non–HC-associated depression, and 164 495 (87.2%; mean age [SD], 26.3 [3.9] years) had no history of depression. A summary of demographic characteristics and clinical profiles among the exposure groups is shown in Table 1. Notably, women with HC-associated depression had more depressive episodes than women with non–HC-associated depression, with 63.4% vs 38.6% having had more than 1 episode, respectively.

### Association of hormonal contraception with depression [^114B9n2F]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Millions of women worldwide use hormonal contraception. Despite the clinical evidence of an influence of hormonal contraception on some women's mood, associations between the use of hormonal contraception and mood disturbances remain inadequately addressed.

Objective

To investigate whether the use of hormonal contraception is positively associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a diagnosis of depression at a psychiatric hospital.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide prospective cohort study combined data from the National Prescription Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register in Denmark. All women and adolescents aged 15 to 34 years who were living in Denmark were followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 2013, if they had no prior depression diagnosis, redeemed prescription for antidepressants, other major psychiatric diagnosis, cancer, venous thrombosis, or infertility treatment. Data were collected from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2013, and analyzed from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2016.

Exposures

Use of different types of hormonal contraception.

Main Outcomes and Measures

With time-varying covariates, adjusted incidence rate ratios (RRs) were calculated for first use of an antidepressant and first diagnosis of depression at a psychiatric hospital.

Results

A total of 1 061 997 women (mean [SD] age, 24.4 [0.001] years; mean [SD] follow-up, 6.4 [0.004] years) were included in the analysis. Compared with nonusers, users of combined oral contraceptives had an RR of first use of an antidepressant of 1.23 (95% CI, 1.22–1.25). Users of progestogen-only pills had an RR for first use of an antidepressant of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.27–1.40); users of a patch (norgestrolmin), 2.0 (95% CI, 1.76–2.18); users of a vaginal ring (etonogestrel), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.55–1.69); and users of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system, 1.4 (95% CI, 1.31–1.42). For depression diagnoses, similar or slightly lower estimates were found. The relative risks generally decreased with increasing age. Adolescents (age range, 15–19 years) using combined oral contraceptives had an RR of a first use of an antidepressant of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.75–1.84) and those using progestin-only pills, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.99–2.52). Six months after starting use of hormonal contraceptives, the RR of antidepressant use peaked at 1.4 (95% CI, 1.34–1.46). When the reference group was changed to those who never used hormonal contraception, the RR estimates for users of combined oral contraceptives increased to 1.7 (95% CI, 1.66–1.71).

Conclusions and Relevance

Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents, was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a first diagnosis of depression, suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use.

### Association of use of oral contraceptives with depressive symptoms among adolescents and young women [^114LSkKk]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Oral contraceptives have been associated with an increased risk of subsequent clinical depression in adolescents. However, the association of oral contraceptive use with concurrent depressive symptoms remains unclear.

Objectives

To investigate the association between oral contraceptive use and depressive symptoms and to examine whether this association is affected by age and which specific symptoms are associated with oral contraceptive use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data from the third to sixth wave of the prospective cohort study Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), conducted from September 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016, among females aged 16 to 25 years who had filled out at least 1 and up to 4 assessments of oral contraceptive use, were used. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2017, to May 31, 2019.

Exposure

Oral contraceptive use at 16, 19, 22, and 25 years of age.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Depressive symptoms were assessed by the DSM-IV-oriented affective problems scale of the Youth (aged 16 years) and Adult Self-Report (aged 19, 22, and 25 years).

Results

Data from a total of 1010 girls (743–903 girls, depending on the wave) were analyzed (mean [SD] age at the first assessment of oral contraceptive use, 16.3 [0.7]; (mean [SD] age at the final assessment of oral contraceptive use, 25.6 [0.6] years). Oral contraceptive users particularly differed from nonusers at age 16 years, with nonusers having a higher mean (SD) socioeconomic status (0.17 [0.78] vs -0.15 [0.71]) and more often being virgins (424 of 533 [79.5%] vs 74 of 303 [24.4%]). Although all users combined (mean [SD] ages, 16.3 [0.7] to 25.6 [0.6] years) did not show higher depressive symptom scores compared with nonusers, adolescent users (mean [SD] age, 16.5 [0.7] years) reported higher depressive symptom scores compared with their nonusing counterparts (mean [SD] age, 16.1 [0.6] years) (mean [SD] score, 0.40 [0.30] vs 0.33 [0.30]), which persisted after adjustment for age, socioeconomic status and ethnicity (β coefficient for interaction with age, -0.021; 95% CI, -0.038 to -0.005; p = 0.0096). Adolescent contraceptive users particularly reported more crying (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.38–2.58; P < .001), hypersomnia (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.14–2.48; p = 0.006), and more eating problems (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.13–2.10; p = 0.009) than nonusers.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although oral contraceptive use showed no association with depressive symptoms when all age groups were combined, 16-year-old girls reported higher depressive symptom scores when using oral contraceptives. Monitoring depressive symptoms in adolescents who are using oral contraceptives is important, as the use of oral contraceptives may affect their quality of life and put them at risk for nonadherence.

### Epidemiology of women and depression [^113arE1J]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability among women in the world today. Depression is much more common among women than men, with female/male risk ratios roughly 2:1.

Aims

Recent epidemiological research is reviewed. Implications are suggested for needed future research.

Results

The higher prevalence of depression among women than men is due to higher risk of first onset, not to differential persistence or recurrence. Although the gender difference first emerges in puberty, other experiences related to changes in sex hormones (pregnancy, menopause, use of oral contraceptives, and use of hormone replacement therapy) do not significantly influence major depression. These observations suggest that the key to understanding the higher rates of depression among women than men lies in an investigation of the joint effects of biological vulnerabilities and environmental provoking experiences.

Conclusions

Advancing understanding of female depression will require future epidemiologic research to focus on first onsets and to follow incident cohorts of young people through the pubertal transition into young adulthood with fine-grained measures of both sex hormones and gender-related environmental experiences. Experimental interventions aimed at primary prevention by jointly manipulating putative biological and environmental risk factors will likely be needed to adjudicate between contending causal hypotheses regarding the separate and joint effects of interrelated risk factors.

### Hormonal contraceptives and mood: review of the literature and implications for future research [^115rAppx]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We examine recent studies that investigate the effects of hormonal contraception on mood in different populations of women, including women in the general population and women with diagnosed psychiatric and gynecologic disorders. We address the mechanisms of several types of hormonal contraceptives and assess how these may affect mood and gynecologic disorders.

Recent Findings

The effects of hormonal contraceptives seem to be most relevant in selected subsets of women, as they may promote improved mental health in particular psychiatric disorders such as PMDD. Currently, there is no consistent evidence for negative effects of most hormonal contraceptives in the general population. Even though some studies reveal that certain individuals appear susceptible to negative mood effects from some forms of hormonal contraceptives, more research is needed to better identify these susceptible individuals.

### Reproductive correlates of depressive symptoms among low-income minority women [^112uGsmh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms among women of reproductive age attending family planning clinics across southeast Texas in addition to demographic and reproductive characteristics associated with these symptoms.

Methods

A retrospective, self-reported, paper-and-pencil survey designed to assess health and risk behaviors was administered to 4726 low-income suburban women, aged 12 and 40 years, attending a family planning clinic in southeast Texas. The survey contained a background and demographic section in addition to six sections addressing health risk behaviors. Women also completed the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory to assess depressive symptoms.

Results

A total of 11.8% exhibited mild symptoms of depression, 14.0% had moderate symptoms, and 4.8% had severe symptoms. Women were at increased risk of moderate to severe symptoms of depression if they were Hispanic, had not graduated high school, were unemployed, or currently smoked cigarettes. Sexual or reproductive characteristics associated with moderate to severe symptoms included two or more lifetime sexual partners, having used hormonal contraception before age 13, not using any birth control at last intercourse, having had a sexually transmitted disease, not having had sexual intercourse in the last 3 months or having had it under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and having heard a family member worry about contracting a sexually transmitted disease or discuss use of alcohol or drugs before sex.

Conclusion

A large percentage of women experience moderate to severe depressive symptoms during their reproductive years. These symptoms are associated with numerous risk behaviors, including inconsistent use of birth control. Women's health care providers have the opportunity to provide a valuable service by screening for depressive symptoms.

### Co-occurrence of IBS and symptoms of anxiety or depression, among Norwegian twins, is influenced by both heredity and intrauterine growth [^117AnJwS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Co-occurrence of IBS with symptoms of anxiety or depression

Logistic regression models were used to analyse the co-occurrence of IBS with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Separate models were analysed for the association between IBS with each mental health outcome. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated adjusted for gender, age at the time of survey and twin relatedness (GEE), using SPSS 20 in the full twin sample. ORs in the co-twin control analyses were estimated using logistic regression with twin pairs as the unit of analysis.

To assess possible effect measure modification, interactions between anxiety and gender and between gender and depression were included in the model. Interaction terms which were significant for the associations IBS-anxiety or IBS-depression, were included in the models because risk of anxiety and depression could be different for the men and women belonging to the same age groups.

The associations between IBS and symptoms of anxiety or depression were first tested in the full twin sample (case–control design), and further analysed using only data from IBS-discordant MZ twins (co-twin control design). Adjusting for twin relatedness in the analyses in the full twin sample supports generalisation to the background population.

This methodology was described previously by Wojczynski et al. and is based on the assumption that resemblance between MZ twins, who are genetically identical, may also stem from shared early environmental factors important for the disorder of interest such as parental rearing, childhood trauma, same housing, pets, similar diet and same infectious diseases, etc.

Therefore, if an association is found in the case–control design study but not in the co-twin control design, this indicates that the comorbidity depends partly on genetic and/or family environment influences. However, if an association is found between IBS and the mental health measures in both the case–control and the co-twin control design, this would suggest a causal link between these health outcomes.

We expanded this test of the sources of comorbidity to explore the influence of restricted fetal growth by stratifying the co-twin control study into two birth weight groups, < 2500 g and ≥ 2500 g. If an association of IBS with the mental health outcomes is demonstrated only in the lowest birth weight group this would suggest that comorbidity arises from a causal biological mechanism due to restricted fetal growth.

### Sacred space: a qualitative interpretive meta-synthesis of women's experiences of supportive birthing environments [^116ECVdK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Of note is the influence of the built environment on healing. Given that thoughtfully designed healthcare facilities can influence the amount of privacy and control a patient perceives, the built environment plays an integral part in healing. Ample daylight, thermal comfort, color, and noise control all contribute to environmental healing within a hospital. Furthermore, patient health outcomes have been linked to the built environment of hospitals in multiple studies. More specific to birthing, women have indicated that perceived hominess and control in the environment relate to their birthing experience.

Control over the birthing environment, including comfort and perceived healing also have mental health impacts for birthing mothers, and the birth environment can have an impact on the mother's perception of the birth which in turn can influence maternal mental health outcomes. Given that approximately 1 in 7 mothers will experience postpartum depression (PPD) in the United States and 0.05%-60% of mothers will experience PPD globally, understanding the impact of birthing environment on maternal morbidities and mental health can create holistic approaches to birthing environment design.

Given the impacts of the birthing environment on maternal mental health, learning what is necessary to have a safe and sacred healing environment for mothers is an important endeavor and the purpose of this qualitative interpretive meta-synthesis (QIMS). A QIMS is a method that is specific to the social work field. It was created to review and analyze qualitative data to identify and synthesize themes surrounding different phenomena found in existing qualitative research. QIMS has previously been used to synthesize existing data regarding social justice concerns around minority police encounters and children's exposure to intimate partner violence. Concerning the topic of birthing and motherhood, one QIMS explored marginalized women's experiences of postpartum depression and another explored the experience of suicidality postpartum. To date, no QIMS has considered the experiences of the birth environment for birthing mothers and the impact on maternal mental health. A synthesis of the literature qualitatively evaluating women's perspectives on what is necessary to have a safe and sacred healing environment for mothers could bolster understanding of how hospitals could better support birthing mothers. As such, this study uses QIMS to answer the following research question: what is necessary to have a safe and sacred healing environment for mothers?

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^115NCydQ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the study include the use of national registers to obtain health data on a large population over 23 years. The use of registry data enabled us to obtain extensive health information on all women living in Denmark from when they were maximally 16 years of age without the risk of recall bias.

The study also has some limitations. First, our study is based on the assumption that HC use is associated with an increased risk of depression at the population level. However, at the individual level we were not able to verify whether a depressive episode developed because of HC use. In addition, we were not able to detect women who developed depression while using HC but were not treated with antidepressants or diagnosed with depression at a psychiatric inpatient or outpatient clinic; hence, the magnitude of the associated PPD risk should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, by using prescription of antidepressants or depression diagnosis to measure depressive episodes, we may have only captured the most severe cases. We acknowledge that our findings may not necessarily be generalizable to mild depressive episodes. Second, the use of antidepressant prescriptions as a proxy for depression can introduce misclassification bias, as antidepressants are used for other indications, such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In Denmark, however, 60% to 80% of prescribed antidepressants are used for treating depression. Third, using our defined time gap between treatments to define new onsets of depressive episodes might not always apply, as time gaps in treatment can be due to periods of noncompliance or a mismatch between the daily dose used and the defined daily dose. This potential misclassification of new-onset depressive episodes is reflected by the large reduction in the number of depressive episodes that was observed when a 90-day and a 180-day grace period were used instead of a 30-day grace period between treatments. However, the results from the sensitivity analyses with longer grace periods did not differ markedly from the main analysis. Fourth, women with HC-associated depression had more depressive episodes than women with non–HC-associated depression, perhaps because prior depression has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of subsequent recurrent depression triggered by HC use. However, if due to other reasons, then the higher number of depressive episodes may increase the likelihood that an episode will coincide with a new HC exposure by chance. This coincidence may induce a bias, as we expect that a history of recurrent depressive episodes compared with a single episode is associated with a higher risk of PPD. Nonetheless, this does not explain the observed association between HC-related depression and PPD, because when the exposure groups were defined based on the first depressive episode, the groups showed similar numbers of depressive episodes and the risk of PPD was, though less pronounced, still higher in the women with HC-associated depression compared with those with non–HC-associated depression. Fifth, a potential influence of unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded, such as differences in prescription patterns; however, by only including ever-users of HC and by comparing groups of women with a history of depression, the risk of confounding was minimized. Furthermore, no diagnosis code exists for PMDD in the 8th and 10th revisions of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, which could be a potential confounder. Such confounding would, however, still provide evidence for hormonal sensitivity being associated with an increased risk of depressive episodes across the reproductive life span in a subgroup of women.

### Sudden infant death syndrome and maternal depression [^116bC9rd]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether there is an association between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and perinatal depression.

Method

A case-control study design was used. Cases included women registered in a British primary care database with a live birth (1987–2000) and a subsequent SIDS death. Controls were women with a live birth born in the same year as the matched SIDS death, with infant survival for the first year of life.

Results

One hundred sixty-nine linked mother-infant cases of SIDS were matched with 662 mother-infant controls. The authors found that SIDS was independently associated with maternal depression in the year before birth (odds ratio [OR] = 4.93, 95% CI = 1.10 to 22.05), smoking (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.29 to 4.88), and male sex (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.64). There was weak evidence of an independent association of SIDS with depression in the 6 months after birth, before the index SIDS death (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 0.71 to 4.56).

Conclusion

This study provides further evidence for an association between SIDS and perinatal depression, particularly antenatal depression. Health care professionals should ensure that women with perinatal depression are appropriately treated and are provided with clear advice on infant care practices that may prevent SIDS.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^114B5KWk]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

This work contributes evidence to guide clinical PPD risk stratification and potentially improve PPD prediction models. Future work should evaluate risk models for PPD that include information on previous depressive episodes and subclinical depressive symptoms associated with HC use, which could potentially further inform a stratified approach to reproductive care. These risk models could be a useful tool in future precision medicine, as some women may benefit more from prophylactic strategies or treatments targeting the hormonal mechanisms of depression. Furthermore, future work should investigate whether our findings can be generalized to depressive episodes associated with other hormonal transitions, such as depression in perimenopause.

### Association of hormone therapy with depression during menopause in a cohort of Danish women [^116nL2Ay]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. Women are twice as likely as men to experience depression, suggesting that cyclic fluctuations in gonadal hormones — estrogen and progesterone — may contribute to this problem. During menopause, which typically occurs during the fifth decade of life, the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease. In this period, 60% to 70% of women experience menopausal symptoms as well as mood and cognitive disturbances, including symptoms of depression.

A few small randomized clinical trials (< 200 participants), have shown that transdermal or oral estradiol plus micronized progesterone might prevent the development of depressive symptoms in women during menopause. In contrast, 2 larger randomized clinical trials, have not supported a role of HT in the prevention of depression in postmenopausal women. Bothersome vulvovaginal symptoms may also influence quality of life, and a single experimental study has shown that vaginally administered estrogen may improve menopause-related quality of life, which in turn might lower the risk of depression. Cross-sectional studies have shown positive correlations between current use of hormone therapy (HT) and depressive symptoms in women around menopause, or negative correlations in women older than 60 years, in whom HT seems associated with lower rates of depressive symptoms. The results from 7 longitudinal studies, in which the association between use of HT and changes in depressive symptoms during the years around menopause have been explored, have been inconclusive. No prior study seems to have assessed the association of different types of HT (locally vs systemically administered) with subsequent risk of clinically verified depression in a prospective cohort design, taking temporality between the use of HT and development of depression into account and including censoring due to mortality or loss to follow-up.

Although HT is widely used to manage menopausal symptoms, evidence of an effect of HT on the risk of developing depression is lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the association of first-time use of specific types of HT with the risk of being diagnosed with depression among women followed up from 45 years of age.

### Anxiety, depression and relationship satisfaction in the pregnancy following stillbirth and after the birth of a live-born baby: a prospective study [^114TB1aC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Due to ethical limitations regarding linking the MoBa data to the MBRN, the study was approved only to use a limited number of reference women instead of using the entire birth cohort as a reference. However, the prevalence of anxiety and depression among the two reference groups was similar to a control group of women without epilepsy in a previous MoBa sub-study.

Although the dropout rate was comparable to other studies of perinatal depression, missing data in the follow-up period is a concern regarding the ability of this study to make conclusions about mental health outcomes from 6 months to 3 years postpartum. As anxiety and/or depression in the subsequent pregnancy after stillbirth was more prevalent among drop-outs, anxiety and depression at follow-up is probably underestimated.

Unfortunately, we do not have reliable data regarding the prevalence of anxiety and depression before the occurrence of stillbirth. It would also be interesting to compare these women to their nonpregnant counterparts in order to assess whether the prevalence of anxiety and depression are indeed associated with being pregnant.

The estimates for anxiety and depression in our study relied on self-reporting using short-form versions of validated screening tools. Even though short-form versions affect the measurement precision, it often remains sufficient for epidemiological purposes. Psychiatric symptoms may be more correctly reported in an anonymous questionnaire than in a clinical interview and questionnaire-based screening tools are often used to estimate the proportion at risk of having a mental disorder in a population. However, it is important to highlight that the screening tools are not suited to make formal diagnoses.

The sample size required that data on anxiety and depression were combined in the subgroup analyses on gestational age at stillbirth and inter-pregnancy interval, limiting the generalizability of these analyses.

As we did not want to increase the risk of type II errors, adjustments for multiple comparisons were not performed and findings with p -values ≥ 0.01 should be considered with some caution.

### Oral contraceptive use and risk of suicidal behavior among young women [^117JJkyS]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral contraceptive use has been previously associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior in some, but not all, samples. The use of large, representative, longitudinally-assessed samples may clarify the nature of this potential association.

Methods

We used Swedish national registries to identify women born between 1991 and 1995 (N = 216 702) and determine whether they retrieved prescriptions for oral contraceptives. We used Cox proportional hazards models to test the association between contraceptive use and first observed suicidal event (suicide attempt or death) from age 15 until the end of follow-up in 2014 (maximum age 22.4). We adjusted for covariates, including mental illness and parental history of suicide.

Results

In a crude model, use of combination or progestin-only oral contraceptives was positively associated with suicidal behavior, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.73–2.78 after 1 month of use, and 1.25–1.82 after 1 year of use. Accounting for sociodemographic, parental, and psychiatric variables attenuated these associations, and risks declined with increasing duration of use: adjusted HRs ranged from 1.56 to 2.13 1 month beyond the initiation of use, and from 1.19 to 1.48 1 year after initiation of use. HRs were higher among women who ceased use during the observation period.

Conclusions

Young women using oral contraceptives may be at increased risk of suicidal behavior, but risk declines with increased duration of use. Analysis of former users suggests that women susceptible to depression/anxiety are more likely to cease hormonal contraceptive use. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the observed association is attributable to a causal mechanism.

### The association between depression and contraceptive behaviors in a diverse sample of new prescription contraception users [^114S87ts]. Contraception (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Among women initiating new prescription contraception, we investigated the relationship between recent depression and a range of contraceptive behaviors.

Study Design

We used medical and pharmacy records of 52,325 women ages 19 to 29 who initiated prescription contraception (pills, patches or rings, injectables, and long-acting reversible contraceptives) in 2014–2016 at a large integrated healthcare system in Northern California. Women had continuous enrollment for a year before and after initiating, and no records of prescription contraceptive use in the year before initiating. Depression in the year prior to initiation was dichotomized into (1) no depression indicator (reference group) or (2) depression diagnosis or redeemed antidepressant. Multinomial logistic regression models examined the associations between depression and method type initiated, and contraceptive patterns, timing of discontinuation, inconsistent use, and switching methods over a year after initiating, adjusting for sociodemographics and testing for interactions between depression and having a recent birth or abortion.

Results

Women with recent depression were more likely to initiate methods other than the pill, and the association was stronger for patches or rings vs pills among those with a recent birth compared to those without. Among women initiating all methods and the pill, those with depression were more likely to discontinue their method, use it inconsistently, and switch from it than use it continuously for a year.

Conclusion

Women with recent depression were less likely to initiate the pill; and when the pill was initiated, those with depression were more likely to discontinue use, use it inconsistently, and switch from it.

Implications

Women with recent depression indicators should be followed closely to ensure they have the support they need to meet their reproductive goals. Those who wish to avoid pregnancy may benefit from methods that do not require daily use.

### Depression associated with hormonal contraceptive use as a risk indicator for postpartum depression [^1123TWKs]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This population-based cohort study of 188 648 first-time mothers provides evidence for the existence of a subgroup of women who are sensitive to hormonal transitions across their reproductive lives by showing an association between 2 types of depressive episodes with plausible hormonal contributions. The findings show that women with a history of depression associated with HC initiation had a higher risk of developing a depressive episode during pregnancy and after childbirth compared with women with a history of depression not associated with HC initiation.

Our findings contribute new evidence for an association between depressive episodes across hormonal transitions in the reproductive life span, supporting the existence of a hormone-sensitive subgroup of women. Our findings also align with previous findings suggesting an association between PPD and the retrospective reporting of experienced mood deterioration associated with HC use. Furthermore, the finding of a similar association with perinatal depression, ie, when both late pregnancy and postpartum onset of depressive episodes were included, suggests that both the pregnancy (ie, during high hormone levels) and postnatal (ie, during abrupt hormone decline) states contribute to the mechanisms by which depression emerges in women who may be sensitive to HC exposure. This outcome is in line with findings from a study that compared women with and without a history of PPD who underwent pharmacologic sex hormone manipulation; women with a history of PPD developed depressive symptoms both during the withdrawal phase of a pharmacologic hormone manipulation and the subsequent hormone add back.

The mechanistic understanding of how changes in the hormone milieu induce depressive symptoms in some women, but not in others, is far from well established. Some evidence points toward a genetic predisposition; for example, a large twin study of the psychiatric adverse effects of oral contraceptives found a distinct genetic basis for depressive symptoms associated vs not associated with HC use. Furthermore, a specific pattern of gene expression during pregnancy shows a high level of accuracy in predicting the development of PPD, and many of these genes are suggested to be involved in estrogen receptor signaling. Notably, this finding translates to a pharmacologic sex hormone manipulation study in healthy women where the pharmacologically induced change in a subset of these gene transcripts correlated with the emergence of depressive symptoms and changes in a marker of brain serotonin signaling. This finding indicates that serotonin-related brain mechanisms may be involved in the pathophysiology of hormone-triggered depressive symptoms. Furthermore, hormones, including HC, may affect the monoaminergic brain system, especially the serotonin system, which may play a key role in reproductive mood disorders.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116pTGc7]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy — clinical features and risk factors — Asthma control often changes during pregnancy; in approximately one-third of women asthma symptoms worsen, in one-third they improve, and in the remaining one-third they remain unchanged, and exacerbations are common in pregnancy, particularly in the second trimester. Exacerbations and poor symptom control are associated with worse outcomes for both the baby (pre-term delivery, low birth weight, increased perinatal mortality) and the mother (pre-eclampsia). Pregnant women appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of viral respiratory infections, including influenza. Risk factors for asthma exacerbations during pregnancy include severe asthma, multiparity, black ethnicity, depression and anxiety, current smoking, age > 35 years and obesity. If asthma is well controlled throughout pregnancy there is little or no increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal complications.

VA/DoD guideline — pregnant or breastfeeding individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD): For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment; in patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions (Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended). The evidence does not support recommending any specific evidence-based psychotherapy over another, and a meta-analysis found fair evidence that CBT and IPT are efficacious for treating postpartum depression; an additional RCT (n = 192) found group treatments were not significantly different from each other although they were not as effective as individual counseling, and an SR of 40 RCTs found fair evidence supporting CBT to treat and prevent depression for women during pregnancy and one year postpartum; there are no studies comparing psychotherapy to medication. Before the initiation of medication in women of childbearing age, providers should discuss whether the individual is sexually active and may be pregnant and the potential risks to the fetus, newborn, and mother of treated and untreated depression, and medication safety should be reviewed again with pregnant or breastfeeding patients who have been prescribed antidepressant medication.

### Oxytocin treatment at birth accelerates an epigenetic shift in the oxytocin receptor gene in the maternal brain [^115FiRSi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, nearly one in three births in the United States occurs after a labor induced with synthetic oxytocin. Despite how common this intervention is, little is known about its long-term consequences for maternal health. Existing work has identified a link between labor induction with synthetic oxytocin and increased risk for postpartum depression. For some women, the link between labor induction and postpartum depression risk may be altered functioning of the oxytocin system, including epigenetic modification of the oxytocin receptor gene, OXTR. Here we use the prairie vole to understand how pregnancy and birth impact epigenetic control of Oxtr, and how a labor induced with synthetic oxytocin may alter this control.

Methods

In an unmanipulated birth model, we measured Oxtr DNA methylation levels in the brain of virgin females, at term pregnancy, and 90 min postpartum using targeted pyrosequencing at four CpG sites in the Oxtr promotor region that are conserved from the human OXTR. We used RT-PCR to assess Oxtr gene expression levels in the brains of these same subjects. These same methods were next used in a model of labor induction with exogenous oxytocin. In both models, brain regions targeted for analysis included the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and medial preoptic area. These regions all use oxytocin system activity in regulating aspects of maternal behaviors. 2-way ANOVA, unpaired two-tailed t-tests, and Pearson's and Spearman's correlations were used for analyses.

Results

Results identify a regulatory switch in Oxtr from term pregnancy to early postpartum that is facilitated in part by oxytocin. Oxtr DNA methylation in virgins is negatively associated with Oxtr gene expression at all four conserved CpG sites in the nucleus accumbens. At term pregnancy, there is no relationship between these markers. Immediately postpartum, this relationship shifts back to a pre-pregnancy state. Administration of increasing doses of exogenous oxytocin, modeling labor induction, shifts the methylation-expression relationship toward a negative state in the nucleus accumbens, mimicking a postnatal brain but at a prenatal time point.

Conclusions

Findings show epigenetic control of Oxtr is dynamic across pregnancy and birth and is sensitive to exogenous oxytocin. Results indicate a need to better understand how common birth interventions impact Oxtr regulation in the maternal brain.

### Facial edema induced by isotretinoin use: a case and a review of the side effects of isotretinoin [^113w5cv1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) is a retinoid that is used to treat cystic acne, comedonal acne, and other diseases. For the treatment of acne, isotretinoin is dosed at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily for 5 months with a target total dose of approximately 120 mg/kg. Its most common side effects are mucocutaneous and ocular in nature (ie, cheilitis, ocular sicca, and decreased dark adaptation). It can also cause xerosis. Patients should be made aware of these side effects before taking isotretinoin and also that utilization of moisturizers and eye drops can help to mitigate such side effects. Sometimes, however, the dose of isotretinoin needs to be decreased to reduce the induction of side effects. Isotretinoin's most significant side effect is the induction of birth defects if a fetus is exposed to isotretinoin, which is pregnancy category X. Isotretinoin should be used with 2 forms of birth control by fecund women. It can rarely increase serum levels of triglycerides, which can, if very elevated, be related to the development of pancreatitis and xanthomas. Isotretinoin's well-documented but rarer side effects include intracranial hypertension. It can induce bony changes. A review of the literature demonstrates that isotretinoin is not linked to depression and suicide. Facial swelling has been linked to isotretinoin use in 3 previous case reports. We note herein the first case of facial swelling that occurred in an acne patient being treated with isotretinoin who at the time the swelling developed had no cysts, comedones, pustules, or evidence of bacterial infection. Possible reasons for the patient's facial swelling include some type of retinoid induced angioedema, exacerbation of inflammation by isotretinoin, and isotretinoin induced capillary leak syndrome.

### Systematic evidence and gap map of research linking food security and nutrition to mental health [^116vHKQe]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Study design

The majority of studies were observational (83%), with 46% cross-sectional and 37% longitudinal (Supplementary results 2). An additional 3% of studies were case-control design. There were 142 systematic reviews, of which 48 offered a meta-analysis. Experimental studies were not common — only 65 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were identified, along with 20 quasi-experimental studies (12 of which used Mendelian Randomization or genetic instrumental variable methods). Only ten qualitative studies were identified, and 4 mixed methods studies, despite explicitly including qualitative eligibility and coding parameters.

Cross-sectional studies followed a similar pattern to the EGM as a whole on mental health measures, although regarding FSN there were proportionally more studies on food scarcity and BMI and fewer on birth outcomes and IYCF. There were proportionally more longitudinal studies on birth outcomes (double across all but one mental health category) and more IYCF studies, and less on nutrient intake, nutrient biomarkers, and food scarcity, although mental health measures were similar proportionally to the full EGM.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on diets linked to depression or hybrid domains were most common (reviews without meta-analysis = 28; reviews with meta-analysis = 9, meta-analysis without review = 4), and nutrient intakes with depression or hybrid domains were the second most common (systematic reviews = 42; 15 of these with meta-analyses). Almost all (14/15) meta-analyses on nutrient intakes were about supplements. There were 18 reviews on BMI and depression or hybrid domains (seven of these with meta-analysis), while nine others focused on child growth measures. There were 22 systematic reviews on mental health related to birth outcomes, 17 of which were about mental health of mothers and birth outcomes of their offspring. Of all 69 meta-analyses, 59 of them focused on depression or hybrid domains.

### Gaps in the evidence for prevention and treatment of maternal anaemia: a review of systematic reviews [^113nAZhx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is the most common disorder of pregnancy with estimates of global prevalence reaching over 40%. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anaemia but other causes include nutritional deficiencies, bone marrow suppression and haemolytic or hereditary diseases. Blood loss during, as well as shortly after, birth may further contribute to postpartum anaemia.

The consequences of anaemia in pregnancy are potentially far-reaching, both for mother and infant. Several studies have identified anaemia as a risk factor for intrauterine fetal death, premature birth, low birth weight and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Some suggest a link between maternal anaemia in pregnancy and later developmental problems in children. Postpartum maternal anaemia may be associated with breathlessness, lethargy, infection, lactation failure and depression. Despite this, there is evidence of significant variation in practice and sub-optimal management of maternal anaemia, possibly due to a lack of consistent, detailed information derived from good quality evidence.

We carried out a review of systematic reviews to summarise the evidence base, to identify gaps in the evidence and to develop a research agenda for this important component of maternity care. The primary focus of this review was the range of interventions used to prevent and treat anaemia in pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. The project focussed on systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as the most robust form of study design to address the effectiveness of interventions. Given the expected clinical diversity in practices and populations, we choose not to include reviews that focussed on resource poor countries. This review of systematic reviews followed principles set out in the Cochrane Handbook.

### Perinatal depression and its impact on infant outcomes and maternal-nurse SMS communication in a cohort of Kenyan women [^111ieugZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Perinatal mood disorders, particularly depression, are associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes and are an urgent global public health concern. Perinatal depression is broadly defined as an episode of major depression or depressive symptoms that occur during pregnancy and/or within the first year following childbirth. A recent systematic review found that worldwide at least 17.2% of pregnant women and 13.1% of postpartum women suffer from perinatal depression. Prevalence is even higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where approximately 25.8% of women have antenatal depression and 19.7% experience postpartum depression. Risk factors for perinatal depression in LMICs include experiencing intimate partner violence, lower maternal educational opportunity, lower socioeconomic status, undesired pregnancy, single/unmarried status at time of pregnancy, and less social support. In studies conducted in Kenya, rates of maternal depression were higher in adolescents and women living with HIV (WLWH). Antenatal depression is the strongest risk factor for postpartum depression, with 54% of women with postpartum depression reporting depressive symptoms prior to childbirth.

Research has consistently demonstrated an association between perinatal depression and adverse health outcomes for mothers and infants. In particular, perinatal depression has been associated with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, prolonged labor, low birth weight, persistent perinatal depression, and even maternal mortality by suicide. Recent studies suggest that subclinical depressive symptoms, i.e. symptoms consistent with depression that do not meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), have a similar impact as clinical depression/MDD on maternal and infant health outcomes. Compared to infants of non-depressed mothers, infants of depressed mothers appear to have poorer physical and neurocognitive development and a higher likelihood of diarrheal, febrile, and other infectious illnesses. One study amongst mothers in Nairobi, Kenya demonstrated how postpartum depression conferred a higher risk of non-exclusive breastfeeding and underweight infants. While previous studies have characterized the consequences of perinatal depression for mothers and infants, there remains a paucity of literature from Sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly from Kenya, examining opportunities and interventions to mitigate maternal and infant morbidity and mortality associated with perinatal depression.

Scope of the problem — diagnostic features of major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder are defined: Major depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood (or irritability in children) and/or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) of listed symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years along with at least two specified symptoms; in children and adolescents, the duration is at least one year, and the mood can be irritable. The text further specifies that there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months and that symptoms are not better explained by another disorder, cause significant impairment in functioning or distress, and are not due to a different medical condition or a substance.

Results

Between July 2013 and March 2017, 160 women were screened, all of whom enrolled. Ultimately, 148 women contributed 3020 visits to this cohort analysis. Women were excluded from the analysis if they had experienced menopause (n = 6), had a hysterectomy (n = 1) or tubal ligation (n = 3), or were pregnant (n = 2). Participants' median number of follow-up visits was 19 (interquartile range [IQR] 11–28). The percent of expected visits attended per participant ranged from 42 to 115%, with a median of 94% (IQR 87–100%). Four participants (3%) had < 50% of expected visits; 11 (7%) had between 50 and 74% of expected visits; and 133 (90%) had between 75 and 115% of expected visits. The median age of women enrolled in the cohort was 32 years (IQR range 29–37) (Table 1). Most women had eight or more years of education (n = 134, 90%). Seventy-seven percent (n = 113) of women were using condoms alone for contraception at enrollment. During the enrollment visit, mild or more severe depressive symptoms were reported by 16% (n = 23) of women and 27% (n = 40) used alcohol. Controlling behavior by the partner was experienced by 42% (n = 61) of women and 30% (n = 44) had experienced intimate partner violence in the past year.

### Association of hormonal contraception with suicide attempts and suicides [^115b6Bcc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the relative risk of suicide attempt and suicide in users of hormonal contraception.

Method

The authors assessed associations between hormonal contraceptive use and suicide attempt and suicide in a nationwide prospective cohort study of all women in Denmark who had no psychiatric diagnoses, antidepressant use, or hormonal contraceptive use before age 15 and who turned 15 during the study period, which extended from 1996 through 2013. Nationwide registers provided individually updated information about use of hormonal contraception, suicide attempt, suicide, and potential confounding variables. Psychiatric diagnoses or antidepressant use during the study period were considered potential mediators between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of suicide attempt. Adjusted hazard ratios for suicide attempt and suicide were estimated for users of hormonal contraception as compared with those who never used hormonal contraception.

Results

Among nearly half a million women followed on average for 8.3 years (3.9 million person-years) with a mean age of 21 years, 6,999 first suicide attempts and 71 suicides were identified. Compared with women who never used hormonal contraceptives, the relative risk among current and recent users was 1.97 (95% CI = 1.85–2.10) for suicide attempt and 3.08 (95% CI = 1.34–7.08) for suicide. Risk estimates for suicide attempt were 1.91 (95% CI = 1.79–2.03) for oral combined products, 2.29 (95% CI = 1.77–2.95) for oral progestin-only products, 2.58 (95% CI = 2.06–3.22) for vaginal ring, and 3.28 (95% CI = 2.08–5.16) for patch. The association between hormonal contraceptive use and a first suicide attempt peaked after 2 months of use.

Conclusions

Use of hormonal contraception was positively associated with subsequent suicide attempt and suicide. Adolescent women experienced the highest relative risk.

### Iranian women's perception on the determinants of birth experience: a qualitative study [^113WoS6x]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study in an Iranian context that employs a woman-centred approach towards women's birth experiences. The main themes extracted from women's birth experiences are: "Internal control", "External control", and "Support". Possessing internal control, having well-balanced external control with adequate care and support linked with positive experiences whereas, the loss of internal control, imbalanced external control without receiving respectful care and support were associated with negative birth experiences. Women's sense of safety, trust and power formed their feelings towards "Internal control".

The findings of other studies, emphasizes the importance of women's sense of internal control influencing their satisfaction with childbirth. Women's attitude towards normal birth and the mother-baby attachment were the highlights that made women feel satisfied and positive about their birth experience. Women reported that the experience of skin-to-skin contact lessened their stress and improved their satisfaction. Skin-to skin contact can help women identify and become familiar with their babies' reactions, reduce the baby's crying time, facilitate baby's sleeping, improve breastfeeding initiation which can lead to a positive feeling for the mothers.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112JvcES]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Background — depressive disorder definitions across ages — Major depression is the second leading cause of disability as of 2013, and major depressive disorder is characterized by depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest for at least 2 weeks and is accompanied by at least three (or a total of at least five) symptoms present most days. Persistent depressive disorder (DSM-5) is characterized by a depressed mood most of the time for at least 2 years with at least two additional symptoms; in children and adolescents the duration is at least 1 year, and there cannot be a gap in these symptoms for more than 2 months. For presentations that do not meet full criteria, DSM-5 Other Specified Depressive Disorder includes recurrent episodes of depressed mood with at least four other symptoms for 2–13 days (recurrent brief depression) and a depressive episode for 4–13 days (short-duration depressive episode).

### Mental health in early pregnancy is associated with pregnancy outcome in women with pregestational diabetes [^112xsh7G]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To explore the role of early pregnancy health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression and locus of control for pregnancy outcome in women with pregestational diabetes.

Methods

This was a cohort study of 148 pregnant women with pregestational diabetes (118 with Type 1 diabetes and 30 with Type 2 diabetes), who completed three internationally validated questionnaires: the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control survey at 8 weeks. Selected pregnancy outcomes were preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) and large for gestational age infants (birth weight > 90(th) percentile). Differences between groups in the questionnaires were analysed using an unpaired t-test.

Results

Women with preterm deliveries (n = 28) had lower (i.e. worse) mean (sd) quality-of-life scores for the two 36-item Short-Form Health Survey scales, Role-Emotional [58.3 (38.1) vs. 82.9 (31.3); P = 0.0005] and Mental Health [67.7 (20.4) vs. 75.2 (15.8), P = 0.04], and a lower score for the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey scale Mental Component Summary (42.8 (13.1) vs. 48.8 (9.7), P = 0.03) in early pregnancy, compared with women with term deliveries. Depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression score ≥ 8) were more frequent in women with preterm vs. term deliveries (seven (25%) vs. six women (5%); P = 0.003), while levels of anxiety and locus of control were similar in these two groups. No difference in early pregnancy scores for health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression and locus of control were seen in women delivering large or appropriate for gestational age infants.

Conclusions

Poor mental quality of life and the presence of depressive symptoms in early pregnancy were associated with preterm delivery in women with pregestational diabetes.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are indicated for the treatment of:

- Acute depressive episodes in Bipolar I Disorder.
- Treatment resistant depression. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Patients with Major Depressive Disorder, both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide.

25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥ 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational stud.

### QUETIAPINE tablet, film coated… [^116vneZn]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

Quetiapine is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8-week monotherapy trials in adult patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. Quetiapine is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two maintenance trials in adults. The effectiveness of quetiapine as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials.
1. 3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.

However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric.

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine fumarate, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.
