## Question

Pregnant woman in third trimester presents with worsening abdominal pain
The woman complained of severe nausea and poor sleep. She had a low mood that she attributed to her recent break up with her boyfriend following treatment for genital herpes. She was icteric and had a palpable, tender liver and mild splenomegaly with dilated abdominal and leg veins and pitting ankle edema. Her BP was 100/70. Her past medical history was significant for migraine and poor oral health for which she had been using betadine gargles.

Upon admission, she was started on intravenous fluids and investigated. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed a viable fetus compatible with the dates. A urine full report showed occasional white cells but no proteins.

Lab results:
Hb: 12 g/dl
WBC: 10,000/mm³ (N-70%, L-30%)
Plt: 200K
Cr: 80 umoll
AST: 80 U
ALT: 155 UM
ALP: 400 U
While in labor, she developed sudden onset shortness of breath with desaturation on pulse oximetry. ECGs were normal, but she had a positive troponin. Portable echocardiography showed right ventricular strain. A tentative diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism was made and she was managed expectantly in the ICU. A blood picture was done and was reported as normal.

All her symptoms gradually improved over the ensuing week, and except for mild ankle swelling, she was feeling quite well. The baby was introduced to the breast and her mood had also improved drastically. She was about to be discharged with only oral cloxacillin for cannulae site thrombophlebitic ulcers, almost 3 weeks from the date she got admitted.

However, the resident physician objected to her discharge and planned for further workup. The same afternoon, she developed a severe headache with difficulty in walking. The on-call registrar noticed papilledema.

BP: 160/100
Urine: negative for proteins
CT: bilateral cortical hemorrhages with cerebral edema

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a pregnant patient in the third trimester who presented with abdominal pain, icterus, hepatosplenomegaly, and later developed severe headache with papilledema and bilateral cortical hemorrhages, seeking a prioritized differential diagnosis and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial hepatic and obstetric differentials in late pregnancy. Then, I should verify the significance of the peripartum cardiopulmonary event and whether it truly fits amniotic fluid embolism. Next, I will examine the neurologic catastrophe and its most likely etiologies in this context. After that, I need to check for unifying diagnoses and consider what tests would confirm them. Finally, I will outline immediate management priorities and a follow-up plan, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the initial presentation and its implications. Third-trimester abdominal pain with icterus, tender hepatomegaly, and mild splenomegaly, plus dilated abdominal and leg veins with pitting edema, points toward hepatic outflow obstruction or severe parenchymal liver disease in pregnancy, where Budd-Chiari syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are high on the list, and HELLP syndrome remains possible despite initially normal platelets and blood pressure, so I should not jump to conclusions and must correlate with labs and imaging [^notfound] [^113emhDb] [^113e34Zs].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory pattern. AST 80 U/L and ALT 155 U/L represent a hepatocellular pattern, and ALP 400 U/L is consistent with cholestasis of pregnancy, but the degree of ALT elevation is modest for HELLP and more compatible with AFLP or BCS; importantly, bilirubin and coagulation parameters are not provided, so I cannot exclude HELLP or AFLP yet, and I should double-check for hemolysis, LDH, ammonia, glucose, and a coagulation profile to refine the differential [^113emhDb] [^113e34Zs].

> I will now examine Budd-Chiari syndrome more closely. Pregnancy shifts the hemostatic balance toward hypercoagulability and can unmask underlying thrombophilia, and BCS classically presents with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, and features of portal hypertension; Doppler ultrasound is usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis, so I should confirm whether a Doppler study of the hepatic veins was performed and, if not, order it urgently [^114M4cJu] [^1124HTfE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about AFLP. AFLP typically presents late in the third trimester with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and can progress to jaundice, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy; the Swansea criteria can help, but I need bilirubin, INR, glucose, ammonia, and uric acid to apply them, and I should also remember that delivery is the definitive therapy once AFLP is suspected, so I need to check whether these were obtained and whether delivery was considered at the time of liver dysfunction [^113emhDb] [^111mKGhB].

> Next, I should review the peripartum cardiopulmonary event. Sudden dyspnea with desaturation, positive troponin, and right ventricular strain on echo could fit amniotic fluid embolism, but I need to ensure we also consider pulmonary embolism, which is more common and carries a different management pathway; given pregnancy-related hypercoagulability and the lack of clear amniotic debris or DIC in the description, PE remains a strong alternative and should be actively excluded with appropriate imaging and anticoagulation if suspected [^114M4cJu].

> Let me consider the neurologic deterioration now. Severe headache with papilledema and bilateral cortical hemorrhages in the immediate postpartum period is a red flag for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; all are enriched in pregnancy and the puerperium, and I should confirm the diagnosis rapidly because management diverges substantially, particularly for CVST where anticoagulation is essential [^116W1acR] [^116Em2Ge].

> I should confirm the most likely diagnosis for the hemorrhagic stroke. Given the absence of proteinuria and the presence of severe hypertension with papilledema and cortical hemorrhages, PRES is highly plausible, but I need to ensure we do not miss CVST, which can also present with headache, seizures, and hemorrhagic infarction; MRI with venography is the test of choice to distinguish these entities and should be obtained emergently, and I should also check for antiphospholipid antibodies if CVST is suspected [^116W1acR] [^116Em2Ge].

> But wait, what if there is a unifying diagnosis. Budd-Chiari syndrome could explain the hepatic findings, the hypercoagulable state, and even contribute to a PRES-like picture via systemic endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, so I should double-check for a thrombophilia workup once the patient is stabilized, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, antithrombin III, protein C and S, and antiphospholipid testing, as results would change long-term management and recurrence risk [^114M4cJu].

> I need to ensure immediate management is prioritized. For suspected PRES, urgent blood pressure control with IV labetalol or nicardipine and delivery if still postpartum are indicated, and for CVST, therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is standard even in the setting of hemorrhage unless there is a contraindication; neurosurgical consultation is warranted for mass effect or deteriorating consciousness, and I should confirm that these steps are initiated without delay [^116W1acR] [^116Em2Ge].

> Next, I should review the hepatic piece. If Budd-Chiari syndrome is confirmed, management includes anticoagulation, evaluation for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt if there is ongoing hepatic congestion or failure, and long-term thrombophilia management; if AFLP is ultimately diagnosed, delivery would have been the cornerstone, and I should verify whether that occurred and whether supportive care addressed coagulopathy and hypoglycemia appropriately [^114M4cJu] [^113emhDb].

> Let me reconsider the initial dismissal of HELLP. Although platelets were normal and blood pressure was initially low, HELLP can evolve and occasionally present with atypical features; given the hepatocellular injury and third-trimester context, I should double-check serial platelets, LDH, and blood pressure trends, and if HELLP is suspected, delivery is indicated regardless of gestational age when severe features are present [^113e34Zs] [^115iadcx].

> Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic workup that must be completed before discharge. MRI brain with venography to distinguish PRES from CVST, a comprehensive thrombophilia panel, and reassessment of liver function with coagulation studies are essential; I also need to ensure blood pressure control is optimized and that neurology, hepatology, and maternal-fetal medicine follow-up are arranged, as recurrence risk and long-term anticoagulation decisions hinge on these results [^116W1acR] [^116Em2Ge] [^114M4cJu].

The most likely diagnosis is **posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)** [^116W1acR] due to severe hypertension and pregnancy-related endothelial dysfunction, with **cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)** as a close alternative given the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and postpartum [^116Em2Ge]. Both can present with severe headache, papilledema, and cortical hemorrhages, and both require urgent MRI/MRV to distinguish them and guide therapy [^116Em2Ge]. Immediate management includes **strict blood pressure control** [^116W1acR], seizure prophylaxis, and **urgent neurology and maternal-fetal medicine consultation**; if CVST is confirmed, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation even in the setting of hemorrhage [^116Em2Ge].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale** | **Supporting features** | **Refuting features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) | - Severe hypertension <br/> - Pregnancy-related endothelial dysfunction <br/> - Cortical hemorrhages and edema are classic | - Severe headache <br/> - Papilledema <br/> - Cortical hemorrhages <br/> - Hypertension | - Proteinuria absent <br/> - No clear eclampsia syndrome |
| Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) | - Hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and postpartum <br/> - Cortical hemorrhages from venous congestion | - Severe headache <br/> - Papilledema <br/> - Cortical hemorrhages | - No clear sinus thrombosis on CT <br/> - Needs MRI/MRV for confirmation |

## Most likely diagnosis: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

PRES is a **neurologic syndrome** characterized by headache, visual disturbances, seizures, and cortical/subcortical edema, often with hemorrhage, linked to severe hypertension and endothelial dysfunction [^116W1acR]. Pregnancy-related PRES is well described and can occur without proteinuria or full eclampsia, making it a strong fit here [^116W1acR].

---

## Alternative diagnosis: cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST)

CVST is a **significant cause of stroke in pregnancy and postpartum**, driven by hypercoagulability; it can present with severe headache, papilledema, seizures, and cortical hemorrhages from venous congestion [^116Em2Ge]. CT is insensitive for CVST, so MRI/MRV is required to confirm or exclude it [^116Em2Ge].

---

## Immediate management

- **Urgent MRI/MRV**: Differentiate PRES from CVST and guide therapy [^116Em2Ge].
- **Strict blood pressure control**: Target < 160/100 mmHg with IV labetalol or nicardipine; avoid nitroprusside and magnesium monotherapy [^116W1acR].
- **Seizure prophylaxis**: Magnesium sulfate if eclampsia is suspected; levetiracetam otherwise.
- **Neurology and maternal-fetal medicine consultation**: Coordinate care and delivery planning [^116W1acR].
- **Therapeutic anticoagulation**: If CVST is confirmed, start LMWH even with hemorrhage unless contraindicated [^116Em2Ge].

---

## Prognosis

PRES is usually **reversible with blood pressure control** and supportive care, though seizures and visual deficits may persist [^116W1acR]. CVST outcomes depend on rapid anticoagulation and control of seizures; maternal mortality is ~1% with modern care, but neurologic morbidity can occur [^116Em2Ge].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **PRES**, with **CVST** as the key alternative. Immediate MRI/MRV, strict blood pressure control, seizure prophylaxis, and specialist input are essential; start anticoagulation if CVST is confirmed [^116Em2Ge].

Discussion

A useful diagnosis is defined by patient prognosis

Diagnosis classifies sick people into groups defined by disease and pathology. The frameworks to explain illness have expanded from pathoanatomical to physiological-biochemical-psychological and, more recently, genetic-molecular models, but the basic concept of diagnosis has not changed. Diagnosis provides clinicians with the means to organise and interpret a range of information provided by patient symptoms, signs, tests, and investigations as the basis for decision-making.

The importance of diagnosis seems most obvious when there is an available treatment which works by directly targeting a specific disease.

Example: The primary care physician faced with the common clinical problem of a child with fever is concerned not to miss rare but serious diagnoses needing specific treatments. A correct diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis will dictate life-saving, targeted antibiotic treatment. Also, correctly classifying the majority of children with fever who have self-limiting infections will underpin appropriate reassurance, and avoid antimicrobial therapy and potentially harmful specialist investigations.

Diagnosis and disease mechanisms inform the decisions in this example, yet patient prognosis is the underlying concern. The concern is firstly to correctly identify the few children who, unless they receive urgent treatment targeted at a specific disease, have a high likelihood of poor outcome (disease diagnosis being a highly effective way to improve prognosis in these individuals) and, secondly, to allow the many children with fever who have a high likelihood of a good outcome to recover without disease-targeted interventions.

The science of diagnosis recognises the uncertainty clinicians face as they attempt to classify people with and without disease. In primary care, this drives the search for optimal combinations of symptoms and signs to identify and select patients with high probability of the target condition to undergo further tests. The usefulness of this strategy is judged by prognosis – are outcomes improved in those selected for testing, and is it safe to avoid tests in persons with low disease probability because their prognosis would not be altered by the test?

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^1126vuui]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — diagnostic testing and laboratory evaluation are guided by history and examination; for patients with CU who present with otherwise unremarkable history and physical examination findings, skin or in vitro testing for IgE to inhalants or foods and/or extensive laboratory testing are not recommended. Targeted laboratory testing based on history or physical examination findings is appropriate, and limited laboratory testing can be obtained, with limited laboratory testing including a CBC with differential, sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein, liver enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement. After a thorough history and physical examination, no diagnostic testing might be necessary for some patients with CU; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, and extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted. Routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings, screening for thyroid disease is of low yield in patients without specific thyroid-related symptoms or a history of thyroid disease, and current evidence does not support routine performance of ASSTs or autologous plasma skin tests in patients with CU.

### Molecular diagnostic outcomes from 700 cases: what can we learn from a retrospective analysis of clinical exome sequencing? [^116DimB3]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical exome sequencing (CES) is efficient and comprehensive, allowing for analysis of most protein coding regions, resulting in the diagnosis of 25% of patients referred for testing and prompting the discovery of novel disease genes. Exome sequencing is a common molecular diagnostic test for individuals with rare genetic disorders or individuals for whom traditional diagnostic technologies were uninformative. This includes pediatric patients with clinical indications such as epilepsy, brain malformations, congenital heart disease, immunologic disorders, autism, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. CES performed as a trio (proband and parents) has the benefit of identifying de novo and compound heterozygous variants, while allowing for the deprioritization of rare variants inherited from an unaffected parent.CES can also identify more than one genetic condition per patient, even when the presence of multiple conditions was not obvious based on the clinical presentation. This may include multiple pathogenic variants contributing to a patient's phenotype and secondary actionable findings. Although the diagnostic yield of CES ranges from 25% to 30%, certain clinical indications are more likely to result in a diagnosis. Moreover, facilitating timely and accurate diagnosis requires the CES laboratory to periodically perform updates and additions to existing sequencing and enrichment platforms and informatics pipelines, and to utilize new data to periodically reanalyze previously tested patients with uninformative results. An accurate diagnosis benefits patients and their families by optimizing clinical management, predicting recurrence risks, and providing prognosis, all while ending the invasive, time-consuming, and costly diagnostic odyssey.

Herein, we provide a retrospective study of 700 pediatric patients referred to our laboratory for CES, with a variety of phenotypes and molecular diagnostic outcomes. We present a review of clinical indications prompting the test, along with their associated diagnostic rates, and discuss improvements initiated to refine and optimize the CES test. Our results demonstrate the utility of CES and reanalysis in elucidating the underlying basis of genetic disorders, while providing an assessment of CES test considerations: sequencing, informatics, troubleshooting, interpretation, and reporting.

### Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia complicated by pulmonary embolism following glucocorticoid therapy: a case report [^113AcCuj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

COP is a rare lung disease that often mimics community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in its clinical presentation. This similarity creates significant diagnostic challenges, as both conditions can present with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, chest pain, and, in severe cases, dyspnea and respiratory distress. Imaging findings in COP may overlap with those of CAP, typically showing pulmonary nodules, infiltrates, consolidations, and pleural-based band shadows. However, the patchy distribution of COP within the lungs can complicate diagnosis, especially when based solely on bronchoscopic biopsy specimens. Although surgical lung biopsy is considered definitive, the procedure is highly invasive and not routinely performed in clinical practice. Therefore, the diagnosis of COP is typically established through a combination of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, imaging characteristics, empirical glucocorticoid therapy, and follow-up assessments. In this case, the patient initially presented with symptoms typical of CAP, including increased CRP levels and computed tomography (CT) findings suggestive of inflammatory changes. However, the clinical presentation and pleural fluid analysis were more consistent with COP. The lymphocyte-predominant pleural effusion, in the absence of infectious pathogens, indicated an immune-mediated inflammatory response rather than a bacterial infection. This is consistent with the pathogenesis of COP, which involves lymphocytic infiltration and granulation tissue formation leading to alveolar OP. The rapid resolution of both pulmonary opacities and pleural effusion following glucocorticoid therapy (within 14 days) strongly supported a non-infectious etiology.

This case underscores the value of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach, coupled with dynamic imaging follow-up and changes in laboratory markers, in diagnosing COP after ruling out infectious causes. Notably, the patient's rapid response to glucocorticoid therapy, with significant improvement in symptoms and inflammatory markers within 14 days, is consistent with previous reports and further supports the diagnosis of COP. Despite initial empirical anti-infective therapy, the patient's symptoms did not improve, and her lung lesions progressed. Given the high degree of similarity between previously reported cases of COP and our patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, glucocorticoid therapy was initiated. The patient's symptoms significantly improved; however, she later developed PE, a complication that required close attention. During the glucocorticoid tapering phase, significant increases in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels indicated an underlying hypercoagulable state. These changes, coupled with the clinical presentation of PE, highlight the importance of monitoring coagulation markers in patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy.

Germline testing — diagnostic utility and approach — Germline (constitutional) testing encompasses a variety of tests that analyze an individual's germline DNA sequence and may be prompted for diagnostic testing; the purpose of diagnostic testing is to identify an underlying genetic condition that explains a patient's clinical presentation, and genetic testing is ordered by a clinician to confirm or rule out such disorders, aiding in accurate diagnosis and management; each testing option carries its own risks, as targeted tests may have a higher likelihood of false negatives whereas broader genomic tests may uncover secondary findings, so the choice of testing is made in consultation with the clinician with the patient's preference playing a central role; a common, theoretically cost-effective approach begins with a targeted gene panel based on the clinician's differential diagnosis, and if this test is inconclusive or negative, more expansive testing may be pursued to identify clinically significant genomic alterations.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) is an uncommon disease in which patients often present with nonspecific initial symptoms that may affect many organ systems, with considerable morbidity and mortality. In the diagnosis of CS, the use of appropriate laboratory tests for the initial documentation of hypercortisolism as well as for distinguishing between adrenocorticotropic hormone dependent and independent forms are important for identifying the source and localizing the lesion. These tests are also essential for guiding the clinician to the correct surgical procedure to potentially cure the patient.

### Executive summary: evaluation and management of children and adolescents with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part I: common clinical challenges of patients with mental health and / or behavioral emergencies [^111DkGEV]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric psychiatric presentations — emergency department (ED) medical clearance is described as excluding potential medical conditions causing or exacerbating psychiatric symptoms and evaluating for diseases or injuries requiring acute ED interventions. Some favor the term "medically stable", emphasizing that the goal is to rule out acute medical conditions rather than exclude all possible etiologies. For patients with unexplained vital sign abnormalities, a concerning history or examination, or new/acute neurologic or psychiatric changes, careful evaluation for potential underlying medical conditions may be important. Regarding laboratory testing, literature casts doubt on the utility of routinely obtaining laboratory or radiologic tests and supports the American College of Emergency Physicians position for focused assessments and judicious testing. Mental health consultants often request pregnancy (females), toxicology, and sexually transmitted infection testing for adolescent patients, and whether to obtain these tests can usually be decided via direct conversation between ED and mental health clinicians.

NCCN Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia — diagnostic approach and secondary causes of eosinophilia: Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause of HE requires integrating histopathologic, clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria, and it is important to rule out HER caused by reactive eosinophilia from non‑neoplastic conditions or neoplasms. Allergic disorders are the most common cause of HER, occurring in about 80% of patients, with parasitic infections the second most common cause; Strongyloidiasis due to Strongyloides stercoralis exposure is generally the most common parasitic infection, and if exposure is suspected, initiation of appropriate treatment is necessary to prevent superinfection and consultation with an infectious agent specialist is recommended. HE may be present with immunodeficiency syndromes associated with abnormal immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and pulmonary eosinophilic diseases and may also be associated with dermatologic conditions. HER is frequently observed in patients with solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies, with HE in solid tumors generally limited to advanced-stage disease and, among lymphoid malignancies, more frequent in T-cell lymphomas.

Discussion

Main Findings

This study provides 4 main findings regarding differences between patients in whom the clinical presentation included symptoms that are not typically considered to be caused by POTS compared with patients with a typical POTS presentation. First, the frequency with which MCA laboratory abnormalities were detected in the former population was relatively high. While solitary laboratory abnormalities cannot provide a definitive MCA diagnosis, the possibility of a coexisting MCA disorder merits consideration given its potential impact on treatment strategy. Second, patients with abnormal laboratory findings manifested a more diverse symptom landscape, particularly including allergy complaints and gastrointestinal issues (most often gastroparesis), and to a lesser extent skin rash/flushing, than did those individuals who had normal laboratory findings (Table 3). Third, while elevated plasma tryptase level is a valuable biochemical marker for mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, and may be useful in confirming MCA as suggested in Consensus‐1, abnormal tryptase levels were uncommon (9%) among the laboratory findings in our study. Finally, elevated prostaglandins in conjunction with an abnormally elevated histamine marker (ie, plasma histamine or urine methyl‐histamine) was the most frequent diagnostic combination supporting a possible MCA diagnosis in our patients.

Laboratory Recognition of MCA and Its Limitations

Many conditions, including MCA, have been implicated in producing symptoms suggestive of POTS. MCA is particularly important in this regard because its presence markedly alters therapeutic strategy. Specifically, patients with MCA may benefit from histamine receptor (H1 and H2) blockers used in conjunction with mast cell stabilizer agents and possibly vitamin D. These agents are not usually part of a typical POTS treatment regimen.

Mast cells are estimated to contain several hundred chemical mediators that are either stored in situ or manufactured de novo as requirement demands. While many such chemicals may be released by other cells, particularly basophils, the mast cell appears to be the most important.

Chemical mediators released from mast cells may affect multiple systems resulting in diverse symptoms (eg, allergic reactions, cutaneous disturbances, and gastrointestinal complaints) that may wax and wane in severity over time. The result is a potentially very heterogeneous clinical picture, with only some affected individuals having symptoms suggesting POTS. It is in the latter cases that the presence of complaints beyond the typical expected with POTS (ie, palpitations, "lightheadedness", and "brain fog") should raise the possibility of an underlying or coexisting MCA disorder.

VA/DoD low back pain — indications for imaging and laboratory testing: For patients with low back pain (LBP), "we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, history) are present" and this is "(Strong for | Reviewed, Amended)". Evidence notes that "most patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy will improve with noninvasive management within four weeks", and that imaging "did not significantly improve outcomes in patients for whom there was no pretest concern for serious underlying conditions"; red flags analyzed "included suspicion or history of cancer, IV drug use, indwelling vascular catheter, and other infection sites". The Work Group observed that "the laboratory and imaging tests in question posed relatively little harm; however, there is enormous harm caused by failure to diagnose a serious pathology", and despite "very low quality evidence", "the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low", yet it "concluded this recommendation continued to merit a Strong for rating considering the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition that is causing LBP".

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115CrLAR]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Laboratory testing in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders — In patients with bradycardia, laboratory tests (eg, thyroid function tests, Lyme titer, potassium, pH) based on clinical suspicion for a potential underlying cause are reasonable (COR IIa, LOE C-LD). Bradycardia attributable to sinus node dysfunction (SND) or atrioventricular block may be secondary to conditions such as hypothyroidism, rheumatologic disorders, and infectious disorders, and there has been no study evaluating the diagnostic yield and benefits of routine comprehensive laboratory testing in patients presenting with bradycardia or conduction tissue abnormalities.

### Rare cause of abdominal pain and fever in a pregnant woman [^113YkAZh]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A pregnant woman (third trimester) presented with intense abdominal pain, nausea and myalgia. The patient was obese (body mass index 38) and was being treated for high blood pressure, hyperuricemia and hypothyroidism. She had chronic renal deficiency related to focal segmental glomerular sclerosis requiring dialysis. The physical examination at admission revealed a fever of 39°C and an acute abdomen with abdominal guarding in the right upper quadrant without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. There were no clinical signs of pre-eclampsia. Fetal ultrasound and a Doppler of the umbilical vessels were normal. Laboratory tests showed normal liver and liver function (total protein 95%, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin normal). The white cell count was 10×10⁹/l (90% neutrophils), with a normal platelet count. Blood, urine and vaginal cultures were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed isolated thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholelithiasis. Empirical antibiotic treatment was begun with intravenous amoxicillin. Six days later, the patient's condition had worsened with increased abdominal pain, persistent fever and liver test abnormalities (AST-ALT 6N). However, bilirubin, hepatic synthesis tests, as well as leucocyte and platelet counts were still normal. A caesarean section followed by coelioscopy was decided. Coelioscopy revealed a liver with numerous necrotic spots (see figure 1).gutjnl;66/11/1911/GUTJNL2016313097F1F1GUTJNL2016313097F1Figure 1Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a liver surface covered with numerous white necrotic spots.

### Evaluation for bleeding disorders in suspected child abuse [^116ydh5C]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Guidance for pediatricians — In children who have bruising or bleeding that is suspicious for abuse: complete medical, trauma, and family histories, screening for unusual or restrictive diets, and a thorough physical examination are critical tools, but family and patient medical history alone have not been shown to effectively predict the presence of a bleeding disorder (Recommendation 1). In each case, careful consideration of the possibility of a medical condition causing the bleeding/bruising is essential, and specific elements of the history, developmental status of the child, and characteristics of the bleeding/bruising can be used to determine the need for a laboratory evaluation for bleeding disorders (Recommendations 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4). If evaluation indicates a need for laboratory testing for bleeding disorders, initial testing is focused on condition prevalence and potential to cause the specific findings; tests should be chosen on the basis of their ability to detect specific bleeding disorders that may cause the findings, and in some cases testing may be tailored on the basis of the history, findings, and patient characteristics (Recommendations 5, 6, 8, 9, and 9a). Consultation with child abuse pediatricians and/or pediatric hematologists should be strongly considered in children with bruising/bleeding concerning for abuse, including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and particularly in cases of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) (Recommendation 7). Laboratory testing suggesting or indicating the presence of a bleeding disorder does not eliminate abuse from consideration, and in children with bruising and laboratory testing suggestive of a bleeding disorder, a follow-up evaluation after a change in home setting can provide valuable information regarding the likelihood of a bleeding disorder causing the concerning findings (Recommendation 8a). Children with ICH often receive blood product transfusions, and it is suggested that testing for bleeding disorders in these patients be delayed until elimination of the transfused blood clotting elements (Recommendation 9b). The discovery of new information regarding condition prevalence, laboratory testing, and clinical presentations of bleeding disorders is to be expected, and close collaboration with a pediatric hematologist may be necessary (Recommendation 7).

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111EcVdw]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy — clinical presentation and diagnosis include generalized pruritus most severe in the palms and soles without an accompanying rash with typical onset in the second or third trimester; 80% of women present after 30 weeks of gestation; AST and ALT levels may be elevated, varying from 2-fold to 30-fold higher; because pruritus can precede laboratory abnormalities, if initial testing of total bile acids is normal, repeat testing is indicated, and symptoms and laboratory tests are sufficient to make the diagnosis, with ultrasound (US) used to exclude biliary causes in select cases; because most women without ICP have total bile acids less than 10 μmol, this threshold is frequently considered the upper limit of normal, and there is no consensus on fasting versus postprandial measurement, but in women with ICP, higher levels are detected postprandially.

### Reporting incidental findings in genomic scale clinical sequencing – a clinical laboratory perspective: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^117UZTjx]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Low credibility.

Advances in sequencing technologies have facilitated concurrent testing for many disorders, and the results generated may provide information about a patient's health that is unrelated to the clinical indication, commonly referred to as incidental findings. This is a paradigm shift from traditional genetic testing in which testing and reporting are tailored to a patient's specific clinical condition. Clinical laboratories and physicians are wrestling with this increased complexity in genomic testing and reporting of the incidental findings to patients. An enormous amount of discussion has taken place since the release of a set of recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. This discussion has largely focused on the content of the incidental findings, but the laboratory perspective and patient autonomy have been overlooked. This report by the Association of Molecular Pathology workgroup discusses the pros and cons of next-generation sequencing technology, potential benefits, and harms for reporting of incidental findings, including the effect on both the laboratory and the patient, and compares those with other areas of medicine. The importance of genetic counseling to preserve patient autonomy is also reviewed. The discussion and recommendations presented by the workgroup underline the need for continued research and discussion among all stakeholders to improve our understanding of the effect of different policies on patients, providers, and laboratories.

### Cryptogenic and secondary organizing pneumonia: clinical presentation, radiographic findings, treatment response, and prognosis [^111ifCuw]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a distinct clinical and pathologic entity. This condition can be cryptogenic (COP) or secondary to other known causes (secondary OP). In the present study, we reviewed the features associated with COP and secondary OP in patients from two teaching hospitals.

Methods

The medical records of 61 patients with biopsy-proven OP were retrospectively reviewed. Forty patients were diagnosed with COP and 21 patients with secondary OP. The clinical presentation, radiographic studies, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), laboratory data, BAL findings, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.

Results

The mean age at presentation was 60.46 ± 13.57 years. Malaise, cough, fever, dyspnea, bilateral alveolar infiltrates, and a restrictive pattern were the most common symptoms and findings. BAL lymphocytosis was observed in 43.8% of patients with OP. The relapse rate and mortality rate after 1 year of follow-up were 37.8% and 9.4%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 5.7%. The clinical presentation and radiographic findings did not differ significantly between patients with COP and secondary OP. A mixed PFT pattern (obstructive and restrictive physiology) and lower blood levels of serum sodium, serum potassium, platelets, albumin, protein, and pH were observed among patients with secondary OP. Higher blood levels of creatinine, bilirubin, Paco₂, and BAL lymphocytes were also more common among patients with secondary OP. There were no differences in the relapse rate or mortality between patients with COP and secondary OP. The 1-year mortality correlated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, low albumin, and low hemoglobin levels.

Conclusions

The clinical and radiographic findings in patients with COP and secondary OP are similar and nonspecific. Although certain laboratory abnormalities are more common in secondary OP and can be associated with worse prognosis, they are likely due to the underlying disease. COP and secondary OP have similar treatment response, relapse rates, and mortality.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1139M4Yt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Table 5 — etiologies of acute liver failure — details typical presentations, laboratory patterns, and timing cues across major causes. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity often follows ingestion of > 10 g and can show marked transaminase elevation with relatively low bilirubin, with rapid progression to ALF accompanied by hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and renal failure within 72–96 hr. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury is not necessarily dose dependent with highly variable latency, and antimicrobials followed by complementary and alternative medications are common culprits. Viral hepatitis notes that hepatitis A, B, and E virus infections are most common and a viral prodrome often precedes ALF; prognosis is reported as Variable (favorable for HAV, but poor for HBV, and HEV during pregnancy). Pregnancy-related ALF commonly involves HELLP syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), both occurring in the third trimester or immediately postpartum, with a hepatocellular pattern and median AST/ALT > 10× ULN. Autoimmune hepatitis shows a predominantly hepatocellular pattern with marked transaminase elevation and elevated anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle actin antibody, and immunoglobulin G levels. Wilson disease may have modest transaminase elevation with normal or very low alkaline phosphatase and can present with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and rapid progression to renal failure. Mushroom poisoning presents with severe gastroenteritis at 6–12 hr after ingestion, evolving hepatotoxicity within 24–36 hr, and progressive liver and multiorgan failure within 4–7 d. Budd-Chiari syndrome most commonly affects women in their fourth to fifth decades of life; laboratory findings include transaminase elevation in the 1000s and an AST:ALT ratio that often exceeds 1.

### Reporting incidental findings in genomic scale clinical sequencing – a clinical laboratory perspective: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115ioWRP]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Medium credibility.

Genetic counseling and consenting perspective — whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS): The consenting process for WES and WGS is critically important and should be performed by a person highly trained in genetics such as a geneticist or genetic counselor, and medical professionals who order WES/WGS should also know that laboratory policies for analysis and reporting of incidental findings may change as they carefully consider advances in technology and the effect of implementing the ACMG recommended panel as well as the recommendations of other groups. Each laboratory should clearly indicate on their consent form if it routinely performs analysis for incidental findings such as the ACMG recommended additional 56 genes or whether it explores an even further expanded list of incidental findings unrelated to phenotype; laboratories should also be as specific as possible in listing the genes to be analyzed and in defining the types of incidental findings they routinely report, and if they exclude certain types of conditions (ie, adult-onset neurodegenerative conditions with no cure) that should be specified in the consent. The consent should clearly delineate whether the patient or other family members have the option of choosing not to receive incidental results, and if several family members are undergoing exome sequencing each of these persons should give consent on a separate written document; they should also be informed about how they are to receive incidental findings if they are not the proband, because the results from the incidental findings in other family members should remain confidential. Some laboratories may choose not to report incidental findings for adult-onset conditions for a patient who is younger than 18 years and may decide not to test for adult-onset conditions in minors, and the ACMG and the American Academy of Pediatrics continue to support deferring the testing of late-onset conditions until adulthood.

### Giant cellulitis-like sweet syndrome in association with chronic myeloid leukemia [^116z9WQT]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pathogenesis of SS has been attributed to helper T-cell mediated production of cytokines, including interleukin 1, interleukin 2, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.GCLSS is a rare variant of SS, and prior descriptions have not associated this variant with underlying conditions other than obesity. Due to the small number of cases of GCLSS reported in the literature, it is possible that obesity represents a confounding feature rather than a significant association. The presentation and symptoms could be misinterpreted as cellulitis as both disorders can present with acute erythematous and edematous plaques, fever, and leukocytosis. Cellulitis is generally associated with a bacterial infection and is usually focal and unilateral in nature, typically affecting the lower extremities. On histopathology, cellulitis and acute inflammatory edema can also present with prominent edema and the presence of neutrophils to varying degrees. Classically, SS can be differentiated by a neutrophilic nodular infiltrate in the upper half of the dermis compared to the perivascular and interstitial pattern with deep inflammation seen in cellulitis or sparse infiltrate with edemaphages seen in acute inflammatory edema. The presence of multiple, discontinuous plaques on the trunk and lack of response to antibiotics led to dermatology consultation and consideration of SS in this case. A comparison of the clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, histopathology, and treatment of SS and cellulitis is summarized in Table I. Workup for suspected SS includes a skin biopsy, assessment of neutrophilia, trial of systemic glucocorticoids, and identification of an associated condition in 50 percent of cases. The patient presented here responded rapidly to the administration of prednisone and was given an extended taper to prevent relapse.

Table I
Comparison of giant cellulitis-like Sweet syndrome and cellulitis,

Previously, GCLSS has been described with typical histopathologic features of SS. In this patient, we observed a superficial and deep sparse perivascular and interstitial neutrophilic infiltrate with extension to the subcutis, findings that mimic cellulitis. Of note, we excluded the possibility of dasatinib-induced GCLSS because of abnormal laboratory values at presentation (leukocytosis with a significant left shift), lack of response to medication dechallenge, absence of recurrence upon medication rechallenge, and the excellent response to systemic corticosteroids.

In conclusion, distribution, clinical context, and response to systemic corticosteroids allow differentiation of GCLSS and cellulitis. Contrary to prior descriptions, GCLSS may be associated with underlying hematologic disorders in addition to obesity. In addition to clinical morphology, histopathologic findings of GCLSS may also mimic cellulitis, potentially resulting in diagnostic confusion and delayed treatment.

### Low blood counts: immune mediated, idiopathic, or myelodysplasia [^1124ydpA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cytopenias are classified as deficiency mediated, immune mediated, BM failure induced, renal, or idiopathic, with the latter including the so-called idiopathic cytopenias of undetermined significance (ICUS). Clinical findings, symptoms, blood counts, BM findings, and other laboratory parameters are usually sufficient to reveal the type and cause of a marked cytopenia. However, in patients with chronic mild cytopenia, it may be a challenge for the physician to establish a correct diagnosis. In such patients, laboratory features and findings often reflect a diagnostic interface, so that criteria that are otherwise robust may hardly be applicable or are not helpful. Even if the BM is examined, the diagnosis often remains uncertain in these patients. In addition, more than one potential cause of cytopenia may be present, especially in the elderly. A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or another BM disorder, but also an overt autoimmune or other inflammatory disease, may develop during follow-up in these patients. A key problem is that in an early phase of MDS, most laboratory and clinical signs are "nonspecific". One of the very few reliable peripheral blood parameters distinguishing between an early or "pre-phase" of MDS and most other causes of a mild cytopenia are the numbers of circulating colony-forming progenitor cells. In addition, flow cytometric and molecular investigations may sometimes assist in the delineation between clonal and reactive conditions underlying mild cytopenias. This review provides an overview of diagnostic approaches and algorithms for patients with mild unexplained cytopenia(s).

### Laboratory biomarkers in the management of patients with COVID-19 [^1178Vtqx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Laboratory testing and the measurement of appropriate biomarkers play a critical role in managing patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), allowing for disease diagnosis, monitoring progression, prognostication, prediction of treatment response, and risk stratification. We sought to characterize these effects on a more detailed, mechanistic level.

Methods

We reviewed the literature and identified a multitude of reports that describe the unique effects of this virus and its devastating consequences to multiple organ systems in COVID-19 patients.

Results

There are specific alterations in biomarkers related to coagulation, depopulation of T-cell subtypes, the cytokine storm and inflammation, and kidney and cardiac dysfunction.

Conclusions

Laboratory measurement of specific parameters and the use of appropriate prognostic, predictive, and monitoring biomarkers afford clinicians the ability to make informed medical decisions and guide therapy for patients afflicted with this dreaded disease.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^114Z1RPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. The key target condition for this review was current COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms include breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require distinctive patient management, and it is important to be able to identify these patients.

In this review, we focus on COVID‐19, without making the distinction between mild to moderate and severe disease.

Index test(s)

We collated evidence on all routine biomarker tests reported in the identified studies. These can be classified into:

full blood count, haemoglobin and red blood cells;
coagulation markers;
liver markers, cardiac markers and kidney function markers;
general inflammatory markers; and
metabolic markers.

### Reporting incidental findings in genomic scale clinical sequencing – a clinical laboratory perspective: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^115DZPwG]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Medium credibility.

Workgroup conclusion on reporting of incidental findings — laboratory policies and patient choice: Laboratories that provide next-generation sequencing (NGS) services "must develop a policy for analysis and reporting of known and predicted pathogenic variants", and patients "should be given an opportunity to opt-out of receiving incidental findings". Persons undergoing whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) "should have the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of receiving a report that documents variants that are not relevant to the initial reason for testing", and laboratories must decide what to provide to parents or third parties with similar opt-in/opt-out options as part of "the patient education and informed consent process". The workgroup notes "Most patients will likely opt-in", but clinicians must be sensitive that some patients facing difficult conditions may decline, and "the needs of specific cultural and ethnic groups must be accommodated". Laboratories "should have policies in place that clearly define their approach to reporting the ACMG gene list and other incidental findings", with the ACMG's initial recommendation covering "a set of 56 genes".

### Predictors of COVID-19 severity: a literature review [^116QZMpk]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving global emergency that continues to strain healthcare systems. Emerging research describes a plethora of patient factors-including demographic, clinical, immunologic, hematological, biochemical, and radiographic findings-that may be of utility to clinicians to predict COVID-19 severity and mortality. We present a synthesis of the current literature pertaining to factors predictive of COVID-19 clinical course and outcomes. Findings associated with increased disease severity and/or mortality include age > 55years, multiple pre-existing comorbidities, hypoxia, specific computed tomography findings indicative of extensive lung involvement, diverse laboratory test abnormalities, and biomarkers of end-organ dysfunction. Hypothesis-driven research is critical to identify the key evidence-based prognostic factors that will inform the design of intervention studies to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and to appropriately allocate scarce resources.

Serotonin syndrome — Given the large number of non–mental health medications with serotonergic properties in addition to antidepressants and some antipsychotics, it is not surprising that the incidence of serotonin syndrome is increasing, and it can occur in cases of overdose but also in the course of standard use. The classic clinical triad consists of mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities, although many patients do not exhibit all these clinical characteristics, and diagnosing serotonin syndrome can be particularly challenging because of the wide variability in the severity of symptoms and the lack of pathognomonic clinical and laboratory findings. Agitated delirium is the most common form of mental status change.

### Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in a 35-year-old woman following hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [^116fNDfv]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS) have been documented to take place after an inciting event or illness. They present with headache, altered mental status and focal neurologic findings. The differential diagnosis includes primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) but one major clinical difference is that the symptoms of RCVS usually resolve within days or weeks whereas PACNS is often fatal. Females of childbearing age are most commonly affected with RCVS. Cases of reversible vasculopathy have also been reported in menopausal women. The hormonal and physiologic changes that take place during the postpartum period and menopause may not be very different from those that occur after a hysterectomy and oophorectomy.

Methods

A case is presented of a 35-year-old woman who underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and then began experiencing severe headaches, visual changes and hemi-sensory loss. Physical examination, imaging and laboratory findings were descriptive of RCVS, and the patient's rapid recovery was consistent with the usual disease progression of a reversible vasculopathy.

Conclusion

A reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome may occur in some circumstances after a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The mechanisms involved in the development of this condition are explained by current research concerning effects on the vasculature of sudden drops in estrogens and progesterones. More studies are required to further establish the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

### Comprehensive screening shows that mutations in the known syndromic genes are rare in infants presenting with hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia [^113keEg5]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

The finding that the patient with Kabuki syndrome had HH as the presenting feature highlights the potential benefit of screening for the syndromic genes in individuals newly diagnosed with HH. Identifying the underlying genetic aetiology is important for these patients as it will inform on prognosis which will allow for better clinical management. A genetic diagnosis also provides important information on recurrence risk.

We found that mutations causing these 20 syndromes are rare. The recent adoption of targeted next‐generation sequencing by molecular genetics laboratories makes screening of multiple genes for conditions such as HH feasible. An early and accurate genetic diagnosis of a syndrome has benefits for patient care. However, there are some disadvantages of this approach in terms of the difficulties with variant interpretation in the absence of additional clinical features and the extra time required for the analysis of the genetic data. Thus, routine testing of this panel of genes may not be justified for patients without syndromic features as we have shown that mutations in these genes are rare in such a cohort. It is anticipated that variant interpretation will become easier through data sharing initiatives such as ClinVar, 22 and as the number of publically available control data sets increase, more variants can be excluded by frequency. 19 This may make testing of these genes in all patients with HH more feasible in future.

Screening large cohorts for mutations in these genes will provide further information on the prevalence of mutations in HH, which will help to guide future genetic screening strategies for this condition and may also identify individuals with "nonclassical" features, which would expand the phenotype associated with these syndromes.

In conclusion, while the clinical impact of finding a mutation in a syndromic gene is high as it can inform clinical management, mutations in the syndromic HH genes are rare in individuals referred for routine testing for HH. Given the time‐consuming nature of a comprehensive screen, routine testing of these genes by molecular genetics laboratories is unlikely to be justified in patients without syndromic phenotypes.

HELLP — features, labs, and diagnostic considerations: Typically arises in the second or third trimester with abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting and commonly coexists with preeclampsia. Prevalence is 0.2%-0.6% (preeclampsia affects 3%-5%). Risk factors include preexisting hypertension, diabetes mellitus, advanced maternal age, multiple gestations, and prior preeclampsia. Laboratory findings include AST and ALT typically > 500 units/L, bilirubin < 5 mg/dL, and hemolysis with markedly elevated LDH > 600 units/L. Diagnosis is clinical with maternal organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, or hematologic complications, uteroplacental dysfunction, or fetal growth restriction.

### Diagnostic challenges in pediatric hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^115eYoHP]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of severe immune dysregulation that encompasses a broad range of underlying genetic diseases and infectious triggers. Monogenic conditions, autoimmune diseases, and infections can all drive the phenotype of HLH and associated immune hyperactivation with hypercytokinemia. A diagnosis of HLH usually requires a combination of clinical and laboratory findings; there is no single sensitive and specific diagnostic test, which often leads to "diagnostic dilemmas" and delays in treatment initiation. Ferritin levels, one of the most commonly used screening tests, were collected across a large tertiary care pediatric hospital to identify the positive predictive value for HLH. Herein, we present several cases that illustrate the clinical challenges of confirming an HLH diagnosis. Additionally, we report on the utility of establishing a formal multi-disciplinary group to aid the prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with HLH-like pathophysiologies.

Case presentation

Patient 1

A pregnant adult patient at 35 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for morbid obesity status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypothyroidism presented with nausea and diffuse, progressive abdominal pain that started several hours after arrival, with no fever or vomiting reported. She reported good fetal movement without vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid, or contractions. Vital signs and laboratory analysis were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen was significant for rebound tenderness in left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated an inflamed, dilated appendix with periappendiceal stranding and edema without fecalith.

Patient 2

A pregnant adult patient at 33 weeks and 5 days gestation with a medical history significant for inflammatory bowel syndrome, status-post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic repair of internal hernia, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus presented with 2 days of nausea, emesis, and right-sided epigastric pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient denied fever, chills, or cough, and reported regular fetal movement. The patient's presenting vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed focal tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory analysis showed a leukocytosis of 14.3×10³/μL. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated appendiceal wall thickening and periappendiceal stranding without fecalith.

Pregnancy — initial presentation and differential diagnosis of Wilson disease require vigilance. WD may first become clinically apparent during pregnancy: timely diagnosis is complicated but essential. The differential diagnosis includes conditions that are more commonly found during pregnancy: hemolysis — elevated liver enzymes — low platelets syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, antiphospholipid syndrome, and flare of systemic lupus erythematosus. Adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with undiagnosed WD.

### Acute fatty liver of pregnancy [^111mKGhB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare, but potentially fatal obstetric disorder characterized principally by varying degrees of hepatic failure with an onset typically in late pregnancy. This review outlines the etiopathogenesis and describes the multiorgan involvement that often results in a number of clinical and laboratory aberrations. These laboratory derangements provide distinct features to differentiate from other obstetric complications, such as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Once recognized, central to the management of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is delivery planning and meticulous supportive care. One particularly dangerous complication is profound coagulopathy. After delivery, the coagulation defect resolves over 1–2 days, and hepatic and renal function are restored soon thereafter. This report offers anticipated recovery and management strategies for commonly associated complications. Application of these factors has served to decrease mortality from as high as 80% down to 10%; however, given the seriousness of this condition, severe maternal morbidities are frequently associated with this obstetric emergency.

Assessment of reporting bias

We aimed to publish lists of studies that we know exist but for which we have not managed to locate reports, and request information to include in updates of these reviews. However, at the time of writing this version of the review, we are unaware of unpublished studies.

Summary of findings

We have listed our key findings in Table 1 to determine the strength of evidence for each test and findings, and to highlight important gaps in the evidence.

Updating

As we will explain in the discussion, this review will no longer be updated in its current form. Resources allowing, we will consider updating this review when sufficient studies of high methodological quality become available examining the combination of signs and symptoms with other, easy‐to‐obtain information such as demographics, point‐of‐care test results, prior exposure to an infected person, and recent case detection rate. Another important outcome would be to investigate whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Differential diagnosis between multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies – A scoping review [^114WGSkg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by damage to the myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes. Currently, there is no specific biomarker to identify the disease; however, a diagnostic criterion has been established based on patient's clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics, which assists in identifying this condition. The primary method for diagnosing MS is the McDonald criteria, first described in 2001 and revised in the years 2005, 2012, and 2017. These criteria have been continuously reviewed to enhance specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of MS, thereby reducing errors in its differential diagnosis. An important differential diagnosis that shares overlapping features with MS, mainly the progressive forms, are leukodystrophies with demyelination as underlying pathology. Leukodystrophies comprise a rare group of genetically determined disorders that lead to either demyelination or hypomyelination of the central nervous system that can result neuroimaging changes as well as clinical findings similar to those observed in MS. Thus, systematic evaluation encompassing clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and laboratory metrics proves indispensable for a differential diagnosis. As such, this study aimed to establish, clearly and objectively, the similarities and differences between MS and the main demyelinating leukodystrophies. The study analyzed the parameters of the McDonald criteria, including clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging aspects, as found in patients with leukodystrophies through scoping literature review.

### Autoimmune encephalitis at the neurological intensive care unit: etiologies, reasons for admission and survival [^113RTFKg]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Encephalitis is a life-threatening medical condition of various etiologies, which affects patients of all ages and results in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Along with recent advances in diagnostic testing, autoimmune conditions have been receiving increasing recognition as causes of encephalitis. Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) poses a diagnostic challenge because of its heterogeneous clinical presentations that include neurological, psychiatric, and general medical conditions. In addition, at this time antibody testing to confirm AE is only available at specialized centers. Direct consequences are an inconsistent coverage for antibody testing and, in many cases, delayed obtainment of results. Timely diagnosis and treatment is, however, essential for favorable outcome.

Patients with AE often develop life-threatening complications that necessitate intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Notably, while ICU admission has been shown to be associated with poor outcome, little is known about clinical presentations and radiological and laboratory findings of those patients admitted to the ICU. In this study, we aimed to characterize underlying etiologies and the spectrum of clinical symptoms in critically ill patients with AE, their reasons for ICU admission, and evaluated which factors might be associated with death. Further, we evaluated the impact of comorbidity, the workload of nurses, and the disease severity during the first 24 h of ICU admission by using the Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI), the therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS) 28, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, respectively.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^116ycKh2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Imaging plays a crucial role in the early detection and assessment of the extent of disease in Budd Chiari syndrome (BCS). Early diagnosis and intervention to mitigate hepatic congestion is vital to restoring hepatic function and alleviating portal hypertension. Interventional radiology serves a key role in the management of these patients. The interventionist should be knowledgeable of the clinical presentation as well as key imaging findings, which often dictate the approach to treatment. This article concisely reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of BCS and provides a detailed description of imaging and treatment options, particularly interventional management.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^114JuqCX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings that detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established that signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and specialist referral. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure as well as cardiovascular death.

### Eleven faces of coronavirus disease 2019 [^117U3xSs]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently spread worldwide and been declared a pandemic. We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases.

Methods

Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed.

Results

The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe.

Conclusion

All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^1115wEis]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

Inflammation

Limbic encephalitis

Limbic encephalitis is a family of disorders causing inflammation of components of the limbic system; it can be paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic.

Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is immune-mediated encephalitis, likely resulting from the immune response to an antigen shared by a neoplasm and the nervous system. Patients usually present subacutely with personality changes, irritability, depression, dementia, seizures and short-term memory loss. It is mostly associated with small cell lung carcinoma and testicular germ cell tumour, and may be diagnosed up to 4 years before tumour diagnosis (Fig. 6). Anti-neuronal antibodies are found in about 60% of the patients (anti Hu, anti Ta, anti Ma, etc.). The diagnosis requires the combination of clinical, imaging and laboratory tests, as well as exclusion of other neuro-oncologic conditions.

Fig. 6
A 52-year-old male with known diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma and new onset seizures. Increased FLAIR signal is noted in the mesial temporal lobes, left greater than right without mass effect or volume loss. Based on positive serum anti Hu antibodies and imaging findings, the diagnosis of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis was made

Imaging abnormalities are seen in 64% of the patients on MRI, most commonly, unilateral or bilateral mesio-temporal T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities. Enhancement may occur, as well as involvement of additional limbic system components and other brain regions.

Non-paraneoplastic limbic encephalopathy is a similarly rare condition, without an underlying malignancy. Imaging findings are similar to neoplastic limbic encephalitis; clinically, seizures and prolonged presentation are more common. Diagnosis relies mainly on exclusion of an underlying malignancy.

Summary — medical assessment approach for ED psychiatric patients: The current body of literature supports focused medical assessments for ED psychiatric patients, in which laboratory and radiographic testing is obtained on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination; routine diagnostic testing generally is low yield, costly, and unlikely to be of value or affect the disposition or management of ED psychiatric patients; when patients are clinically stable, the ACEP states that routine laboratory testing need not be performed as part of the ED assessment; if a discrepancy occurs between ED and psychiatry clinicians, direct communication between attending physicians may be helpful; for patients with concerning findings on history and/or physical examination or with new-onset or acute changes in psychiatric symptoms, a careful evaluation for possible underlying medical conditions may be important.

Pituitary incidentaloma — initial evaluation: We recommend that patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma undergo a complete history and physical examination, laboratory evaluations screening for hormone hypersecretion and for hypopituitarism. Patients with evidence of either of these conditions should undergo an appropriately directed biochemical evaluation. We recommend that all patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, including those without symptoms, undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hormone hypersecretion. We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism. We recommend that all patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma abutting the optic nerves or chiasm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undergo a formal visual field (VF) examination.

### Interaction between clinic and laboratory [^117Tzx8h]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Clinicians order laboratory tests to diagnose, monitor, and screen for diseases, to evaluate or confirm previously abnormal results and to develop prognoses. The rigorous quality assurance programs, large automated processes and economic constraints may induce direct challenges to tailored diagnosis. Clinicians will have to gain an understanding of the underlying principles of laboratory technologies without losing their ability to practice 'the art of medicine' at their primary focus - the patient. Specialized laboratory services and expertise play especially important roles in coagulation hematology. Assays are technically demanding and often based on functional properties of proteins, producing results that are far more than plain numbers. Interpretation of laboratory data poses many challenges, such as pre-analytical and patient-dependent factors, of which the laboratory is often not well informed, but which the clinicians are required to take into account. The laboratory scientist needs to understand the multiple clinical circumstances causing variance or interference in the laboratory results. Direct interaction between clinic and laboratory is needed. When laboratory-specific issues are uncertain to the clinician, the laboratory scientist should become the clinician's primary consultant. The better the education and knowledge of both directions, the better the outcome. Regular multidisciplinary rounds by the clinicians and the laboratory scientists are of great benefit. This interaction at its best fosters research and development by identifying new mechanisms and tools.

### Clinical characteristics, cause analysis and infectivity of COVID-19 nucleic acid repositive patients: a literature review [^114kVVt1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the published literature, there are few of large‐sample statistics on the proportion of patients with viral redetectable, and the rate of viral redetectable has been reported to be as low as 3.3% and as high as 30.7% (see Table 1). However, the results of these small‐sample‐size studies suggest that a significant proportion of discharged patients are carriers of the virus. According to reports of the clinical characteristics of repositive patients, some patients have recurrent clinical symptoms, such as fever and cough. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, a large number of cases showed no clinical symptoms and no change in laboratory indicators or imaging findings. 3, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Furthermore, the repositive patients tended to be younger, and most of them had mild disease symptoms at the first time of admission. 6, 7, 13, 18, 19

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of repositive COVID‐19 patients

Compared with other discharged patients, no clinical characteristics or indicators were found to reliably predict the risk of a patient being repositive for SARS‐CoV‐2, nor were any specific drugs or treatments associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 reactivation. However, whether there are clinical symptoms or not, such patients are admitted to hospital, provided medicine treatment, monitored for physical changes, and regularly tested for nucleic acid conversion (see Table 1).

1.2 Cause analysis for recovered COVID‐19 patients with repositive nucleic acid results

In the existing literature, strict isolation measures continue to be taken for discharged patients, and the chance of reexposure to the source of infection is very low, 7, 8, 11, 17 which suggested that nucleic acid repositive patients are not reinfected with SARS‐CoV‐2, rather, it is likely that the virus was not completely cleared before the patients were discharged from hospital, and their previous nucleic acid test results were false negative. To ascertain why the nucleic acid results were false negative and SARS‐CoV‐2 is not easily cleared, the etiological and patient characteristics and laboratory tests should be analyzed in combination with the relevant literature.

### Acquisition of genital herpes among pregnant women… [^112MmeFF]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection most commonly occurs when the virus is present in the birth canal of an asymptomatic mother during labor and delivery. The virus may be present as a result of reactivation of prior infection or infection acquired at some time during the pregnancy. The consequences of neonatal infection with HSV include neurodevelopmental disability and death. It has also been noted that genital HSV infection acquired during pregnancy may result in pre-term labor, intrauterine growth retardation and spontaneous abortion. Brown and colleagues used virologic and serologic methods to determine the rate of acquisition of HSV infection among pregnant women. Serum samples for antibody to HSV type 1 and type 2 were obtained at the first prenatal visit in 8, 538 women. In addition, serum samples were obtained at 14 to 18 weeks of gestation, at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation and at the time of labor.

Cultures for HSV were obtained from the external genitalia and from the cervix of these women at the onset of labor. The serum samples from each of the women were tested simultaneously using Western blot assays. The medical records of women who became seropositive for HSV during the pregnancy were reviewed for symptoms of genital herpes during pregnancy. Of the approximately 8, 500 women included in the study, 24 percent were HSV-negative at entry into the study; 48 percent were seropositive for HSV type 1 antibody; 11 percent were seropositive for HSV type 2 antibody; and 17 percent were seropositive for both types of antibodies. During the course of pregnancy, a total of 94 women became seropositive for HSV. After adjustment for a 40-week gestation period, this total represents 2 percent of all susceptible patients. Among the 94 women who became seropositive during the prenatal period, 60 had subclinical infections.

Thirty percent acquired the infection in the first trimester, 30 percent in the second trimester, and 40 percent in the third trimester. Thirty-four of the newly infected patients had symptomatic infections. Twenty-one percent of infections occurred in the first trimester, 44 percent in the second trimester, and 35 percent in the third trimester. There were no cases of neonatal herpes and there was no increase in pregnancy-related morbidity among the 94 women who seroconverted. Nine other women who were diagnosed with genital herpes obtained the infection near the onset of labor; five of these women had lesions at the time of labor. Neonatal infections occurred in four of the nine infants born to these women. The authors conclude that infection with HSV during the prenatal period did not increase the frequency of pregnancy-related complications if seroconversion was complete before the onset of labor.

Approximately 2 percent of susceptible women may acquire HSV infection during pregnancy. However, only an infection obtained near the time of labor and delivery appears to be associated with neonatal infection and accompanying morbidity and mortality. The latter part of pregnancy may be the best time to consider serologic testing for HSV and to recommend preventive methods to susceptible mothers, such as the use of condoms or sexual abstinence.

### Fluticasone propionate (armonAir digihaler) [^1154YWmn]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome

In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.

### Appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasonography in patients with acute dyspnea in emergency department or inpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113wi6F3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for POCUS in acute dyspnea — applicability, exclusions, device scope, training, and diagnostic uncertainty: The included studies enrolled adult patients presenting in EDs and inpatient settings with dyspnea as a primary symptom (unspecified acute dyspnea) and who were later confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest (congestive heart failure [including pulmonary edema], pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax). The systematic review excluded studies that included patients with other medical conditions that can cause dyspnea (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, acute coronary symptoms, and trauma) if the patients were not also confirmed to have 1 of the conditions of interest. This recommendation does not apply to handheld devices; evidence from 1 high risk of bias study is very uncertain (insufficient) about the effect of handheld POCUS devices in addition to the standard pathway on health, diagnostic, and treatment outcomes. Clinicians who use POCUS should be trained in the use and interpretation of findings and ongoing care quality assessment. As with any diagnostic test, this recommendation applies to clinical scenarios where there is diagnostic uncertainty, and clinicians should understand and consider that the test accuracy of POCUS varies according to the likelihood of underlying diseases. Figure 2 shows that, using the prevalence estimates of various conditions reported in the studies, the rate of false-positive test results for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism may be higher than what many clinicians and patients are comfortable with, and clinicians can also review Figure 2 and consider that the severity of consequences of false-negative or false-positive test results may differ according to disease.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^116v8C8L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Laboratory Findings

Hematologic abnormalities are among the most consistent laboratory findings reported in patients with SARS; most patients have total leukocyte counts that are normal or slightly low, and 70%–95% of patients have lymphopenia. Platelet counts are mildly depressed in 30% to 50% of patients. Prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time can be observed in 40% to 60% of patients, but disseminated intravascular coagulation is uncommon.

Other common abnormal laboratory findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels in 70% to 90% of patients, elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels in 20% to 30%, elevated creatine phosphokinase in 30% to 40%, and elevated C-reactive protein.

Radiographic Findings

While the full understanding of the spectrum of radiographic manifestations of SARS will require additional information, available data suggest that almost all reported patients with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection have radiographic evidence of pneumonia documented at some point during their illness. Chest radiographs may be normal in up to 30% of patients with the clinical diagnosis of SARS at the time when first evaluated (,–). In reports from China, radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia were detected in 67% to 80% of SARS patients by day 3 of illness, 97%-100% by day 7, and in 100% by day 10. A lesion typically begins as an isolated focal lesion found in a peripheral location, often in the lower lobes. In 75% of patients, the lesions progress over several days to involve additional lobes or both lungs.

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest appears to be more sensitive than conventional chest radiography for detecting pneumonia; SARS patients who have normal chest radiographic findings early in their clinical course often have evidence of pneumonia by CT. Common CT findings are ground-glass opacification and a lower lobe and peripheral distribution.

Distinguishing SARS from Other Illnesses

As with other causes of bacterial and viral pneumonia, clinical findings in patients with SARS cannot accurately predict the causative agent. Further study is required to determine whether a constellation of clinical findings alone can be used to discriminate accurately between SARS and other (especially viral) respiratory illnesses. Many of the clinical and laboratory features of SARS are similar to those in other forms of viral pneumonia. Several clinical features, however, may be helpful in facilitating recognition of patients with SARS (Table 1).

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113XcKD9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Another important patient group that has been neglected in the literature is older adults. They are most at risk of a negative outcome of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, especially mortality but also intensive care support. In this version of the review, only two overlapping studies (1 dataset) focused on adults aged 65 years or older. All other studies included adults of all ages and did not present results separately for the older age groups. The lack of a solid evidence base for the diagnosis of COVID‐19 in older adults adds to the difficulty in diagnosing serious infections in this age group, in whom other serious infections such as bacterial pneumonia or urinary sepsis also tend to lead to non‐specific presentations.

Studies specifically focusing on older adults or children may also enable us to estimate any difference in the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms within these age groups. Given the distinct biological characteristics of children versus younger and versus older adults, these accuracy estimates are likely to be different in different age groups. The current presentation of overall summary estimates may therefore prove too simplistic.

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^1168263v]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases. "I tried to unveil the stillness of existence through a counteracting murmur of words, and, above all, I confused things with their names: that is belief". Jean-Paul Sartre (The Words, 1964).

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a potentially life-threatening disorder with a number of causes, including viral infections.

Case Presentation

A 25-year-old female patient presented with a non-specific febrile illness, headache and hepatitis. She was found to have right transverse sinus and cortical venous thrombosis in addition to acute systemic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. She responded well to anticoagulation with warfarin for 6 months. CMV infection was treated conservatively.

Conclusion

CVST is an increasingly prevalent condition often presenting with headache, focal neurological deficits and seizures. Despite extensive investigations, often no specific cause is found. CMV is a ubiquitous virus that can present with a non-specific febrile illness or a variety of organ dysfunction. CMV has been shown to be associated with predominantly venous thrombosis, most commonly lower limb deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and splanchnic vein thrombosis. The risk is highest in immunocompromised patients, though most patients are immunocompetent. There have been few reports of CVST related to CMV and all of these with a more tenuous link to acute CMV infection. Clinicians should be aware of this link, particularly in those who have CVST in the context of a febrile illness, or immunocompromised patients.

### Vascular graft infections, mycotic aneurysms, and endovascular infections: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114Ecryz]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Intracranial mycotic aneurysm (ICMA) — clinical presentation and diagnostic triggers include ischemic stroke from septic emboli and hemorrhage from rupture with focal neurological or meningeal signs; other findings can include proptosis, papilledema, ocular or facial palsy, epistaxis, or cavernous sinus thrombosis. There are no clinical or laboratory findings specific for ICMA, and suspected cases must be confirmed radiographically or at surgery. Any patient with underlying predisposing conditions who develops severe, localized, unremitting headache; focal neurological findings; stroke; or acute intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage should be suspected of having ICMA. Prompt cerebrovascular imaging should be performed to identify possible ICMA or CNS bleeding in any patient with IE who develops severe localized headache, neurological deficits, or meningeal signs, and can even be considered in patients without symptoms because of risk. There is insufficient evidence to recommend dedicated cerebrovascular imaging for all patients with meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, orbital cellulitis, or sinusitis; however, dedicated imaging for possible ICMA should be performed if there is intracranial bleeding, focal neurological abnormalities, or cranial nerve abnormalities.

### Acalculous acute cholecystitis during the course of an enteroviral infection [^113TGSuh]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Gallbladder diseases are uncommon in children. Acalculous acute cholecystitis, although rare, is the most frequent form of acute cholecystitis in childhood. In acalculous acute cholecystitis, clinical presentation and laboratory findings are unspecific, making the diagnosis challenging. Abdominal ultrasonography is the first-line exam. Most cases of paediatric acalculous acute cholecystitis have been described in critically ill patients, but can occur in previously healthy children, without underlying diseases or severe conditions. The authors present a clinical report of a child with acalculous acute cholecystitis and enteroviral infection. Diagnosis, treatment, clinical course and prognosis are described. Pathophysiology, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of acalculous acute cholecystitis are also discussed.

### Complicated COVID-19 in pregnancy: a case report with severe liver and coagulation dysfunction promptly improved by delivery [^114bEieJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been proposed that pregnant women and their fetuses may be particularly at risk for poor outcomes due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. From the few case series that are available in the literature, women with high risk pregnancies have been associated with higher morbidity. It has been suggested that pregnancy induced immune responses and cardio-vascular changes can exaggerate the course of the COVID-19 infection.

Case Presentation

A 26-year old Somalian woman (G2P1) presented with a nine-day history of shortness of breath, dry cough, myalgia, nausea, abdominal pain and fever. A nasopharyngeal swab returned positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Her condition rapidly worsened leading to severe liver and coagulation impairment. An emergency Caesarean section was performed at gestational week 32+6 after which the patient made a rapid recovery. Severe COVID-19 promptly improved by the termination of the pregnancy or atypical HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes and Low Platelet Count) exacerbated by concomitant COVID-19 infection could not be ruled out. There was no evidence of vertical transmission.

Conclusions

This case adds to the growing body of evidence which raises concerns about the possible negative maternal outcomes of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and advocates for pregnant women to be recognized as a vulnerable group during the current pandemic.

### Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: a case report [^116KiLsc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

AFLP is a disease of the third trimester that is unique to human pregnancy and was described by Sheehan in 1940. The condition was associated with high mortality rates but this has improved because of early diagnosis and prompt delivery of the foetus. The approximate incidence of AFLP is 1: 7,000 to 1:20,000. Conditions unique to pregnancy that cause liver dysfunction include intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome and AFLP. While intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and pre-eclampsia are frequently seen, AFLP is rare and potentially life-threatening. The pathogenesis of AFLP remains unclear but there is emerging evidence of the genetic basis of AFLP where defective mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation in the foetus is implicated in some cases of AFLP. We present a case where the diagnosis was delayed with subsequent poor outcome.

Preeclampsia — prevalence and delivery timing — is reported to affect 3%-8% of pregnancies and may be diagnosed in patients with preexisting hypertension if additional findings of worsening blood pressures, maternal organ dysfunction, or proteinuria are present. For preeclampsia without severe features, delivery is recommended at 37 weeks; however, delivery at 34 weeks is recommended with preeclampsia with severe features, and delivery for patients with eclampsia is as soon as possible after maternal stabilization, regardless of gestational age.

### Systemic and organ-specific immune-related manifestations of COVID-19 [^114StPk3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Immune-related manifestations are increasingly recognized conditions in patients with COVID-19, with around 3,000 cases reported worldwide comprising more than 70 different systemic and organ-specific disorders. Although the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is predominantly centred on the respiratory system, some patients can develop an abnormal inflammatory reaction involving extrapulmonary tissues. The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion. Additional studies are required to learn about the mechanisms involved in the development of these manifestations and apply that knowledge to achieve early diagnosis and the most suitable therapy.

### Abstract… [^1152LrNZ]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

1 A woman who experiences a primary episode of genital HSV during the third trimester and who has not completed seroconversion by the onset of labor has a 33 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 In contrast, a woman experiencing a secondary reactivation of HSV during the intrapartum period has approximately a 3 percent chance of transmitting the virus to her infant. 2 Of known infected infants, only 30 percent have mothers who had symptomatic HSV or a sexual partner with clinical infection. 3 Many neonatal infections occur because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus, usually after a primary episode of HSV infection.
3. 5 Transmission occurs from an HSV-2-positive partner and is often traced to asymptomatic shedding of virus. Symptomatic and asymptomatic primary genital HSV infections are associated with preterm labor and low-birth-weight infants.

6, 7 Because of the high prevalence of HSV among adults, physicians should be aware of the risk of a primary HSV infection in a pregnant woman and its potential consequences to the fetus. The diagnosis of neonatal HSV can be difficult initially. The presentation is nonspecific, with signs and symptoms such as irritability, lethargy, fever or failure to feed at about one week of age. Illustrative Case A male infant was born vaginally at 39 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 7 lb, 3 oz to a 35-year-old gravida 1 para 1 woman. The mother had an uncomplicated pregnancy and no known history of HSV infection. Rupture of membranes was spontaneous and labor was augmented. Delivery occurred approximately 20 hours after rupture of membranes. There was no intrapartum fever. The infant developed mild respiratory distress at delivery that resolved with bulb and orogastric suction and administration of free-flow oxygen. Apgar scores were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.

The newborn had a normal physical examination and an uncomplicated stay in the newborn nursery and was discharged home on the second day of life. The infant was brought to the emergency department the following day with a one-day history of poor breast-feeding, lethargy and an axillary temperature of 38. 7°C. The examination was significant for mild lethargy, mild jaundice and a few scattered petechiae on the chest. Sepsis work-up was done and the cerebrospinal fluid showed a white blood cell count of 2 per mm. He was found to have positive cultures for HSV-1 from multiple sites. His mother also had a positive culture for HSV-1 from a breast lesion. This case illustrates the nonspecificity of the signs and symptoms of an HSV infection in a neonate, the lack of a history of HSV in the mother and the often tragic outcome of this disease.

Diagnosis of HSV Infections The hallmark of primary episode genital HSV infections in adults is multiple painful vesicles in clusters on an inflamed surface. Associated symptoms may include pruritus, dysuria, vaginal discharge and tender regional lymphadenopathy. There is often a systemic prodrome of fever, malaise and myalgias one to two days before the appearance of lesions. Secondary episodes of genital herpes are similar, but they often are associated with fewer lesions and are unilateral on the genitals. The symptoms of secondary episodes are usually less severe with few systemic symptoms. A suspected genital HSV infection should be confirmed with a diagnostic test. Traditionally, this has been viral culture of vesicular fluid. Typically, it may take two to three days to receive a report. More rapid diagnosis may be obtained by direct immunofluorescent staining using fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to HSV.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^112mfMGv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### Extrapulmonary manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection [^113kKgyW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019, the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, has resulted in a global pandemic with unprecedented health, societal, and economic impact. The disease often manifests with flu-like symptoms and is dominated by pulmonary complications, but widely diverse clinical manifestations involving multiple organ systems can result. We posit that viral tropism and the aberrant host immune response mediate the protean findings and severity in this disease. In general, extrapulmonary manifestations are a harbinger of or contemporaneously associate with disease progression, but in the case of some extrapulmonary findings (gastrointestinal and dermatologic), may track with milder disease. The precise underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated, and additional immune phenotyping studies are warranted to reveal early correlates of disease outcomes and novel therapeutic targets.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: what to expect when your patient is expecting [^116W3bFs]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease

Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) (previously known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; NAFLD) is currently the most frequent chronic liver disease worldwide and includes a spectrum from simple steatosis to hepatocellular injury and fibrosis. The prevalence of MASLD in pregnancy has nearly tripled in the last decade and is independently associated with a higher incidence of hypertensive complications, post-partum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia HELLP syndrome, and preterm birth. Treatment in pregnancy mainly involves nutritional measures and physical activity.

Imaging can determine the presence of liver steatosis. PDFF-MRI is the most accurate biomarker, and the fibrosis can be estimated on transient elastography, US-, or MR-elastography. A differential diagnosis is made with AFLP using clinical-laboratory data and the absence of other findings connected with AFLP. Although the mechanisms by which MASLD favor adverse maternal and perinatal events are not well defined, the presence of MASLD warrants preconception counselling and management by specialized obstetricians.

2.2 Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy (Figure 3)

FIGURE 3
Summary of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy is a rare, pregnancy‐specific cause of acute liver failure. It is estimated to occur in 1:10 000 pregnancies. The condition typically presents in the third trimester as a maternal and fetal emergency requiring prompt recognition and management.

AFLP is caused by toxic infiltration of the hepatocytes by small fat droplets (also called microvesicular fat). On average, pregnant women present at 35–36 weeks of pregnancy with non‐specific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, and distension. The signs include those associated with hepatic failure (elevated liver transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, jaundice, encephalopathy, polyuria, polydipsia, acidosis and, in some cases, renal dysfunction, and pancreatitis). AFLP may also present in the early postpartum period.

Risk factors for AFLP include low body mass index, multiple gestation, younger and older maternal age, gestational hypertension with proteinuria (pre‐eclampsia), fetal growth restriction, and carrying a male fetus. AFLP is likely to have a multifactorial etiology. In some cases the pathogenesis is thought to be related to fatty acid oxidation disorders, leading to microvesicular fat deposition in maternal hepatocytes and subsequent hepatic dysfunction.

Diagnosis

AFLP is diagnosed with a combination of clinical features, laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging. Assessment should include maternal blood testing for bilirubin, uric acid, liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), glucose, uric acid, hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, ammonia, creatinine, prothrombin (PT), and partial thromboplastin times (PTT).

Maternal, fetal, and neonatal adverse outcomes associated with AFLP are listed in Table 3. The risk of maternal death is associated with higher levels of creatinine, lactate, PT, PTT, and encephalopathy.

TABLE 3
Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes with acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

A useful tool for establishing the diagnosis is the Swansea Criteria(Table 4) that has a high positive predictive value for AFLP. Liver biopsy is rarely required to aid diagnosis.

Differential diagnoses includes HELLP syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Table 5 outlines key differences between these disorders.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum controlled with rituximab [^113gcpaE]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case synopsis

A 24-year-old man presented with a 6-year history of widespread cutaneous ulcerations, including involvement of two-thirds of his face. The patient had been evaluated at multiple institutions with a working diagnosis of recalcitrant ulcerative and vegetative PG. At presentation to our facility, physical examination found vegetative plaques and ulcerations encompassing most of his face (Fig 1) and bilateral inguinal folds. The patient's attempts at pain control led to narcotic addiction, depression, and social anxiety.

Fig 1
Pyoderma gangrenosum. Extensive ulceration of the face with some involvement of the earlobe upon presentation to our clinic, despite being on 100 mg of prednisone daily for the past 6 years.

Search for underlying disease processes was negative. The patient denied any history of arthritis or joint disease, and no history of such conditions were found in his medical records. Chest radiographs and colonoscopies were unremarkable, and multiple laboratory tests were negative with nothing to suggest any underlying malignancy. We did not conduct genetic testing for possible genodermatoses, but he did have a negative family history of autoinflammatory conditions. Excisional biopsy found sheets of dermal neutrophils with areas of granulation tissue and reactive squamous proliferation (Fig 2). Cultures and direct immunofluorescence were negative. Given the findings on pathology, clinical presentation, and exclusion of other underlying disease processes, poorly controlled, severe PG was diagnosed.

### Hepatic disease and pregnancy: an overview of diagnosis and management [^112Zo8As]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide a review of the current literature on hepatic disease in pregnancy, outlining the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of major diseases in this category.

Design

A thorough review of expert analysis, case reports, and randomized clinical trials was used to assess current methods of managing the major diseases related to hepatic dysfunction in pregnancy. A review of bibliographies was also utilized.

Results

Hepatic disease complicates nearly 3% of all pregnancies and is a significant cause of morbidity during the gravid state. However, several diseases, including HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, acute cholestasis of pregnancy, ruptured liver hematoma, and preeclampsia, can be managed with successful outcomes for both the mother and fetus if diagnosed in early stages. Astute clinical judgment and laboratory evaluation of the patient is vital in the appropriate diagnosis of hepatic disease in pregnancy.

Conclusions

Early intervention and appropriate diagnosis can substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with hepatic derangements of pregnancy.
