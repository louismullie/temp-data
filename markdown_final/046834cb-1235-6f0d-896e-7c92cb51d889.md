## Question

What common causes of flatulence in outpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of flatulence in outpatient care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why flatulence is common in outpatient practice. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic groups, including functional disorders, dietary factors, malabsorption syndromes, medications, and organic diseases. Next, I will prioritize the most prevalent causes and quantify them where possible. After that, I should consider special populations and red flags that shift pretest probabilities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of common causes and outline a focused evaluation strategy with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and prevalence framing. Flatulence is a frequent outpatient complaint and often coexists with bloating, distension, and altered bowel habits; functional gastrointestinal disorders are the most common cause in primary care, affecting up to 40% of people at any given time, which explains why many patients present with gas-related symptoms without an organic lesion [^53e113f7] [^7fd0e584].

> I will now examine functional gastrointestinal disorders as the leading cause. Wait, let me verify the specific entities and their symptom profiles. Irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and chronic idiopathic constipation commonly feature flatulence alongside pain, bloating, and altered stool form; Rome IV conceptualizes these as disorders of gut–brain interaction with altered motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and microbial dysbiosis, which mechanistically explains gas symptoms and their chronicity [^53e113f7] [^7fd0e584].

> Next, I should review dietary contributors, because they are both common and modifiable. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for diet effects. Fermentable carbohydrates drive colonic gas production; a low-flatulogenic diet reduced gas evacuations by about 54% and flatulence severity by about 48% in a randomized trial, and fiber supplementation, especially psyllium, is effective for constipation but commonly causes flatulence, reinforcing the link between diet and gas symptoms [^6c9dce7b] [^0d5362ec] [^d1d80cc5].

> Let me consider carbohydrate malabsorption next, since it is a classic outpatient cause of flatulence. Lactose malabsorption is prevalent globally, with symptoms including flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea; breath testing remains pragmatic, though no single test is a perfect gold standard, and many patients with functional disorders report milk intolerance even when formal testing is negative, complicating interpretation and counseling [^626d1308] [^c005b5a5]. Fructose malabsorption is also increasingly recognized; in a referral cohort, 73% had a positive fructose breath test and symptom reproduction was common, though test positivity varies with load and patient selection, so I need to be cautious about overcalling it in everyone with gas [^4d0e4239].

> I should confirm medication-induced flatulence, because it is frequently overlooked. Lactulose for constipation causes gaseous distension and flatulence in about 20% of patients, and this is dose dependent, which matters when counseling on titration and alternatives [^5084bf30] [^2db2e67e] [^6880714a]. Metformin commonly causes gastrointestinal effects including flatulence, and acarbose/miglitol inhibit alpha-glucosidases, producing dose-related flatulence and soft stools; semaglutide and other GLP-1 agents also list flatulence among common adverse effects, so a careful medication reconciliation is essential [^0c1bc389] [^bd4058db] [^4455d03e]. Even potassium chloride and some antiretrovirals like tenofovir can cause flatulence, so I need to check OTC and prescription lists carefully [^75fa35cc] [^e1c7bcf2].

> But wait, what if the gas reflects small intestinal bacterial overgrowth rather than simple colonic fermentation. SIBO is associated with bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, yet symptoms alone are poor predictors of test positivity; breath testing has limitations and gold-standard aspiration is invasive, so I should reserve SIBO testing for patients with risk factors or refractory symptoms and avoid overattributing gas to SIBO in the absence of supportive testing or context [^1bfaf95a] [^6151813d] [^180c3a00].

> I need to check for organic diseases that can masquerade with flatulence. Celiac disease frequently presents with bloating and flatulence; population data show flatulence in about two-thirds of patients pre-diagnosis, and symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet, so nonresponsive or atypical gas symptoms warrant serologic screening in the right clinical context [^b182ce24] [^8230ee0b]. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency causes steatorrhea, weight loss, and flatulence due to fat maldigestion; I should consider it when gas coexists with oily stools or nutritional deficits, especially in patients with risk factors or poor response to dietary changes [^2675bd1c]. Inflammatory bowel disease and giardiasis can also present with flatulence as part of a broader symptom complex, so alarm features or travel and water exposure should prompt targeted testing [^d4f33ec8] [^a201fd58].

> Let me think about special populations where the pretest probabilities shift. In diabetes, gastrointestinal symptoms are highly prevalent, with flatulence reported by about one-third of patients, likely reflecting dysmotility and microbial changes; this should lower my threshold to evaluate for SIBO or dietary contributors in diabetic patients with gas [^878b237d]. In Parkinson's disease, SIBO prevalence is markedly elevated, so unexplained flatulence and bloating merit breath testing and consideration of rifaximin in confirmed cases, acknowledging recurrence is common and evidence quality varies [^f6ecfb71]. Post-infectious IBS is another context where flatulence persists beyond the acute episode, aligning with the broader IBS mechanism profile [^216a5ce1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing everyone with gas. I should double-check the evaluation approach. For most patients without alarm features, a careful history, medication review, and limited labs are sufficient; testing for celiac disease is reasonable in IBS-type presentations, and breath testing for lactose or fructose can be considered when symptoms are diet-linked and persistent, while SIBO testing is best reserved for appropriate risk contexts or refractory cases to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^7fd0e584] [^1bfaf95a].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchy of common causes, keeping frequencies in mind. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are the most common cause of flatulence in outpatient care, followed by dietary factors such as fermentable carbohydrates and fiber, then medication-induced gas, and finally carbohydrate malabsorption syndromes like lactose and fructose malabsorption; organic diseases such as celiac disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, SIBO, and infections are less prevalent but important to consider when red flags or risk factors are present [^53e113f7] [^6c9dce7b] [^0d5362ec] [^626d1308] [^2675bd1c] [^1bfaf95a].

> I should confirm the practical implications for management. Education on dietary modification, slow fiber titration with hydration, and medication review are first-line steps; for confirmed lactose or fructose malabsorption, targeted dietary restriction is reasonable; for persistent, refractory, or high-risk presentations, selective testing for celiac disease, SIBO, or EPI can be justified; and throughout, I need to screen for alarm features and reassess the diagnosis if symptoms evolve or fail to respond to appropriate therapy [^7fd0e584] [^0d5362ec] [^2675bd1c] [^1bfaf95a].

Flatulence in outpatients is most often due to **functional GI disorders** (IBS, functional dyspepsia, chronic constipation) [^53e113f7] and **dietary factors** (high-fiber foods, lactose/fructose malabsorption, carbonated drinks) [^6c9dce7b] [^4d0e4239]. Medications such as **lactulose**, **metformin**, **alpha-glucosidase inhibitors**, and **fiber supplements** are common drug-related causes [^5084bf30] [^0c1bc389] [^bd4058db] [^0d5362ec]. Less frequent causes include SIBO, celiac disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and GI infections (e.g. giardiasis) [^1bfaf95a] [^b182ce24] [^2675bd1c] [^a201fd58]. Evaluation should start with a focused history, medication review, and dietary assessment; testing is reserved for alarm features or refractory cases [^7fd0e584].

---

## Functional gastrointestinal disorders

Functional GI disorders are the **most common cause** of flatulence in outpatients, characterized by chronic or recurrent symptoms without identifiable structural disease [^53e113f7].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits with frequent flatulence [^0ccb1849].
- **Functional dyspepsia**: Upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, and early satiety with flatulence [^fd9a55ec].
- **Chronic idiopathic constipation**: Flatulence due to delayed transit and bacterial fermentation [^f2b20d7a].

---

## Dietary factors

Dietary intake is a **major contributor** to flatulence via fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by colonic bacteria [^6c9dce7b].

- **High-fiber foods**: Beans, lentils, cruciferous vegetables, and whole grains increase gas production [^6c9dce7b].
- **Lactose malabsorption**: Common worldwide, causing flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea [^626d1308].
- **Fructose malabsorption**: Increasingly recognized, especially with high-fructose corn syrup intake [^4d0e4239].
- **Carbonated beverages**: Directly increase intestinal gas and flatulence.

---

## Medications

Several commonly used medications cause **flatulence** via altered gut motility, fermentation, or osmotic effects.

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Laxatives | Lactulose, polyethylene glycol | Osmotic fermentation and increased gas [^5084bf30] [^2e56832c] |
| Antidiabetic agents | Metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (miglitol, acarbose) | Carbohydrate fermentation and osmotic effects [^0c1bc389] [^bd4058db] |
| Fiber supplements | Psyllium, inulin | Fermentation and gas production [^0d5362ec] [^29fec5cc] |
| Antiretrovirals | Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate | Gastrointestinal side effects including flatulence [^e1c7bcf2] |

---

## Malabsorption syndromes

Malabsorption leads to **increased intestinal fermentation** and flatulence.

- **Celiac disease**: Flatulence with diarrhea, bloating, and weight loss [^b182ce24].
- **Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency**: Steatorrhea, weight loss, and flatulence [^2675bd1c].
- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea [^1bfaf95a].

---

## Gastrointestinal infections

Certain infections cause **flatulence** with diarrhea and malabsorption.

- **Giardiasis**: Flatulence, diarrhea, and malabsorption [^a201fd58].
- **Bacterial overgrowth**: Post-infectious or structural causes leading to flatulence [^6151813d].

---

## Evaluation and management

A structured approach begins with a **focused history**, medication review, and dietary assessment [^7fd0e584]. Initial management is **empiric**, including dietary modification, medication adjustment, and symptom control. Testing is reserved for alarm features or refractory cases and may include breath tests, celiac serology, or stool studies [^7fd0e584].

---

Flatulence in outpatients is most often due to **functional disorders and diet**, with medications and malabsorption as important contributors. A **targeted history and empiric management** resolve most cases, reserving testing for refractory or alarm-feature presentations.

### Overlap between irritable bowel syndrome and common gastrointestinal diagnoses: a retrospective cohort study of 29, 553 outpatients in Germany [^0887fde9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

As early as 3000 years ago, Hippocrates described a patient with abdominal complaints, altered stool behavior, flatulence and urge to defecate. In 1892, Osler and Hurst described a "mucous colitis" with discharge of mucus (mucorhea), cellular debris, and "intestinal sand". The term "spastic colon" or "irritable colon" was used by Ryle in 1928 as well as Jordan and Kiefer in 1929, respectively, who described a musculo-neural disorder of the colon in 30% of gastroenterological outpatients with abdominal pain and impaired defecation. Various terms have since been used in the literature since then, however, the designation "irritable bowel syndrome" has become established in nowadays for the disease. According to the current S3 guideline, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) disease is present when all 3 items are met: (1) there are chronic symptoms, i.e. lasting longer than 3 months (e.g. abdominal pain, flatulence), which are referred to the intestine by the patient and the physician and are usually accompanied by changes in bowel movements; (2) the complaints should justify the patient seeking help and/or worrying about them and be so severe that the quality of life is relevantly impaired as a result; (3) there are no characteristic alterations for other clinical pictures which are probably responsible for these symptoms. Nevertheless, in many cases suspected for an IBS, complaints are less specific and it is difficult to decide whether an IBS or another disease is responsible for the patients' symptoms. It is therefore likely that the prevalence of IBS in Germany, reported at 1.34% in 2017, is overestimated given the current definition of IBS. In the present study, we analyzed the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of IBS who, within one year prior to the diagnosis of IBS, received a diagnosis of another gastrointestinal disease that is in principle capable of causing symptoms that also fit IBS and might therefore have precluded the diagnosis of IBS.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^3ed50ed1]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

A common issue in the literature is the lack of a consistent definition of chronic constipation. While formal diagnostic criteria exist for chronic (primary) constipation, the Rome IV criteria, there is disagreement on perceptions of what constipation is between patients and clinicians, as well as between such perceptions and the formal criteria. Multiple terminologies have been used to define chronic constipation in the literature, including primary constipation, idiopathic constipation, functional constipation, and evacuation disorders. The Guideline Steering Committee agreed that it was important that these dietary guidelines address the needs of most patients who commonly present and seek constipation treatment in clinical practice. For this reason, a broader definition of constipation was adopted, including those diagnosed based on widely recognized clinical diagnostic criteria (e.g. the Rome criteria), author‐defined or clinician‐defined criteria/diagnosis, participant‐defined criteria (e.g. self‐reported constipation), or the presence of at least one symptom indicative of constipation. Constipation secondary to medications or other conditions, as well as constipation‐related complications (e.g. fecal incontinence), was not covered in these guidelines; however, the recommendation statements could be applied in secondary constipation with caution and as clinically applicable.

Instead of the recommendation statements addressing the effect of dietary interventions in "constipation" in general, each statement referred to specific constipation outcomes, including response to treatment, stool frequency and consistency, global and specific gut symptoms, adverse events, and global and specific quality of life (QoL). This was in recognition of the highly diverse symptoms patients with constipation experience and the varied definitions clinicians and patients use to characterize constipation. In addition, while certain dietary interventions may improve one cardinal aspect of constipation (e.g. stool frequency), they may have no impact on another (e.g. straining), or they may even worsen another (e.g. flatulence). Therefore, an important strength of these guidelines is that by having outcome‐specific recommendation statements, clinicians can provide personalized dietary advice tailored to the patients' needs, symptoms, and concerns.

Treatment options

Current treatment options

Current laxatives aid defecation by decreasing stool consistency (softening) and/or artificially or indirectly stimulating colon motility, via one or more of a number of mechanisms (Table 3).

Table 3
Drugs commonly used in the treatment of constipation,

Well-designed, placebo-controlled, blinded, clinical trials of older laxatives are sparse. Although many trials report improvements in the number of bowel movements per week and some report improvements of certain symptoms, many studies are small and lack comprehensive clinically relevant treatment endpoints. Similarly, there is a lack of head-to-head comparisons; hence, there is a lack of evidence to determine whether one laxative class is superior to another. It is also largely unknown if laxative treatments address the impaired quality of life observed in patients with chronic constipation, as most studies have failed to assess quality of life measures. Indeed, for some patients, laxatives can worsen certain symptoms, such as bloating and flatulence.

### Do patients with lactose intolerance exhibit more frequent comorbidities than patients without lactose intolerance? An analysis of routine data from German medical practices [^c005b5a5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Therefore, these diagnoses can only partly be attributed to LI.

Since the present work was based on a routine data analysis, corresponding limitations of the data used must be clearly identified. Routine data were not explicitly collected with predefined questions in mind, and as a consequence, not all relevant information, such as lifestyle habits of the patients, was available. It must also be borne in mind that it could not be clearly ascertained which disease was the cause and which disease ultimately occurred as comorbidity. Furthermore, the validity of the data could not be guaranteed, since documentation varied between individual physicians.

The conclusions of the present study are twofold: LI is not to be regarded as an isolated illness, nor are the resulting diseases to be underestimated. Since this was a routine data analysis, no clear statement can be made with regard to the issue whether LI triggers other diseases. To aptly answer this question, further studies are required which involve monitoring LI patients over a longer period of time and simultaneously record their lifestyle habits.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Approximately 70% of the global population have lactase non-persistence
Affected persons complain of abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and osmotic diarrhea. However, non-specific symptoms such as headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, concentration problems, and muscle pain can also be attributed to lactose intolerance (LI)
Patients also often suffer from irritable bowel syndrome and other food intolerances, especially fructose malabsorption
These coincidences may be known from clinical expertise, but they have not yet been confirmed by analyses of large routine databases deriving from daily practice in outpatient care

What the new findings are:

On a population-based level, the study at hand showed significant correlations between LI and the incidence of osteoporosis and the presence of additional food intolerances
Furthermore, the present results demonstrated that depression and LI often occur together. To date, this issue has not yet been adequately addressed in scientific literature
The findings confirmed observational awareness based on clinical experience by obtaining insight from in-depth analyses of unbiased data within the expanding discipline of health services research

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults — lactulose after failure or intolerance of OTC therapies: Recommendation 4 states that in adults with CIC who fail or are intolerant to OTC therapies, the panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose. Implementation considerations indicate that bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

### AGA clinical practice update on the epidemiology, evaluation, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: expert review [^2675bd1c]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 3 — clinical features and differential diagnosis of EPI states that clinical features of EPI include steatorrhea with or without diarrhea, weight loss, bloating, excessive flatulence, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and protein-calorie malnutrition. The differential diagnosis for EPI is broad and multiple disorders may be present in the same patient, making diagnosis challenging, EPI-specific patient-reported outcome measures have been developed but cannot distinguish EPI from other causes of similar symptoms, and common diseases with overlapping symptoms include celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, long-standing diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease; less common causes include disaccharidase deficiencies, bile acid diarrhea, and infectious etiologies, such as giardiasis; these are most often suspected when a patient with EPI does not respond to PERT.

### Concomitant medications, functional foods, and supplements: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^566a2e67]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Common functional foods — weight effects and safety: The table states that "None of these products have been proven to induce and/or maintain clinically meaningful weight loss," that "none have been studied for safety with the level of rigor of FDA approved prescription medications," and that "none have undergone prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials with clinical trial outcomes evidence of improvement in major outcomes health benefits (e.g., reduction in cardiovascular disease or reduction in mortality)." Dietary fiber's reported weight loss is inconsistent and some patients may experience abdominal bloating or flatulence; prebiotics show some human studies suggesting minor weight loss but effects are most consistently reported in rodents with bloating and flatulence; probiotics have similar modest weight effects and are generally safe but carry a small risk of infection in at-risk individuals; caffeine-containing products have studies suggesting minor weight loss but high doses can cause anxiety, tremors, and cardiac dysrhythmias; green tea (not extract) has meta-analyses suggesting minor weight reduction and green tea extract is an important cause of liver injury.

### ACG clinical guideline: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^1bfaf95a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

SIBO symptoms and symptom-based diagnostic limitations — Evidence suggests that abdominal pain, bloating, gas, distension, flatulence, and diarrhea are the most common symptoms reported in patients with SIBO, with severe cases sometimes showing vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron deficiencies that are usually subtle or undetectable. However, in one study that compared symptom burden, Jacobs et al. compared 38 subjects with culture-positive SIBO to 74 subjects with culture-negative SIBO and reported no difference in the intensity, frequency, and duration of abdominal pain or in bloating, fullness, belching, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gas. Therefore, close attention should be paid not only to a patient's symptom profile but also to risk factors for SIBO and any history of previous attempts to treat other underlying conditions, when evaluating SIBO as a possible diagnosis in a patient presenting with unexplained abdominal pain, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and/or malabsorptive symptoms.

### American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: pharmacological management of chronic idiopathic constipation [^6880714a]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Lactulose — chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults who fail or are intolerant to over-the-counter (OTC) therapies: The panel suggests the use of lactulose over management without lactulose (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Two RCTs in elderly participants evaluated lactulose syrup, including a multicenter Netherlands study with 103 participants using an initial dose of 15 mL of 50% lactulose daily for 3 weeks, with dose reduced by half after 3 consecutive days with defecation, doubled if no defecation occurred for more than 48 hours, then reduced back to 15 mL after 3 consecutive days; a U.S. study included 55 participants who received 30 mL daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. Lactulose is approved by the FDA for constipation at 10–20 g (15–30 mL or 1–2 packets) daily and may be increased to 40 g (60 mL or 2–4 packets) daily if needed. Bloating and flatulence are dose-dependent and common side effects, which may limit its use in clinical practice.

### Effect of a low-flatulogenic diet in patients with flatulence and functional digestive symptoms [^6c9dce7b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diets rich in fermentable residues increase intestinal gas production. Our aim was to demonstrate the potential effects of diet on gas-related symptoms.

Methods

The effect of a low-flatulogenic test diet (restricted to foodstuffs low in fermentable residues; n = 15) was compared to that of a balanced control diet (Mediterranean type; n = 15) in 30 patients complaining of flatulence and other abdominal symptoms using a randomized parallel design. The following outcomes were measured daily: number of anal gas evacuations by an event marker, severity of gas-related symptoms by 0–10 scales, and sensation of digestive comfort by a -5 (unpleasant) to +5 (pleasant) scale. Measurements were taken pretreatment for 3 days on their habitual diet and for 7 days during the treatment phase.

Key Results

No pretreatment differences were detected between patients allocated to the control or test diets. The test diet significantly reduced the number of gas evacuations (by 54 ± 10%; p = 0.002 vs basal diet) whereas the control diet had a lesser effect (reduction by 28 ± 9%; p = 0.059 vs basal diet; p = 0.089 vs test diet). Compared to the control diet, the test diet significantly reduced flatulence (by 48 ± 7% vs 27 ± 8%, respectively; p = 0.018), abdominal distension (by 48 ± 4% vs 22 ± 12%, respectively; p = 0.038), and enhanced digestive well-being (by 149 ± 18% vs 58 ± 22%, respectively; p = 0.006).

Conclusions & Inferences

In patients with gas-related symptoms, a low-flatulogenic diet produces immediate beneficial effects with digestive, cognitive, and emotive dimensions. The number of gas evacuations is an objective biological marker of response to dietary treatment.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^f0c084b6]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) managing side effects — Patients taking PrEP should be informed of side effects among HIV-uninfected participants in clinical trials, in which side effects were uncommon and usually resolved within the first month of taking PrEP ("start-up syndrome"). Clinicians should discuss the use of over-the-counter medications for headache, nausea, and flatulence should they occur, and patients should also be counseled about signs or symptoms that indicate a need for urgent evaluation (e.g., those suggesting possible acute renal injury or acute HIV infection).

### Critical constipation [^810021e8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Constipation is a common emergency department (ED) chief complaint encompassing various gastrointestinal concerns. A focused history and physical should screen for dangerous mimics, dangerous causes, and dangerous complications. If red flags are absent, laboratory studies and abdominal imaging are generally unnecessary as functional constipation is a clinical diagnosis. Disimpaction with oral or enema therapy may start in the ED but requires outpatient therapy for success. Oral and enema therapies are safe, but emergency physicians should be aware of specific contraindications and potential adverse events before initiating.

### Miglitol [^bd4058db]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

The following information should be provided to patients:

Miglitol tablets should be taken orally three times a day at the start of each main meal. It is important to continue to adhere to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.
Miglitol tablets themselves do not cause hypoglycemia when administered to patients in the fasted state. Sulfonylurea drugs and insulin, however, can lower blood sugar levels and cause symptoms or life-threatening hypoglycemia. Because miglitol tablets given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood sugar, it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents. The risk of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be well understood by patients and responsible family members. Because miglitol tablets prevent the breakdown of table sugar, a source of glucose (dextrose, D-glucose) should be readily available to treat symptoms of low blood sugar when taking miglitol tablets in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.
If side effects occur with miglitol tablets, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy. They are most commonly mild-to-moderate dose-related gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, soft stools, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time. Discontinuation of drug usually results in rapid resolution of these gastrointestinal symptoms.

Physician Counseling Information for Patients

In initiating treatment for type 2 diabetes, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment. Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient. Proper dietary management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia. The importance of regular physical activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken where possible. Use of miglitol tablets or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint. Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of miglitol tablets or other antidiabetic medications. Maintenance or discontinuation of miglitol tablets or other antidiabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.

Laboratory Tests

Therapeutic response to miglitol tablets may be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^d4f33ec8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### What's new in Rome IV? [^666e2ee9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are the most common disorders seen in Gastroenterology clinical practice. The Rome process has generated consensus definitions of FGIDS, allowing to subdivide patients into diagnostic categories based on the symptom pattern. The Rome IV consensus, presented in 2016, is the most recent update of this diagnostic scheme. This article summarizes the main changes, which include the use of epidemiology-based symptom thresholds to define FGIDs, characterization of FGIDS as disorders of Gut-Brain interaction, and updates of criteria for esophageal disorders, irritable bowel syndrome and Biliary and Sphincter of Oddi disorders based on scientific and technical progress made over the last decade. The Rome IV consensus provides a standard for clinical and research approach to FGIDS for the coming years.

The term "small intestinal bacterial overgrowth" (SIBO) has been used to refer to a disorder resulting from the colonization of the small bowel by an increased number of microorganisms or by the presence of bacteria that are not usual constituents of this part of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical presentations, often in patients with certain risk factors, can range from a full-blown malabsorption syndrome to such "functional" complaints as bloating and flatulence. SIBO is diagnosed by either culture of a small bowel aspirate or one of several breath tests. Treatment of SIBO entails risk factor modification, correction of nutritional deficiencies, and oral antibiotics.

### A gluten-free diet effectively reduces symptoms and health care consumption in a Swedish celiac disease population [^b182ce24]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Symptoms

Pre-treatment, flatulence (64%) was the most commonly reported symptom, followed by fatigue (62%), soft stool (54%), and abdominal pain (53%). All investigated symptoms, except joint pain, improved after diagnosis and initiated treatment with a gluten-free diet (Figure 1). Today, flatulence and fatigue were also the most commonly reported symptoms for all participants, even those who did not report the symptom pre-treatment (Table 2). It was less common that participants without a specific symptom reported pre-treatment reported the symptom today than it was for participants who reported the symptom pre-treatment. There were improvements in all investigated symptoms in the screening-detected cases except joint pain and body pain. Due to too few cases, comparison between pre-treatment and today was not feasible for vomiting and hair loss in the screening-detected group. For recently diagnosed cases (2005–2009), all investigated symptoms except vomiting and hair loss, which were rare in our study population, improved after diagnosis. The only differences between recently diagnosed and those with an earlier CD diagnosis was that weight loss and vomiting were less common in the former pre-treatment, joint pain was more common for recently diagnosed cases pre-treatment, and nausea was less common for recently diagnosed cases today.

### Functional diarrhea [^d5ffe6b2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a frequent and challenging problem in clinical medicine. In a considerable subgroup of these, no underlying cause is identified and this is referred to as functional diarrhea. A consensus definition for functional diarrhea is based on loose stool consistency and chronicity and absence of coexisting irritable bowel syndrome. Underlying pathophysiology includes rapid intestinal transit, which may be worsened by stress or be triggered by a preceding infectious gastroenteritis. Diagnostic work-up aims at exclusion of underlying organic disease. Treatment starts with dietary adjustments, aiming at decreasing nutrients that enhance transit and stool and at identifying precipitating food items.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitor AZD0837 for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a randomized dose-guiding, safety, and tolerability study of four doses of AZD0837 vs. vitamin K antagonists [^f13e1c54]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Bleeding events

Bleeding events are summarized in Table 2. In the whole cohort, bleeding events were less common in the AZD0837 150 mg od, 300 mg od, and 200 mg bid dose groups and similar in the AZD0837 450 mg od group compared with the VKA group. In the VKA-naïve subgroup, there were fewer bleeding events at all doses of AZD0837 compared with VKA. Clinically relevant bleeding events (i.e. major and clinically relevant minor bleeding events) were numerically less common in the AZD0837 150 mg od and 300 mg od groups compared with the higher dose AZD0837 and VKA both in the whole cohort and in the VKA-naïve subgroup. Patients on aspirin < 100 mg/day as concomitant therapy had similar bleeding rates in the AZD0837 and VKA groups.

Table 2
Number (%) of patients with at least one bleeding event

Adverse events

The proportion of patients with AEs was similar between the different AZD0837 doses and the VKA group, as summarized in Table 3 along with discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs, and deaths.

Table 3
Number (%) of patients who had at least one adverse event with onset during treatment (safety population)

The most common AEs with AZD0837 treatment were gastrointestinal disorders (23 vs. 14% in the VKA group), such as diarrhoea, flatulence, or nausea. Diarrhoea and flatulence were more common in the AZD0837 groups compared with VKA, without any dose–response relationship, and nausea was as common as with VKA. The episodes of diarrhoea most commonly started soon after initiation of study treatment, lasted for 1–3 days, and were of mild intensity.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^b77c52a0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) issues — key concepts for GERD — include that regarding safety, we suggest that patients should be advised as follows: PPIs are the most effective medical treatment for GERD; available associations do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, high-quality studies have found that PPIs do not significantly increase the risk of any of these conditions except intestinal infections, and for GERD the well-established benefits of PPIs far outweigh their theoretical risks. Switching PPIs can be considered for patients who experience minor PPI side effects including headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence. For patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for bone disease, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of calcium or vitamin D or that they have routine monitoring of bone mineral density; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of vitamin B12 or that they have routine monitoring of serum B12 levels; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for kidney disease, we do not recommend that they have routine monitoring of serum creatinine levels. For patients with GERD on clopidogrel who have LA Grade C or D esophagitis whose GERD symptoms are not adequately controlled with alternative medical therapies, the highest quality available suggests that the established benefits of PPI treatment outweigh their proposed but highly questionable cardiovascular risks. PPIs can be used to treat GERD in patients with renal insufficiency with close monitoring of renal function or consultation with a nephrologist.

### Prevalence and clinical manifestations of giardia intestinalis and other intestinal parasites in children and adults in Algeria [^a201fd58]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Giardia intestinalis is one of the most common causes of parasite-induced diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and malabsorption. Yet, data on the epidemiology of G. intestinalis infections in North Africa are limited. The purpose of this study was to carry out a retrospective survey on the level of intestinal parasitism with a particular emphasis on G. intestinalis in children and adults in Algiers, Algeria. A total of 2,054 individuals from outpatient clinics or hospitalized at Beni-Messous University Hospital of Algiers undergoing stool microscopy for ova and parasites were included. The overall parasite infection rate was 28%. In the 567 parasite-positive samples, Blastocystis was found most frequently (57.3%), followed in frequency by Endolimax nana (41.0%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (19.6%), G. intestinalis (17.1%), Entamoeba coli (13.9%), Chilomastix mesnili (1.0%), Iodamoeba bütschlii (0.7%), Entamoeba hartmanni (0.5%), and Cryptosporidium spp. (0.2%). Intestinal parasites were generally more common in adults than in children, except for Giardia, which was more common in children (P = 0.0001). Giardia infection was independent of gender (P = 0.94). Compared with other intestinal parasitic infections, clinical manifestations, such as abdominal pain (P = 0.28) and diarrhea (P = 0.82), were found not to be significantly linked to Giardia infection. In conclusion, G. intestinalis is common in individuals referred to the University Hospital of Beni-Messous with digestive symptoms, particularly so in children. However, in our study, intestinal symptoms appeared not to be more linked to Giardia than to other intestinal parasites.

### Chronic constipation: new insights, better outcomes? [^f2b20d7a]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Constipation is a symptom that affects around 11–20% of the adult population yearly. Most physicians consider infrequency of defecation as a hallmark of constipation. However, most patients view excessive straining as the biggest component of constipation and only a minority of patients with constipation have infrequent bowel movements. Constipation might be due to many different medical conditions or occur as a side-effect of drug therapy. When these medical conditions or drug therapies are not present, a diagnosis of functional constipation, chronic idiopathic constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is often made. In all patients with constipation, rectal outlet dysfunction should be excluded by physical examination because this condition occurs in approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with idiopathic constipation and can be improved with different therapeutic approaches than administration of laxatives. Because of the availability of over-the-counter laxatives, most patients consider themselves able to self-manage constipation, and patients have often tried many different treatments before seeking professional help. The physician must carefully assess these previous efforts of self-treatment, optimise them, and strategically use the increasing list of prescription medications for management.

### Knowledge and practices of primary care physicians or general practitioners treating post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome [^216a5ce1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In our survey, physicians frequently prescribed a probiotic for therapy. This management approach is not consistent with current guidelines for practice. The American College of Gastroenterology guidelines give the following recommendation, "We suggest probiotics, taken as a group, to improve global symptoms, as well as bloating and flatulence in IBS patients. (Recommendation: weak; Quality of evidence: low)". Similarly, the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology states, "We suggest offering IBS patients probiotics to improve IBS symptoms (GRADE: Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence)". While these recommendations don't discourage use of probiotics, we are unsure why there is an observed practice variation between current practice guidelines and reported practice of this sample population. It is possible that patients are driving demand for probiotics based on their review and awareness of medical information from online sources and marketing. Most probiotics are OTC and, thus, it could be that while physicians did not recall them as often in the list of common medications they prescribe (as seen in our results for Table 2) physicians are supportive in recommending OTC probiotics for therapy when patients ask. In any case, given the lack of evidence for probiotics in the effectiveness of IBS therapy physicians may not be fully helping their patients to avoid the excess costs (most often out of pocket) associated with therapies that lack proven effectiveness.

Interestingly, the estimate that roughly 4 out of 10 patients who develop PI-IBS will continue to have symptoms throughout their life is an important observation. Reported literature have only followed up subjects for up to 8 years. To determine the prevalence of PI-IBS among Walkerton Health Study participants, 28.3% (n = 210) of patients enrolled into the PI-IBS cohort reported the condition after 2–3 years. At the 8-year follow-up, the overall prevalence within the cohort dropped to 15.4%, but over 50% of those diagnosed at year 2–3 were still symptomatic at year 8. These findings are consistent with the estimates given in this survey. While there exist no studies that have estimated the lifelong impact of PI-IBS, for some, IBS remains a chronic condition.

### A 21st century look at the spectrum of gastrointestinal motility disorders. what is dysmotility; what is functional? [^aa575b5e]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Taken together, the above examples indicate that physiology-based diagnosis has a substantial overlap with symptom-based diagnosis. Neither symptomatic treatment nor therapy aimed at restoring normal physiology has had much success. It is still uncertain if measurement of physiologic parameters facilitates the doctor-patient relationship, whether results are abnormal or normal. However, the addition of physiology parameters to the evaluation of therapeutic interventions aimed at symptom reduction in FGIDs can possibly facilitate the identification of subgroups with a higher probability of treatment success. Unfortunately, our experience from clinical trials in this area is that physiology testing usually disappears as a new drug moves from phase II to phase III trials. In the ideal situation, the development of measurement methods with better availability and standardization, like different ingestible capsules, will help us to merge physiology and symptoms regarding both diagnosis and treatment evaluation.

### Small-bowel aspiration during upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy: rao technique [^180c3a00]. VideoGIE (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intestinal dysbiosis is increasingly recognized as a common cause of GI symptoms. The adult GI tract has nearly 38 trillion bacteria, mostly in the colon. There are very few bacteria in the normal small bowel; if present in sufficient concentrations, however, bacteria can cause symptoms. Because of the variability in patient populations and methods used to establish a diagnosis, SIBO prevalence has been difficult to estimate. SIBO is defined as the presence of an abnormal number of bacteria in the small intestine, together with symptoms of flatulence, bloating, distension, and other unexplained symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and constipation.SIFO is defined as the presence of excess fungal organisms in the small bowel, together with the aforementioned unexplained GI symptoms.

The diagnosis of SIBO and SIFO has been challenging because patients with either positive or negative duodenal aspirate and/or breath testing report similar symptoms (ie, symptoms alone are poor predictors of SIBO). Consequently, SIBO diagnosis requires specialized testing (Table 1). Glucose breath test and lactulose breath test are generally used. However, the equipment for breath testing is not widely available, the amount of sugar substrates is controversial, and the test interpretation is not standardized and requires further validation. A recent North American consensus provided some useful recommendations.

Table 1
Small-bowel aspiration for SIBO

Today, most experts agree and the recent American College of Gastroenterology guidelines further endorsed that small-bowel aspiration is currently the best technique for identifying SIBO, although its limitations include invasiveness, cost, lack of standardization of aspiration and microbiological techniques, and need for collaboration with the microbiology laboratory. Here, we describe our technique of small-bowel aspiration to bridge the knowledge gap so that more endoscopists can adopt this technology and facilitate a proper diagnosis of SIBO.

### Constipation – modern laxative therapy [^59401936]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one third of the population in Western industrial countries suffers from constipation at least from time to time. Constipation may have somatopathic or functional causes. Furthermore, a great number of substances are known to cause medication-induced constipation, i.e. opioid-induced constipation is caused by linkage of the opioid to opioid receptors in the bowel and the central nerve system. Whenever possible, causal therapy should be undertaken. Patients in palliative care mostly suffer from chronic functional constipation. The treatment consists of basic measures and the application of laxatives. According to their mode of action, they are divided into bulk-forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, lubricating agents and others. Bulk-forming laxatives are not recommended for use in palliative care patients, for such patients are normally not able to take in the required amount of fluids. Osmotic laxatives are divided into (magnesium) salts, saccharine, alcohols and macrogols. Lactulose is the most popular saccharine laxative. Because of its side effects (flatulence, bloating and abdominal cramping), lactulose is not a laxative of our choice; instead, we prefer to give macrogol. Orally administered, macrogol is not metabolised and pH value and bowel flora remain unchanged. Macrogol hydrates hardened stools, increases stool volume, decreases the duration of colon passage and dilates the bowel wall that then triggers the defecation reflex. Even when given for some time, the effectiveness of macrogol will not decrease. Because of its high effectiveness and commonly good tolerance, macrogol has become the laxative of first choice in palliative care patients with all kinds of chronic constipation, if these patients are able to take in the necessary amount of fluids. From the general medical point of view, lubricating agents have become obsolete. In palliative care patients, however, they are still important laxatives for prophylactic treatment or therapy of constipation. Due to clinical experience, in palliative care a laxative ladder has proven successful.

The sensation of bloating, a common but poorly understood problem, is the subject of two papers in this issue. The first study showed that patients with bloating as their main complaint have delayed clearance of infused gas from the colon, while the second study showed that bloaters had impaired defecation. Together, these studies suggest that behavioral factors may be important in this important symptom complex and propose novel approaches to its treatment.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic: a cross-sectional study in north of iran [^878b237d]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), which involved in high cost of health care and low quality of life. The aim of this study to investigate the prevalence of GI symptoms in diabetic patients referred to the Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases Research Center (GLDRC), Guilan University of Medical Sciences (Rasht, Iran) using a validated questionnaire.

Methods

In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, 255 diabetic patients and 255 non-diabetic subjects were recruited. Participants were randomly selected. The questionnaire recorded GI symptoms among the study population.

Results

GI symptoms were reported in 91.4% of diabetic patients, and 42.1% of them were male. The common GI symptoms in diabetic patients were flatulence (33.0%), followed by retrosternal pain (14.9%), belching (13.7%), postprandial fullness (12.5%), and constipation (11.4%). Retrosternal pain, constipation, flatulence, loss of appetite, and abdominal distention were more prevalent in diabetic women than men.

Conclusions

DM is associated with high prevalence rate of upper and lower GI symptoms. This effect may be linked to gender and poor glycemic control in diabetic patients, but not to type and duration of diabetes.

### Acamprosate: safety and tolerability in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^6df2d92b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acamprosate, in conjunction with psychosocial treatment, has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients in multiple clinical trials. Data from 13 short-term (≤ 26 weeks) and long-term (≥ 48 weeks) clinical trials were analyzed to assess the safety and tolerability of acamprosate: 4234 patients were randomized to placebo (N = 1962), acamprosate 1332 mg/d (N = 440), 1998 mg/d (N = 1749), or 3000 mg/d (N = 83). Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 61% for acamprosate and 56% for placebo (P < 0.01). The majority of AEs in all groups were reported as transient and considered "mild" or "moderate" in severity, and discontinuation rates due to AEs were comparable. Most common AEs were diarrhea (16% acamprosate versus 10% placebo, P < 0.01) and flatulence (3% acamprosate versus 2% placebo, P < 0.01). Patients taking concomitant medications commonly used to treat alcohol dependence reported comparable AEs between placebo- and acamprosate-treated groups. Acamprosate was shown to be safe in patients with hepatic impairment. A dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal impairment. No clinically meaningful between-group differences were reported for clinical chemistry tests or vital sign parameters. This ad hoc analysis demonstrates that acamprosate can be used safely in alcohol-dependent patients, including those taking concomitant medications, or having renal or hepatic impairment.

SIBO

The clinical implications of SIBO have been a subject of heated debate in the gastroenterological literature for years. The very definition of SIBO — precisely what threshold of bacterial density constitutes "overgrowth" — as well as the optimal way to diagnose this, and how such a diagnosis relates to symptoms or indeed, responds to treatment, are all areas that continue to evolve. Originally formulated as potentially injurious colonization of the small bowel by colonic bacteria in high-risk patients with evidence of malabsorption, SIBO has since been invoked as a general cause of bloating in average-risk patients and those with functional GI disorders. Symptoms attributed to SIBO in addition to bloating are abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, and nutritional deficiencies. Several diseases or physiological changes are associated with SIBO, including PD, such as scleroderma or surgical alterations in GI anatomy. Although the etiology is multifactorial, small intestinal transit time has been shown to be delayed in SIBO and can occur even when gastric emptying time is normal.

Patients with PD are more than twice as likely to have SIBO than controls — with a prevalence as high as 55%. The presence of SIBO has also been shown to be associated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage and Unified PD rating score in PD. Unfortunately, the relationship between a positive SIBO test (most commonly lactulose and/or glucose breath tests) and GI symptoms has been understudied in PD. Furthermore, a prospective study by Fasano et alfound that 42.9% of patients with PD were SIBO-positive again 6 months after eradication.

Given the higher prevalence and pathophysiologic plausibility in this population, it is reasonable to test for SIBO in patients with symptomatic PD and treat if positive (typically with a 14-day course of rifaximin, which has been shown, albeit heterogeneously, to improve symptoms attributed to SIBO). In patients with recurrent symptoms after initial benefit, a discussion of the risks and benefits of retreatment with an additional course of antibiotics should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

1 Preface

1.1 Purpose of guidelines

The guidelines are directed at consultant gastroenterologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, specialist registrars in training and general practitioners, and refer specifically to adult not paediatric gastroenterology. Their purpose is to provide guidance on the best available methods of investigating symptoms of chronic diarrhoea. Given this broad symptom-based focus, the guidelines cover a wide range of gastroenterological conditions and are not intended as a comprehensive review of all aspects of the clinical conditions mentioned herein, but rather an attempt to rationalise the approach to investigation in the context of this common clinical scenario.

### The evolution of TIF: transoral incisionless fundoplication [^caf51cfa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Post procedure concerns

Postoperative care is similar to traditional fundoplication techniques. Patients will experience some substernal discomfort associated with irritation of the cura with or without hiatal repair. Shoulder discomfort associated with phrenic nerve irritation is common and resolves usually within a week. Some practitioners have opted to perform TIF 2.0 as an outpatient procedure but many observe the patient overnight. Risks include postoperative nausea, but patients are able to belch and vomit if necessary, although there is some risk to disruption of the fundoplication with heavy retching or vomiting. As discussed, postoperative dysphagia, bloat, gassiness, and flatulence is rare with the TIF 2.0 procedure; however, preoperative dysphagia may persist postoperatively. To moderate dysphagia, a graduated diet is prescribed. This consists of full liquids for 2 weeks, pureed foods for 1 week, soft foods for 1 week, and then a modified regular diet that avoids beef, chicken, bread, rice, and tortillas for a week. A regular diet is allowed in the 6th week. This is felt to improve esophageal muscular strength and peristaltic coordination in the postoperative period. Persistent dysphagia may be treated with bougie dilation as is typical with dysphagia due to reflux associated esophageal fibrosis.

More serious complications, including pleural effusion, mediastitis, abscess, and esophageal perforation, have been reported. Observation overnight for manifestations of these complications is reasonable, and if white blood cell counts greater than 15K, and or tachycardia over 105 beats per minute, contrast study is recommended. Either esophagram or computed tomography with gastrograffin contrast is helpful. If a leak cannot be demonstrated, it would be prudent to continue on intravenous antibiotics until these issues resolve or a leak declares. A review of the manufacturer and user database reveals that complications were more common in the first few years after introduction of TIF 2.0. Changes in technique, device design, and the overall level of experience with the device have demonstrated a downward trend in the incidence of these complications.

### Novel pharmacological therapies for management of chronic constipation [^29fec5cc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

FIBER AND BULK FORMING AGENTS

The fiber and bulking agents are the most similar agents to the physiological mechanisms of evacuation; fiber decreases colonic transit time, increases stool volume, decreases intracolonic pressure especially at rectal sigmoid that reduces patient discomfort, reduces bile salt concentration that implies a decrease of gut contractile activity, and produces changes in the colonic microbial mass favoring growth of the bacterial population.

There are different types of fiber, natural and synthetic; the most common among natural ones is wheat bran (20 g/d) and synthetic methylcellulose (4 g/d) through commercial preparations based on seeds, but the most used are psyllium derivatives (10 to 20 g/d). The appropriate dose should be achieved gradually, always taking care to ensure a plentiful water intake. The positive response to fiber may take 4 to 6 weeks, which is why it is advisable to maintain dietary fiber treatment for 1 to 2 months before considering treatment failure.

Some patients cannot tolerate fiber because of excessive bloating and gas production. Psyllium acts like a dietary fiber and undergoes the action of colonic bacteria, with the consequent development of meteorism, bloating, and flatulence. The synthetic agents such as methylcellulose and polycarbophil are not degraded by bacterial enzymes of the intestinal flora, thus avoiding the formation of gas.

A great advantage of these agents is the lack of systemic side effects and can be used for a long time. Contraindications for their use are intestinal obstruction and hypersensitivity and they should be avoided in acute abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, flatulence, bloating, and severe meteorism.

The few clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of psyllium have shown to be superior to placebo in improving the consistency and frequency of stools. Psyllium is recommended for the treatment of constipation, with level II evidence and grade B recommendation.

### A novel digital approach to describe real world outcomes among patients with constipation [^341b1886]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

For the daily surveys, participants were asked about bowel habits for the previous day, which were labeled into mutually exclusive categories of normal, irregular, constipated, or none of the above. All participants were also asked to rate on a 4-point severity scale symptom dimensions of bloating, hard stool, painful bowel movement, or difficulty passing stool. Those who reported Irregular or Constipated days were asked to rate five additional symptoms of incomplete bowel movements, periumbilical cramps, sub-umbilical cramps, flatulence and nausea. Finally, participants were also asked about medication use to manage constipation symptoms for the previous day. A list of common over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including stool-softeners, laxatives, suppositories, stool bulk, and fiber supplements was provided for the participant to label with binary Yes or No responses if the medication(s) were used. Daily survey questions on constipation severity and medication use were drawn from a bank of questions that had been used by Sanofi-Aventis for consumer-focused research. Participant days for which any medication was used was labeled a medication day (binary Yes or No) for that participant.

### Chronic constipation [^9e107348]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is a common disorder that affects approximately 20% of the population and significantly impacts an individual's quality of life. The diagnosis can be made using standard criteria, and in the absence of alarm signs or symptoms, a determination of the underlying etiology/etiologies should be undertaken. In many instances, these will be gleaned from the history and physical examination. Specialized diagnostic testing may be warranted after the failure of initial laxative trials. Many therapeutic classes of laxatives exist with recent analyses indicating that practicing physicians prefer to use over-the-counter therapies in lieu of more strongly evidence-based prescription pharmaceuticals.

### Comparison of outcomes twelve years after antireflux surgery or omeprazole maintenance therapy for reflux esophagitis [^b46c8cfd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

It is important to evaluate the long-term effects of therapies for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In a 12-year study, we compared the effects of therapy with omeprazole with those of antireflux surgery.

Methods

This open, parallel group study included 310 patients with esophagitis enrolled from outpatient clinics in Nordic countries. Of the 155 patients randomly assigned to each arm of the study, 154 received omeprazole (1 withdrew before therapy began), and 144 received surgery (11 withdrew before surgery). In patients who remained in remission after treatment, post-fundoplication complaints, other symptoms, and safety variables were assessed.

Results

Of the patients enrolled in the study, 71 who were given omeprazole (46%) and 53 treated with surgery (37%) were followed for a 12-year follow-up period. At this time point, 53% of patients who underwent surgery remained in continuous remission, compared with 45% of patients given omeprazole with a dose adjustment (P = 0.022) and 40% without dose adjustment (P = 0.002). In addition, 38% of surgical patients required a change in therapeutic strategy (eg, to medical therapy or another operation), compared with 15% of those on omeprazole. Heartburn and regurgitation were significantly more common in patients given omeprazole, whereas dysphagia, rectal flatulence, and the inability to belch or vomit were significantly more common in surgical patients. The therapies were otherwise well-tolerated.

Conclusions

As long-term therapeutic strategies for chronic GERD, surgery and omeprazole are effective and well-tolerated. Antireflux surgery is superior to omeprazole in controlling overall disease manifestations, but post-fundoplication complaints continue after surgery.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^bb917abc]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Development of Recommendation Statements

Recommendation statements were produced for constipation‐related outcomes that were decided to be "critical" by the Guideline Steering Committee (Table S2). Outcomes were converted into recommendation statements aggregated into five categories, as appropriate:
Treatment response (number of people benefiting from the intervention)
Stool output (stool frequency and consistency)
Gut symptoms (global and individual symptoms)
Adverse events (flatulence, bloating, abdominal pain/discomfort)
Quality of life (global and specific components).

Recommendation statements were generated based solely on the findings of the four systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta‐analysis. Statements were not generated for dietary interventions when only one study contributed to the meta‐analysis or for uncontrolled studies. This ensured that the recommendation statements were based on as robust evidence as possible. Recommendation statements were developed for:
overall dietary intervention types (i.e. "overall, fibre supplements… ", "overall, probiotics… "), when appropriate, and included all studies contributing to the meta‐analysis; and
specific types of the dietary interventions (e.g. psyllium fiber, specific probiotic species or strains), where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the subgroup meta‐analysis.

### Gene variants of the SLC2A5 gene encoding GLUT5, the major fructose transporter, do not contribute to clinical presentation of acquired fructose malabsorption [^9b7b8c8f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent causes for medical check-up in medical office and clinics as well. Pathophysiological mechanisms are numerous including infectious causes (viral, bacterial, parasitical), immunologically-related disorders (e.g. eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, coeliac disease, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease), intolerance towards nutrients or components (e.g. food-related allergies) and malabsorption syndromes of nutrients such as lactose and fructose as most common ones.

Malabsorption syndromes have rarely monogenic causes. Pathogenic mutations strongly affecting function of lactase or aldolase B as key enzymes for metabolizing lactose and fructose, respectively, are present in very few subjects. The overall majority of patients suffering from lactose- and fructose-related symptoms are caused multifactorially by hereditary, environmental, sociology-economic factors; in particular diet plays a major role. Lactose-related disorders had been widely studied for decades and have been comprehensively understood concerning its multi-factorial pathogenesis including genetic variants. In contrast, fructose-related disorders are not well understood. Notably, fructose-associated disorders have sharply increased over the last 2 decades strongly associated with increasing demand of fructose consumption in a variety of food. Incomplete intestinal absorption of fructose can lead to various symptoms in vulnerable subjects such as flatulence, diarrhea, bloating, nausea and pain. Routinely, diagnosis of fructose malabsorption syndrome is mainly performed by hydrogen breath test after ingestion of defined amount of fructose. Several studies demonstrated pathophysiological role of fructose transporters, in particular GLUT5, for the development of fructose-associated symptoms, although divergent results were reported. Mice experiments (either knockout or feeding models) highlighted a predominant role of slc2a5 gene (glut5) as major intestinal transporter for fructose and signaling molecule for the induction of down-stream acting genes encoding fructolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes. Furthermore, slc2a5 -mRNA was found to be regulated by age and presence of fructose in rat model. In human intestinal cell line models fructose was shown to positively regulate SLC2A5/GLUT5 expression by transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. However, ex vivo studies of human samples did not show differences in SLC2A5 -mRNA or GLUT5-protein content in intestinal biopsies from patients with fructose intolerance. In addition to GLUT5 in intestine, the glucose-transporter GLUT2 contributes to the hepatic uptake of fructose since GLUT5 is weakly expressed in liver. Very recently, several studies revealed potential regulatory role of GLUT5 for malignancy and proliferation of various tumor cells driven by high consumption of fructose as carbon source. Based on these recent observations, diagnostic and therapeutic potential of targeting this metabolic pathway has been started to be investigated. The only study addressing the role of gene variants of SLC2A5 /GLUT5 for the development of fructose malabsorption studied 8 patients suffering from isolated fructose malabsorption without finding any functionally relevant gene variant. Mutational analysis was performed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and in one index case by Sanger sequencing. In order to analyze potential role of SLC2A5 gene variants in a larger cohort, a genomic region comprising the complete coding region, adjacent introns and 700 bp of proximal promoter region of 35 subjects with acquired fructose malabsorption were comprehensively analyzed by Sanger sequencing.

### A comparison of diagnostic tests for lactose malabsorption – which one is the best? [^626d1308]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The population based prevalence of lactose malabsorption (LM) in Scandinavia is 2–8%. The prevalence of LM is in the same order in subjects with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) as in the general population, whereas perceived milk and lactose intolerance is reported by 30–67% of subjects with FGID. Dietary advice to subjects with FGID and to those with intolerance to milk and lactose relies on a valid and reliable diagnostic test for LM. Such a test is not available.

Lactose is an unabsorbable disaccharide hydrolysed by lactase (lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) in the intestinal brush border into galactose and glucose that are absorbed. LM is a failure to hydrolyse lactose. In adults the most common cause is a genetic defect with lack of intestinal lactase. The unabsorbed lactose is metabolised by colonic bacteria to produce gas (hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4)) and short chain fatty acids. Clinical manifestations of LM are abdominal pain/discomfort, borborygmi, bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea. In subjects with LM, symptoms depend on the amount of lactose. Most people with LM can, due to colonic adaptation to regular lactose ingestion, ingest up to 6–12 g lactose (120–240 mL milk) without developing symptoms.

Commonly used tests for the diagnosis of LM are based on an exaggerated increase in H2 and/or CH4 in the expired air after intake of lactose, or an inappropriate increase in serum glucose (s-glucose). Other tests are assessment of lactase activity in jejunal biopsies, a test for genetic defects, and registration of symptoms after intake of lactose. Recently, the Rome Consensus Conference published a review of the methodology and indications of H2-breath testing in gastrointestinal diseases. No "gold standard" is available for the diagnosis of LM and breath tests with measurement of volatile compounds and other gases (mainly CH4) were encouraged. There are few comparisons between the tests and no agreement upon which one is the best.

The aims of this study were to assess the agreement between commonly used diagnostic methods for LM (breath test, s-glucose and symptoms), describe the diagnostic properties of the methods and establish the best method and cut-off levels for clinical use.

Clinical Trial Experience

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of loperamide hydrochloride are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with loperamide hydrochloride were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.

The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^717dfbbc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Reflux symptoms and side effects among patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease at baseline, during treatment with PPIs, and after nissen fundoplication [^c5ecaa17]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are no prospective studies available on the behavior of extraesophageal and esophageal symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients without effective antireflux medication, receiving the most effective antireflux medication, and after laparoscopic fundoplication.

Methods

Extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms and treatment-related side effects were assessed in 60 patients while they were on no effective antireflux medication (three-week washout period), after three month of treatment with double-dose esomeprazole, and 3 months after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Esophageal and extraesophageal reflux symptoms, rectal flatulence, and bloating were analyzed with the visual analog scale. In addition, dysphagia, rectal flatulence, and bloating were recorded as none, mild, moderate, or severe.

Results

Both extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms decreased after treatment with esomeprazole and were further reduced after fundoplication. Dysphagia and flatulence did not increase from baseline after surgery. Bloating decreased both after treatment with esomeprazole and after fundoplication. In contrast, dysphagia and increased flatus were found more often after surgery than during treatment with esomeprazole. Dysphagia and rectal flatulence were less common during treatment with esomeprazole than at baseline or after surgery.

Conclusions

Both extraesophageal and esophageal reflux symptoms decreased after treatment with esomeprazole and were reduced further after fundoplication. Any treatment-related side effect was not increased after surgery when compared to baseline. However, compared to esomeprazole there was more dysphagia and flatulence after fundoplication.

### Gas, bloating, and belching: approach to evaluation and management [^7fd0e584]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Gas, bloating, and belching are associated with a variety of conditions but are most commonly caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders. These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e., test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation. Nonceliac sensitivities to gluten and other food components are increasingly recognized, but highly restrictive exclusion diets have insufficient evidence to support their routine use except in confirmed celiac disease.

### Donor human stool (Rebyota) [^6e394e0d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most commonly reported (≥ 3%) adverse reactions occurring in adults following a single dose of REBYOTA were abdominal pain, (8.9%), diarrhea (7.2%), abdominal distention (3.9%), flatulence (3.3%), and nausea (3.3%).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of REBYOTA was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-blind clinical studies (Study 1: NCT03244644 and Study 2: NCT02299570) and 3 open-label clinical studies (NCT01925417, NCT02589847, NCT03931941) conducted in the United States and Canada. A total of 978 adults 18 years of age and older with a history of 1 or more recurrences of Clostridioides difficile (CDI) infection and whose symptoms were controlled 24–72 hours post-antibiotic treatment were enrolled and received 1 or more doses of REBYOTA; 595 of whom received a single dose of REBYOTA. In the 2 randomized, double-blind clinical studies, 131 adults were originally randomized to receive placebo and 48 crossed over to receive an open-label dose of REBYOTA after additional CDI recurrence. Overall, across the 5 studies, the median age of participants was 64 years and 67.2% were female. The racial and ethnic distribution was as follows: 93.8% were white, and 2.4% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. No meaningful differences in demographic characteristics occurred across the treatment groups. Study 1 and Study 2 excluded individuals with celiac disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and chronic diarrhea. Individuals with these conditions were not excluded from one of the open-label studies (NCT03931941), and individuals with food allergies were not excluded from any of the 5 clinical studies.

### Clinical efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation for patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: a randomized, placebo-controlled clinic study [^57d9c61c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is induced by excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestine and is mainly accompanied with a myriad of gastrointestinal symptoms, including flatulence, dyspepsia, and diarrhea, it is associated with marked adverse effects on quality of life and elevated costs in health care expenditures. SIBO is a common and frequent problem in outpatient practice, especially in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Recently, multiple studies have confirmed that SIBO is correlated with irritable bowel syndrome, liver cirrhosis and small intestinal tumors, the presence of SIBO has influences on the progression and prognosis of the abovementioned diseases, both directly and indirectly. SIBO patients are often rescripted with antibiotics (i.e. rifaximin, norfloxacin, metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, etc.), nonetheless, the efficacy of norfloxacin is approximately 37.5%, and they cannot be used repeatedly for long periods of time. Beyond that, probiotics can be used to help restore the gut microbial ecosystem, with a curative effect with the antibiotic of 62.8%.

Recently, applying fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to gastrointestinal diseases has re-emerged and gained increasing attention from medical researchers. For years, FMT has been used as an effective treatment for CDI, as well as other recurrent or refractory gastrointestinal disease. It has been proposed as an effective therapy to restore the gut microbiota barrier by transplanting functional gut microbiota from healthy donors to patients. Compared to probiotics, FMT has more advantages for patients because the transplantation of fecal microbiota is an integral transplantation of intestinal microecology and is "an organ" that humans can truly share, with high safety which would not elicit immune response or rejection like other means of transplanted organ. A published systematic review demonstrated that FMT has the potential to treat ulcerative colitis. El-Salhy reported that FMT is a promising tool for managing IBS.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^0ccb1849]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Because there are no reliable biological or laboratory markers associated with the condition, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome(IBS) is based on patient descriptions of common symptoms such as abdominal pain accompanied by changes in stool form or frequency and associated symptoms such as bloating and distension. With the development and refinement of symptom-based criteria for the diagnosis of IBS, the traditional need for a negative diagnostic evaluation has been questioned. This article evaluates the diagnostic characteristics of various symptom-based criteria in routine clinical practice and reviews the data regarding the yield of the multiple commonly used diagnostic tests in patients with suspected IBS.

### Intestinal gas dynamics: mechanisms and clinical relevance [^5a808207]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with functional gut disorders, irritable bowel disease, and related syndromes frequently attribute their symptoms to intestinal gas. While patients are usually convinced of their interpretation, the doctor has few arguments to confirm or refute it, and in this context intestinal gas has become a myth. Studies of intestinal gas dynamics have demonstrated subtle dysfunctions in intestinal motility. Hopefully, extension of these studies may help both in the classification of patients complaining of gas symptoms based on pathophysiological mechanisms, and in identification of objective markers to test mechanistically oriented treatment options.

### Evaluation of abdominal gas by plain abdominal radiographs [^9153c4f1]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients with functional digestive symptoms, that is, without detectable organic disorders, frequently attribute their symptoms to excess abdominal gas. Indeed, gas‐related symptoms, such as abdominal distension, bloating, flatulence, and borborygmi, affect a large proportion of patients with functional gut disorders and constitute their most bothersome complaint.

The clinical value of plain abdominal radiographs for the investigation of abdominal symptoms has been studied in the setting of the emergency department, and despite that its clinical value is not clear, plain abdominal radiographs remain one of the most common radiological examinations performed in this setting,; indeed, a study from Switzerland reported that only 12% of plain abdominal radiographs performed in 1997 patients (2.2% of all patients admitted to the ER) were actually indicated. Correspondingly, an Italian study showed that plain abdominal radiographs were used in 38% of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain; the sensitivity for detecting acute disease was 28%. Likewise, plain abdominal radiographs were performed in 42% of patients presenting to the ER with constipation, and the findings had no significant effect on management.

In particular, the evaluation of patients with severe episodes of abdominal bloating and distension frequently includes plain abdominal radiographs; based on the subjective interpretation of the images, the symptoms in some patients are categorically attributed to excess of gas in the gut and are followed by sometimes drastic recommendations to reduce intestinal gas production. However, some studies objectively measuring intestinal gas content by means of abdominal CT in patients with functional gut disorders consistently found gas volumes within the normal range. To address this discrepancy, our aim was to determine the reliability of plain abdominal radiographs for the evaluation of abdominal gas content in patients with functional gas‐related symptoms. To this aim, we analyzed CT images obtained in previous studies in patients with functional gut disorders complaining of abdominal distension and compared the objective values of abdominal gas measured by CT to the subjective estimation of gas volumes from a plain AP projection of the same CT images by a cohort of physicians.

### Nocebo effects and influencing factors in the randomized clinical trials of chronic constipation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^44db9efd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Nocebo effects are unavoidable in randomized clinical trials. We aimed to assess the magnitude of nocebo effects and explore the influencing factors in chronic constipation.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to July 2022. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigating interventions in chronic constipation were included. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the proportion of adverse events (AEs) in placebo-treated participants and evaluated the effect of trial characteristics on nocebo effects.

Key Results

We identified 20,204 studies from the databases, of which 61 were included in the final analysis. The pooled placebo AE rate was 30.41%, and AE-related withdrawal rate was 1.53%. The most commonly reported AEs were headache (5.67%), diarrhea (4.45%), abdominal pain (3.98%), nasopharyngitis (3.39%), nausea (3.36%), and flatulence (2.95%). The placebo AE rate was lower in trials conducted in Asia compared to those in Europe, North America, and international trials. It was also lower in trials diagnosed by Rome III compared to clinician's opinion and Rome II. Additionally, the placebo AE rate was lower in single-center trials compared to multicenter trials, lower in 5-8weeks therapy compared to 9-12weeks therapy, lower in participants with FC compared to those with IBS-C and CC, lower in trials with 2 arms compared to 3 arms, and higher in trials with prokinetic drugs compared to secretagogues and laxatives.

Conclusions & Inferences

The placebo AE rate was 30.41% in patients with chronic constipation. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers take the nocebo effects into consideration when designing and conducting clinical trials and adopt specific measures to mitigate the negative influence of nocebo effects.

### Plausibility criteria for putative pathophysiological mechanisms in functional gastrointestinal disorders: a consensus of experts [^66941d41]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are extremely common conditions associated with a considerable personal, social and health economic burden. Managing FGIDs in clinical practice is challenging because of the uncertainty of symptom-based diagnosis, the high frequency of overlap between these conditions and the limited efficacy of available therapies. It has often been argued that successful drug development and management of FGIDs requires knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Numerous and highly variable candidate pathophysiological mechanisms have been implicated in the generation of FGID symptoms, but there is no current consensus on how to best define the relevance of these disturbances.

Methods

A group of international experts on FGIDs developed plausibility criteria that should be fulfilled by relevant pathophysiological mechanisms in FGIDs.

Results

Five criteria are proposed: (1) the presence of the abnormality in a subset of patients, (2) temporal association between proposed mechanism and symptom(s), (3) correlation between the level of impairment of the mechanism and symptom(s), (4) induction of the symptom(s) by provoking the pathophysiological abnormality in healthy subjects and (5) treatment response by a therapy specifically correcting the underlying disorder or congruent natural history of symptoms and dysfunction in the absence of specific therapy. Based on strength of evidence for these five criteria according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, a plausibility score can be calculated for each mechanism.

Conclusion

Evaluation of the strength of evidence for candidate pathophysiological abnormalities fulfilling these five plausibility criteria will help to identify the most relevant mechanisms to target for novel diagnostic approaches and for the development of new therapies.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^37b6d84b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

### Antispasmodics for chronic abdominal pain: analysis of north American treatment options [^bc76ffe6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom prompting an office-based outpatient or emergency department visit in the United States. Functional GI disorders, now more formally described as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), are the underlying cause of abdominal pain in many patients. IBS is a chronic disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain associated with disordered bowel habits. According to Rome IV criteria, the diagnosis of IBS requires patients to have abdominal pain ≥ 1 day per week in the previous 3 months. FD is also a pain-predominant disorder. Rome IV diagnostic criteria for FD require patients to present with bothersome epigastric pain (≥ 1 day per week), epigastric burning (≥ 1 day per week), postprandial fullness (≥ 3 days per week), or early satiation (≥ 3 days per week) during the previous 3 months. Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome is characterized by persistent abdominal pain that interferes with daily activities; it is not associated with altered bowel habits.

Table 3 shows the frequency of reported symptoms/CD-associated medical conditions after diagnosis in the 2015 survey. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported experiencing symptoms/CD-associated medical conditions after diagnosis. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain/bloating (35%), diarrhoea (33%), joint pain (29%), and flatulence (28%). Thirty-two percent of respondents reported at least 4 symptoms/CD-associated medical conditions, and 19% reported no symptoms/CD-associated medical conditions after diagnosis. Comparable information was not collected in the 2006 Survey.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders: advances in understanding and management [^53e113f7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are highly prevalent, but many people who have them will have no organic explanation for their symptoms. Most of these people will be labelled as having a functional gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, or functional constipation. These conditions affect up to 40% of people at any one point in time, and two-thirds of these people will have chronic, fluctuating symptoms. The pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders is complex, but involves bidirectional dysregulation of gut-brain interaction (via the gut-brain axis), as well as microbial dysbiosis within the gut, altered mucosal immune function, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Hence, nomenclature refers to the conditions as disorders of gut-brain interaction. Psychological comorbidity is common; however, whether or not this predates, or is driven by, symptoms is not clear. Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders can feel stigmatised, and often this diagnosis is not communicated effectively by physicians, nor is education provided. Prompt identification and treatment of these conditions is crucial as they have a considerable impact on health-care systems and society as a whole because of repeated consultations, unnecessary investigations and surgeries, prescriptions and over-the-counter medicine use, and impaired health-related quality of life and ability to work. Symptom-based criteria are used to make a diagnosis, with judicious use of limited investigations in some patients. The general principles of treatment are based on a biopsychosocial understanding and involve management of physical symptoms and, if present, psychological comorbidity. In the future, treatment approaches to functional gastrointestinal disorders are likely to become more personalised, based not only on symptoms but also underlying pathophysiology and psychology.

### Fructose intolerance: an under-recognized problem [^4d0e4239]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although the role of lactose intolerance in the pathogenesis of abdominal symptoms is well known, the role of fructose intolerance is unclear. Our aims were 1) to examine the prevalence of fructose intolerance in patients with unexplained abdominal symptoms, and 2) to explore whether fructose concentration influences fructose breath test.

Methods

Over 2 yr, patients with unexplained symptoms answered questionnaires and underwent fructose breath tests. Patients received 50 g fructose in 150 mL water (33% solution). Breath samples were collected for hydrogen and methane. In a second study, breath test was performed after giving either 10%, 20%, or 33% fructose solution. Data were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

A total of 183 patients (50 male, 133 female) had breath tests, of whom 134 (73%) were positive. Among these, 119 (89%) had elevated H(2), and 15 (11%) had elevated CH(4) or both gases. Questionnaires showed that flatus (83%), pain (80%), bloating (78%), belching (70%), and altered bowel habit (65%) were the most common symptoms. Breath test reproduced symptoms in 101 patients (75%). In the second study, 14/36 (39%) tested positive with a 10% solution, 23/33 (70%) with a 20% solution, and 16/20 (80%) with a 33% solution (10% versus 20% or 33%, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Fructose intolerance may cause unexplained GI symptoms. The higher yield of positive tests in our initial study may be due to referral bias or testing conditions; lower test dose produced a lower yield. Nonetheless, recognition and treatment of fructose intolerance may help many patients.

### Pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia [^fd9a55ec]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a symptom complex characterised by postprandial upper abdominal discomfort or pain, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, bloating, and anorexia in the absence of organic disease. Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, altered visceral sensation, and psychosocial factors have all been identified as major pathophysiological mechanisms. This perspective has now replaced the earlier view that the condition was the result of a sole motor or sensory disorder of the stomach. Future therapeutic strategies should be aimed at reducing nociception as well as enhancing the accommodation response.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in children: an expert review by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^6de39fa5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarize the prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatments currently available for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in children. SIBO is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of an excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel leading to several nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms due to malabsorption and malnutrition, such as bloating, flatulence, belching, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, steatorrhea, fatigue and stunted growth. Initially thought to develop specifically in the context of abnormal or postsurgical gastrointestinal anatomy, it has then been recognized that it can be associated with other nonsurgical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysmotility, disorders of gut-brain interactions and chronic use of drugs. The uncertainty regarding the exact cut-off of excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel has led to the absence of a universally accepted definition of SIBO making well-designed research to assess the best diagnostic and therapeutic approaches challenging. Current available diagnostic tools includes duodenal/jejunal aspirate with culture and hydrogen breath tests, which all have some limitations and pitfalls that prevent accurate sampling. The treatment goal should be to treat the underlying causes, restore the healthy intestinal microflora, relieve the symptoms and address the associated complications. The use of antibiotics represents the treatment cornerstore. However, they are commonly used despite the scarce published evidence and the absence of agreement on the dose and duration of the treatment. Currently, data on best diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in children remain lacking. Novel diagnostic approaches for SIBO are emerging and may facilitate further research.

### Bloating and abdominal distension: old misconceptions and current knowledge [^0920dbe1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloating, as a symptom and abdominal distension, as a sign, are both common functional-type complaints and challenging to manage effectively. Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.
