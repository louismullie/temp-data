## Question

Tacrolimus ointment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tacrolimus ointment for atopic dermatitis, including mechanism, indications, dosing, safety, special populations, off-label uses, and how to counsel patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the FDA-approved indication and age-based strengths. Next, I will review efficacy data versus vehicle, corticosteroids, and pimecrolimus. After that, I need to examine safety, including the boxed warning and malignancy concerns. I will then consider special populations, off-label dermatologic uses, and practical counseling points. Finally, I should integrate guideline recommendations and synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and mechanism. Tacrolimus is a topical calcineurin inhibitor that blocks dephosphorylation of NFAT, thereby suppressing T-cell activation and cytokine release; importantly, it does not cause corticosteroid-induced dermal atrophy, which is a key advantage over topical steroids in sensitive skin areas [^116XAUDk] [^1113V5dd].

> I need to verify the FDA-approved indication and labeled strengths. Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% and 0.1% are indicated as second-line therapy for short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised patients who have failed or cannot tolerate other topical prescriptions; only 0.03% is approved for children aged 2 to 15 years, and use under 2 years is not recommended [^116wTUQv] [^116KSQsK].

> Next, I should review efficacy versus vehicle. In phase 3 randomized trials, both 0.03% and 0.1% were superior to vehicle, with 0.1% showing higher response rates; for example, approximately 27.5% with 0.03% and 36.8% with 0.1% achieved at least 90% improvement by physician global assessment versus 6.6% with vehicle, with onset often within the first week of therapy [^113FcRq3] [^117NFj8v].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroid comparisons; I should double-check potency and head-to-head data. Tacrolimus 0.1% has efficacy comparable to medium-potency corticosteroids and is superior to low-potency agents; in a 6-month randomized study versus a hydrocortisone butyrate regimen, 0.1% tacrolimus achieved higher response rates, and in shorter trials versus hydrocortisone acetate, tacrolimus outperformed low-potency steroid comparators, with 0.1% generally outperforming 0.03% in adults with more severe disease [^116Jyqvr] [^112FTJcz] [^113hhrHU] [^117NFj8v].

> I will now examine comparisons with pimecrolimus. Multiple randomized studies and meta-analyses indicate tacrolimus 0.1% is more effective than pimecrolimus 1% cream, with faster onset and greater EASI reductions; for example, mean EASI reductions around 54% with tacrolimus versus 35% with pimecrolimus in adults, and similar superiority signals in pediatric cohorts [^113FcRq3] [^113Ch5ce].

> Let me consider proactive therapy and long-term control. Intermittent maintenance with tacrolimus (for example, twice or three times weekly to previously involved sites) significantly prolongs time to relapse and increases flare-free days compared with vehicle in stabilized patients, supporting a proactive, steroid-sparing strategy after induction of clearance [^111tJBgH] [^114QdGcr].

> Now, I should review safety and tolerability. The most common adverse effects are transient application-site burning and pruritus, typically peaking in the first week and diminishing with continued use; systemic absorption is minimal in most patients, with blood levels generally below quantification limits, though higher absorption can occur with barrier defects or occlusion [^111TXDSg] [^114dftaM] [^116E3a1L].

> Wait, let me verify the malignancy signal and boxed warning. The FDA boxed warning reflects a theoretical risk extrapolated from systemic calcineurin inhibitor use and animal data; however, large clinical programs and observational reviews have not demonstrated a causal increase in lymphoma or skin cancer with topical use, and expert guidelines increasingly view the absolute risk as low and likely not clinically meaningful, though continuous long-term use should still be avoided per labeling [^1169SipV] [^11329WHs] [^115gQtef].

> I should confirm special population considerations. In pediatrics, 0.03% is the approved strength for ages 2 to 15, with evidence of sustained efficacy and acceptable safety in long-term pediatric studies; use under 2 years remains off-label and not recommended by FDA, though some guidelines acknowledge occasional use in infants when alternatives are unsuitable, which requires careful risk–benefit discussion and monitoring [^112FMEdP] [^113bdGgp] [^116UcDUZ].

> Let me think about off-label dermatologic uses. Tacrolimus 0.1% is effective for facial and intertriginous psoriasis as a steroid-sparing agent, with randomized data showing approximately 65% clear or almost clear responses at 8 weeks versus 31% with vehicle; it is also recommended for facial vitiligo and has supportive data in lichen sclerosus, while evidence for alopecia areata is limited and generally negative [^115YjwhW] [^11432nmT] [^116tjhEN] [^114yKoxf] [^112QrFBw].

> Next, I should review practical counseling and administration. Apply a thin layer twice daily to affected areas until clearance, then stop or transition to intermittent maintenance; avoid continuous long-term use, minimize application to involved skin only, and avoid occlusion; common burning can be mitigated by avoiding application immediately after bathing and by using moisturizers after application; if there is no improvement in 6 weeks, reassess the diagnosis and consider alternatives [^116E3a1L] [^111H7dur].

> I need to ensure I address contraindications and precautions. Tacrolimus is contraindicated in hypersensitivity and should be avoided in generalized erythroderma, Netherton syndrome, or other barrier-defect states with risk of increased absorption; active bacterial or viral skin infections should be treated before initiation; rare eczema herpeticum has been reported in pediatric cohorts, so new vesicular or crusted eruptions warrant evaluation [^114i4um5] [^114dftaM] [^112FMEdP].

> But wait, what about cost and access considerations. Tacrolimus is generally more expensive than generic topical corticosteroids, yet economic evaluations suggest comparable or favorable cost-effectiveness in some settings, particularly when steroid-sparing strategies reduce adverse effects and secondary costs; payer policies and prior authorizations may still create barriers in practice [^113PnG5V] [^11168XPb].

> Let me synthesize guideline positioning to anchor clinical decisions. Contemporary AAD guidelines strongly recommend tacrolimus as a treatment option for adults with AD and endorse its role as a steroid-sparing agent, including for sensitive areas; European guidance similarly supports first-line TCI use at sensitive sites and for long-term management, reflecting evolving confidence in benefit–risk balance [^114TyC2C] [^111VwZEX] [^116UcDUZ].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with evidence and labeling. Tacrolimus ointment is a well-established, effective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, with the most robust data for 0.1% in adults and 0.03% in children aged 2 to 15; transient local burning is common but manageable, systemic absorption is minimal under usual use, and long-term malignancy risk remains theoretical rather than proven, supporting its role as a steroid-sparing therapy and in proactive maintenance regimens when used intermittently and judiciously [^116wTUQv] [^113FcRq3] [^11329WHs].

Tacrolimus ointment is a **topical calcineurin inhibitor** for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, especially on sensitive skin areas (face, eyelids, intertriginous sites) and as a steroid-sparing option [^114TyC2C] [^116UcDUZ]. It is available as 0.03% (ages 2–15) and 0.1% (≥ 16 years) formulations, applied thinly twice daily until clearance, then intermittently to prevent flares [^112bVFyg] [^111tJBgH]. Common adverse effects are transient burning/itching; rare malignancy reports exist, but long-term studies show no increased cancer risk, though the boxed warning remains [^1169SipV] [^114GvX7P] [^115gtqnE]. It is contraindicated in hypersensitivity and in children < 2 years; use caution in immunocompromised patients and avoid continuous long-term use [^114i4um5] [^112FMEdP] [^1169SipV].

---

## Mechanism of action

Tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin, **reducing T-cell cytokines** (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5) and mast cell mediators, thereby suppressing inflammation and pruritus without causing skin atrophy [^1113V5dd] [^116XAUDk].

---

## Clinical indications

- **Primary indication**: Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as second-line therapy when steroids are inadequate or inadvisable [^116wTUQv] [^116UcDUZ].

- **Sensitive areas**: Face, eyelids, and intertriginous regions due to low atrophy risk [^111ee4uC].

- **Off-label uses**: Facial/intertriginous psoriasis, vitiligo, lichen sclerosus, and seborrheic dermatitis [^11432nmT] [^116tjhEN] [^114yKoxf] [^11126TZA].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Formulation** | **Indication** | **Application** |
|-|-|-|
| 0.03% ointment | Ages 2–15 years | Thin layer twice daily until clearance; then intermittent maintenance [^112bVFyg] [^111tJBgH] |
| 0.1% ointment | ≥ 16 years | Thin layer twice daily until clearance; then intermittent maintenance [^116E3a1L] [^111tJBgH] |

---

Application instructions include using the **minimum amount** to cover lesions, avoiding occlusion, and applying moisturizers after tacrolimus; if there is no improvement in 6 weeks, reassess the diagnosis [^116E3a1L] [^111H7dur].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Short-term**: Rapid improvement in erythema, pruritus, and sleep within days; superior to vehicle and comparable to medium-potency steroids [^117NFj8v] [^113FcRq3].

- **Long-term**: Sustained control and reduced flares with intermittent use; proactive twice-weekly maintenance delays relapse [^114GvX7P] [^114QdGcr].

- **Versus pimecrolimus**: Greater efficacy with faster onset and similar safety [^113Ch5ce] [^113FcRq3].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common effects**: Transient burning, stinging, pruritus, erythema, and warmth, typically resolving with continued use [^111TXDSg] [^114dftaM].

- **Serious effects**: Rare infections (eczema herpeticum, cellulitis) and rare malignancy reports (skin cancer, lymphoma); no causal link established [^1169SipV] [^112FMEdP].

- **Systemic absorption**: Minimal; avoid use on large areas, with occlusion, or in barrier defects (e.g. Netherton syndrome) [^114iU6dU] [^114dftaM] [^112bVFyg].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to tacrolimus** or components and use in children under 2 years [^114i4um5]. Precautions include use in immunocompromised patients, avoidance of continuous long-term use, and caution in pregnancy/lactation due to limited data [^1169SipV] [^115GWMR4].

---

## Long-term safety and cancer risk

Long-term studies show sustained efficacy without increased malignancy or systemic immunosuppression; the **boxed warning remains** based on theoretical risk rather than established causality [^114GvX7P] [^115gtqnE] [^115zps5H] [^114gKx1r].

---

## Patient counseling and education

- **Application**: Use the minimum amount, avoid eyes/mucosa, and apply moisturizers after [^111H7dur].

- **Expectations**: Transient burning/itching is common and improves with use [^114dftaM].

- **Monitoring**: Report infections, worsening symptoms, or lack of response by 6 weeks [^116E3a1L].

- **Sun protection**: Minimize sun exposure and use sunscreen [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other topical treatments

| **Attribute** | **Tacrolimus ointment** | **Topical corticosteroids** | **Pimecrolimus cream** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | High; comparable to medium-potency steroids | High; risk of atrophy | Moderate; milder disease |
| Safety | No atrophy; minimal systemic absorption | Atrophy, striae, telangiectasia | Similar; less burning |
| Use | Sensitive areas, steroid-sparing | First-line flares | Mild disease, maintenance |

---

Tacrolimus ointment is effective and well tolerated for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, especially on sensitive skin and as a steroid-sparing agent. It provides rapid symptom relief and sustained control with intermittent use, with a favorable long-term safety profile despite a precautionary boxed warning [^114TyC2C] [^116UcDUZ].

### The efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment: a clinical review [^114nmVHG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical tacrolimus ointment was approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in Japan in 1999, the United States in 2000, and Europe in 2001. The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment was established in vehicle-controlled, randomized, 12-week clinical trials; 1-year open-label trials; and comparative studies with topical steroids. Although an extensive database exists on the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment based on the global development program, clinicians desire additional information on the long-term safety and efficacy of this novel agent. In this supplement, additional studies are reported that extend the safety and efficacy profile of tacrolimus ointment in patients with atopic dermatitis, including long-term safety studies for up to 4 years. The studies presented in this supplement address important questions regarding the selection and use of tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis.

### A 4-year follow-up study of atopic dermatitis therapy with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in children and adult patients [^114GvX7P]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

For the treatment of a chronic disease like atopic dermatitis, sustained tolerability and efficacy of the applied medication are essential.

Objectives

The present open-label, noncomparative study was conducted to obtain information on the long-term safety and efficacy of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment.

Methods

Patients aged 2 years or older with an affected body surface area of more than 5%, who previously participated in a clinical trial on tacrolimus ointment, were eligible for this study. The treatment area was defined by the investigator at study entry. Both children and adults applied continuously or intermittently 0.1% tacrolimus ointment twice daily during episodes of active disease plus an additional week after remission over a follow-up period of up to 4 years.

Results

The intent-to-treat population comprised 782 patients, with a median age of 22 years (range 2–72). Patients remained in the study for up to 4 years. Approximately half of the patients discontinued the study prematurely; the median follow-up was 1422 days. Median tacrolimus ointment use was 31.2 g during the first week; ointment use decreased during the first year and then remained stable for the remainder of the study. The median cumulative tacrolimus use was 271.5 g at month 6, 462.5 g at month 12, 739.9 g at month 24, 1029.3 g at month 36 and 1320.8 g at month 48. Altogether 51.8% of patients discontinued the study prematurely; the main reasons were withdrawal of consent (13.3%), loss to follow-up (11.3%) and lack of efficacy (9.4%). Adverse events led to study discontinuation in 3.7% of the patients. The most frequent application site events were skin burning and pruritus. These events were most often reported in adult patients during the initial treatment period; prevalence decreased after the first week and remained at a low level throughout the study. Nonapplication site events occurred with stable incidences throughout the study period. In general, calculated daily hazard rates did not indicate an increased risk of adverse events with prolonged treatment. The total affected body surface area decreased substantially upon onset of treatment and efficacy of treatment was maintained until the end of the study with smaller but continuous improvements throughout the follow-up period. Overall, 75% of the patients and 76% of the investigators rated their satisfaction with the treatment as excellent, very good or good at the end of the study or at the time of premature discontinuation.

Conclusions

The safety profile of intermittent or continuous long-term application of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for up to 4 years was consistent with that which has been established from shorter studies and gave no reason for concern. In addition, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment demonstrated sustained efficacy as reflected by the expression of high satisfaction with treatment by both patients and investigators.

### A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of long-term treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [^116Jyqvr]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatis (AD) is a chronic disease that often requires long-term treatment. Topical corticosteroids are the usual therapy for patients with AD, but prolonged usage can result in skin atrophy and other side-effects.

Objectives

In a randomized, double-blind, comparative study, to compare the efficacy and safety of a 6-month treatment period with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment vs. a corticosteroid ointment regimen in adults with moderate to severe AD.

Methods

Treatment was applied twice daily for a maximum of 6 months. Patients in the tacrolimus treatment group (n = 487) applied 0.1% tacrolimus ointment to all affected areas over the whole body. The patients treated with the corticosteroid regimen (n = 485) applied 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment to affected areas on the trunk and extremities and 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment to affected areas on the face and neck. The study primary endpoint was the response rate, i.e. the proportion of patients with at least 60% improvement in the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (mEASI) between baseline and month 3.

Results

By month 3, more patients in the 0.1% tacrolimus group responded to treatment (72.6% vs. 52.3% in the corticosteroid group, P < 0.001). The patients treated with 0.1% tacrolimus also showed greater improvement in mEASI, EASI, affected body surface area and physician and patient assessments of global response. Patients applying 0.1% tacrolimus ointment experienced more skin burning (52.4% vs. 13.8% in the corticosteroid group; P < 0.001). In most patients, skin burning was mild to moderate in severity and decreased rapidly after the first week of treatment. There was no increase in the incidence of infections or malignancies over time in either treatment group.

Conclusions

Long-term treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment is significantly more efficacious than a corticosteroid ointment regimen in adults with moderate to severe AD.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Three randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center, phase 3 studies were conducted to evaluate tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. One (Pediatric) study included 351 patients 2 to 15 years of age, and the other two (Adult) studies included a total of 632 patients 15 to 79 years of age. Fifty-five percent (55%) of the patients were women and 27% were black. At baseline, 58% of the patients had severe disease and the mean body surface area (BSA) affected was 46%. Over 80% of patients had atopic dermatitis affecting the face and/or neck region. In these studies, patients applied either tacrolimus ointment 0.03%, tacrolimus Ointment 0.1%, or vehicle ointment twice daily to 10% to 100% of their BSA for up to 12 weeks.

In the pediatric study, a significantly greater (p < 0.001) percentage of patients achieved at least 90% improvement based on the physician's global evaluation of clinical response (the pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint) in the tacrolimus ointment 0.03% treatment group compared to the vehicle treatment group, but there was insufficient evidence that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% provided more efficacy than tacrolimus ointment 0.03%.

Information for Patients

(See Medication Guide)

Patients using tacrolimus ointment should receive and understand the information in the Medication Guide. Please refer to the Medication Guide for providing instruction and information to the patient.

What is the most important information patients should know about tacrolimus ointment?

The safety of using tacrolimus ointment for a long period of time is not known. A very small number of people who have used tacrolimus ointment have had cancer (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, a link with tacrolimus ointment has not been shown. Because of this concern, instruct patients:

Do not use tacrolimus ointment continuously for a long time.
Use tacrolimus ointment only on areas of skin that have eczema.
Do not use tacrolimus ointment on a child under 2 years old.

Tacrolimus ointment comes in two strengths:

Only tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is for use on children aged 2 to 15 years.
Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% can be used by adults and children 16 years and older.

Advise patients to talk to their prescriber for more information.

How should Tacrolimus Ointment be used?

Advise patients to:

Use tacrolimus ointment exactly as prescribed.
Use tacrolimus ointment only on areas of skin that have eczema.
Use tacrolimus ointment for short periods, and if needed, treatment may be repeated with breaks in between.
Stop tacrolimus ointment when the signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching, rash, and redness go away, or as directed.
Follow their doctor's advice if symptoms of eczema return after treatment with tacrolimus ointment.
Call their doctor if:
Their symptoms get worse with tacrolimus ointment.
They get an infection on their skin.
Their symptoms do not improve after 6 weeks of treatment. Sometimes other skin diseases can look like eczema.

### Intermittent therapy for flare prevention and long-term disease control in stabilized atopic dermatitis: a randomized comparison of 3-times-weekly applications of tacrolimus ointment versus vehicle [^111tJBgH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Intermittent dosing of a topical calcineurin inhibitor for preventing atopic dermatitis (AD) disease relapse in patients with stabilized AD has not been evaluated.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of 3-times-weekly use of tacrolimus ointment in preventing AD disease relapse.

Methods

Adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD who were clear of disease after up to 16 weeks of treatment with tacrolimus ointment were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 3-times-weekly treatment with either tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1%) or vehicle for 40 weeks. The primary end point was the number of flare-free treatment days.

Results

A total of 125 patients were randomized to tacrolimus and 72 patients to vehicle. The mean number of flare-free treatment days was 177 for tacrolimus and 134 for vehicle (P = 0.003). Median time to first relapse was 169 days for tacrolimus and 43 for vehicle (P = 0.037).

Limitations

Generalizability to all patients seen in clinic may be limited because only patients who responded to tacrolimus ointment in the stabilization phase were randomized into the maintenance phase of the trial.

Conclusions

Maintenance therapy with tacrolimus ointment was associated with significantly more flare-free days compared with vehicle, and a significantly longer time until first disease relapse.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% shows efficacy and safety in pediatric and adult patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis [^116SS4h9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Tacrolimus ointment is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment 0.03% compared with vehicle in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD.

Methods

Two identically designed, independent, randomized, double-blind, 6-week studies — one pediatric and one adult — in patients with mild to moderate AD were conducted. Combined data from 617 patients were used in the analysis. The primary efficacy end point was percentage of patients with treatment success (defined as "clear" or "almost clear" on the Investigator's Global AD Assessment) at end of study.

Results

As early as day 4, treatment success occurred in 17.7% of patients treated with tacrolimus compared with 9.8% of patients treated with vehicle (P = 0.003), and by study end had increased to 49.7% for tacrolimus versus 29.0% for vehicle (P < .0001). Tacrolimus was associated with significantly less application site pruritus than vehicle (29.0% vs 37.5%; p = 0.03). There was no difference between tacrolimus and vehicle in the incidence of application site skin burning and stinging.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is effective and safe for the management of mild to moderate AD in both adult and pediatric patients, and has a rapid onset of action.

Talk to your doctor for more information.

What is tacrolimus ointment?

Tacrolimus ointment is a prescription medicine used on the skin (topical) to treat eczema (atopic dermatitis). Tacrolimus ointment is in a class of medicines called topical calcineurin inhibitors. It is for adults and children 2 years of age and older who do not have a weakened immune system. Tacrolimus ointment is used on the skin for short periods, and if needed, treatment may be repeated with breaks in between. Tacrolimus ointment is for use after other prescription medicines have not worked for you, or if your doctor recommends that other prescription medicines should not be used.

Who should not use tacrolimus ointment?

Tacrolimus ointment should not be used:

on children younger than 2 years of age.
if you are allergic to tacrolimus ointment or anything in it. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients.

What should I tell my doctor before starting tacrolimus ointment?

Before you start using tacrolimus ointment, you and your doctor should talk about all of your medical conditions, including if you:

have a skin disease called Netherton's syndrome (a rare inherited condition).
have any infection on your skin including chicken pox or herpes.
have been told you have a weakened immune system.
are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

### Single-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluating the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis with hydrocortisone 1% ointment compared with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment in adults [^11126TZA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tacrolimus is a topical calcineurin inhibitor with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and fungicidal properties that may be beneficial in the treatment of facial seborrheic dermatitis.

Objectives

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus with standard corticosteroid treatment in adults with facial seborrheic dermatitis in a phase II, single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Adult patients were enrolled in a 12-week study. Subjects were randomized to tacrolimus 0.1% ointment (n = 16) or hydrocortisone 1% ointment (n = 14) applied twice daily to symptomatic regions of the face. The primary efficacy measure was the severity of facial seborrhea at the end of treatment (day 84) as measured by the Seborrhea Area and Severity Index-Face. Secondary efficacy measures included physician and patient assessment of seborrhea, the frequency of medication application, and adverse events.

Results

The severity of facial seborrhea was similarly improved in both treatment groups (P = 0.86). Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was used on significantly fewer days than 1% hydrocortisone ointment (mean missed doses per patient at first visit: 15.6 vs 7.6, P < .05; at last visit: 13.5 vs 7.7, P = 0.08). The majority of doses were missed because of lack of symptoms. The adverse event profile for both agents was similar; however, there was a numerically higher incidence of adverse events in the hydrocortisone group.

Limitations

This was a small, open-label study.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment required significantly fewer applications compared with hydrocortisone 1% ointment to achieve a comparable clinical response in adults with facial seborrheic dermatitis. Tacrolimus was generally well tolerated.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^116E3a1L]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

ADULT

Tacrolimus ointment 0.1%

Apply a thin layer of tacrolimus ointment to the affected skin twice daily. The minimum amount should be rubbed in gently and completely to control signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Stop using when signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis resolve.
If signs and symptoms (e.g. itch, rash, and redness) do not improve within 6 weeks, patients should be re-examined by their healthcare provider to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.
Continuous long-term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus ointment should be avoided, and application should be limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis.

The safety of tacrolimus ointment under occlusion, which may promote systemic exposure, has not been evaluated. Tacrolimus ointment should not be used with occlusive dressings.

### Proactive treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment [^114QdGcr]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) using low dose, intermittent, topical anti-inflammatory agents may control acute disease and prevent relapses. This 12-month, European, multicentre, randomized study investigated whether the proactive use of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment applied twice weekly can keep AD in remission and reduce the incidence of disease exacerbations (DE).

Methods

During the initial open-label period, 257 adults with AD applied 0.1% tacrolimus ointment twice daily (b.i.d.) for up to 6 weeks to affected areas. When an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≤ 2 was achieved, the patient entered the disease control period (DCP) and was randomized to either proactive tacrolimus (n = 116) or vehicle ointment (n = 108) twice weekly for 12 months. Exacerbations were treated with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment b.i.d. until an IGA ≤ 2 was regained, then randomized treatment was restarted. The primary endpoint was the number of DEs during the DCP that required a substantial therapeutic intervention.

Results

Proactive tacrolimus 0.1% ointment application significantly reduced the number of DEs requiring substantial therapeutic intervention (median difference 2; P < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test), the percentage of DE treatment days (median difference: 15.2%; P < 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test) and increased the time to first DE (median 142 vs 15 days; P < 0.001; stratified log-rank test). The adverse event profile was similar for the two treatment approaches.

Conclusion

A 12-month, twice weekly proactive tacrolimus ointment application was an effective treatment in most study patients which prevented, delayed and reduced the occurrence of AD exacerbations

### Topical tacrolimus for atopic dermatitis [^115gtqnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) (or atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects children and adults and has an important impact on quality of life. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first-line therapy for this condition; however, they can be associated with significant adverse effects when used chronically. Tacrolimus ointment (in its 2 manufactured strengths of 0.1% and 0.03%) might be an alternative treatment. Tacrolimus, together with pimecrolimus, are drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for moderate and severe atopic dermatitis compared with other active treatments.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 June 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT database). We searched six trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We contacted specialists in the field for unpublished data. A separate search for adverse effects of topical tacrolimus was undertaken in MEDLINE and EMBASE on 30 July 2013. We also scrutinised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites for adverse effects information.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (both children and adults) using topical tacrolimus at any dose, course duration, and follow-up time compared with other active treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and examined the full text of selected studies for compliance with eligibility criteria, risk of bias, and data extraction. Our three prespecified primary outcomes were physician's assessment, participant's self-assessment of improvement, and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of improvement of the disease by validated or objective measures, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), and BSA (Body Surface Area) scores.

Main Results

We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants. The variability of drug doses, outcomes, and follow-up periods made it difficult to carry out meta-analyses. A single trial showed that tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency TCS by the physician's assessment (risk ratio (RR) 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.45, 1 study, n = 371, moderate-quality evidence). It was also marginally better than low-potency TCS on face and neck areas and moderate-potency TCS on the trunk and extremities by the physician's assessment (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.49, 1 study, n = 972, moderate level of evidence) and for some of the secondary outcomes. Compared with pimecrolimus 1%, people treated with tacrolimus were almost twice as likely to improve by the physician's assessment (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.42, 2 studies, n = 506, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with the lower concentration of 0.03%, the tacrolimus 0.1% formulation reduced the risk of not having an improvement by 18% as evaluated by the physician's assessment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, 6 studies, n = 1640, high-quality evidence). Tacrolimus 0.1% compared with moderate-to-potent TCS showed no difference by the physician's assessment, and 2 secondary outcomes (1 study, 377 participants) and a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% was found by the participant's assessment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29, 1 study, n = 974, low quality of evidence) and SCORAD. Based on data from 2 trials, tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild TCS for the physician's assessment (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.38, 2 studies, n = 790, moderate-quality evidence) and the participant's self-assessment (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.90, 1 study, n = 416, moderate quality of evidence). One trial showed moderate benefit of tacrolimus 0.03% compared with pimecrolimus 1% on the physician's assessment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, 1 study, n = 139, low-quality evidence), but the effects were equivocal when evaluating BSA. In the comparison of tacrolimus 0.03% with moderate-to-potent corticosteroids, no difference was found in most of the outcomes measured (including physician's and participant's assessment and also for the secondary outcomes), but in two studies, a marginal benefit favouring the corticosteroid group was found for the EASI and BSA scores. Burning was more frequent in those using calcineurin inhibitors than those using corticosteroid tacrolimus 0.03% (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.14, 5 studies, 1883 participants, high-quality evidence), but no difference was found for skin infections. Symptoms observed were mild and transient. The comparison between the two calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) showed the same overall incidence of adverse events, but with a small difference in the frequency of local effects. Serious adverse events were rare; occurred in both the tacrolimus and corticosteroid groups; and in most cases, were considered to be unrelated to the treatment. No cases of lymphoma were noted in the included studies nor in the non-comparative studies. Cases were only noted in spontaneous reports, cohorts, and case-control studies. Systemic absorption was rarely detectable, only in low levels, and this decreased with time. Exception is made for diseases with severe barrier defects, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and a few others, with case reports of a higher absorption. We evaluated clinical trials; case reports; and in vivo, in vitro, and animal studies; and didn't find any evidence that topical tacrolimus could cause skin atrophy.

Authors' Conclusions

Tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency corticosteroids, pimecrolimus 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03%. Results were equivocal when comparing both dose formulations to moderate-to-potent corticosteroids. Tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild corticosteroids and pimecrolimus. Both tacrolimus formulations seemed to be safe, and no evidence was found to support the possible increased risk of malignancies or skin atrophy with their use. The reliability and strength of the evidence was limited by the lack of data; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. We did not evaluate costs.

### The safety of tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis: a review [^114iU6dU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus ointment is a topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) that was developed specifically for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). It is one of the most extensively tested dermatological products, with more than 19 000 patients (including approximately 7600 children) having participated in the tacrolimus ointment clinical development programme. Recent regulatory reviews have focused on the potential risk of malignancy with TCIs, based on their mode of action and the effects of systemic tacrolimus when given to transplant recipients. Studies have shown, however, that the systemic absorption of tacrolimus when applied topically is very low, with blood concentrations being below the level of quantification in most patients. Moreover, TCIs are not associated with a decrease in immunocompetence in the skin and there is no increase in the incidence of infections with long-term treatment. More than 5.4 million prescriptions for tacrolimus ointment have been issued worldwide, with no evidence of an increased risk of malignancy in adults or children compared with the general population. Similarly, epidemiological studies have failed to demonstrate an increased incidence of skin cancer in patients using TCIs. The most common adverse events (AEs) that occur with tacrolimus ointment treatment are transient application-site reactions, such as burning or pruritus. These complications are related to disease severity, and decrease in frequency over time as AD improves. The incidence of nonapplication-site AEs does not increase with long-term treatment, and most such events occurring in clinical trials were considered to be unrelated to therapy. Although it is important that clinicians are aware of the recent changes in product labelling, extensive clinical trials continue to show that tacrolimus ointment is well tolerated, and is generally an effective therapy for suitable patients with AD.

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma risk: evidence update with implications for daily practice [^115gQtef]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Topical tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream have been commercially available for more than a decade and are the first and only drugs approved for chronic treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric patients. These topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) have been a welcomed alternative to topical corticosteroids because their chronic use is not associated with skin barrier compromise or increasing percutaneous absorption. However, in January 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instituted a boxed warning for both TCIs based on a theoretical risk of malignancy (including lymphomas) that sparked an ongoing debate over the safety of these drugs. Since then, despite a number of epidemiological and clinical studies, no clear link between TCI use and lymphoma risk has been established. Yet, the boxed warning remains, leaving many physicians hesitant to prescribe TCIs and countless patients (including infants and children) exposed to other anti-inflammatory agents with proven adverse effects. This review will (1) present a historical overview of the basis for the boxed warning, (2) review and critically evaluate the evidence for lymphoma risk, (3) provide practical clinical and evidence-based advice on using TCIs in the management of AD, and (4) offer advice on addressing obstacles to patient access to these drugs.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^1169SipV]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Long-term Safety of Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors Has Not Been Established

Although a causal relationship has not been established, rare cases of malignancy (e.g., skin and lymphoma) have been reported in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus ointment.

Therefore:

- Continuous long-term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus ointment, in any age group should be avoided, and application limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis.

- Tacrolimus ointment is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age. Only 0.03% tacrolimus ointment is indicated for use in children 2–15 years of age.

### Tacrolimus ointment is effective for facial and intertriginous psoriasis [^115YjwhW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intertriginous and facial involvement are manifestations of psoriasis that require a different approach than is used for typical plaque psoriasis on other skin areas. Topical corticosteroids are the primary treatment for psoriasis; however, the side effects of corticosteroids are magnified on intertriginous and facial skin. Topical tacrolimus offers the potential for anti-inflammatory effect without the atrophy or other local side effects associated with the use of topical corticosteroids.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of facial or intertriginous psoriasis.

Methods

One hundred sixty-seven patients 16 years or older were evaluated in an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center study. Upon entry into the study, patients were randomized 2:1 to apply the tacrolimus ointment 0.1% or vehicle twice daily to all psoriatic lesions of the face or intertriginous areas for 8 weeks. The physician's global assessment was used to assess improvement from baseline. The inverse psoriasis severity for patients was measured using a 6-point scale from clear to very severe.

Results

As early as day 8, more patients (P = 0.004) had cleared or achieved excellent improvement in the 0.1% tacrolimus ointment group compared to the vehicle group (24.8% vs 5.8%). At the end of the 8-week treatment period 65.2% of the tacrolimus ointment group and 31.5% of the vehicle were clear or almost clear (P < .0001) based on a Static Severity Score. Adverse events were similar in the 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and vehicle groups. Conclusion Tacrolimus ointment is an effective treatment for psoriasis of the face or intertriginous areas.

### Nonclinical and early clinical development of tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^116XAUDk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus ointment, formulated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, is the first in a class of topical immunomodulators. Its mechanism of action is based on calcineurin inhibition, which results in suppression of antigen-specific T-cell activation and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine release. Animal and human studies have shown that topically applied tacrolimus is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, the fraction that is absorbed is extensively distributed, and tacrolimus does not accumulate in tissues following repeated topical application. In addition, tacrolimus ointment is not inherently irritating, sensitizing, phototoxic, or photoallergenic when applied to intact skin. Unlike some topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus ointment does not cause a decrease in collagen synthesis or skin thickness, nor does it produce skin abnormalities or depigmentation. In animal studies, repeated daily application of tacrolimus ointment up to 1 year is associated with dermal findings similar to those following vehicle application (mild to moderate dermal irritation and microscopic findings of acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and superficial inflammation). In a 52-week study with Yucatan micropigs, no noteworthy macroscopic or microscopic changes (either dermal or systemic) related to the application of tacrolimus ointment (0.03% to 0.3% concentrations) were observed. Tacrolimus ointment was shown to be safe and effective in phase 2 and early phase 3 studies. Significant improvements in atopic dermatitis were observed in the majority of patients treated with tacrolimus ointment. The most common adverse events associated with its use were a transient burning sensation and pruritus at the site of application. Blood tacrolimus concentrations were below the limit of quantitation in most patients.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111RSZ6S]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Review Recommendations

Overall, the published data summarized above suggest that the warning included in the current Japanese labeling for TAC‐O is not based on the reports of malignancies whose causal relationship to the drug has been determined. As a result, the warning does not appear justified in the context of optimal clinical use at currently approved doses, as was stated by Topical Calcineurin Inhibitor Task Force of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. 73 Therefore, we conclude that TAC‐O is a safe and effective option for the treatment of AD in both children and adults.

We join these other experts in stating that the current warning of the Japanese labeling for TAC‐O is not appropriate based on available scientific evidence and that the boxed US FDA warning should also be reconsidered. 73, 82, 96 We believe that this would be the best approach to ensuring that all patients with AD receive the most appropriate and effective treatment.

Abstract

Atopic dermatitis requires long‐term management, mainly with topical anti‐inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment (‐O) are recommended as first‐line treatments for. However, the long‐term use ofis limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For‐O, Japanese andlabelings were updated in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However,‐O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with. Available data suggest that‐O is effective and well tolerated, and can improve quality of life.‐O has successfully been used in the proactive management ofconsisting of long‐term intermittent use to prevent, delay or reduce the occurrence offlares. Systemic drug absorption after‐O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients, and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns. In the absence of robust evidence, the warning about the carcinogenic potential in the Japanese labeling for‐O does not appear justified and should be reconsidered. This mitigation of description would allow adult and pediatric patients withto receive the effective treatment more appropriately.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^112FMEdP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Use

Tacrolimus ointment is not indicated for children less than 2 years of age.

Only the lower concentration, 0.03%, of tacrolimus ointment is recommended for use as a second-line therapy for short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised children 2 to 15 years of age who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments for atopic dermatitis, or when those treatments are not advisable.

The long-term safety and effects of tacrolimus ointment on the developing immune system are unknown (see boxed WARNING, WARNINGS and INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Four studies were conducted involving a total of about 4,400 patients 2 to 15 years of age: one 12-week randomized vehicle-controlled study and three open-label safety studies of one to three years duration. About 2,500 of these patients were 2 to 6 years of age.

The most common adverse events from these studies associated with tacrolimus ointment application in pediatric patients were skin burning and pruritus (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In addition to skin burning and pruritus, the less common events (< 5%) of varicella zoster (mostly chicken pox), and vesiculobullous rash were more frequent in patients treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% compared to vehicle. In the open-label safety studies, the incidence of adverse events, including infections, did not increase with increased duration of study drug exposure or amount of ointment used. In about 4,400 pediatric patients treated with tacrolimus ointment, 24 (0.5%) were reported with eczema herpeticum. Since the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment have not been established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age, its use in this age group is not recommended.

In an open-label study, immune response to a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was assessed in 23 children 2 to 12 years old with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03%. Protective antibody titers developed in all patients. Similarly, in a seven-month, double-blind trial, the vaccination response to meningococcal serogroup C was equivalent in children 2 to 11 years old with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis treated with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (n = 121), a hydrocortisone ointment regimen (n = 111), or normal children (n = 44)

CLINICAL STUDIES

Three randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center,
phase 3 studies were conducted to evaluate PROTOPIC Ointment for the treatment
of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. One (Pediatric) study
included 351 patients 2–15 years of age, and the other two (Adult) studies
included a total of 632 patients 15–79 years of age. Fifty-five percent (55%) of
the patients were women and 27% were black. At baseline, 58% of the patients had
severe disease and the mean body surface area (BSA) affected was 46%. Over 80%
of patients had atopic dermatitis affecting the face and/or neck region. In
these studies, patients applied either PROTOPIC Ointment 0.03%, PROTOPIC
Ointment 0.1%, or vehicle ointment twice daily to 10% - 100% of their BSA for up
to 12 weeks.

In the pediatric study, a significantly greater (p less than 0.001) percentage of
patients achieved at least 90% improvement based on the physician's global
evaluation of clinical response (the pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint) in
the PROTOPIC Ointment 0.03% treatment group compared to the vehicle treatment
group, but there was insufficient evidence that PROTOPIC Ointment 0.1% provided
more efficacy than PROTOPIC Ointment 0.03%.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of tacrolimus ointment versus high-potency topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [^113PnG5V]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Few cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted on topical therapies for atopic dermatitis.

Objective

We sought to compare cost-effectiveness of high-potency topical corticosteroids (HPTCs) and tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for patients who are not responsive to or not well controlled with mid-potency topical corticosteroids.

Methods

A Markov model represented the cyclic nature of atopic dermatitis. Clinical outcomes were derived from published literature. "Efficacy" was defined as disease-controlled days on which patients experienced a greater than 75% improvement in their disease. Resource use and changes in management were on the basis of opinions of a physician panel; secondary treatment was an oral antibiotic with topical corticosteroids. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for all variables.

Results

The model was sensitive to duration of continuous treatment with HPTCs. HPTCs, when limited to 2-week treatment cycles, were associated with the highest total costs ($1682 per year) and the least efficacy (185 disease-controlled days). HPTCs in 4-week treatment intervals and tacrolimus ointment were similar in total costs and efficacy ($1317 vs $1323 for 194 vs 190 disease-controlled days, respectively). Although primary drug costs were higher for patients treated with tacrolimus ointment, patients treated with regimens of HPTCs incurred higher secondary drug costs.

Conclusion

In the base case analyses, tacrolimus ointment was more cost-effective than HPTCs administered in 2-week treatment cycles, and similar in cost-effectiveness to 4-week cycles of HPTCs.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) requires long-term management, mainly with topical anti-inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) and tacrolimus ointment (TAC-O) are recommended as first-line treatments for AD. However, the long-term use of TCS is limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For TAC-O, Japanese and US labelings were updated in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However, TAC-O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with AD. Available data suggest that TAC-O is effective and well tolerated, and can improve quality of life. TAC-O has successfully been used in the proactive management of AD consisting of long-term intermittent use to prevent, delay or reduce the occurrence of AD flares. Systemic drug absorption after TAC-O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients, and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns.

### Tacrolimus (Protopic) [^115GWMR4]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Although systemic absorption of tacrolimus following topical
applications of PROTOPIC Ointment is minimal relative to systemic
administration, it is known that tacrolimus is excreted in human milk. Because
of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from

discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the
mother.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^113FcRq3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) tacrolimus — adult AD efficacy, proactive control, head-to-head comparison, and tolerability: Tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03% ointments were shown to be superior to vehicle based on investigator assessments in adult AD in 4 randomized trials, including a study in which 211 adults received tacrolimus 0.03% ointment, 209 received tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, and 212 received vehicle twice daily for 12 weeks, with 58/211 (27.5%), 77/209 (36.8%), and 14/212 (6.6%), respectively, achieving improvement by Physician's Global Assessment (P < .001 for both treatment groups compared to vehicle); tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03% ointments resulted in flare prevention and disease control when used intermittently from 2 to 3 times per week in patients with stable disease followed for 40 to 56 weeks (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.59–1.09); based on 3 randomized trials, tacrolimus 0.1% is significantly more efficacious than pimecrolimus 1% by IGA "clear" or "almost clear" (43.6% vs 25.1%, RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.40–2.16), and a study comparing 210 AD patients applying tacrolimus 0.1% to 203 applying pimecrolimus 1% for 6 weeks demonstrated mean EASI score reductions of 54.1% vs 34.9% (P = 0.0002); serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and infection were comparable to placebo, skin infection and withdrawal due to adverse effects do not appear to differ between these medications, and the primary side effects of tacrolimus appear to be local in nature (ie, burning).

How should I use tacrolimus ointment?

Use tacrolimus ointment exactly as prescribed.
Use tacrolimus ointment only on areas of your skin that have eczema.
Use tacrolimus ointment for short periods, and if needed, treatment may be repeated with breaks in between.
Stop tacrolimus ointment when the signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching, rash, and redness go away, or as directed by your doctor.
Follow your doctor's advice if symptoms of eczema return after treatment with tacrolimus ointment.
Call your doctor if:
your symptoms get worse with tacrolimus ointment.
you get an infection on your skin.
your symptoms do not improve after 6 weeks of treatment. Sometimes other skin diseases can look like eczema.

To apply tacrolimus ointment:

Wash your hands before applying tacrolimus ointment.
Apply a thin layer of tacrolimus ointment twice daily to the areas of skin affected by eczema.
Use the smallest amount of tacrolimus ointment needed to control the signs and symptoms of eczema.
If you are a caregiver applying tacrolimus ointment to a patient, or if you are a patient who is not treating your hands, wash your hands with soap and water after applying tacrolimus ointment. This should remove any ointment left on the hands.
Do not bathe, shower, or swim right after applying tacrolimus ointment. This could wash off the ointment.
You can use moisturizers with tacrolimus ointment. Make sure you check with your doctor first about the products that are right for you. Because the skin of patients with eczema can be very dry, it is important to keep up good skin care practices. If you use moisturizers, apply them after tacrolimus ointment.

### An approach to pruritus in atopic dermatitis: a critical systematic review of the tacrolimus ointment literature [^1138BoGq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Persistent pruritus, or itch, is one of the earliest symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD). When pruritus is untreated, the incessant scratching response by the patient can increase the inflammatory response, resulting in aggravation of disease symptoms and severity, increasing flares and worsening patient quality of life. Therefore, it is essential that pruritus be treated effectively, rapidly and safely for optimal management of AD. In this article, the authors review clinical trials using tacrolimus ointment, a topical calcineurin inhibitor, to treat adult and pediatric patients with AD over a wide range of disease severity focusing on its efficacy in rapidly reducing pruritus. Furthermore, the authors evaluate trials in which tacrolimus ointment was directly compared with topical corticosteroids, the mainstay of AD treatment, and pimecrolimus cream, another topical calcineurin inhibitor, as well as long-term safety trials in which patients applied tacrolimus ointment for extended periods.

### Impact of topical calcineurin inhibitors on quality of life in patients with atopic dermatitis [^116PnTte]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

This review considers randomized trials of topical calcineurin inhibitors in atopic dermatitis that have included quality-of-life (QOL) data. Relatively few trials were identified and several different QOL measures have been used, partly because trial subjects included adults, children, and the parents of affected infants. Tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream were found to be superior to vehicle treatment in terms of QOL for active AD. In adults, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment provided a greater improvement in QOL than the 0.03% strength. Pimecrolimus 1% cream was superior to vehicle treatment for flare prevention in the studies that contained QOL outcomes but no data are available for tacrolimus ointment in this regard. QOL data comparing topical calcineurin inhibitors with other active treatments such as topical corticosteroids are sparse and it would be useful for future randomized trials to include QOL measures as a primary outcome.

Topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus — off-label therapy for facial and intertriginous psoriasis are described with dosing and safety parameters as follows: No FDA-approved indications for psoriasis; primary indications for off-label use are for facial and intertriginous psoriasis. Applied twice daily to affected areas; no duration of course is specified. Plaque psoriasis is not generally effective, whereas for intertriginous and facial psoriasis, 65% of patients treated with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment were clear or almost clear after 8 weeks versus 31% with placebo, and 71% with pimecrolimus 0.1% cream versus 21% with placebo. There are no specific contraindications/adverse reactions for psoriasis; the most common side effect is burning and itching, and a lymphoma "black box" warning has been issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pregnancy and nursing are Category C, and the drugs are found in human milk and are not recommended for nursing mothers. Pediatric approval noted is topical tacrolimus (0.03%) and topical pimecrolimus for patients 2 years of age or older for atopic dermatitis.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children [^113bdGgp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus ointment is a nonsteroidal topical immunomodulator that was formulated specifically for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A total of 255 children, 2 to 15 years of age, with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis applied 0.1% tacrolimus ointment twice daily for up to 12 months to assess long-term safety and efficacy. Patients on average were treated with tacrolimus ointment for 279 days or 87% of study days. Substantial improvements in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, percent body surface area affected, and the patient's or parent's assessment of pruritus were observed during the first week of treatment and were maintained throughout the study. Transient skin burning and itching were the most common drug application site adverse events. Occurrence of these symptoms decreased after the first few days of treatment. There was no increased incidence of infections or other significant adverse events. Effectiveness of tacrolimus was maintained with prolonged daily use. Tacrolimus ointment (0.1%) is safe and effective for long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis in children.

### Tacrolimus ointment is safe and effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: results in 8000 patients [^112fgDaA]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in a large cohort of adult and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

Methods

A cohort of 3964 adult and 3959 pediatric patients with AD were enrolled in this open-label noncomparative study. Patients applied tacrolimus 0.03% or 0.1% ointment twice daily to the affected areas. Efficacy and safety assessments included percentage of body surface area affected and incidence of adverse events, respectively.

Results

A total of 7923 patients were evaluated; 95.5% had severe or moderate AD at baseline. There was a 52% decrease from baseline in the mean percentage of body surface area affected at month 1 and a 91% decrease at month 18. Two of the most common adverse events, skin burning and pruritus, were generally mild, transient in nature, and decreased in prevalence as AD improved. Severity and frequency of other common adverse events were consistent with expected rates in the general population.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus ointment monotherapy in almost 8000 pediatric and adult patients led to continuous improvement in AD and revealed no change in the safety profile reported in previous clinical trials.

### Tacrolimus ointment. A review of its therapeutic potential as a topical therapy in atopic dermatitis [^116kDXvQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Tacrolimus, a macrolide immunomodulator, is believed to control atopic dermatitis by inhibiting T lymphocyte activation, altering cell surface expression on antigen-presenting dendritic cells and modulating the release of inflammatory mediators from skin mast cells and basophils. Tacrolimus ointment penetrates human skin with no systemic accumulation after repeated applications; systemic absorption is generally low, with most patients in clinical trials having blood concentrations of the drug below the limit of quantification. Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis significantly improved (measured using multiple end-points, including ≥ 90% improvement in Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response) with tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment compared with vehicle in both adult (n = 304 and 328) and pediatric (n = 351) patients in three 12-week, double-blind, randomized, phase III trials. In adults, tacrolimus ointment was effective therapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis on all skin regions, including the head and neck. The 0.1% concentration was more effective than the 0.03% concentration. Clinical improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult (n = 316) or pediatric (n = 255) patients was seen as early as week 1, and improvement continued and/or was maintained for up to 6 and/or 12 months in long-term studies. The 0.1% formulation was also effective and well tolerated for up to 2 years. Tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment was associated with significant quality-of-life benefit in adults, children (aged 5 to 15 years) and toddlers (aged 2 to 4 years) with atopic dermatitis in 12-week phase III trials (n = 985). Skin burning and pruritus were the most common application site adverse events in adult and pediatric patients in short-term and long-term trials. These events were generally of short duration and mild or moderate severity. Cutaneous infections occurred with a similar incidence after treatment with tacrolimus ointment to that seen after vehicle in short-term trials.

Conclusion

Both short- and long-term monotherapy with tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment improves moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult and pediatric patients. Topical tacrolimus ointment is well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events being localized, transient in nature and of mild or moderate severity. Tacrolimus ointment provides a promising addition to the currently available treatments for atopic dermatitis; it can be used as a short- or long-term intermittent therapy for moderate to severe disease, including disease on the head or neck, in adult (0.1 and 0.03% formulations) and pediatric (0.03% formulation) patients who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional treatments.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Tacrolimus (ta kroe' li mus) Ointment 0.1%

Read the Medication Guide every time you or a family member gets tacrolimus ointment. There may be new information. This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. If you have questions about tacrolimus ointment, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

What is the most important information I should know about tacrolimus ointment?

The safety of using tacrolimus ointment for a long period of time is not known. A very small number of people who have used tacrolimus ointment have had cancer (for example, skin or lymphoma). However, a link with tacrolimus ointment has not been shown. Because of this concern:

Do not use tacrolimus ointment continuously for a long time.
Use tacrolimus ointment only on areas of your skin that have eczema.
Do not use tacrolimus ointment on a child under 2 years old.

Tacrolimus ointment comes in two strengths:

Only tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is for use on children aged 2 to 15 years.
Either tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or 0.1% can be used by adults and children 16 years and older.

### Three times weekly tacrolimus ointment reduces relapse in stabilized atopic dermatitis: a new paradigm for use [^116qNLph]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Long-term, safe and effective therapeutic options for managing the chronic relapsing nature of atopic dermatitis are essential for improving patient quality of life. To minimize the risks of continued topical corticosteroid usage and potentially reduce the incidence of flares, we tested the efficacy and safety of a rotational paradigm of initial brief application of topical corticosteroid followed by long-term intermittent application of non-steroidal tacrolimus ointment to previously inflamed sites of dermatitis.

Methods

In this 2-phase study, patients who were 2 to 15 years of age and had moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to 4 days of twice-daily double-blind therapy with either alclometasone ointment 0.05% or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I acute), followed by up to 16 weeks of twice-daily open-label tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Phase I short-term). Patients whose disease stabilized underwent new randomization to double-blind tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or vehicle applied once daily, 3 times per week to clinically normal-appearing skin for up to 40 weeks (Phase II). Corticosteroid use was prohibited.

Results

Of 206 randomly assigned patients, 152 completed Phase I; 105 of 152 were randomly assigned into Phase II (68 tacrolimus ointment and 37 vehicle). There were no differences in adverse events between alclometasone and tacrolimus (Phase I) or between tacrolimus and vehicle (Phase II). In the acute period, alclometasone-treated patients showed greater improvement in atopic dermatitis signs and symptoms; thereafter, when all patients applied tacrolimus ointment (short-term), there were no differences. In Phase II, tacrolimus-treated patients had significantly more disease-free days compared with vehicle, significantly longer time to first relapse, and significantly fewer disease relapse days.

Conclusions

For patients with stabilized moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, long-term intermittent application of tacrolimus ointment to normal-appearing but previously affected skin was significantly more effective than vehicle at maintaining disease stabilization, with a safety profile similar to vehicle.

### The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^111oS8je]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease in children, and its prevalence is increasing. It is a chronic disorder, characterized by intermittent flares and phases of remission. Treatment regimens often require multiple therapies. These can vary between patients, and in an individual patient, depending on the state of disease. The traditional treatment for AD flares is topical corticosteroids, which are fast acting and effective for relief of symptoms, but may cause adverse effects, including those resulting from systemic absorption, particularly in children. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are alternative treatments for AD. Tacrolimus ointment, a TCI, is approved for patients aged 2 years and older. Multiple studies have shown that tacrolimus is effective for short-term relief of symptoms in pediatric patients with AD. Long-term trials have demonstrated that the effectiveness of tacrolimus is maintained for up to 4 years in children. Additional studies have revealed that long-term intermittent use of tacrolimus as part of maintenance therapy can prevent AD flares. Tacrolimus has a low potential for systemic accumulation, and analysis of long-term studies indicates that it has a good safety profile. Treatment with tacrolimus, alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids for acute flares, may be a useful option for long-term management of AD in pediatric patients.

WARNINGS

WARNING

Long-term Safety of Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors Has Not
Been Established

Although a causal relationship has not been established, rare cases of
malignancy (e.g., skin and lymphoma) have been reported in patients treated with
topical calcineurin inhibitors, including PROTOPIC Ointment.

Therefore:

Continuous long-term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors, including
PROTOPIC Ointment, in any age group should be avoided, and application limited
to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis.
PROTOPIC Ointment is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of
age. Only 0.03% PROTOPIC Ointment is indicated for use in children 2–15 years of
age.

Prolonged systemic use of calcineurin inhibitors for sustained
immunosuppression in animal studies and transplant patients following systemic
administration has been associated with an increased risk of infections,
lymphomas, and skin malignancies. These risks are associated with the intensity
and duration of immunosuppression.

Based on the information above and the mechanism of action, there is a
concern about potential risk with the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors,
including PROTOPIC Ointment. While a causal relationship has not been
established, rare cases of skin malignancy and lymphoma have been reported in
patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors, including PROTOPIC
Ointment. Therefore:

PROTOPIC Ointment should not be used in immunocompromised adults and
children.
If signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis do not improve within 6 weeks,
patients should be re-examined by their healthcare provider and their diagnosis
be confirmed (see PRECAUTIONS: General).
The safety of PROTOPIC Ointment has not been established beyond one year of
non-continuous use.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^117STxc2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

There was no evidence based on blood concentrations that tacrolimus accumulates systemically upon intermittent topical application for periods of up to 1 year. As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors, it is not known whether tacrolimus is distributed into the lymphatic system.

Metabolism

Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the mixed-function oxidase system, primarily the cytochrome P-450 system (CYP3A). A metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 8 possible metabolites has been proposed. Demethylation and hydroxylation were identified as the primary mechanisms of biotransformation in vitro. The major metabolite identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13-demethyl tacrolimus. In in vitro studies, a 31-demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus.

Excretion

The mean clearance following IV administration of tacrolimus is 0.04, 0.083 and 0.053 L/hr/kg in healthy volunteers, adult kidney transplant patients and adult liver transplant patients, respectively. In man, less than 1% of the dose administered is excreted unchanged in urine.

In a mass balance study of IV administered radiolabeled tacrolimus to 6 healthy volunteers, the mean recovery of radiolabel was 77.8 ± 12.7%. Fecal elimination accounted for 92.4 ± 1.0% and the elimination half-life based on radioactivity was 48.1 ± 15.9 hours whereas it was 43.5 ± 11.6 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations. The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0.029 ± 0.015 L/hr/kg and clearance of tacrolimus was 0.029 ± 0.009 L/hr/kg.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^114dftaM]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

The use of tacrolimus ointment should be avoided on pre-malignant and malignant skin conditions. Some malignant skin conditions, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), may mimic atopic dermatitis.

The use of tacrolimus ointment is not recommended in patients having skin conditions with a skin barrier defect where there is the potential for increased systemic absorption of tacrolimus, including but not limited to, Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, generalized erythroderma or cutaneous Graft Versus Host Disease. Oral application is also not recommended. Post-marketing cases of increased tacrolimus blood level have been reported in these conditions.

The use of tacrolimus ointment may cause local symptoms such as skin burning (burning sensation, stinging, soreness) or pruritus. Localized symptoms are most common during the first few days of tacrolimus ointment application and typically improve as the lesions of atopic dermatitis resolve. With tacrolimus ointment 0.1%, 90% of the skin burning events had a duration between 2 minutes and 3 hours (median 15 minutes). 90% of the pruritus events had a duration between 3 minutes and 10 hours (median 20 minutes) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Bacterial and Viral Skin Infections

Before commencing treatment with tacrolimus ointment, cutaneous bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved. Studies have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment treatment for up to 4 years in patients with atopic dermatitis [^111sGHB1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in adult and pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

Methods

A total of 408 adult and 391 pediatric patients with AD who had participated in a previous clinical trial of tacrolimus ointment were enrolled in this long-term, open-label, noncomparative trial. Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% was applied twice daily either intermittently or continuously to the affected areas. Efficacy and safety assessments included percent body surface area affected, Eczema Area and Severity Index score, individual signs of AD, and the incidence of adverse events.

Results

A total of 799 patients were evaluated, of whom 300 (37.5%) were followed for more than 3 years (maximum 49 months). Improvements in efficacy parameters were observed within 1 week of treatment and continued for the duration of the study. Common adverse events included skin burning, pruritus, skin infection, skin erythema, flu-like symptoms, and headache. The incidence of adverse events, including cutaneous infections, did not increase with time on study.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus ointment therapy is a rapidly effective and safe treatment for the management of AD in pediatric and adult patients for up to 4 years.

### 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice daily is more efficacious than 1% hydrocortisone acetate in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: results of a randomized double-blind controlled trial [^117VAqcC]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are the usual treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD) in children but can have side-effects.

Objectives

This study compared the efficacy and safety of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice daily over a 3-week period with the twice daily application of 1% hydrocortisone acetate (HA) ointment in children with moderate to severe AD.

Patients and Methods

Patients applied ointment daily to all affected body surface areas. The primary study endpoint was the percentage change in the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (mEASI) between baseline and treatment end.

Results

Six hundred and twenty-four patients, aged 2–15 years, applied 0.03% tacrolimus ointment once daily (n = 207), twice daily (n = 210) or 1% HA twice daily (n = 207). By the end of treatment, application of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment both once or twice daily resulted in significantly greater median percentage decreases in mEASI (66.7% and 76.7%, respectively) compared with 1% HA (47.6%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the median percentage decrease in mEASI was significantly greater for patients applying 0.03% tacrolimus twice daily compared with once daily (P = 0.007). Patients with severe AD benefited especially from twice daily application of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment compared with once daily application (P = 0.001). Transient mild to moderate skin burning occurred significantly more often in the 0.03% tacrolimus groups (P = 0.028) but resolved in most cases within 3–4 days. Laboratory parameters showed no clinically relevant changes.

Conclusions

0.03% tacrolimus ointment applied once or twice daily is significantly more efficacious than 1% HA in treating moderate-severe AD in children. Twice daily application of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment results in the greatest improvement in mEASI, and is especially effective in patients with severe baseline disease.

### Multicentre, phase II trial on the safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of lichen sclerosus [^114yKoxf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease causing significant sclerosis, atrophy and pruritus. Treatment remains unsatisfactory, with potent corticosteroids being the most effective therapy.

Objectives

To conduct a multicentre, phase II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for the treatment of lichen sclerosus with a follow-up period of 18 months at 10 university and teaching hospitals in Germany and Austria.

Methods

Eighty-four patients (49 women, 32 men and three girls) aged between 5 and 85 years with long-standing, active lichen sclerosus (79 with anogenital and five with extragenital localization) were treated with topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice daily for 16 weeks. Computerized analysis of the lesional area was performed. The primary endpoint was clearance of active lichen sclerosus. Secondary endpoints were time to optimal response, reduction of sclerosis and duration of remission.

Results

The primary endpoint (clearance of active lichen sclerosus) was reached by 43% of patients at 24 weeks of treatment. Partial resolution was reached in 34% of patients. Maximal effects occurred between week 10 and 24 of therapy. Treatment led to a significant reduction of the total lesional area (P < 0.01) and to a significant decline in the total symptom score (P < 0.005). Symptoms (e.g. itching) and findings (erythema, erosions and induration) showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events were observed. There were three (9%) recurrences during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% was safe and effective for the treatment of long-standing active lichen sclerosus.

### Superiority of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment compared with fluticasone 0.005% in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis of the face: results from a randomized, double-blind trial [^112gyrnG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

No specific data are available on tacrolimus ointment as a second-line treatment in adults with facial eczema.

Objectives

To compare tacrolimus 0.1% and fluticasone 0.005% ointments in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) of the face in whom conventional treatment was ineffective or poorly tolerated.

Methods

Patients were randomized to double-blind treatment of facial AD with twice-daily tacrolimus ointment (n = 288) or fluticasone ointment (n = 280) for 3 weeks or until clearance. After day 21, patients could continue without the study treatment, apply the same ointment once daily, or switch to the other medication twice daily, depending on lesion clearance and patient/physician satisfaction. The primary endpoint was the day-21 response [≥ 60% reduction in the modified Local Eczema and Severity Index (mLEASI) score]. Secondary endpoints included facial erythema and pruritus, global clinical response, treatment switching at day 21 and safety. RESULTS Response with tacrolimus ointment (93%) was superior to that with fluticasone (88%; P = 0.026). Improvements in mLEASI components were also greater with tacrolimus ointment. Facial erythema and pruritus improved in both groups. Global clinical response was rated 'marked improvement' or better in 88% and 79% of patients in the tacrolimus ointment and fluticasone groups, respectively. At day 21, 9% of patients switched from fluticasone to tacrolimus ointment, while 4.5% switched from tacrolimus ointment to fluticasone. Adverse events were more frequent with tacrolimus ointment as a result of the higher incidence of application-site skin burning sensation. Safety of both drugs was in line with their respective summary of product characteristics.

Conclusions

Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment has superior efficacy to fluticasone 0.005% ointment for twice-daily treatment of adults with moderate to severe facial AD in whom conventional therapy was inadequately effective or not tolerated. Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment is a safe and effective second-line treatment for the control of moderate to severe AD of the face.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adult patients: part II, safety [^111TXDSg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

In two randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies, a total of 631 adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis applied tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1%) or vehicle twice daily for up to 12 weeks. The mean percent body surface area (%BSA) affected at baseline was 45%, and 56% of patients had severe atopic dermatitis. As previously reported, these studies showed that tacrolimus ointment was superior to vehicle for all efficacy parameters measured. This report focuses on the safety of tacrolimus ointment in these studies. The most common adverse events were the sensation of skin burning, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, skin erythema, and headache. Skin burning and pruritus were more common among patients with severe or extensive disease; these events were usually brief and were resolved during the first few days of treatment. Common adverse events with a significantly higher incidence in one or both of the tacrolimus ointment groups than in the vehicle group included skin burning, flu-like symptoms, and headache. More patients in the vehicle group discontinued the study because of an adverse event than in either of the tacrolimus ointment groups. There were no notable or consistent changes in any laboratory variables. Tacrolimus was not detected in 80% of blood samples collected. Measurable concentrations of tacrolimus were transitory and were not associated with adverse events. Tacrolimus ointment is a safe therapy for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis on the face, neck, or other body regions.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment compared with that of hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children with atopic dermatitis [^113hhrHU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Vehicle-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment with 1% hydrocortisone acetate ointment in children 2 to 15 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD.

Methods

Treatment was twice daily to affected areas for 3 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The primary endpoint was the modified eczema area and severity index (mEASI) mean area under the curve (mAUC) as a percentage of baseline.

Results

Five hundred sixty patients were randomized and received at least one application of ointment. Discontinuations included 21 of 189 patients from the 0.03% tacrolimus group, 13 of 186 patients from the 0.1% tacrolimus group, and 20 of 185 patients from the hydrocortisone acetate group. The median mEASI mAUC as a percentage of baseline showed 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus to be significantly more effective than 1% hydrocortisone acetate (P < .001) and 0.1% tacrolimus to be more effective than 0.03% tacrolimus (P = 0.006). The mEASI mAUC as a percentage of baseline was 44.8%, 39.8%, and 64.0% for patients who received 0.03% tacrolimus, 0.1% tacrolimus, and 1% hydrocortisone acetate, respectively. Transient skin burning was the only adverse event to show a higher incidence in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the hydrocortisone acetate group (P < .05). Laboratory parameters showed no treatment differences and no marked changes over time.

Conclusion

Tacrolimus, 0.03% and 0.1%, was significantly more effective than 1% hydrocortisone acetate and 0.1% tacrolimus was more effective than 0.03% tacrolimus in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in children. No safety concerns were identified.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^116UcDUZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) have been available since 2000. Current TCI agents in use include tacrolimus 0.03% ointment, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, and pimecrolimus 1% cream. Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream are indicated for use in individuals aged two years or older, and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment is approved in those aged 16 years or more (Wollenberg 2020). However, TCI are commonly used in children aged under two years, and this is supported by guideline recommendations (Sidbury 2023; Wollenberg 2020). American Academy of Dermatology guidelines strongly recommend the use of TCI or TCS for managing eczema (Sidbury 2023). The European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) recommends first‐line use of TCI at sensitive sites (with a preference for pimecrolimus in mild eczema and tacrolimus in moderate and severe eczema) and for long‐term topical treatment (Wollenberg 2020). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that TCI are an option for the second‐line treatment of moderate‐to‐severe eczema in individuals aged two years or over "that has not been controlled by TCS or where there is a serious risk of important adverse effects from further TCS use, particularly irreversible skin atrophy" (NICE 2007).

### Adult patients with moderate atopic dermatitis: tacrolimus ointment versus pimecrolimus cream [^115qVmsK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adults with moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). A randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week, multicenter study enrolled patients (≥ 16 years) with mild to very severe AD. Patients with moderate AD at baseline were analyzed. At study completion, tacrolimus ointment-treated patients had significantly greater improvement in Eczema Area Severity Index score compared with pimecrolimus cream-treated patients (59% versus. 43% reduction, respectively; p = 0.01). Significantly more tacrolimus ointment-treated patients than pimecrolimus cream-treated patients improved by 1 or more grades on the Investigators' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (P < .02). A total of 5 pimecrolimus cream-treated patients discontinued the study early due to lack of efficacy compared with no tacrolimus ointment-treated patients (P = 0.02). Overall, reported adverse events occurred at a similar frequency for both treatment groups. Tacrolimus ointment is more effective than pimecrolimus cream in the management of adults with moderate AD.

### Cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus ointment versus pimecrolimus cream in adults with atopic dermatitis [^117K2sUZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tacrolimus 0.1% and pimecrolimus 1.0% are used for short-term and noncontinuous treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in patients unresponsive to conventional therapies.

Objective

To assess the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus versus pimecrolimus in adults with AD.

Methods

Using a Markov cohort model, the authors projected clinical and economic outcomes over six weeks in adults receiving tacrolimus versus pimecrolimus. Cost-effectiveness was assessed in terms of the ratio of the expected cost of AD-related care to the expected number of days with resolved AD.

Results

Patients receiving tacrolimus had an estimated 4.9 fewer days with active AD over six weeks (30.0 versus 34.9 for pimecrolimus). Expected costs (per patient) of AD-related care also were lower for tacrolimus patients ($501.27 versus $546.14, respectively).

Limitation

While pimecrolimus is indicated for use solely in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, the trial on which this study was based included some patients with severe AD.

Conclusion

In adults with AD, tacrolimus 0.1% may yield better clinical outcomes and lower costs of care than pimecrolimus 1.0%.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^116XU9BJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) — facial and intertriginous psoriasis show efficacy in randomized controlled studies despite initial lack of effect in thick plaque. When first studied in their commercially available forms for chronic plaque psoriasis, neither pimecrolimus nor tacrolimus were effective therapies, but in a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study of 167 patients with facial and intertriginous psoriasis, 65% of patients treated with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment were clear or almost clear after 8 weeks of therapy as compared with 31% of patients treated with placebo; and in a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study of 57 patients with intertriginous psoriasis, 71% of the patients treated with pimecrolimus 0.1% cream were clear or almost clear after 8 weeks of twice-daily treatment as compared with 21% of patients treated with placebo. There are no specific precautions for the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of psoriasis; the most common side effect for both medications is burning and itching that generally reduces with ongoing usage and can also be mitigated by not applying immediately after bathing, and this side effect appears to be more significant in patients treated with tacrolimus ointment as compared with patients treated with pimecrolimus cream. In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration implemented a black box warning for tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream because of the lack of long-term safety data and the potential risk for the development of malignancies; however, clinical evidence to date does not reveal any causal link between an increased risk of cancer and the use of either of the topical calcineurin inhibitors. Although some animal studies suggest that the concomitant use of calcineurin inhibitors and ultraviolet light may lead to an increased risk of epithelial tumors, there are no similar observations in humans, and prudence would therefore dictate cautious use of topical calcineurin inhibitors in patients with psoriasis who are being treated with ultraviolet light. Both pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are pregnancy category C, are found in human milk, and thus are not recommended for nursing mothers, and topical tacrolimus (0.03%) ointment and topical pimecrolimus creams are approved for patients as young as 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis.

Topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors

Topical corticosteroids are the primary choice of topical treatment for limited, mild forms of cutaneous cGVHD and are beneficial in papulosquamous, eczematous, lichen planus-like, lichen sclerosis-like, and other superficially sclerotic forms. They can also be helpful in combination with systemic therapy for moderate to severe forms of cutaneous cGVHD. Topical steroids come in a variety of strengths and formulations and choice of the appropriate agent varies depending on the body site affected and severity of rash (Table 2). Cutaneous complications of long-term topical steroid use include dermal atrophy, striae, and telangiectasias, and therefore it is typically recommended that patients take a break from topical steroid use for 1 to 2 weeks per month of use and consider discontinuing or switching to a lower potency topical steroid if adverse effects are observed. Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as topical tacrolimus ointment or topical pimecrolimus cream, can be useful options in areas in which topical steroid side effects would optimally be avoided, such as on the face or lips, or cycled as an alternative to topical steroid use, as they do not carry a risk of atrophy, striae, or telangiectasias. The benefits of topical tacrolimus were demonstrated in several small studies, and in one study the use of topical tacrolimus in addition to systemic therapies benefitted 13/18 cGVHD patients with a reduction in scaling, pain, or tightness. However, caution is advised for the use of tacrolimus ointment on large surface areas as systemic absorption resulting in toxic levels has been reported in cGVHD patients. Neither topical steroids nor topical tacrolimus offer much benefit in deeper sclerotic forms of the disease.

Alternative topical agents

A recently published article detailed the use of topical 5-fluorouracil cream specifically for cGVHD that present in a photo-distributed pattern. The hypothesized benefit results from a decrease in mutational burden in the skin and reduced abnormal epitopes to be targeted by the grafted immune system, however further research is needed. Interim results of a prospective, randomized, vehicle and comparator-controlled phase 2 ongoing trial of topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream in adults with nonsclerotic and superficially sclerotic cGVHD showed a reduction of involved body surface area and improvement in lesion severity on the treatment side versus vehicle side.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment compared with that of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in adult patients with atopic dermatitis [^112FTJcz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Vehicle-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment for patients with atopic dermatitis.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment with 0.1% hydrocortisone-17-butyrate ointment, a midpotent to potent topical corticosteroid, in the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

Methods

Patients applied ointment twice daily to all affected areas for 3 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The primary endpoint was the modified eczema area and severity index (mEASI) mean area under the curve as a percentage of baseline.

Results

Five hundred seventy patients were randomized and received treatment. Discontinuations included 22 of 193 patients from the 0.03% tacrolimus group, 22 of 191 patients from the 0.1% tacrolimus group, and 17 of 186 patients from the hydrocortisone butyrate group. The median mEASI mean area under the curve as a percentage of baseline was 47.0%, 36.5%, and 36.1% for patients who received 0.03% tacrolimus, 0.1% tacrolimus, and 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between 0.1% tacrolimus and 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate; however, the lower improvement in mEASI for 0.03% tacrolimus was statistically significant when compared with 0.1% tacrolimus (P < .001) or hydrocortisone butyrate (P = 0.002). Skin burning and pruritus at the application site showed a higher incidence in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the hydrocortisone butyrate group (P < .05). Laboratory parameters showed no treatment differences and no marked changes over time.

Conclusions

The efficacy of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was similar to that of 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment and was lower for 0.03% tacrolimus ointment. No serious safety concerns were identified.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^11329WHs]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) — recommendations and safety context: Based on a review of studies of TCIs compared to vehicle, there is high certainty evidence to strongly recommend the use of tacrolimus 0.1% and 0.03% ointments to treat AD patients, and in AD patients with mild-to-moderate disease, there is high certainty evidence to strongly recommend pimecrolimus 1% cream; while the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) black box warning of an elevated risk of cancer with TCIs may worry some clinicians and patients, several long-term safety studies suggest an increased relative risk of lymphoma with TCI use but not other cancers, and given the low absolute risk of lymphoma, cancer risk from TCIs is likely not clinically meaningful; though tacrolimus may be more effective clinically, it is only commercially available as an ointment, while pimecrolimus comes as a cream, thus pimecrolimus may be more appropriate for patients who prefer a cream vehicle, have milder disease, or may be more sensitive to local reactions.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing–remitting skin disease characterized by pruritus and skin inflammation. 1 Interactions among skin barrier dysfunction, immune abnormalities and infectious/environmental agents are thought to play roles in the development of AD, although the precise disease pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. 1

Atopic dermatitis usually appears in infancy and childhood (~85% of cases), and more than two‐thirds of pediatric patients with AD outgrow the condition before adolescence. 2 However, approximately 1–3% of adults are also affected. 3 The chronic nature of AD and the requirement for the frequent application of emollients and topical medications mean that its burden is high for patients and the health‐care system.

The main goals of therapy in patients with AD include relieving pruritus, improving skin barrier function, reducing inflammation and preventing flares. 1 Although preventing disease flares requires long‐term management, it has also been suggested that achieving remission with initial therapy may have a "disease‐modifying" effect and therefore play an important role in the long‐term management of AD. 4 The effective treatment of AD is important not only for improving symptoms and quality of life but also for preventing the development of chronic or severe symptoms. The use of topical anti‐inflammatory agents in pediatric patients with AD has been described as an important, potentially disease‐modifying strategy. 5 Therefore, the ideal first‐line pharmacological agents for the treatment of AD should have an excellent safety/tolerability profile as well as reliable anti‐inflammatory efficacy.

Currently recommended first‐line treatments include topical corticosteroids (TCS) and tacrolimus ointment (TAC‐O). 6, 7, 8 Although TCS have potent anti‐inflammatory activity in the maintenance treatment as well as in the crisis intervention, 9, 10 their long‐term use is known to be associated with cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. 11, 12, 13 The occurrence of these side‐effects can decrease patient adherence to topical treatments, sometimes leading to the cessation of TCS. 14, 15

The mechanism of action of TAC‐O differs from those of TCS. 16 Topical tacrolimus inhibits the activation of pro‐inflammatory cells such as T lymphocytes and mast cells 17, 18 and prevents the progression of cytokine‐driven inflammation (Fig. 1).

### Pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: a pilot study on patient preference [^116TVef6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pimecrolimus cream 1% is approved for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children older than two years of age and adults. Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the patient population between two to seventeen years of age and Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients 18 years of age and older. However, beyond safety and efficacy, the delivery system or vehicle used in topical treatment formulations is equally important in affecting patient satisfaction, tolerability, and subsequent treatment compliance and hence clinical resolution of active disease.

### A prospective randomized clinical trial of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in a model of chronic allergic contact dermatitis [^112ZtALn]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Tolerability and safety of 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in treating nickel-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) were evaluated.

Methods

Patients allergic to nickel applied nickel patches to each upper inner aspect of the arm for 4 to 8 hours daily. Tacrolimus was applied to patch site on one arm and vehicle to patch site on the other, twice daily. Physician's Global Assessment, signs and symptoms of ACD, pruritus scores, and adverse events were evaluated.

Results

After 8 weeks, dermatitis in 45% of patients was clear or almost clear (Physician's Global Assessment) with tacrolimus; and 1% with vehicle (P < .001). Significant results were achieved as early as day 8. Tacrolimus was superior in ACD signs and symptoms improvement and pruritus reduction (P < .001). Adverse events were similar between treatments.

Limitations

This model, involving one agent, may not be generalizable for other agents.

Conclusions

Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is well tolerated and significantly more effective than vehicle in treating chronically exposed, nickel-induced ACD.

Clinical Efficacy of Tacrolimus in AD

Several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have summarized the clinical data on TAC‐O in AD. Based on the combined results of 19 studies of calcineurin inhibitors (TAC‐O or pimecrolimus) in patients with AD, TAC‐O 0.03% and 0.1% were more effective than mild TCS and had similar efficacy to that of medium‐potency TCS. 21 In a more recent analysis of calcineurin inhibitor studies, the overall efficacy of TAC‐O 0.1% was at least as good as that of medium‐potency TCS, although TAC‐O 0.03% was less effective. 22 TAC‐O 0.1% was demonstrated to have similar efficacy to those of medium‐ and high‐potency TCS in other analyses. 23, 24 In a meta‐analysis focusing specifically on studies in pediatric patients with AD, there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between TAC‐O 0.03% and 0.1%, and response rates with TAC‐O were higher than those for patients with AD treated with hydrocortisone 1% or pimecrolimus 1% cream. 25 The anti‐inflammatory activity of TAC‐O 0.03% has been defined as equipotent to medium‐ to high‐potency TCS. 26, 27, 28

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111FgozF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In 2003, the Japanese labeling for TAC‐O was updated to include a warning about a possible risk of lymphoma and skin cancer. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit in 2006, issuing a boxed warning requirement for the labeling for two topical calcineurin inhibitors, namely tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and highlighting a possible risk of lymphoma and skin cancer secondary to these agents' effects on the immune system. The FDA's boxed warning and Japanese labeling warning emphasize this theoretical risk by stating that health‐care providers and patients should be aware of the long‐term risks of these products (i.e. their potential to cause cancer) and that the use of these agents in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. 19, 20 Consequently, the European Medicines Agency and many other regulatory authorities took the same actions to increase health professionals' awareness of these risks associated with topical calcineurin inhibitors.

Tacrolimus ointment has been available in Japan for more than 15 years, including the 10 years since the FDA approved the labeling update to include the boxed warning about its carcinogenic potential. Therefore, a review of the safety data of TAC‐O, including its carcinogenic potential, as well as its benefits in patients with AD would be useful at this point. This review of the available published work concludes with a consensus opinion from Japanese pediatric, dermatological and allergology experts.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adult patients: part I, efficacy [^117NFj8v]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A total of 632 adults with atopic dermatitis applied tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.1%) or vehicle twice daily for up to 12 weeks in two randomized, double-blind studies. This report focuses on the efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in these studies. The mean percent body surface area (%BSA) affected at baseline was 45%, and 56% of patients had severe atopic dermatitis. Evaluations included a physician's global evaluation of clinical response, %BSA affected, individual signs of atopic dermatitis, the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, and the patient's assessment of pruritus. A 90% or greater improvement from baseline in disease status was observed for 6.6%, 27.5%, and 36.8% of patients in the vehicle, 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, and 0.1% tacrolimus ointment groups, respectively (P < .001), and 50% or better improvement was observed for 19.8%, 61.6%, and 72.7% of patients, respectively. Tacrolimus ointment-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement than vehicle-treated patients for all efficacy parameters evaluated, including the %BSA affected, the total score and individual scores for signs of atopic dermatitis, the patient's assessment of pruritus, and EASI score. The 0.1% concentration was more effective than the 0.03% concentration, particularly in patients with severe disease and/or extensive BSA involvement at baseline and in African Americans. Tacrolimus ointment is an effective therapy for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis on all skin regions including the head and neck.

### Tacrolimus ointment is more effective than pimecrolimus cream with a similar safety profile in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: results from 3 randomized, comparative studies [^113Ch5ce]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream in adult and pediatric patients with mild to very severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

Methods

One thousand and sixty-five patients were randomized to treatment in 3 multicenter, randomized, investigator-blinded, 6-week studies.

Results

Based on the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), tacrolimus ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus cream at the end of the study in adults (54.1% vs. 34.9%, respectively; P < .0001), in children with moderate/severe disease (67.2% vs. 56.4%, respectively; p = 0.04), in the combined analysis (52.8% vs. 39.1%, respectively; P < .0001), and at week 1 in children with mild disease (39.2% vs. 31.2%, respectively; p = 0.04). Tacrolimus was also more effective than pimecrolimus based on the Investigator Global AD Assessment (IGADA), improvement in percentage of total body surface area affected, and improvement in itch scores (P ≤ .05), with a faster onset of action. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including application site reactions in the 2 studies involving 650 children. Adults treated with tacrolimus experienced a greater number of local application site reactions on day 1; both groups reported a similar incidence of application site reactions thereafter. More pimecrolimus-treated patients than tacrolimus-treated patients withdrew from the studies because of a lack of efficacy (P ≤ .03) or adverse events (P = 0.002; pediatric mild).

Conclusion

Tacrolimus ointment is more effective and has a faster onset of action than pimecrolimus cream in adults and children with AD; their safety profiles are similar.

Clinical Safety of Tacrolimus in AD

The overall tolerability profile of TAC‐O is favorable and serious adverse events are quite rare. The most common adverse events in adults and children are application site reactions including burning and pruritus. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 However, these adverse events are usually transient and decrease in severity after the first few days of treatment. Local irritation associated with TAC‐O is thought to occur through the activation of TRPV1 nociceptors distributed throughout sensory neuron terminals, which is a known mechanism of action of the drug. 31 The attenuation of skin irritation over time has a physiological basis because repeated applications have been shown to desensitize subsequent sensory neuronal activation 31 and eventually nullify the irritant response. 24, 46

Tacrolimus ointment has a potential to increase the risk of cutaneous infections due to its immunosuppressive effect. However, several clinical trials have shown similar frequencies of cutaneous infections in patients treated with TAC‐O and control patients treated with vehicle. 53 A retrospective study including 388 Japanese adult AD patients with total treatment periods ranging 5–17 years revealed that the overall incidence of herpes simplex virus infection during treatment with TAC‐O and TCS did not exceed the incidence in patients with AD. 54 Moreover, it has also been reported that tacrolimus actually reduces the staphylococcal colonization of AD lesions, possibly as a result of reduced skin inflammation and improved skin barrier function. 55 This restoration of skin barrier function has been documented in studies specifically focusing on this issue, showing recovery of the lamellar structure of the skin, 56, 57 and is in contrast to the impairment of skin barrier function associated with long‐term TCS use.

Justification for a Class Labeling?

The FDA applies pharmacological classes to drugs in order to help prescribers avoid duplicative therapy and drug interactions. In order to maintain consistency, the agency considers applying warnings, contraindications, and boxed warnings to all members of a pharmacological class; however, it does allow for these to be applied to a single member of a class if the benefit–risk ratio is shown to apply to only one member. Low systemic exposure with TCIs and striking differences between pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment in terms of pharmacology and clinical development programs might justify reconsideration of class labeling and/or warnings.

Low Systemic Exposure

Many studies with both pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment have shown systemic exposure to be low after topical treatment in AD patients as young as 3 months of age. In a head-to-head comparison study, the highest blood concentrations detected in adults with moderate-to-severe AD were 1.51 ng/mL in the pimecrolimus cream group and 2.39 ng/mL in the tacrolimus ointment group, both of which are substantially below target trough concentrations for systemic immunosuppression for tacrolimus (5–20 ng/mL) in transplant patients. In infants, blood concentrations are similar to those seen in adults with no evidence of accumulation for up to 1 year. The highest blood concentrations reported for infants with pimecrolimus cream 1% range from 1.8 to 4.14 ng/mL and the average maximum concentration with tacrolimus ointment 0.03% was 3% of that observed in pediatric liver-transplant patients receiving oral tacrolimus.

In vitro skin penetration (into) for each compound is approximately equal, but skin permeation (through) is greater for tacrolimus ointment than pimecrolimus cream. When comparing relative permeation in normal versus inflamed or corticosteroid-pretreated skin, both compounds permeated inflamed and corticosteroid-pretreated skin to a greater extent (up to a factor of 6 times greater than normal skin). Thus, exposure to TCIs is self-limiting — as skin barrier function is restored, exposure decreases. There is also the argument that pediatric patients may have greater systemic exposure because of their greater body surface area to weight ratio. In the head-to-head trial, when blood concentrations after tacrolimus ointment application were analyzed by total body surface area (TBSA) affected by AD, they were detectable in more patients as TBSA affected by AD increased.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111oLm5w]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of the boxed US FDA warning for topical calcineurin inhibitors and the warning in Japanese labeling for TAC‐O has had a number of negative consequences. Prescription rates decreased and some health‐care payers introduced additional hurdles for physicians and patients such as health‐care payment restrictions, making it more difficult to access these agents. 19 The results of an anonymous survey of US dermatology conference attendees in 2007 (after the boxed warning was issued) showed that changes to therapies based on the warning were associated with a loss of disease control in some patients whose conditions were previously well controlled using topical calcineurin inhibitors. 91 In addition, the therapies chosen to replace topical calcineurin inhibitors, including TCS, systemic corticosteroids and other systemic immunosuppressants, often had worse tolerability profiles and risk–benefit ratios than the treatment they replaced. Some physicians also felt that the warnings would be a deterrent to participation in future clinical trials, limiting the ability to accurately determine the real risk of malignancy during long‐term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors. 92

Several investigators pointed out that "topical corticosteroid phobia" encompasses concerns, fears, worries, anxiety, sorrow and doubts about TCS use. The term "topical corticosteroid phobia" was suggested to be a misnomer because the concerns have a rational background of available evidence. 93, 94, 95 Instead, it has been proposed to use the term "corticosteroid concerns" rather than "corticosteroid phobia" in future discussions. 95 On the other hand, in the case of topical calcineurin inhibitors, we believe that we should use the term "topical calcineurin inhibitor phobia" rather than "topical calcineurin inhibitor concerns" for the warning on malignancies due to the lack of established scientific evidence.

Background

Regulatory History of the Boxed Warning for TCIs

Tacrolimus ointment 0.03 and 0.1% [Protopic ®; owned and developed by Fujisawa (now Astellas)] and pimecrolimus cream 1% (Elidel ®; developed by Novartis, Meda acquired global rights to Elidel ® in 2011 and immediately licensed North American rights to Valeant) are TCIs, which inhibit transcription and release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from T cells. In December 2000, tacrolimus ointment was approved for "short-term and intermittent long-term therapy in the treatment of patients (≥ 2 years of age) with moderate to severe AD in whom the use of alternative, conventional therapies is deemed inadvisable because of potential risks, or in the treatment of patients who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of alternative, conventional therapies". At that time, no efficacy or safety studies had been conducted with tacrolimus in infants, and the approved indication was limited to patients at least 2 years of age. One year later, in December 2001, pimecrolimus cream was approved with a similar indication for mild-to-moderate AD with similar warnings and contraindications based on pharmacological class. In contrast to tacrolimus, data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus were available at the time of application for 436 infants who had participated in clinical trials. On the basis of the "disproportionately higher incidence of adverse events, particularly viral infections in infants", seen in these trials, the approved indication was limited to patients 2 years of age and older. To further investigate the long-term safety of both drugs, the FDA requested post-approval commitments from both companies to establish pediatric registries.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^1157whVL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease, affecting an estimated 16.5 million adults and 9.6 million children in the United States (US). This chronic condition often begins in the first few years of life and may persist into adulthood; however, adolescent and adult-onset disease are increasingly recognized. The pathogenesis of AD is complex but involves a dysregulated immune system and a compromised skin barrier. Mainstay therapy for acute management includes topical corticosteroids (TCSs) or non-steroidal alternatives including topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as crisaborole ointment.

Since the 1950s, TCSs have remained the standard of care due to their ability to reduce skin inflammation and pruritus. However, long-term use may cause localized skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, perioral dermatitis, and acne. With extensive use, there is also the rare risk of systemic absorption, which may lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, adversely affecting the linear growth and bone density of children and adults, respectively. As a result, patients and caregivers often underutilize TCSs due to fear of side effects, termed "steroid phobia".

TCIs have been approved (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in 2000 and 2001, respectively) for short-term or intermittent use in patients who have previously failed on, or have contraindications to, TCSs. These second-line agents act as immunosuppressants and inhibit T cell activation, decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Tacrolimus 0.03% and 0.1% ointments are approved for adults and 0.03% for children aged 2–15 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is indicated for non-immunocompromised adults and children aged ≥ 2 years with mild-to-moderate AD. Although these TCIs do not carry the risk of skin atrophy, they can cause local adverse effects of skin burning and irritation. In addition, a black box warning was added by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 regarding the hypothetical risk that TCIs may increase long-term cancer risk in individuals with AD; however, findings from multiple studies have not shown increased risks with their use.

### Long-term results of topical 0.02% tacrolimus ointment for refractory ocular surface inflammation in pediatric patients [^112ctDQD]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

We defined those cases that showed persistence of symptoms and signs despite receiving a topical 0.12 or 1% prednisone acetate or use of systemic steroids treatment for more than 3 months, cases in which there was a relapse after tapering or withdrawal of steroids, and cases in which steroid-related complications developed as "refractory to conventional treatment". The "refractory to conventional treatment" patients were prescribed with topical 0.02% tacrolimus ointment as an adjunct immunosuppressive therapy in addition to previous steroid treatments.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with history of tacrolimus eye drops, ocular bacterial infection, ocular herpetic infection, ocular chemical injury, previous ocular trauma, and contact lens wearer. The following information at the beginning and each follow-up (every month up to 3 months, and every 3 months after that) was obtained from a retrospective chart review: demographic data including diagnosis, systemic disease, clinical features, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), disease severity (symptom and sign score), steroid score, and presence of any adverse reaction. Disease severity was classified as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to a grading system out of four points (0 to 3 points) based on symptoms and signs (Table 1). Clinical outcomes were assessed using the same grading system. The primary measure of treatment efficacy was a decrease the composite score of symptoms and signs. The changes in the composite score of symptoms and signs were compared between baseline and after the treatment. The slit-lamp examinations and a questionnaire to subject symptoms were conducted by a single clinician (KYS) for consistency. Pediatric patients usually do not allow good slit lamp examination. In case of poor cooperation of the patients, slit lamp examination was performed using portable slit lamp.

PRECAUTIONS

General

The use of PROTOPIC Ointment should be avoided on pre-malignant
and malignant skin conditions. Some malignant skin conditions, such as cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), may mimic atopic dermatitis.

The use of PROTOPIC Ointment in patients with Netherton's Syndrome or other
skin diseases where there is the potential for increased systemic absorption of
tacrolimus is not recommended. The safety of PROTOPIC Ointment has not been
established in patients with generalized erythroderma.

The use of PROTOPIC Ointment may cause local symptoms such as skin burning
(burning sensation, stinging, soreness) or pruritus. Localized symptoms are most
common during the first few days of PROTOPIC Ointment application and typically
improve as the lesions of atopic dermatitis resolve. With PROTOPIC Ointment
0.1%, 90% of the skin burning events had a duration between 2 minutes and 3
hours (median 15 minutes). 90% of the pruritus events had a duration between 3
minutes and 10 hours (median 20 minutes). (see ADVERSE
REACTIONS).

Bacterial and Viral Skin Infections

Before commencing treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment, cutaneous
bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved. Studies
have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of PROTOPIC Ointment in the treatment
of clinically infected atopic dermatitis.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111vZGUj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

One of the important effects of TAC‐O is its ability to relieve pruritus. 29, 30 This is thought to be attributed to desensitization of the cutaneous sensory neurons. 31, 32 TAC‐O has also been shown to decrease neuropeptide levels in the lesional skin of patients with AD, suggesting that interference with neurogenic tissue inflammation is a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of TAC‐O. 33 Data from an in vitro study of human mast cells suggest that the subsets of chemokines inhibited by tacrolimus differ from those inhibited by corticosteroids, 34 raising the possibility that combination treatment may be more effective than either individual agent alone and highlighting the importance of individualizing the choice of therapeutic agents in patients with AD.

The effective treatment of AD with TAC‐O has been associated with improved quality of life both in pediatric 35, 36 and adult patients. 37 In a study of 30 pediatric patients with AD, significant improvements in overall quality of life obtained in the first week of therapy maintained throughout the 4‐week study period, as well as the improvements in erythema and papulation scores, pruritus and sleeplessness. 35 In adult patients with AD, data from a double‐blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 6‐month treatment with TAC‐O 0.1% and TCS showed that TAC‐O was associated with a clinically significant improvement of quality of life that was sustained throughout the treatment period and that quality of life improvements with TAC‐O were significantly greater than those with TCS. 37

The conventional treatment approach to managing AD has consisted of a combination of daily application of emollients combined with the application of topical anti‐inflammatory agents (TCS or topical calcineurin inhibitors) as required to manage visible skin lesions. More recently, a proactive approach to the long‐term management of AD has been investigated. This approach includes intensive topical anti‐inflammatory treatment of visible lesions until clearance has been obtained followed by the intermittent application of low‐dose anti‐inflammatory agents to these areas to prevent disease flares. 9, 10, 38 This approach is based on evidence that although skin may appear normal after the resolution of an AD episode, a number of defects persist, including impaired barrier function and subclinical inflammation. 39, 40 Proactive treatment with TAC‐O has been shown to prevent, delay and reduce the occurrence of disease exacerbations in adults and children with AD. 38, 41, 42, 43, 44 Long‐term TAC‐O treatment may also help attenuate the progression of AD to allergic rhinitis or bronchial asthma, the so‐called "atopic march". 45

### Understanding economic evidence for the prevention and treatment of atopic eczema [^11168XPb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cost‐effectiveness results for interventions to prevent and treat eczema

Ten studies (described in 11 papers) undertook full economic evaluations. 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 40, 42, 46, 52, 56, 59 Interventions estimated to be dominant (more effective and less expensive) included tacrolimus ointment; 20 ciclosporin; 56 care by a nurse practitioner; 40 and care package with access to an electronic eczema portal. 42 Two interventions were judged to be cost‐effective (i.e. they had higher costs that were justified by greater effectiveness given societies willingness to pay for health gain): fluticasone propionate (twice‐daily application) 52 and tacrolimus ointment. 18 Silk clothing, along with standard care, 13 ion‐exchange water softener, 14 homeopathy, 59 Atopiclair and EpiCeram, 46 were dominated (cost more and were less effective than their comparators). It should be noted that such statements lack usefulness without knowing the perspective, time frame, precise detail of the comparator, country of study, etc. for each study. That different economic evaluations of the same intervention can reach different conclusions is illustrated here by tacrolimus ointment. In the study that required a judgement to be made about cost‐effectiveness, 18 tacrolimus ointment was compared with hydrocortisone ointment, whereas the economic evaluation finding tacrolimus ointment to be dominant was comparing it with usual care. 20 Therefore, we provide fuller details in Table S3 (see Supporting Information) to aid interpretation of the results.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^116DhtmP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

A large retrospective cohort observational study based on an integrated health‐care insurance database (follow‐up duration, 2–2.5 years) has shown an increased risk for cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma in eczema patients with the use of TAC‐O, but not pimecrolimus, compared with patients who were not exposed to topical calcineurin inhibitors. 79 There was an increase in the risk of T‐cell lymphoma in patients treated with TAC‐O at higher concentrations and cumulative doses, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. On the other hand, when compared with the general population, an increased risk for cutaneous lymphoma with the use of TAC‐O, pimecrolimus and TCS has been reported, but needed longer‐term studies for the conclusion. 80

Based on the results of these investigations, the risk for malignancies associated with topical calcineurin inhibitors is best addressed by the systematic review on the efficacy, safety and cost‐effectiveness of topical calcineurin inhibitors in AD. 22 It has been suggested that the lymphoma diagnosed after treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitor was pre‐existing cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma, which often initially presents as an eczematous rash and may be misdiagnosed as AD, leading to overestimation of the association between topical calcineurin inhibitors and lymphoma. 71, 75, 79 In a Japanese postmarketing surveillance study of pediatric patients with AD being treated with TAC‐O 0.03%, no cases of treatment‐related malignancy have been identified over 7 years of a planned 10‐year follow up. 81

The PAC convened 15 months later in February 2005 to review the results of a newly completed oral carcinogenicity study conducted in monkeys (the results of which are discussed in detail in Sect. 3.1) as well as additional AERS malignancy reports. The concerns of the PAC were elevated in part by the manufacturers' marketing efforts, escalating TCI sales, and a higher rate of off-label use. On the basis of the recommendation made at this meeting, the FDA issued a public health advisory in March 2005 and a requirement in January 2006 for revised labeling for both products to include a boxed warning ('black box') and medication guide ('patient medi guide') to address a theoretical risk of lymphoma and to emphasize that the safety of long-term continuous use and use in patients 2 years of age and younger had not been established. In addition, the indications were modified to specify that TCIs are " second-line [emphasis added] therapy for short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment… of [AD] in non-immunocompromised adults and children [≥ 2 years of age] who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments, or when those treatments are not advisable". This was the first time that the FDA required that a boxed warning be issued on the basis of a theoretical risk rather than proven safety concerns.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing pruritic inflammatory skin disease associated with skin barrier dysfunction, intense pruritus and eczematous skin lesions. 1, 2 AD is estimated to affect 15–30% of children and 2–10% of adults in industrialized countries and causes significant impairments in health‐related quality of life from disease symptoms and the stigma associated with a highly visible skin condition. 1, 3 Corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are topically used for AD patients but these drugs have some limitations. Long‐term use of topical corticosteroids is associated with specific cutaneous adverse reactions such as atrophy and telangiectasia, frequently leading to steroid phobia due to the misunderstanding of the adverse reactions of systemic modalities. 2 It causes poor treatment adherence and inadequate responses to treatments. Tacrolimus ointment is highly associated with skin irritation symptoms at the application site, such as a burning sensation and hot flushes, appearing often during the early phase of treatment. 4 Also, tacrolimus ointment has a possibility of increased risk of local skin infections. 4

### Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus: from clever prokaryotes to inhibiting calcineurin and treating atopic dermatitis [^1113V5dd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus ointment, a topical inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, has recently been approved in the United States for use in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. It is the first topical immune suppressant that is not one of the hydrocortisone derivatives, important allies in dermatology for nearly 50 years. Although tacrolimus is less able to penetrate thick skin than glucocorticoids, it does not cause dermal atrophy, an important advantage over the hydrocortisone class. Pimecrolimus (ASM 981), a newer calcineurin inhibitor closely related to tacrolimus, is also being developed for atopic dermatitis therapy. Pimecrolimus has an altered skin penetration profile but the same mechanism of action as tacrolimus. In this review we chronicle the discovery of the calcineurin inhibitors, their presumed evolutionary role as a bacterial "smart bomb" against fungi, molecular and cellular mechanisms of action in the immune system, systemic and topical side effects, efficacy in atopic dermatitis, and future applications within the specialty of dermatology. Particular attention is given to the issues of systemic absorption of tacrolimus, the conditions in which absorption can become a concern, efficacy relative to glucocorticoids, and the choice of 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for use in adults and children.

### Efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone aceponate ointment 0.1% compared to tacrolimus 0.03% in children and adolescents with an acute flare of severe atopic dermatitis [^116ZwBoU]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Topical glucocorticosteroids are the gold standard in treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Recently, topical calcineurin inhibitors have been developed for treatment of this condition. This study compared efficacy and safety of 0.1% methylprednisolone aceponate (MPA) ointment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment for 3 weeks, in children and adolescents with severe to very severe flare of AD.

Methods

The primary end point was treatment success, defined as a score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' in the static Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score. Secondary end points were the percentage change in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and patients' assessment of itch and sleep, Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index, patient's assessment of global response, affected Body Surface Area and medication costs.

Results

265 patients were randomized to either MPA (n = 129) or tacrolimus (n = 136) treatment, 257 patients completed the study. Methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% ointment once daily provided rapid and relevant clinical benefit. Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment twice daily was equally effective with regard to success rate. Methylprednisolone aceponate was superior to tacrolimus for EASI, itch and sleep. Both treatments were well tolerated. Drug-related adverse events were only observed in the tacrolimus group. Medication costs were significantly lower for MPA.

Conclusions

While both treatment groups showed similar efficacy results regarding treatment success (IGA), significant advantages were observed for EASI, itch and sleep with MPA 0.1%. These advantages and the significantly lower treatment costs highlight the benefits of MPA treatment, underlining its first-line role in treatment of children and adolescents with severe AD.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^114SMkPW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Calcineurin inhibitors for psoriasis — efficacy, use context, and safety are summarized as follows: Although not FDA approved for psoriasis, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are often used in the treatment of psoriasis, are especially helpful on thinner skin such as facial and intertriginous areas, and are used as steroid-sparing agents for prolonged use (> 4 weeks). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) report benefits: in a double-blind RCT of 57 patients with intertriginous psoriasis, after 8 weeks of twice-daily treatment, 71% of the patients in the pimecrolimus 0.1% cream group were clear or almost clear compared with 21% of patients in the placebo group (treatment difference in target area score was −1.810; 95% confidence interval −2.801 to −0.819), and in a double-blind RCT of 167 patients with facial and intertriginous psoriasis, after 8 weeks of therapy, 65% of patients in the tacrolimus 0.1% ointment group were clear or almost clear compared with 31% of patients in the placebo group. The off-label combination of tacrolimus and 6% salicylic acid for 12 weeks may be used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Reported risks include burning and pruritus, which generally improve with continued use and can be mitigated by avoiding application to moist skin, and in 2005 the FDA issued a boxed warning citing concerns that long-term, intermittent use of pimecrolimus or tacrolimus could lead to an increased incidence of lymphoma.

Optimal Use of TCIs

Most treatment algorithms recommend regular use of emollients for control of dry skin with short-term TCS for treatment of AD flares. Under certain circumstances, TCIs are a more appropriate first-line choice and/or useful adjunct to TCS.
As a corticosteroid-sparing agent: Reducing the risks of chronic TCS exposure is important, especially in children treated with intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroids for other atopic diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. The corticosteroid-sparing effect of pimecrolimus cream has been demonstrated in clinical trials. A reduced number of flares and prolonged time-to-flare quantified in tacrolimus ointment clinical trials also supports a corticosteroid-sparing effect.
To treat face and skin fold disease: Skin atrophy, perioral dermatitis, and increased percutaneous absorption are TCS risks prompting greatest concern in patients with inflammatory skin disease involving sensitive skin areas on the face, eyelids, and diaper area. TCIs are well suited for use in these areas due to low acnegenic and atrophogenic potential.
To simplify treatment regimens: Risks associated with TCS use are highest with more potent products, especially when applied to sensitive skin areas. To minimize these risks, a popular approach is to recommend a two-drug treatment regimen using a lower potency TCS on the face and a higher potency product on the body. Patients are often confused about the appropriate drug to use on the affected sites, and monitoring the optimal quantity used can also be complicated. Maintenance treatment with a TCI requires use of only one product on all affected sites. This not only simplifies treatment for the patient, but also allows easier monitoring of drug quantity used over time.
For children who require daily treatment: Safety of TCS has been studied for durations of no longer than 4 weeks for a limited number of products. In contrast, safety of TCIs for durations of up to 1 year has been documented in several prospective trials and registries.
In patients who are TCS intolerant or dependent: Well-described but under-recognized complications of long-term use of TCS include delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, and rebound erythroderma. Neither pimecrolimus cream nor tacrolimus ointment carry these risks.
In patients with confirmed or suspected skin infection: 'In cognito' TCS-associated skin infections are another complication that has been well-described but underappreciated. The proposed mechanism of action is via dendritic cells and antigen presentation. In contrast, TCIs do not affect the differentiation, maturation, or function of dendritic cells. Clinical trials have not identified an increased incidence of skin infection for either TCI.

Black Box and Japanese Labeling Safety Risk of Skin Cancer or Lymphoma

There is currently no strong evidence supporting the boxed warning requirement issued by the US FDA and the warning of Japanese labeling regarding the use of TAC‐O in the treatment of AD. These warnings themselves actually state that a causal relationship between malignancy and topical calcineurin inhibitor use has not been established. 20

The risk of malignancy in chronically immunosuppressed human organ transplant recipients has been well documented. 58, 59 For liver transplantation, the p.o. or i.v. administration of immunosuppressants, such as calcineurin inhibitors including tacrolimus, has been reported to be associated with the development of malignancy and lymphoma. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 Systemic immunosuppression is thought to be a mechanism underlying the development of cancer in human organ transplant recipients receiving systemic treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor. 65, 66 In both animals and humans receiving oral immunosuppressants, the extent of systemic drug exposure resulting in systemic immune suppression is significantly greater than that after use of TAC‐O. 19 In fact, systemic drug exposure after TAC‐O administration is absent or minimal, 47, 67, 68 and no immunosuppression was observed after 1–4 years' intermittent treatment with TAC‐O. 69

Skin malignancies and lymphoma have been reported in animals after topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment. The carcinogenic effect of topical tacrolimus was investigated using a mouse model and some tumor‐promoting effects were noted. 70 Mice naturally have thinner skin and more fragile skin barriers than humans. In the carcinogenicity study using mice, TAC‐O was applied to a large area for 2 years. This resulted in much higher systemic drug concentrations than those in patients during routine topical treatment of AD at recommended drug doses. 71 Data from a study using an initiation/promotion mouse model of cutaneous carcinogenesis designed to investigate the carcinogenic effects of TAC‐O showed that TAC‐O 0.03% or 0.1% actually had an inhibitory effect on skin neoplasms. 72 This was thought to be secondary to the inhibition of 12‐ O ‐tetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate promotion without any immunosuppressive effects. Furthermore, animal studies showing the development of lymphoma after the application of topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, another topical calcineurin inhibitor available in the world so far, used drugs dissolved in ethanol at concentrations 26 and 47 times the maximum recommended human dose, respectively. 73

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors in atopic dermatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116j28ZE]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To build a critical appraisal of the available literature to evaluate the effectiveness of topical calcineurin inhibitors in treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD), in comparison to topical corticosteroids (TCs) and/or placebo.

Design

systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

electronic search of MEDLINE Pubmed along the last 10 years (1997–2006).

Study Selection

randomized control trials of TCIs reporting efficacy outcomes, in comparison to TCs or vehicle (placebo) or both.

Data Synthesis

of 210 articles, 19 studies were included, 10 for tacrolimus and 9 for pimecrolimus, involving 7378 patients of whom 2771 applied tacrolimus, 1783 applied pimecrolimus, and 2824 were controls. Both drugs were significantly more effective than a vehicle. However, two long-term trials comparing demonstrated the value of pimecrolimus in reduction of flares and steroid-sparing effect after 6 months. Compared to TCs, both 0.1% and 0.03% tacrolimus ointments were as effective as moderate potency TCs, and more effective than a combined steroid regimen. Tacrolimus was more effective than mild TCs.

Conclusions

TCIs in AD are more effective than placebo. Although less effective than TCs, pimecrolimus has its value in long-term maintenance and as a steroid-sparing agent in AD, whenever used early enough, at first appearance of erythema and/or itching. In treatment of moderate to severe AD, topical tacrolimus is as effective as moderately potent TCs, and more effective than mild preparations. Chronic AD lesions of the face and flexures are the most justified indication for topical calcineurin inhibitors.

### Topical tacrolimus for eczema… [^1144fXmR]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer For children and adults with moderate to severe eczema, topical tacrolimus is an effective, albeit costly, alternative to topical corticosteroids. Both tacrolimus strengths are superior to low-potency topical corticosteroids, whereas tacrolimus 0. 1% has similar effectiveness to moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroids. A mild, self-limited, local burning sensation is common with use.

1. One study reported on the use of once-daily tacrolimus dosing, whereas two studies reported on the use of twice-daily tacrolimus dosing. In one of the studies, patients and physicians reported more improvement at six months with tacrolimus 0.

1% than did patients and physicians in the topical corticosteroids group. In three studies of 543 patients, tacrolimus 0. 1% was better than pimecrolimus 1% in achieving physician-assessed global improvement. Tacrolimus 0. 03% was also somewhat better than pimecrolimus 1% in one study of 139 children. When comparing the two tacrolimus potencies in six studies of 1, 640 patients, the 0. 1% potency led to modestly superior physician-assessed improvement scores. Regarding tacrolimus use in children, there was no significant difference in the outcome of physician-assessed improvement when patients received once-daily vs. twice-daily dosing, nor between patients treated with high- vs. low-potency strengths.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated labeling on January 19, 2006 for two topical eczema drugs, Elidel Cream and Protopic Ointment. The new labeling includes a boxed warning about a possible risk of cancer and a Medication Guide. The Medication Guide is to be distributed with each prescription to help ensure that patients using these prescription medicines are aware of this concern. The new labeling also clarifies that these drugs are recommended for use as second-line treatments. This means that other prescription topical medicines should be tried first.
