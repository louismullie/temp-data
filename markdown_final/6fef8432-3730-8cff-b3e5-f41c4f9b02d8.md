## Question

Cellulite antibiotic therayp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cellulitis antibiotic therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology because "cellulite" is a cosmetic term, not an infection. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and how often cultures help. Next, I will review severity classification and empiric antibiotic choices by severity, including MRSA risk factors. After that, I should confirm duration of therapy and whether shorter courses are effective. I will then examine route of therapy and outpatient versus inpatient management. I also need to check special populations and scenarios, consider adjunctive measures, and finally address prevention of recurrence and summarize a practical algorithm with caveats about diagnostic uncertainty and stewardship.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are discussing cellulitis, not cellulite. Cellulite refers to cosmetic dimpling of the skin and is not treated with antibiotics, whereas cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that requires antimicrobial therapy, so I will proceed assuming cellulitis is the intended topic [^e957fa91].

> Next, I should review the likely pathogens and the role of cultures. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: most cases of nonpurulent cellulitis are nonculturable, and when organisms are identified, beta-hemolytic streptococci predominate, with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus as a secondary pathogen; MRSA is less common in nonpurulent cellulitis unless specific risk factors are present, so routine cultures are not recommended for typical cases [^e957fa91] [^955c5117].

> I will now examine severity classification because empiric therapy hinges on it. Mild nonpurulent cellulitis lacks systemic signs, moderate nonpurulent cellulitis has systemic features without shock, and severe nonpurulent cellulitis includes sepsis, immunocompromise, or concern for necrotizing infection; this framework guides both antibiotic selection and disposition, so I should confirm that I align with IDSA's categorization before choosing agents [^955c5117].

> For mild nonpurulent cellulitis, I should confirm that streptococcal coverage is sufficient. IDSA recommends an antibiotic active against streptococci as first-line, and multiple high-quality sources support a 5–6 day course as effective when patients can self-monitor and have close follow-up; options include penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalexin, or dicloxacillin, and routine MRSA coverage is not indicated here [^955c5117] [^1ae48964] [^d3b916cf].

> Wait, let me verify the MRSA question for nonpurulent disease. A randomized trial adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin in uncomplicated cellulitis without abscess showed no improvement in outcomes, reinforcing that routine MRSA coverage is unnecessary in this scenario; I should also remember that clindamycin has unreliable streptococcal activity, so if I consider it, I need to ensure adequate streptococcal coverage or pair it with a beta-lactam [^7ab94428] [^4da44506].

> For moderate nonpurulent cellulitis, I need to ensure I cover both streptococci and MSSA. IDSA suggests systemic therapy and allows consideration of MSSA coverage; reasonable oral choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or dicloxacillin, reserving MRSA-active agents for patients with specific risk factors such as penetrating trauma, prior MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS, in which case vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or oral options like clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX are appropriate depending on severity and route [^955c5117] [^268fb36a] [^4da44506].

> For severe nonpurulent cellulitis or when necrotizing infection is suspected, I should confirm that broad-spectrum empiric therapy is indicated. IDSA recommends vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem for severe infection, with early source control if necrotizing features are present; I need to ensure rapid escalation and surgical consultation when red flags arise [^955c5117] [^5d934d82].

> Now, duration of therapy: I initially thought 7–10 days might be standard, but wait, I should double-check the evidence. Contemporary guidance supports 5–6 days for uncomplicated cellulitis if the patient is improving, with extension only if there is inadequate response; a randomized trial in severe cellulitis suggested higher relapse with 6 versus 12 days, but that study's wide confidence intervals and different population mean it does not overturn the 5–6 day recommendation for uncomplicated cases, so I should individualize by severity and response [^1ae48964] [^d3b916cf] [^4048f35a].

> I need to check the route of administration and outpatient eligibility. Most patients with uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed as outpatients with oral therapy; hospitalization is warranted for hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, severe immunocompromise, failure of outpatient therapy, or concern for deeper infection; in children, randomized data show home IV ceftriaxone is noninferior to hospital IV flucloxacillin, supporting outpatient parenteral therapy when appropriate [^955c5117] [^5c1a4102].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy, beta-lactams such as cephalexin are preferred; in pediatrics, cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate are common choices, with clindamycin reserved for beta-lactam allergy or when MRSA is suspected; in patients with chronic edema or lymphedema, I should treat predisposing factors and consider prophylaxis if recurrences are frequent; for diabetic foot infections, durations are longer and broader coverage may be needed depending on severity and presence of osteomyelitis [^fc42512e] [^f2548904].

> Next, I should review adjunctive measures because they meaningfully affect outcomes. Elevation of the affected limb, meticulous skin care, treatment of tinea pedis or toe-web abnormalities, and management of edema reduce recurrence and improve response; in nondiabetic adults, a short course of systemic corticosteroids can accelerate clinical improvement when combined with antibiotics, though I need to screen for contraindications and use judiciously [^83fdbfec] [^fda290f2].

> I will now examine prevention of recurrence, since this is a major driver of morbidity. For patients with three or more episodes per year despite addressing predisposing factors, IDSA suggests prophylactic antibiotics such as oral penicillin V or macrolides, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin, continued as long as risk factors persist; randomized and meta-analytic data show substantial reductions in recurrence during prophylaxis, though protection wanes after cessation, so I should couple pharmacologic prophylaxis with risk-factor modification [^becddefb] [^54035c6b] [^75bced06].

> But wait, what if the diagnosis is wrong? I should confirm that diagnostic uncertainty is common and that misclassification can bias treatment and trials. Approximately 30% of patients admitted with suspected lower-limb cellulitis are ultimately diagnosed otherwise, so I need to actively consider mimics such as venous stasis dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, gout, or contact dermatitis, and use bedside ultrasound when abscess is suspected to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and procedures [^e43f10ed] [^c86d6864].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis warrants 5–6 days of an oral beta-lactam active against streptococci, with close follow-up and extension only if not improved; moderate disease adds MSSA coverage and MRSA therapy if risk factors are present; severe disease requires broad-spectrum IV therapy with early source control; throughout, address predisposing skin and edema factors, and consider prophylaxis for frequent recurrences, aligning with IDSA and ACP guidance [^955c5117] [^1ae48964] [^d3b916cf].

> Finally, I should double-check stewardship principles to avoid overtreatment. Avoid routine MRSA coverage in nonpurulent cellulitis, prefer single-agent therapy, and target the shortest effective duration; these choices reduce adverse effects, resistance, and cost without compromising outcomes, and they are supported by randomized data and meta-analyses showing no advantage to broader or longer empiric regimens in typical cellulitis [^7ab94428] [^0f35b49d] [^418fd95e].

Cellulitis is best treated with **5–6 days of oral beta-lactam therapy** (cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or amoxicillin) for uncomplicated cases, as this achieves high cure rates and minimizes resistance [^1ae48964] [^d3b916cf]. MRSA coverage is **not routinely needed** unless there are specific risk factors (prior MRSA, penetrating trauma, purulence, or severe infection) [^4da44506] [^268fb36a]. If MRSA is suspected, use clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX, and add a beta-lactam if streptococcal coverage is needed [^4da44506] [^aa0c7f7d]. Extend therapy to 10–14 days for slow response, severe disease, or immunocompromise [^82705a35] [^a90fb55d]. Hospitalize for systemic toxicity, failed outpatient therapy, or concern for necrotizing infection, and use IV cefazolin or vancomycin when MRSA is likely [^955c5117] [^5d934d82].

---

## Empiric antibiotic selection

Empiric therapy should cover the **most common pathogens**, primarily beta-hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA) [^e957fa91]. MRSA coverage is not routinely required unless risk factors are present [^4da44506].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated, nonpurulent cellulitis | - Cephalexin <br/> - Dicloxacillin <br/> - Amoxicillin [^d3b916cf] |
| Penicillin allergy (non-anaphylactic) | - Clindamycin <br/> - Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) [^d3b916cf] |
| Penicillin allergy (anaphylactic) | - Clindamycin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - TMP-SMX (add beta-lactam for streptococcal coverage) [^4da44506] |
| MRSA risk factors (prior MRSA, penetrating trauma, purulence, severe infection) | - Clindamycin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - TMP-SMX <br/> - Vancomycin (IV) [^4da44506] [^268fb36a] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated cellulitis is 5–6 days [^1ae48964] [^d3b916cf]. This duration balances efficacy with minimizing antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Clinical improvement is typically expected within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, reassess the diagnosis, consider alternative diagnoses, and extend therapy to 10–14 days for slow response, severe infection, or immunocompromised patients [^d2fd611f] [^82705a35].

---

## Route of administration

Oral antibiotics are effective for most patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^e957fa91]. Intravenous therapy is reserved for patients with **severe infection**, systemic toxicity, failed outpatient therapy, or inability to tolerate oral medications [^955c5117]. Recent studies show that oral therapy is comparable to intravenous therapy in selected patients, supporting outpatient management when clinically appropriate [^418fd95e].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Clinical improvement — reduced erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain — is expected within 48–72 hours of initiating therapy. If there is no improvement within this timeframe, reassess the diagnosis, evaluate for complications (e.g. abscess, necrotizing infection), and consider alternative diagnoses such as deep vein thrombosis or vasculitis [^e957fa91]. Follow-up should occur within 48–72 hours to ensure **adequate response** and adherence to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Management of treatment failure

Treatment failure, defined as lack of clinical improvement or deterioration after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, necessitates reassessment of the diagnosis, antibiotic selection, and patient factors. Consider obtaining cultures, imaging (ultrasound or MRI) to exclude abscess or necrotizing infection, and adjusting antibiotic therapy based on culture results and local resistance patterns [^7fabfe87] [^c86d6864].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Oral beta-lactams (cephalexin, amoxicillin) are first-line therapy. Intravenous ceftriaxone is effective for moderate to severe infections and can be administered at home in selected cases [^5c1a4102].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for gram-negative organisms, may be necessary based on clinical judgment and local epidemiology [^0e2d8e89].
- **Recurrent cellulitis**: Identify and treat predisposing factors (edema, tinea pedis, chronic wounds). Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. oral penicillin) may be considered for patients with frequent recurrences despite optimal management of predisposing factors [^f97f9913] [^54035c6b].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Preventing recurrence involves identifying and treating predisposing factors such as edema, tinea pedis, chronic wounds, and venous insufficiency [^f97f9913]. Patient education on skin care, prompt treatment of minor skin injuries, and adherence to therapy are essential. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered for patients with frequent recurrences despite optimal management of predisposing factors [^54035c6b].

---

Cellulitis antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the clinical scenario, with **beta-lactams as first-line therapy** for uncomplicated cases and MRSA coverage reserved for specific risk factors. A 5–6 day course is typically sufficient, with close follow-up to ensure clinical improvement and adjust therapy if needed.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0f35b49d]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^418fd95e]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^54035c6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

report feeling unwell and that it has a significant impact on their mobility and ability to carry out their usual activities.

Skin and soft tissue infections are a common cause of hospitalization and use of antibiotic therapy, and may result in significant disability. Infections managed by surgeons may vary from simple, noncomplicated cellulitis to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. The differentiation of necrotizing infections from nonnecrotizing infections is critical to achieving adequate surgical therapy. An understanding of the changing epidemiology of all complicated skin and soft tissue infections is required for selection of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent cellulitis [^18fa1471]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent cellulitis is a challenging clinical condition affecting up to 47% of patients after the first episode, especially those with predisposing risk factors. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art of literature evidence and to highlight recent developments in its management.

Recent Findings

Recurrent cellulitis can occur after successful treatment of cellulitis. Conditions that commonly increase the risk of cellulitis include local and systemic modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. A rigorous approach to the management of risk factors and treatment of acute infection is important as the risk of recurrence rises with repeated episodes. Risk factors, if present, need to be targeted in association with antibiotic prophylaxis. Penicillin V is the preferred antibiotic for prevention but other antibiotics and new drugs can be considered in cases of β-lactam allergy, intolerance, or failure.

Summary

Recurrent cellulitis is associated with short term and long-term morbidity as well as significant healthcare costs. Management of underlying predisposing conditions is crucial to prevent recurrence in addition with evaluation of pharmacological measures, but specialized and multidisciplinary skills are needed. More efforts are needed to prevent and treat this underestimated problem.

### Failure of antibiotics in cellulitis trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^533322f7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of the study are to quantify trial-to-trial variability in antibiotic failure rates, in randomized clinical trials of cellulitis treatment and to provide a point estimate for the treatment failure rate across trials.

Methods

We conducted a structured search for clinical trials evaluating antibiotic treatment of cellulitis, indexed in PubMed by August 2015. We included studies published in English and excluded studies conducted wholly outside of developed countries because the pathophysiology of cellulitis is likely to be different in such settings. Two authors reviewed all abstracts identified for possible inclusion. Of studies identified initially, 5% met the selection criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently, and data were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey transformation under a random-effects model. Our primary outcome was the summary estimate of treatment failure across intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable participants.

Results

We included 19 articles reporting data from 20 studies, for a total of 3935 patients. Treatment failure was reported in 6% to 37% of participants in the 9 trials reporting intent-to-treat results, with a summary point estimate of 18% failing treatment (95% confidence interval, 15%-21%). In the 15 articles evaluating clinically evaluable participants, treatment failure rates ranged from 3% to 42%, and overall, 12% (95% confidence interval, 10%-14%) were designated treatment failures.

Conclusions

Treatment failure rates vary widely across cellulitis trials, from 6% to 37%. This may be due to confusion of cellulitis with its mimics and perhaps problems with construct validity of the diagnosis of cellulitis. Such factors bias trials toward equivalence and, in routine clinical care, impair quality and antibiotic stewardship. Objective diagnostic tools are needed.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^07b56cc0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: a systematic review [^0867dca8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics. This can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019. Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic type, administration route, treatment duration or dose. LLC may be overtreated and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^fffa47f0]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens, duration of antibiotics, and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d3b916cf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^edbf81dd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing recurrent cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^75bced06]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Importance

A significant proportion of patients who have had a first episode of erysipelas or uncomplicated cellulitis will subsequently develop a recurrence. There is disagreement about how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is for preventing recurrent cellulitis.

Objective

To determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing recurrent cellulitis compared to no prophylaxis using a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Studies in any language identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, TRIP database, clinical practice guidelines websites, and ongoing trials databases up to 31st August 2012. Search terms included cellulitis, erysipelas, controlled clinical trial, randomized, placebo, clinical trials, randomly, and trial.

Study Selection

Only controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis to no antibiotic prophylaxis in patients age 16 years and above, and after 1 or more episodes of cellulitis, were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent extraction of articles was done by 2 investigators using predefined data extraction templates, including study quality indicators. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42012002528. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of patients with a recurrence of cellulitis. Secondary outcomes were (1) the time to next episode of recurrence, (2) quality of life measures, and (3) adverse events (e.g. allergic reactions, nausea).

Results

Five randomized controlled trials (n = 535), with 260 patients in the intervention arm and 275 in the comparator group met our inclusion criteria. 44 patients (8%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 97 patients (18%) in the comparator group had an episode of cellulitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the number of patients having recurrent cellulitis, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26–0.79). None of the studies reported severe adverse effects to antibiotics. There was methodological heterogeneity amongst the studies in terms of types of antibiotic used, delivery modes, number of recurrences of cellulitis at study entry, and study quality.

Conclusion and Relevance

Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent recurrent cellulitis. Future research should aim to identify the ideal type, dosage, and duration of antibiotics for prophylaxis, as well as to identify the group of patients who will benefit most from antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Cellulitis: a review [^e957fa91]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cellulitis is an infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting with expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness, and swelling. Cellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone.

Observations

In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria are unknown. In the 15% of cellulitis cases in which organisms are identified, most are due to β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. There are no effective diagnostic modalities, and many clinical conditions appear similar. Treatment of primary and recurrent cellulitis should initially cover Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, with expansion for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in cases of cellulitis associated with specific risk factors, such as athletes, children, men who have sex with men, prisoners, military recruits, residents of long-term care facilities, those with prior MRSA exposure, and intravenous drug users. Five days of treatment is sufficient with extension if symptoms are not improved. Addressing predisposing factors can minimize risk of recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The diagnosis of cellulitis is based primarily on history and physical examination. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis should be directed against Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Failure to improve with appropriate first-line antibiotics should prompt consideration for resistant organisms, secondary conditions that mimic cellulitis, or underlying complicating conditions such as immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, or chronic kidney disease.

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^81baebd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically-acquired cellulitis.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort.

### Penicillin for the emergency department outpatient treatment of CELLulitis (PEDOCELL) [^a9839f1d]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Penicillin for the Emergency Department Outpatient Treatment of CELLulitis ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The main objective of this study is to investigate the non-inferiority of oral flucloxacillin alone compared with a combination of oral flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin for the emergency department directed outpatient treatment of cellulitis, wound infections and abscesses, recently renamed by the Food and Drug Administration as acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Half of the trial participants will receive flucloxacillin and placebo in combination, and the remaining half will be treated will flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin. In a secondary objective the trial aims to measure adherence and persistence of trial patients with outpatient antibiotic therapy.

In addition a within-trial evaluation of the cost per quality adjusted life year gained from the use of oral flucloxacillin compared with combination therapy from the perspective of the health-care payer the patient and government. Finally the study will externally validate the Extremity Soft Tissue Infection-score, a Health Related Quality of Life questionnaire designed to quantify the impact of cellulitis, wound infections and abscesses on patient HRQL in clinical trials.

Table 1.
Mapped interventions for appropriate antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis and abscess

All combinations of the five interventions being present/absent produced 32 case vignettes per condition, with 64 case vignettes in total. Which factors are included in each numbered vignette is described in a design matrix (Supplement Table). It was unrealistic to ask participants to read 64 vignettes, so we utilized a balanced incomplete block design where participants responded to 8 vignettes, 4 for cellulitis and 4 for abscess. We chose 4 vignettes per condition to balance participant burden (response rate) and factor coverage. The respondents for each factor block (e.g. 10001 factor block: first and fifth factors are present) were shown both cellulitis and abscess vignettes for that assigned block.

We randomized which four factor blocks were presented to participants and whether a cellulitis or abscess vignette was presented first. The survey then alternated between presenting a cellulitis or abscess vignette. We randomized the order within the lineup of cellulitis and abscess vignettes such that the cellulitis and abscess vignettes of the same factor block may or may not have ended up next to each other in the survey (Supplement Figure).

Following each vignette, we asked participants to indicate how likely they were to prescribe antibiotics for that case (not very likely, slightly likely, somewhat likely, very likely, extremely likely) and if they would prescribe an antibiotic in their everyday practice (yes/no). For cellulitis cases only, we also asked participants how likely it was that the patient had cellulitis (not very likely, slightly likely, somewhat likely, very likely, extremely likely).

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^5c5476b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Antimicrobial overuse is a major health care issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Such overuse includes unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy in patients with common bacterial infections, such as acute bronchitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cellulitis. This article describes best practices for prescribing appropriate and short-duration antibiotic therapy for patients presenting with these infections.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative literature review of published clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual studies that addressed bronchitis with COPD exacerbations, CAP, UTIs, and cellulitis. This article is based on the best available evidence but was not a formal systematic review. Guidance was prioritized to the highest available level of synthesized evidence.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with COPD exacerbations and acute uncomplicated bronchitis who have clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia for a minimum of 5 days. Extension of therapy after 5 days of antibiotics should be guided by validated measures of clinical stability, which include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation.

Best Practice Advice 3

In women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, clinicians should prescribe short-course antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose. In men and women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, clinicians should prescribe short-course therapy either with fluoroquinolones (5 to 7 days) or TMP-SMZ (14 days) based on antibiotic susceptibility.

Best Practice Advice 4

In patients with nonpurulent cellulitis, clinicians should use a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci, particularly for patients able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### Diagnosis and management of cellulitis and abscess in the emergency department setting: an evidence-based review [^c86d6864]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and abscess are a common reason for presentation to the emergency department, although there are several nuances to the care of these patients.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article was to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cellulitis and abscesses with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

The most common bacteria causing cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and other β-hemolytic streptococci, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus is most common in abscesses. The history and physical examination are helpful in differentiating cellulitis and abscess in many cases, and point-of-care ultrasound can be a useful tool in unclear cases. Treatment for cellulitis typically involves a penicillin or cephalosporin, and treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Loop drainage is preferred over the traditional incision and drainage technique, and adjunctive antibiotics can be considered. Most patients can be managed as outpatient.

Conclusions

It is essential for emergency physicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with cellulitis and abscess.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with febrile neutropenia (persistent/recurrent episodes), IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to add empiric antifungal therapy to the antibacterial regimen, as yeasts and molds are the primary cause of infection associated with persistent and recurrent fever and neutropenia. Add empiric vancomycin or other agents with Gram-positive activity, such as linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline, if not already being administered.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^873bd4c2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Antibiotic treatment for 6 days versus 12 days in patients with severe cellulitis: a multicentre randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial [^4048f35a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate whether antibiotic treatment of 6 days' duration is non-inferior to treatment for 12 days in patients hospitalized for cellulitis.

Methods

This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial enrolled adult patients hospitalized for severe cellulitis who were treated with intravenous flucloxacillin. At day 6 participants with symptom improvement who were afebrile were randomized between an additional 6 days of oral flucloxacillin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified for diabetes and hospital. The primary outcome was cure by day 14, without relapse by day 28. Secondary outcomes included a modified cure assessment and relapse rate by day 90.

Results

Between August 2014 and June 2017, 151 of 248 included participants were randomized. The intention-to-treat population consisted of 76 and 73 participants allocated to 12 and 6 days of antibiotic therapy, respectively (mean age 62 years, 67% males, 24% diabetics); 38/76 (50.0%) and 36/73 (49.3%) were cured in the 12- and 6-day groups respectively (ARR 0.7 percentage points, 95%CI: -15.0 to 16.3). Cure rates were 56/76 (73.7%) and 49/73 (67.1%) with the modified cure assessment (ARR 6.6, 95%CI: -8.0 to 20.8). After initial cure without relapse, day 90 relapse rates were higher in the 6-day group (6% versus 24%, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Given the wide confidence intervals, we can neither confirm nor refute our hypothesis that 6 days of therapy is non-inferior to 12 days of therapy. However, a 6-day course resulted in significantly more frequent relapses by day 90. These findings require confirmation in future studies.

### Cellulitis [^fc42512e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower-limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower-limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

### Prioritizing emergency department antibiotic stewardship interventions for skin and soft tissue infections using judgment analysis [^931b7d4b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing often results from diagnostic uncertainty or error. This gap in care quality has been identified as a primary, modifiable contributor to the global increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In the U.S. alone, 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year with 35,000 associated deaths. Thus, there have been multiple "calls to action" related to antibiotic stewardship, including those highlighting the emergency department (ED). –

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) account for approximately two percent of all ED encounters (~3 million annual visits) and available reports indicate frequent suboptimal antibiotic prescribing in this setting. – Specifically, cellulitis is overdiagnosed in 30% of cases in which patients with noninfectious mimics, termed pseudocellulitis, are prescribed antibiotics. Among cases of accurately diagnosed cellulitis, providers often use two antibiotics despite randomized controlled trials demonstrating this does not improve clinical outcomes. – Additionally, uncomplicated abscesses are often treated with one or more antibiotics despite high cure rates being observed with incision and drainage alone across two large RCTs (number needed to treat (NNT) for antibiotics to prevent treatment failure = 14–26). –

Our previous qualitative work characterized drivers of antibiotic decision-making for SSTIs among emergency medicine (EM) physicians which were then mapped to potential interventions. Intervention mapping is a systematic framework used for the development, implementation, and evaluation of clinical interventions through incorporation of evidence-based practices and the social and cognitive determinants of clinical decision-making. As there are limited resources to implement stewardship-focused interventions in the ED, we sought to conduct an experiment to quantitatively assess the potential impact of the developed interventions. In order to capture changes in antibiotic prescribing decisions for SSTIs based on these interventions, we utilized case vignettes that presented brief clinical scenarios with various combinations of the proposed interventions and asked EM physicians if they would treat with antibiotics. Case vignettes have historically been used to study clinical decision-making due to their flexibility in manipulating multiple clinical factors while being cost-effective and overcoming ethical limitations of experimental research with real patients.

There is a clear need to evaluate and prioritize interventions that can optimize antibiotic use in the management of skin and soft tissue conditions evaluated in the ED. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of interventions in minimizing inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for presumed SSTIs in the ED using a case vignette survey design to simulate the decision-making process.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Cellulitis: a review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^42b86d73]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is seen by clinicians across various disciplines in the inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings, but it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination and lacks a gold standard for diagnosis. Clinical presentation with acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and pain is typical. However, cellulitis can be difficult to diagnose due to a number of infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unobtainable due to poor sensitivity of culture specimens. The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and appropriate targeted coverage of this pathogen with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^9d98338f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^3da0bbaf]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^6d352cc9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^fc674adf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^7ab94428]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; P = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^68e5ad45]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P = 0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P = 0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P = 0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

Recurrent cellulitis — evaluation and prophylaxis: Identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and perform these practices as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^955c5117]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^da650005]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Recurrent cellulitis — prevention recommends to identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and states that these practices should be performed as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Aligning provider prescribing with guidelines for soft tissue infections [^5bb15ad4]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite evidence-based guidelines, antibiotics prescribed for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections can involve inappropriate microbial coverage. Our aim was to evaluate the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing practices for mild nonpurulent cellulitis in a pediatric tertiary academic medical center over a 1-year period.

Methods

Eligible patients treated in the emergency department or urgent care settings for mild nonpurulent cellulitis from January 2017 to December 2017 were identified by an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code for cellulitis. The primary outcome was appropriateness of prescribed antibiotics as delineated by adherence with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Secondary outcomes include reutilization rate as defined by revisit to the emergency department/urgent cares within 14 days of the initial encounter.

Results

A total of 967 encounters were evaluated with 60.0% overall having guideline-adherent care. Common reasons for nonadherence included inappropriate coverage of MRSA with clindamycin (n = 217, 56.1%) and single-agent coverage with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (n = 129, 33.3%). There were 29 revisits within 14 days of initial patient encounters or a reutilization rate of 3.0%, which was not significantly associated with the Infectious Diseases Society of America adherence.

Conclusions

Our data show antibiotic prescription for nonpurulent cellulitis as a potential area of standardization and optimization of care at our center.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^73fb6948]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of complex abscesses (perianal and perirectal, and abscesses in intravenous drug injection sites)?

Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. We recommend antibiotic therapy if systemic signs of infection are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or in cases of abscess with significant cellulitis (recommendation 1C).

We recommend empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with coverage of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Common sites of origin of complex abscesses may be perineal or perianal, perirectal, and abscesses at intravenous drug injection sites. Complicated skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage with adjuvant antibiotic therapy.

Perianal and perirectal abscesses originate most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. Anorectal abscess occurs more often in males than females. Most patients present between the ages of 20 to 60 with the mean age of 40 in both sexes.

The diagnosis of anorectal abscess is usually based on the patient's history and physical examination. The most common symptom of anorectal abscess is pain. As such, it has to be differentiated from other causes of anal pain including anal fissure, thrombosed hemorrhoids, levator spasm, sexually transmitted diseases, proctitis, and cancer. Low (intersphincteric, perianal, and ischiorectal) abscesses are usually associated with swelling, cellulites, and exquisite tenderness, but few systemic symptoms. High (submucosal, supralevator) abscesses may have few local symptoms, but significant systemic symptoms. Deeper abscesses, such as those that form in the supralevator or high ischiorectal space, may also present with pain referred to the perineum, low back, or buttocks.

### Avoidable antibiotic exposure for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in the ambulatory care setting [^52888ad1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections are among the most frequent indications for outpatient antibiotics. A detailed understanding of current prescribing practices is necessary to optimize antibiotic use for these conditions.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of children and adults treated in the ambulatory care setting for uncomplicated cellulitis, wound infection, or cutaneous abscess between March 1, 2010 and February 28, 2011. We assessed the frequency of avoidable antibiotic exposure, defined as the use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity, combination antibiotic therapy, or treatment for 10 or more days. Total antibiotic-days prescribed for the cohort were compared with antibiotic-days in 4 hypothetical short-course (5–7 days), single-antibiotic treatment models consistent with national guidelines.

Results

A total of 364 cases were included for analysis (155 cellulitis, 41 wound infection, and 168 abscess). Antibiotics active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were prescribed in 61% of cases of cellulitis. Of 139 cases of abscess where drainage was performed, antibiotics were prescribed in 80% for a median of 10 (interquartile range, 7–10) days. Of 292 total cases where complete prescribing data were available, avoidable antibiotic exposure occurred in 46%. This included use of antibiotics with broad gram-negative activity in 4%, combination therapy in 12%, and treatment for 10 or more days in 42%. Use of the short-course, single-antibiotic treatment strategies would have reduced prescribed antibiotic-days by 19% to 55%.

Conclusions

Approximately half of uncomplicated skin infections involved avoidable antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic use could be reduced through treatment approaches using short courses of a single antibiotic.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^f9fd7335]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was first to describe the early and late course after treatment initiation, including how rapidly the clinical and biochemical responses occur. Second, we wanted to examine early response dynamics in relation to underlying factors, etiology, and severity as well as antibiotic escalation and other outcomes. By limiting the study to cellulitis in a setting with low prevalence of BHS and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to first-line antibiotics, the study of early response in relation to baseline factors could be performed largely without influence of confounders such as need of surgical drainage or antibiotic resistance. The results may provide an improved basis for the assessment of early response and how initial response can be used in guiding continued treatment and predicting outcome.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: is telephone follow up sufficient? [^5accefed]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analysed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^5760abd6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^7ae6ae84]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^f2548904]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^59222a84]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We hope that this case will expand the range of pathophysiology known to be associated with GCS cellulitis, including rhabdomyolysis; whereas most cases of cellulitis are self-limited streptococcal infections, this case highlights the importance of being alert to toxin-mediated disease, with systemic symptoms out of proportion to visible surface inflammatory signs. This distinction is important because the default therapeutic response is often broader antibiotic coverage, whereas the most appropriate response for virulent yet antibiotic-sensitive pathogens, such as GCS, is more narrowly targeted high-dose antibiotics with vigilant clinical monitoring and supportive care to avoid a poor prognosis and prolonged hospitalization.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1ffe6bfd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when it is possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified, on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for a simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

The cornerstone of treatment is early surgical drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis.

Complicated abscesses may involve a variety of pathogens. Aerobic gram-positive pathogens are isolated in most complicated abscesses. They may involve only a single pathogen but are frequently poly-microbial in origin and may involve a number of organisms.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Broad-spectrum agents with coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic pathogens may be required depending on the clinical setting. Given the high frequency of MRSA, this pathogen should be empirically covered if it is suspected, but no randomized studies are available for the treatment of SSTI specifically caused by CA-MRSA.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^aa140687]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissue. Repeat episodes are frequent, cause significant morbidity and result in high health service costs.

Objectives

To assess whether prophylactic antibiotics prescribed after an episode of cellulitis of the leg can prevent further episodes.

Methods

Double-blind, randomized controlled trial including patients recently treated for an episode of leg cellulitis. Recruitment took place in 20 hospitals. Randomization was by computer-generated code, and treatments allocated by post from a central pharmacy. Participants were enrolled for a maximum of 3 years and received their randomized treatment for the first 6 months of this period.

Results

Participants (n = 123) were randomized (31% of target due to slow recruitment). The majority (79%) had suffered one episode of cellulitis on entry into the study. The primary outcome of time to recurrence of cellulitis included all randomized participants and was blinded to treatment allocation. The hazard ratio (HR) showed that treatment with penicillin reduced the risk of recurrence by 47% [HR 0·53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·26–1·07, P = 0·08]. In the penicillin V group 12/60 (20%) had a repeat episode compared with 21/63 (33%) in the placebo group. This equates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of eight participants in order to prevent one repeat episode of cellulitis [95% CI NNT(harm) 48 to ∞ to NNT(benefit) 3]. We found no difference between the two groups in the number of participants with oedema, ulceration or related adverse events.

Conclusions

Although this trial was limited by slow recruitment, and the result failed to achieve statistical significance, it provides the best evidence available to date for the prevention of recurrence of this debilitating condition.

### Risk factors for clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis and cutaneous abscess [^8289755b]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with clinical failure in patients hospitalized with cellulitis with or without abscess.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study among adults admitted for cellulitis/cutaneous abscess from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for clinical failure among evaluable patients.

Results

A total of 210 cases met inclusion criteria. Among 106 evaluable cases, clinical failure occurred in 34 (32.1%) patients. Weight over 100 kg (Odds ratio [OR] = 5.20, P = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 (OR 4.10, P = 0.02), inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (OR = 9.25, P < 0.01), recent antimicrobial therapy (OR = 2.98, P = 0.03), and lower end of antibiotic dosing per treatment guidelines upon discharge (OR = 3.64, P < 0.01) were independent risk factors for clinical failure. Further subgroup analysis demonstrated that morbidly obese patients were at higher risk for clinical failure if they were discharged on a low oral dose of clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Inappropriate antimicrobial selection and dosing may adversely affect clinical outcomes among patients with cellulitis/cutaneous abscess. Obese individuals may be at particular risk for clinical failure secondary to inadequate dosing of antimicrobial therapy.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^7be7804d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. 1 Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation. 2

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. 3 Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. 4 This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. 5 Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and also improve the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. 6 However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. 7 A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research. 8

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower‐limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower‐limb cellulitis only. Lower‐limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable from cellulitis.

A preliminary search found no previous systematic reviews that investigated the development or validation of diagnostic criteria or tools for cellulitis.

### Analysis of empiric antimicrobial strategies for cellulitis in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^d1e4aa96]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The rise in community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections potentially complicates the empiric management of cellulitis. The threshold at which drugs active against MRSA, such as clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), should be incorporated into empiric therapy is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using cephalexin, TMP/SMX, or clindamycin for outpatient empiric therapy of cellulitis, given various likelihoods of infection due to MRSA.

Methods

A decision analysis of the empiric treatment of cellulitis was performed from the perspective of a third-party payer. The model included initial therapy with cephalexin, clindamycin, or TMP/SMX, followed by treatment with linezolid in cases of clinical failure. Probability and cost estimates were obtained from clinical trials, epidemiologic data, and publicly available cost data and were subjected to sensitivity analysis.

Results

Under the base-case scenario (37% probability of infection by S. aureus and a 27% MRSA prevalence), cephalexin was the most cost-effective option. Clindamycin became a more cost-effective therapy at MRSA probabilities from 41–80% when the probability of staphylococcal infection was greater than 40%. TMP/SMX was cost-effective only at very high likelihoods of MRSA infection. Variables with the most influence in the model were probability of S. aureus being methicillin-resistant, cost of linezolid, probability of a cure with cephalexin for a non-MRSA infection, and probability of infection due to S. aureus.

Conclusions

Cephalexin remains a cost-effective therapy for outpatient management of cellulitis at current estimated MRSA levels. Cephalexin was the most cost-effective choice over most of the modeled range of probabilities, with clindamycin becoming more cost-effective at high likelihoods of MRSA infection. TMP/SMX is unlikely to be cost-effective for treatment of simple cellulitis. Further studies of the microbiology of cellulitis, the epidemiology of MRSA, and the clinical effectiveness of clindamycin and TMP/SMX in skin and soft tissue infections are needed.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone at home versus intravenous flucloxacillin in hospital for children with cellulitis (CHOICE): a single-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^5c1a4102]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in children is common despite no evidence of its efficacy or safety from clinical trials. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous antibiotic therapy at home with that of standard treatment in hospital for children with moderate to severe cellulitis.

Methods

The Cellulitis at Home or Inpatient in Children from the Emergency Department (CHOICE) trial was a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in children aged 6 months to 18 years who presented to the emergency department at The Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg once daily) at home or intravenous flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg every 6 h) in hospital with web-based randomisation, stratified by age and periorbital cellulitis. The primary outcome was treatment failure, which was defined as no clinical improvement or occurrence of an adverse event, resulting in a change in empiric antibiotics within 48 h of the first dose. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Outcomes were assessed in all randomised participants with outcome data (intention-to-treat population) and in all individuals who received treatment as allocated and did not have any major protocol violations (per-protocol population). For home treatment to be non-inferior to hospital treatment, the difference between groups in the proportion of children with treatment failure in the intention-to-treat population had to be less than 15%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02334124.

Findings

Between Jan 9, 2015, and June 15, 2017, we screened 1135 children for eligibility, of whom 190 were randomly assigned to receive ceftriaxone at home (n = 95) or flucloxacillin in hospital (n = 95). The intention-to-treat analysis comprised 188 children (93 in the home group and 95 in the hospital group) because two children in the home group were found to be ineligible after randomisation and were excluded. Treatment failure occurred in two (2%) children in the home group and in seven (7%) children in the hospital group (risk difference -5·2%, 95% CI -11·3 to 0·8, p = 0·088). In the per-protocol analysis, treatment failure occurred in one (1%) of 89 children in the home group and in seven (8%) of 91 children in the hospital group (-6·5%, -12·4 to -0·7). Fewer children treated at home than in hospital had an adverse event (two [2%] vs ten [11%]; p = 0·048). There was no difference between groups in rates of nasal acquisition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or gastrointestinal acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria or Clostridium difficile after 3 months.

Interpretation

Home treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone is not inferior to treatment in hospital with intravenous flucloxacillin for children with cellulitis. The standard of care for the intravenous treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis in children should be home or outpatient care when feasible.

### Hand infections [^57fae849]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Hand infections are commonly seen by orthopedic surgeons as well as emergency room and primary care physicians. Identifying the cause of the infection and initiating prompt and appropriate medical or surgical treatment can prevent substantial morbidity. The most common bacteria implicated in hand infections remain Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species. Methicillin-resistant S aureus infections have become prevalent and represent a difficult problem best treated with empiric antibiotic therapy until the organism can be confirmed. Other organisms can be involved in specific situations that will be reviewed. Types of infections include cellulitis, superficial abscesses, deep abscesses, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. In recent years, treatment of these infections has become challenging owing to increased virulence of some organisms and drug resistance. Treatment involves a combination of proper antimicrobial therapy, immobilization, edema control, and adequate surgical therapy. Best practice management requires use of appropriate diagnostic tools, understanding by the surgeon of the unique and complex anatomy of the hand, and proper antibiotic selection in consultation with infectious disease specialists.

Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent cellulitis (decolonization strategies), IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine screening cultures before decolonization if at least 1 of the prior infections was documented as due to MRSA.

Unlabelled

Treatment success of cellulitis in the age of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA). A comparison of initial antibiotic choice and treatment success in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

Objective

The objective of this study is to determine antibiotic prescribing patterns and treatment failure rates for cellulitis in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

Methods

We performed an electronic chart review of patients seen in our emergency department with cellulitis in 2000 and 2005. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years or more and received a single oral antibiotic for cellulitis. Exclusion criteria were incision and drainage, surgery, or admission on initial visit. Treatment failure was defined as a repeat visit in the subsequent 30 days and a change in antibiotics, admission to the hospital, incision and drainage of abscess, or surgical intervention. Antibiotic-prescribing practices and treatment failure rates were then compared in the pre- and post-CAMRSA eras.

Results

There was a significant decrease in beta-lactam antibiotics and an increase in CAMRSA-effective antibiotics prescribed in 2005 vs 2000. The difference in treatment failure rates of the beta-lactams and CAMRSA antibiotics was statistically insignificant. There has not been an increase in failure rates of the beta-lactam antibiotics for simple cellulitis since the emergence of CAMRSA.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that prescribing practices for simple cellulitis have changed since the emergence of CAMRSA. This may not be appropriate because beta-lactam antibiotics perform as well as 'CAMRSA antibiotics' in our study.
