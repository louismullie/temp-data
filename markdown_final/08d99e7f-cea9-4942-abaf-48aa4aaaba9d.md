## Question

do PPIs cuase renal disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) cause renal disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hierarchy of evidence and whether randomized trials exist. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of observational associations across large cohorts. Next, I will examine dose–response and temporality as causal clues. After that, I need to check for confounding and bias that could explain the associations. I will then review mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions and translate this into practical prescribing and monitoring advice, including special populations and deprescribing strategies [^113hRHhu] [^115h2VaF] [^111Psyk6].

> Let me first confirm the evidentiary foundation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — causal inference is strongest with randomized controlled trials, but I need to check whether any RCTs have directly tested PPIs versus comparators for kidney outcomes; I don't see definitive RCTs here, so the best available evidence is observational, which can show association but not prove causation, and that distinction matters for clinical decision-making [^116JuRF1] [^114onhwZ].

> Next, I should review the magnitude and consistency of associations. Multiple large cohorts and meta-analyses report higher risks of acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease, and progression to end-stage renal disease with PPI use, with effect sizes typically in the 1.2–1.5 range for CKD and AKI, and larger for acute interstitial nephritis, which is a recognized phenotype of PPI-associated kidney injury; for example, Lazarus et al. found a 20–50% higher incident CKD risk with PPIs, and Xie et al. replicated this in new-user designs, while meta-analytic estimates for AKI and CKD hover around 1.4 and for AIN around 3.6, suggesting a class signal rather than an isolated finding [^1112XSGJ] [^114ygbc8] [^116hdNif] [^117FsKa8].

> Wait, let me verify dose–response and temporality, because those strengthen causal inference in observational settings. Several analyses show a graded relationship with longer cumulative PPI exposure and higher risk, and twice-daily dosing appears riskier than once-daily; moreover, associations persist in new-user designs and when intervening AKI is accounted for, indicating the chronic kidney outcomes are not solely explained by an antecedent AKI episode, which is an important check on alternative explanations [^1112XSGJ] [^113tCYtg] [^115Uf9t3].

> I need to ensure we are not being misled by confounding. Systematic reviews using ROBINS-I consistently judge most observational studies as having moderate to serious risk of bias, largely due to confounding by indication, prevalent-user bias, and residual confounding from comorbidities and concomitant medications; still, sensitivity analyses, active comparators like H2 blockers, and self-controlled designs mitigate some confounding, and the persistence of associations across diverse populations and analytic strategies argues that confounding alone is unlikely to explain everything, though it cannot be fully excluded without RCTs [^114onhwZ] [^111oVPTo] [^114q3Jpa] [^116JuRF1].

> Let me consider biological plausibility. PPIs are linked to acute interstitial nephritis, a well-documented immune-mediated injury, and case series implicate all marketed PPIs, supporting a class effect; mechanistic hypotheses include hypomagnesemia, endothelial dysfunction with accelerated senescence, oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury in renal tubular cells, and CYP2C19-mediated interactions, with signals stronger for omeprazole and esomeprazole in some cohorts; these lines of evidence, while indirect, cohere with the epidemiologic associations and provide a credible causal pathway [^117FsKa8] [^111ENJgn] [^114vGqzm] [^115SDZcV].

> Hold on, I should verify what guidelines say so I don't overstate certainty. The ACG GERD guideline advises that available associations do not establish causality, notes that high-quality data have not shown significant risk increases for most proposed harms beyond enteric infections, and does not recommend routine creatinine monitoring in otherwise low-risk patients; it does advise using PPIs at the lowest effective dose and reassessing ongoing need, and it supports PPI use even in renal insufficiency with appropriate monitoring when clinically indicated, which aligns with a risk–benefit framing rather than avoidance [^113hRHhu] [^115h2VaF].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical guidance. I should confirm indications before prescribing and plan for the shortest effective course with periodic deprescribing trials; in patients at higher baseline kidney risk or those with CKD, I should prefer once-daily dosing, consider H2 blockers when appropriate, and monitor renal function if therapy is prolonged or if other nephrotoxins are present; if AKI or unexplained eGFR decline occurs, I need to check for AIN and stop the PPI promptly, as early recognition improves recovery; shared decision-making is important because patient concern about kidney risks is common and can drive inappropriate discontinuation without addressing underlying indications [^113hRHhu] [^111Psyk6] [^113KComp].

> But wait, what about special populations where the signal might differ. In moderate to advanced CKD, some observational data suggest faster progression to ESRD with PPIs compared with H2 blockers, particularly with omeprazole or esomeprazole, whereas other CKD-focused cohorts show no difference in ESRD or mortality versus H2 blockers or no acid suppression; given this uncertainty, I should individualize therapy, avoid unnecessary PPIs, and if acid suppression is essential, consider agents with fewer CYP2C19 interactions and use the lowest dose with monitoring in higher-risk groups [^111MdMPk] [^1143KuTv] [^115zN5Mp] [^112woTnL].

> In summary, I should double-check my bottom line. The weight of evidence indicates that PPI use is associated with a modestly increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes, including AKI, incident CKD, and possibly CKD progression, with biological plausibility and dose–response patterns supporting a causal contribution in some cases; however, confounding cannot be fully excluded without RCTs, and guideline bodies frame this as a reason for judicious use rather than prohibition, so the appropriate response is to prescribe PPIs when clearly indicated, minimize duration and dose, consider alternatives when feasible, and monitor kidney function in higher-risk patients or prolonged courses [^1112XSGJ] [^112GXH3k] [^114onhwZ] [^113hRHhu] [^115h2VaF].

PPIs are **associated with an increased risk of renal disease**, including acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^112GXH3k] [^116hdNif]. The risk is **higher with long-term use and higher doses** [^1112XSGJ], and is not fully explained by confounding or indication bias [^113w1PXe]. While causality is not definitive, the evidence is strong enough to warrant cautious, indication-driven prescribing, avoidance of unnecessary long-term use, and periodic renal function monitoring in at-risk patients [^113hRHhu] [^111Psyk6].

---

## Evidence linking PPIs to renal disease

### Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)

AIN is a well-documented adverse effect of PPIs, characterized by immune-mediated inflammation of the renal interstitium [^117FsKa8]. Multiple case reports and series have described **biopsy-proven AIN** associated with PPI use, with omeprazole being the most frequently implicated agent [^117FsKa8]. AIN can lead to **acute kidney injury (AKI)** and, if unrecognized or untreated, may progress to **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** [^117FsKa8].

---

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

Several large observational studies have demonstrated an association between PPI use and AKI [^116hdNif]. A meta-analysis of observational studies found that PPI users had a **significantly increased risk of AKI** compared to non-users (relative risk [RR] 1.44, 95% CI 1.08–1.91) [^116hdNif]. Another large cohort study reported a **significant association** between PPI use and AKI, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.30 (95% CI 1.00–1.69) [^113tCYtg].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

PPI use has also been associated with an increased risk of incident CKD and CKD progression. A large prospective cohort study found that PPI users had a **significantly higher risk of incident CKD** compared to non-users (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14–1.96) [^1112XSGJ]. This association persisted even after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, clinical measurements, prevalent comorbidities, and concomitant medications [^1112XSGJ]. Another large cohort study similarly reported an increased risk of CKD progression among PPI users, with a **graded association** between cumulative PPI exposure and risk of CKD progression [^113tCYtg].

---

## Mechanisms underlying PPI-induced renal injury

Several plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between PPI use and renal disease:

- **Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)**: Immune-mediated inflammation of the renal interstitium, which can lead to AKI and, if unrecognized, progress to CKD [^117FsKa8].

- **Hypomagnesemia**: PPI-induced hypomagnesemia has been associated with renal calcification, nephrolithiasis, and CKD progression [^notfound].

- **Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction**: Experimental studies have shown that PPIs, particularly omeprazole, can induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury in renal tubular cells, potentially contributing to renal dysfunction [^115SDZcV].

- **Drug-drug interactions**: PPIs inhibit CYP2C19, which can interact with other nephrotoxic medications, increasing the risk of renal injury [^114vGqzm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the accumulating evidence linking PPIs to renal disease, several clinical guidelines and expert recommendations have been issued:

- **Indication-driven prescribing**: PPIs should be prescribed only for clear indications, and long-term use should be regularly reassessed [^11188Ffx].

- **Monitoring renal function**: Routine monitoring of renal function is not universally recommended, but clinicians should consider periodic renal function assessment in patients on long-term PPI therapy, particularly those with pre-existing renal risk factors [^113hRHhu].

- **Deprescribing strategies**: Efforts should be made to deprescribe PPIs when they are no longer indicated, and alternative therapies (such as H2 receptor antagonists) should be considered when appropriate [^111Psyk6].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

PPIs are associated with an increased risk of renal disease, including AIN, AKI, and CKD [^116hdNif]. The risk appears to be **dose-dependent and increases with prolonged use** [^1112XSGJ] [^114ygbc8]. While causality cannot be definitively established due to the observational nature of most studies, the evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant cautious prescribing, regular reassessment of ongoing need, and monitoring of renal function in at-risk patients [^114onhwZ]. Clinicians should balance the benefits of PPI therapy against potential renal risks and consider alternative treatments when appropriate [^113hRHhu].

### The association of proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease: cause or confounding? [^113w1PXe]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss whether the recently described relationship between proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes represents a causal relationship or is merely the result of confounding.

Recent Findings

A wave of observational studies has described an association between PPI use and the risk of development of chronic kidney disease and its progression to end-stage renal disease. The results are generally robust and remarkably consistent across different studies. The application of modern pharmacoepidemiologic methods to estimate the effect of a putative unmeasured or unknown confounder or set of confounders on the relationship of PPI use and risk of adverse renal outcomes suggests that confounding is unlikely to explain away the reported association.

Summary

The constellation of evidence from all available studies suggests that PPI use is associated with increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes. Exercising vigilance in the use of PPI is warranted.

Prevalent versus new-user (incident) cohort

Inclusion of existing users of a drug to define comparison groups may create bias since participants who remain on treatment have not yet developed substantial side effects or have a different indication to remain on the drug versus short-term users. Sometimes, even protective associations can be found, as for example in studies of hormone replacement therapy and vascular outcomes in women. Conversely, people who remain on long-term treatment may be more sick than those who only take treatments for short periods, and therefore are generally more likely to develop conditions like acute kidney injury (AKI) or CKD. Therefore, 'new-user cohorts' are preferred in pharmacoepidemiology, particularly to examine side effects, such as AKI, that may occur shortly after starting treatment with a drug. The paper by Lazarus et al. is based on prevalent PPI use but includes a new-user sensitivity analysis, while the paper by Xie et al. is based on a new-user cohort.

Choice of comparison group

The gold-standard way of determining drug efficacy and adverse effects is the randomized clinical trial. Fundamentally this is because, if adequately powered and with a successful allocation procedure, randomization ensures that there is a balance of both measured and unmeasured confounders between the study arms. Similarly, comparison of effects between drugs, or between treatment and none, is also commonly assessed in observational studies. It can provide robust results reproducing clinical trial outcomes if there is a high degree of randomness between choices of drugs. However, as use of a type of medication becomes widespread and when drugs are clearly indicated for specific conditions, the results of these study designs can be misleading. Such 'confounding by indication' may explain in part many drug-related adverse outcomes seen in observational studies.

The study question was whether PPI users are more likely to develop CKD than people not using PPIs. It is probable that people who do not use PPIs are less ill than PPI users. Therefore, both of these studies (at least in part) compare outcomes between users of PPIs and H 2 -blockers and find an increased incidence of CKD among those exposed to PPIs. But, although prescribed for similar indications, to what extent are H 2 -blockers a valid comparator for PPI users? We need to consider the patterns of use of each class of drug at the time that patients entered the study and compare the measured characteristics of each group.

CONCLUSION

Bearing in mind the history of PPI-associated adverse event research and the potential sources of bias, we do not believe that these papers on their own provide strong evidence of a causal link with CKD. This caution has also been expressed by the authors, e.g. Lazarus et al. state 'further research is required to investigate whether PPI use itself causes kidney damage', while Xie et al. state 'the findings should not deter from prescription and use of PPI where medically indicated'. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that many patients remain on PPIs for long periods with no clear indication. Studies such as these serve as salutary reminders to constantly review whether all drugs remain indicated for each patient, and to de-prescribe if necessary. Stopping PPIs can cause an exacerbation of severe dyspeptic symptoms, and inevitably some patients may suffer more severe complications, for instance, upper GI bleeding (as one of the high-risk consequences), after cessation.

One may argue that decisions about prescribing are best informed by an overall risk–benefit analysis derived from well-conducted clinical trials. However, in reality, many such trials will not be feasible (e.g. for rare harms), nor affordable, nor always ethical. If done well, observational data have a great deal to contribute to our understanding of the incidence and causes of prescribing-related adverse outcomes in routine clinical care.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease [^111zvMrh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly prescribed medicines and are the mainstay of treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of these medicines for unclear and inappropriate indications. Although generally well tolerated and considered to be safe, several observational studies have linked PPI use with a variety of conditions such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, fractures, hypomagnesemia, and dementia. The well-established association between PPIs and acute interstitial nephritis has raised questions about whether they may also cause acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Observational studies have evaluated these possible associations. This paper reviews the currently available literature about these associations and considers their possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The level of evidence-linking PPI use with acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease is weak and does not establish causality. More research is required to explore these possible associations further. The PPIs should be used in the lowest effective dose and inappropriate use should be avoided.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^114onhwZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed as acid-suppression therapy. Some observational studies suggest that long-term use of PPIs is potentially associated with certain adverse kidney outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature review to assess potential bias in non-randomized studies reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes (acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease).

Methods:

We searched the medical literature within 10 years of 17 December 2020. Pre-specified criteria guided identification of relevant English language articles for assessment. Risk of bias on an outcome-specific basis was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool by two independent reviewers.

Results:

Of 620 initially identified records, 26 studies met a priori eligibility criteria and underwent risk of bias assessment. Nineteen studies were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for reported adverse kidney outcomes, while six studies were judged as having a serious risk of bias (mainly due to inadequate control of confounders and selection bias). We were unable to determine the overall risk of bias in two studies (one of which was assessed as having a moderate risk of bias for a different adverse kidney outcome) due to insufficient information presented. Effect estimates for PPIs in relation to adverse kidney outcomes varied widely (0.24–7.34) but associations mostly showed increased risk.

Conclusion:

Using ROBINS-I, we found that non-randomized observational studies suggesting kidney harm by PPIs have moderate to serious risk of bias, making it challenging to establish causality. Additional high-quality, real-world evidence among generalizable populations are needed to better understand the relation between PPI treatment and acute and chronic kidney outcomes, accounting for the effects of varying durations of PPI treatment, self-treatment with over-the-counter PPIs, and potential critical confounders.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^111A1AG3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types. PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^117SPPgp]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) became available in the United States in 1989, and have become one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs. The approved indications for use of PPIs include gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease and erosive esophagitis. However, PPIs are often prescribed outside of their approved uses. It has been estimated that up to two-thirds of all people on PPIs do not have a verified indication for the drug. A 2009 analysis using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey found an increase in the frequency of prescription PPI treatment from less than five prescriptions per 1000 GERD-related physician visits in 1995 to 43.9 prescriptions per 1000 visits in 2006 in the United States, a more than eight-fold increase. There were a total of 119 million U.S. prescriptions filled in 2009 for all PPIs totaling $13.6 billion.

Several studies have shown increased hazards of cardiovascular disease and death with PPIs. Renal side effects of PPIs are less often reported and may go unrecognized. These include acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. In general, most patients with acute kidney injury are assumed to have acute tubular necrosis. It is not surprising that AIN secondary to PPI use may also go undetected due to several reasons: 1) awareness that PPIs can cause AIN may not be wide spread; 2) the time interval from drug initiation to onset of clinical abnormalities is quite variable, ranging from 1 week to 9 months (median 9.9 weeks); and 3) typical features of hypersensitivity reaction are present in only a minority of cases. Patients with undiagnosed AKI due to PPIs may present later with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, data is lacking on the association of PPI use with CKD. In this manuscript we investigate the relationship of PPI use and the development of CKD and death.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113hRHhu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

ACG GERD guideline — proton pump inhibitor (PPI) monitoring and risk statements: For patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) on PPIs without additional risk factors, the guideline states "we do not recommend that they raise their intake of vitamin B12 or that they have routine monitoring of serum B12 levels" and likewise "we do not recommend that they have routine monitoring of serum creatinine levels". It further notes that in prolonged PPI users who have "LA grade C or D esophagitis or whose GERD symptoms are not adequately controlled with alternative medical therapies", available data "suggest that the established benefits of PPI treatment outweigh their proposed but highly questionable cardiovascular risks", and that "PPIs can be used to treat GERD in patients with renal insufficiency with close monitoring of renal function or consultation with a nephrologist".

### Proton pump inhibitors and the kidney: implications of current evidence for clinical practice and when and how to deprescribe [^111Psyk6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), long thought to be safe, are associated with a number of nonkidney adverse health outcomes and several untoward kidney outcomes, including hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and increased risk for all-cause mortality and mortality due to chronic kidney disease. PPIs are abundantly prescribed, rarely deprescribed, and frequently purchased over the counter. They are frequently used without medical indication, and when medically indicated, they are often used for much longer than needed. In this In Practice review, we summarize evidence linking PPI use with adverse events in general and adverse kidney outcomes in particular. We review the literature on the association of PPI use and risk for hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and death. We provide an assessment of how this evidence should inform clinical practice. We review the impact of this evidence on patients' perception of risk, synthesize PPI deprescription literature, and provide our recommendations on how to approach PPI use and deprescription.

### Pharmacoepidemiology for nephrologists: do proton pump inhibitors cause chronic kidney disease? [^116cT3Xn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Pharmacoepidemiology studies are increasingly used for research into safe prescribing in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Typically, patients prescribed a drug are compared with patients who are not on the drug and outcomes are compared to draw conclusions about the drug effects. This review article aims to provide the reader with a framework to critically appraise such research. A key concern in pharmacoepidemiology studies is confounding, in that patients who have worse health status are prescribed more drugs or different agents and their worse outcomes are attributed to the drugs not the health status. It may be challenging to adjust for this using statistical methods unless a comparison group with a similar health status but who are prescribed a different (comparison) drug(s) is identified. Another challenge in pharmacoepidemiology is outcome misclassification, as people who are more ill engage more often with the health service, leading to earlier diagnosis in people who are frequent attenders. Finally, using replication cohorts with the same methodology in the same type of health system does not ensure that findings are more robust. We use two recent papers that investigated the association of proton pump inhibitor drugs with CKD as a device to review the main pitfalls of pharmacoepidemiology studies and how to attempt to mitigate against potential biases that can occur.

### Pharmacoepidemiology for nephrologists: do proton pump inhibitors cause chronic kidney disease? [^11735x7X]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

The challenges of appropriately adjusting for confounding by indication in the context of who is prescribed PPIs became apparent during the extensive research into the clinical importance of a pharmacological interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs on vascular outcomes. The majority of observational studies compared people taking PPIs and clopidogrel with those taking clopidogrel alone and found positive associations of the combination therapy with vascular events. However, important differences were observed between people prescribed a PPI and those not prescribed a PPI in terms of risk factors for vascular events. One study compared the results of two study designs derived from the same dataset of patients in UK primary care to investigate the role of residual confounding. The traditional cohort design showed an increased risk of vascular events in people taking PPIs and clopidogrel compared with clopidogrel alone, but tellingly, the cohort study also identified an association between PPIs and harmful outcomes that would not be predicted by the drug interaction (despite adjusting for relevant recorded confounders), pointing towards residual confounding as a possible explanation. In the same study, a self-controlled case series analysis, a method that compares time periods within individuals to remove between-person confounding, showed no increase in risk within individuals when they were taking both drugs. This suggested that the possible observed interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs was not of clinical importance and that findings of harm in the multiple previous cohort studies were explained by confounding by poorer health among people taking PPIs that was difficult to adjust for in standard analyses.

The importance of assessing bias cannot be overstated, and only very thorough investigation with a range of study designs or alternative outcomes will unveil its influence. Alternative negative outcomes to understand the degree of residual confounding in future studies of the PPI–CKD question may be useful, for example, incident depression or cataract surgery. Because CKD is not an acute event, a self-controlled case series design is not suited to the study of CKD. A self-controlled case series of the association of PPI use with AKI has not yet been conducted but may be informative.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^11244JGY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a widely-used class of drugs for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and other acid-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. As a class, PPIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile. However, case reports have suggested that this class of drugs may be linked to acute kidney injury, which may in turn lead to chronic injury or failure. The objective of this study was to determine if an association between PPIs and kidney failure exists and to estimate an effect size for the relationship between PPI use and renal disease.

Methods

A nested case-control study was conducted in a privately insured population in a single Midwestern state including a total of 184,480 patients aged 18 years or older who were continuously enrolled with the insurer for at least 24 months between September 2002 and November 2005.

Results

Renal disease was positively associated with PPI use (odds ratio [OR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27, 2.32, p < 0.001) even after controlling for potential confounding conditions. After removing patients with potential confounding disease states from the study population, the number of cases (195 of the 854) and controls (607) was lower, but the relationship between renal disease and PPI use remained consistent (OR 2.25, CI 1.09–4.62, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients with a renal disease diagnosis were twice as likely to have used a previous prescription for a PPI. Therefore, it is necessary for physicians to increase recognition of patient complaints or clinical manifestations of this potentially harmful event in order to prevent further injury.

### Proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease: is it time to sound the alarm? [^115QaeVZ]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors are widely used worldwide for the management of gastroesophageal reflux, but have been associated with the development of interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury. A large observational study using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort and the Geisinger Health System demonstrates an association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and chronic kidney disease. Although the study does not prove causality, the robustness of the findings in two cohorts suggests a need for further study and reevaluation of the safety of these agents for widespread, non-prescription use.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^111MdMPk]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were mostly prescribed for gastrointestinal (GI) disease widely, there were numerous studies about PPIs and adverse renal outcome. Most evidence was to evaluate the risk of PPIs in patients with normal renal function and in the absence of the moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study focuses on the accelerated progression of renal function following proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) use, and the increased risks of acute kidney injury (AKI) among moderate to advanced CKD (pre-ESRD) patients.

Patients and methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted by including adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3b to 5 who initiated PPI or H2 blocker (H2B) therapy between 2011 and 2018. The risk of renal events was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity analyses were performed, including propensity score matching, as-treated analysis, and subgroup analysis.

Results

The cohort comprised 83,432 pre-ESRD patients, with 5,138 treated with H2B and 1,051 with PPIs. The progression to ESRD was significantly more likely in patients using PPIs compared to those using H2B (adjusted HR, 1.495; 95% CI: 1.198–1.867). Specifically, omeprazole (adjusted HR, 1.784; 95% CI: 1.079–2.951) and esomeprazole (adjusted HR, 1.847; 95% CI: 1.332–2.561) were associated with a notably higher risk of ESRD and AKI.

Conclusions

The study highlights the significance of the accelerated renal risk, especially for moderate to advanced CKD patients, when prescribing PPIs and to implicate the clinicians prescribed PPIs and H2B in pre-ESRD patients.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^112szjMx]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are established as the leading medications for gastric acid suppression, and have a crucial role in treating peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and in eradicating Helicobacter pylori. Their significant clinical use is well-documented. However, recent studies have raised concerns about the long-term use of PPIs, particularly the potential risk of adverse renal outcomes. These range from minor issues such as hypomagnesemia to serious conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and even the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The underlying mechanisms of PPI-induced renal dysfunction, potentially involving a dose-response relationship, are an area of ongoing research.

The metabolic processing of PPIs, especially omeprazole and esomeprazole, which predominantly rely on the Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) enzyme, is a key issue. Studies indicate a significant variability in CYP2C19 activity among different ethnic populations, with Asians often exhibiting a slower metabolic rate compared to Western populations. This variation suggests that Asian populations may be more likely to accelerate adverse renal outcomes, when treated with CYP2C19 -metabolized PPIs.

Taiwan, despite implementing a pre-ESRD pay-for-performance program in 2006 to enhance care for CKD stages 3b to 5 patients, continues to have one of the highest global ESRD prevalence. This alarming statistic underscores the importance of region-specific research on potential renal risks associated with PPIs. Current research in Taiwan on PPI-related renal risks primarily comprises case-control studies. While these studies have been valuable in suggesting potential associations, their design limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions. This limitation highlights the need for further research using more rigorous methodologies to better understand the potential effects of PPI usage on renal outcomes.

Our study investigates to expand upon these findings by exploring the relationship between PPI usage and the risk of AKI and progression to ESRD specifically in the pre-ESRD patient in Taiwan. We focus particularly on PPIs, exploring whether these medications accelerated e the risk of renal function progression in pre-ESRD patients. By examining the implications of PPI usage in a broader and more extended context, this research aims to provide valuable insights into renal health outcomes. These findings will contribute to more informed clinical decisions in the prescription of PPIs or H2 blockers (H2B) especially in moderate to advanced CKD patients, particularly in these population in pre-ESRD program in Taiwan.

### Pharmacoepidemiology for nephrologists: do proton pump inhibitors cause chronic kidney disease? [^113f42NS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In the paper by Xie et al. the primary outcomes were the first eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (encompassing both CKD and AKI), and CKD defined as two eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at least 90 days apart.

Use of a CKD end point based on two measurements requires patients to stay alive for the second measurement to fulfil the chronicity definition. If sicker patients die beforehand or do not attend for repeat tests, they would not be coded as having CKD, which would bias the study towards the null. On the other hand, physicians may be more likely to monitor renal function regularly in those they consider to be at higher risk.

Both papers also examined an association between PPI exposure and AKI as an additional outcome. Demonstrating an association with a second outcome may substantially strengthen an argument for causality in a pharmacoepidemiological analysis, particularly where the second outcome may be on the causal pathway as is proposed for AKI and CKD. However, in these studies the outcomes are closely correlated: in the paper by Lazarus et al. both are defined by ICD-9 coding, while in that by Xie et al. both CKD and AKI are defined by the change in creatinine values. For the hospital-derived coding of AKI there has been a huge change in recognition (similar to that of CKD) over the past decade. Determining AKI by changes in creatinine appears slightly more robust (than clinical coding), but the problem of sicker patients being more closely monitored remains. Within each cohort, the same problems apply to both outcomes, respectively. Therefore, it is unsurprising that an association between PPI use and AKI is found in both papers.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hdNif]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Existing epidemiological studies illustrate that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be related to adverse kidney outcomes. To date, no comprehensive meta-analysis has been conducted to evaluate and quantify this association.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess the association between PPI use and the risk of adverse kidney outcomes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and grey literature with no language restrictions (through 31 October 2016). Adverse kidney outcomes were acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The risk ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random effects model. The strength of evidence (SOE) for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommended Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.

Results

Of 2037 identified studies, four cohort and five case-control studies with ∼2.6 million patients were included. Of these, 534 003 (20.2%) were PPI users. Compared with non-PPI users, PPI users experienced a significantly higher risk of AKI [RR 1.44 (95% CI 1.08–1.91); P = 0.013; SOE, low] and CKD [RR 1.36 (95% CI 1.07–1.72); P = 0.012; SOE, low]. Moreover, PPIs increased the risk of AIN [RR 3.61 (95% CI 2.37–5.51); P < 0.001; SOE, insufficient] and ESRD [RR 1.42 (95% CI 1.28–1.58); P < 0.001; SOE, insufficient].

Conclusion

PPI usage was associated with adverse kidney outcomes; however, these findings were based on observational studies and low-quality evidence. Additional rigorous studies are needed for further clarification.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^1147KEsC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have emerged as one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. While the efficacy of PPIs for approved indications is well-established for short term use (2–12 weeks), misuse of PPIs is estimated to occur at an alarming rate of 50% across both hospital and ambulatory settings.

Concerns about potential long-term adverse outcomes are growing with numerous recent studies highlighting PPI-related adverse events such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia, bone fractures, hypomagnesemia, Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea and mortality. –

Subsequent analyses suggested that the rise in PPI-related mortality may primarily be attributed to cardiovascular disease, CKD, and upper gastrointestinal cancers. Residual confoundingand prothopatic biashave been proposed as alternative explanations for increased PPI-related mortality. Regarding kidney disease, some observational studies found that PPIs or even histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2-blockers) use might increase the risk of CKD. – However, these findings were not confirmed in other studies.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and worsening kidney function in PPI initiators as compared with H2-blockers initiators in a large database.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115h2VaF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) issues — key concepts for GERD — include that regarding safety, we suggest that patients should be advised as follows: PPIs are the most effective medical treatment for GERD; available associations do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, high-quality studies have found that PPIs do not significantly increase the risk of any of these conditions except intestinal infections, and for GERD the well-established benefits of PPIs far outweigh their theoretical risks. Switching PPIs can be considered for patients who experience minor PPI side effects including headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence. For patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for bone disease, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of calcium or vitamin D or that they have routine monitoring of bone mineral density; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency, we do not recommend that they raise their intake of vitamin B12 or that they have routine monitoring of serum B12 levels; for patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for kidney disease, we do not recommend that they have routine monitoring of serum creatinine levels. For patients with GERD on clopidogrel who have LA Grade C or D esophagitis whose GERD symptoms are not adequately controlled with alternative medical therapies, the highest quality available suggests that the established benefits of PPI treatment outweigh their proposed but highly questionable cardiovascular risks. PPIs can be used to treat GERD in patients with renal insufficiency with close monitoring of renal function or consultation with a nephrologist.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease [^1112XSGJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used drugs worldwide and have been linked to acute interstitial nephritis. Less is known about the association between PPI use and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Objective

To quantify the association between PPI use and incident CKD in a population-based cohort.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In total, 10,482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were followed from a baseline visit between February 1, 1996, and January 30, 1999, to December 31, 2011. The data was analyzed from May 2015 to October 2015. The findings were replicated in an administrative cohort of 248,751 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) from the Geisinger Health System.

Exposures

Self-reported PPI use in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study or an outpatient PPI prescription in the Geisinger Health System replication cohort. Histamine2 (H2) receptor antagonist use was considered a negative control and active comparator.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident CKD was defined using diagnostic codes at hospital discharge or death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and by a sustained outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the Geisinger Health System replication cohort.

Results

Among 10,482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the mean (SD) age was 63.0 (5.6) years, and 43.9% were male. Compared with nonusers, PPI users were more often of white race, obese, and taking antihypertensive medication. Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with incident CKD in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11–1.90); in analysis adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.14–1.96); and in analysis with PPI ever use modeled as a time-varying variable (adjusted HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17–1.55). The association persisted when baseline PPI users were compared directly with H2 receptor antagonist users (adjusted HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01–1.91) and with propensity score-matched nonusers (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.13–2.74). In the Geisinger Health System replication cohort, PPI use was associated with CKD in all analyses, including a time-varying new-user design (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20–1.28). Twice-daily PPI dosing (adjusted HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.28–1.67) was associated with a higher risk than once-daily dosing (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09–1.21).

Conclusions and Relevance

Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with a higher risk of incident CKD. Future research should evaluate whether limiting PPI use reduces the incidence of CKD.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^115QZdjA]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the introduction of Omeprazole in 1989, Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) have gone on to become one of the most widely prescribed medications in the United States. These drugs are also increasingly sold over the counter (OTC), making the actual use of PPIs across the general population much higher. Initially praised for their superiority in treating many acid-related disorders, PPIs have more recently garnered scrutiny over their potential adverse effects. Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with PPI use is well documented in the literature. Case reports and small case series initially described the development of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in patients prescribed PPIs. Since that time, there have been various large observational studies and meta-analyses which have reproduced the same findings of increased risk of developing AKI with PPI use.

More recently, some studies have suggested an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with normal renal function. The underlying mechanism of this association remains unclear. A popular theory that an intervening AKI in the setting of PPI use leads to the development of CKD was not upheld when examined by Xie and colleagues. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis also demonstrated a higher incidence of CKD with PPI use. Interestingly, the subgroup analysis found no association between PPI use and risk of CKD in older patients (age > 62 years), in studies with large sample sizes (> 10,000 participants), in case-control studies, and in the US study location (3 out of the 4 studies reviewed). Despite the growing body of evidence on PPI use and increased risk for developing CKD, there is limited data on patients with already established CKD. To the best of our knowledge, only one such study has been published. It concluded that PPI use was associated with increased major renal adverse events, defined as doubling of serum creatinine or progression to end-stage renal disease.

Given the inconclusive data on PPI safety in the CKD population, we elected to examine the rate of CKD progression among CKD patients on PPI versus Histamine-2-Receptor Blockers (H2B) and to no acid-suppressing therapy.

### Effects of prolonged proton-pump inhibitor use on renal dysfunction and bone fragility [^115pDGYd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use for management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) consists of a short-duration trial, according to guidelines. Long-term usage is appropriate under certain indications. Literature has increasingly documented an adverse effect profile of PPIs, including kidney disease and bone fragility.

Objective

To investigate the rate of occurrence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients using PPI therapy for longer than the recommended trial period of 8 weeks.

Methods

Retrospective cohort analysis of a single-site primary care clinic. Patients aged 18 to 65 years with PPI prescriptions longer than 8 weeks were included. Information regarding PPI prescriptions, demographics, and medical diagnoses was collected.

Results

The search discovered 293 PPI-users and 1908 never-PPI-users. Demographics varied, with a P -value < 0.05 in age, body mass index (BMI), and black population (higher in PPI group). The PPI cohort featured higher rates of osteoporosis/osteopenia and CKD (P < 0.001). The odds ratios (ORs) of diagnosis with PPI use was 2.91 (95% CI = [1.692, 4.979]) in osteoporosis/osteopenia. The OR was 1.14 (95% CI = [1.141, 2.229]) in CKD and PPI use but higher with diabetes, elevated BMI, black race, and male gender.

Conclusions and Relevance

We observed increased occurrence rates of osteoporosis, or osteopenia, and CKD in patients with prolonged PPI use. Demographics varied in age, BMI, and black race proportion. A logistic regression revealed increased likelihood of kidney disease and osteoporosis/osteopenia in association with PPI use. These results add to the evidence regarding long-term PPI use and the development of these conditions, but additional studies are needed.

### Association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of progression of chronic kidney disease [^113tCYtg]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been associated with acute kidney injury and recent studies suggest that they may be associated with the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis using the Stockholm creatinine measurements database, which contains information on diagnoses, dispensation claims, and laboratory test results for all citizens in the Stockholm region from 2007 through 2010. We identified new users of PPIs (n = 105,305) and new users of H 2 blockers (H 2 B; n = 9578); data on renal outcomes were collected for a median 2.7 years. The primary outcome was progression CKD, defined as doubling of creatinine or decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more. Secondary outcomes were end-stage renal disease and acute kidney injury. Complete collection of repeated PPI and H 2 B dispensations at pharmacies in Sweden allowed modeling the time-dependent risk associated with cumulative PPI exposure.

Results

Users of PPIs, compared with users of H 2 Bs, had an increased risk for doubled levels of creatinine (1985 events; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05–1.51) and decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30% or more (11,045 events; 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16–1.36). PPI use also associated with development of end-stage renal disease (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.76–7.58) and acute kidney injury (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.00–1.69). There was a graded association between cumulative exposure to PPIs and risk of CKD progression. This was not the case for cumulative H 2 B use.

Conclusions

Initiation of PPI therapy and cumulative PPI exposure is associate with increased risk of CKD progression in a large, North European healthcare system. Although consistent, the association was modest in magnitude, and cannot exclude residual confounding.

### Long-term kidney outcomes among users of proton pump inhibitors without intervening acute kidney injury [^115Uf9t3]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). PPI-associated CKD is presumed to be mediated by intervening AKI. However, whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of chronic renal outcomes in the absence of intervening AKI is unknown. To evaluate this we used the Department of Veterans Affairs national databases to build a cohort of 144,032 incident users of acid suppression therapy that included 125,596 PPI and 18,436 Histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blockers) consumers. Over 5 years of follow-up in survival models, cohort participants were censored at the time of AKI occurrence. Compared with incident users of H2 blockers, incident users of PPIs had an increased risk of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) under 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 (hazard ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.15–1.24), incident CKD (1.26; 1.20–1.33), eGFR decline over 30% (1.22; 1.16–1.28), and ESRD or eGFR decline over 50% (1.30; 1.15–1.48). Results were consistent in models that excluded participants with AKI either before chronic renal outcomes, during the time in the cohort, or before cohort entry. The proportion of PPI effect mediated by AKI was 44.7%, 45.47%, 46.00%, and 46.72% for incident eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73m 2, incident CKD, eGFR decline over 30%, and ESRD or over 50% decline in eGFR, respectively. Thus, PPI use is associated with increased risk of chronic renal outcomes in the absence of intervening AKI. Hence, reliance on antecedent AKI as warning sign to guard against the risk of CKD among PPI users is not sufficient as a sole mitigation strategy.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112wE6Mm]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with increased risk of development of CKD and death. Although cause and effect cannot be determined with an observational study, with the large number of patients being treated with proton pump inhibitors, healthcare providers need to be cautious in prescribing these drugs because of the potential side effects.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^114wVSBN]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this nested case-controlled study affirm an association between renal disease and PPI use. Our study revealed that patients with a renal disease diagnosis were twice as likely to have a previous prescription for a PPI. Therefore, it is necessary that pharmacist and physician awareness and recognition of patient complaints or clinical manifestations of this potentially harmful event are increased. Furthermore, it is important that future research seek to establish a definitive causal relationship.

### Estimates of all cause mortality and cause specific mortality associated with proton pump inhibitors among US veterans: cohort study [^113gRhPJ]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The results show a consistent excess of cause specific mortality even among patients without documented gastrointestinal indications for acid suppression drugs — an alarming finding which might help guide the design and implementation of deprescription programs to reduce the number of unnecessary or un-indicated PPI prescriptions. The evidence that mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer was not modified by the presence of baseline cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or upper gastrointestinal cancer, respectively, suggests the need for heightened vigilance among those with and — with equal importance — those at risk of these conditions. The evidence from all available studies suggests that long term PPI use is associated with serious adverse events, including an increased risk of all cause mortality, and our results specifically suggest an increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer. Because of the high prevalence of PPI use, the findings have public health implications and underscore the important message that PPIs should be used only when medically indicated and for the minimum duration necessary.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^11188Ffx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taking into consideration the sources of bias described above makes it challenging to establish causality and may clarify many of the observed potential associations. A review published in 2018 considered the available evidence from non-randomized observational studies and potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of AKI and CKD with PPI use. The authors observed that the association between CKD and PPI use, although consistent for the studies reviewed, did not meet the Hill criteria for causationand may have been confounded by NSAID use and underlying comorbidities (i.e. hypertension, diabetes). In contrast, the association between AKI and PPI was described as inconsistent based on the studies reviewed, but also potentially confounded by NSAID use and failing to meet the Hill criteria. Overall, these findings suggest that it is important to distinguish associations from causality in the interpretation of results from non-randomized observational studies.

We also found that effect estimates for the evaluation of reported associations were largely of small magnitude and uncertain clinical relevance; thus, these results should not prevent prescribers from using appropriate doses of PPIs for proper indications. Results from our study, combined with other literature reviews, should support recommendations for clinical prudence. For instance, health care professionals should avoid unnecessary long-term PPI use by being cautious in their initial decision-making for prescribing PPI, and by periodically revisiting the need for continued PPI therapy to ensure medical indication. There is considerable variation in defining long-term PPI use in prior studies, ranging from more than 8 weeks of regular daily use to greater than 1 year. Few studies selected for this review defined long-term PPI use. Among the eight studies that reported on the association between long-term PPI use or duration of PPI use, respectively, and associated kidney effects, long-term PPI use was described as ranging from as low as 3 monthsto over 3 years. Using recommendations outlined in guidelines on prescribing PPIs and how to mitigate the potential harms of long-term PPI therapy for three common indications (GERD, BE, and NSAID bleeding prophylaxis), physicians can safely and appropriately balance the evidence on the benefits and harms of PPI use in managing their patients.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112dm2ET]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) frequently goes undiagnosed due to its subacute clinical presentation, which may later present as chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the association of PPI use with the development of CKD and death.

Methods

Two separate retrospective case–control study designs were employed with a prospective logistic regression analysis of data to evaluate the association of development of CKD and death with PPI use. The population included 99,269 patients who were seen in primary care VISN2 clinics from 4/2001 until 4/2008. For evaluation of the CKD outcome, 22,807 with preexisting CKD at the first observation in Veterans Affairs Health Care Upstate New York (VISN2) network data system were excluded. Data obtained included use of PPI (Yes/No), demographics, laboratory data, pre-PPI comorbidity variables.

Results

A total of 19,311/76,462 patients developed CKD. Of those who developed CKD 24.4% were on PPI. Patients receiving PPI were less likely to have vascular disease, COPD, cancer and diabetes. Of the total of 99,269 patients analyzed for mortality outcome, 11,758 died. A prospective logistic analysis of case–control data showed higher odds for development of CKD (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.05–1.16) and mortality (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.67–1.84) among patients taking PPIs versus those not on PPIs.

Conclusions

Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with increased risk of development of CKD and death. With the large number of patients being treated with proton pump inhibitors, healthcare providers need to be better educated about the potential side effects of these medications.

### Association of proton pump inhibitor use and immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated acute kidney injury: a meta-analysis and a review of related outcomes [^114PWs2p]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, they pose the risk of immune-related adverse events, including ICI-mediated acute kidney injury (ICI-AKI). Recent studies have implicated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as potential contributors to ICI-AKI development. This meta-analysis examines the association between PPI use and ICI-AKI, exploring a potential modifiable risk factor in ICI therapy while also reviewing the possible outcomes of ICI-AKI.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, assessing the risk of ICI-AKI in cancer patients concurrently using PPIs and potential outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate heterogeneity and potential biases.

Results

A total of 14 studies involving 12,694 patients were included. In total, we analyzed 639 patients with all-cause AKI and 779 patients with ICI-AKI. The pooled OR for the overall incidence of AKI from all-causes was 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–2.40) among patients on PPIs. Specifically, the risk of ICI-AKI associated with PPI use was significantly higher, with a pooled OR of 1.84 (95% CI 1.16–2.90). This indicates approximately 84% higher likelihood of developing ICI-AKI with concurrent use of PPIs. Additionally, among patients with ICI-AKI, 67% had complete or partial recovery of renal function, 32% progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and about 36% died during a follow-up period of at least 3 months.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis highlights the importance of cautious PPI prescription in cancer patients undergoing ICI therapy. Clinicians are advised to evaluate the risks and benefits of PPI use and consider alternative therapies when feasible.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^115zN5Mp]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression remains controversial. Specifically, there is a lack of data evaluating renal outcomes in established CKD patients. The aim of our study is to determine the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death amongst CKD patients on PPI, histamine-2 receptor blocker (H2B), or no anti-acid therapy.

Methods

Using our CKD registry, we evaluated the relationship between PPI and H2B use and outcomes amongst patients with CKD (eGFR < 60), with at least 2 PCP visits in the year prior. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the relationship between medication groups and overall mortality, while competing risks regression models were used to determine the risk of ESKD with death as a competing risk.

Results

25,455 patients met inclusion criteria and were stratified according to medication group: no antacid therapy (15,961), PPI use (8646), or H2B use (848). At 4 years, the cumulative incidence of ESKD with death as a competing risk was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.7, 2.4), 1.5% (0.8, 2.8), and 1.6%(1.4, 1.9) among PPI, H2B, and no medication respectively (P = 0.22). The cumulative incidence of death with ESKD as a competing risk was 17.6% (95% CI: 16.6, 18.6), 16.7% (13.7, 19.8), and 17.3% (16.6, 18.0) (P = 0.71).

Conclusions

Use of PPI in a CKD population was not associated with increased mortality or progression to ESKD when compared to H2 blocker and to no acid suppressing therapy.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^112wdA7x]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a widely-used class of drugs for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and other acid-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. In 2009, more than 119 million PPI prescriptions were filled in the United States, accounting for nearly $14 billion dollars in prescription PPI sales, in addition to billions more in over-the-counter (OTC) sales. The PPI class includes several different agents, such as esomeprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, deslansoprazole, rabeprazole, etc. all of which possess a common mechanism of action for reducing parietal cell acid production by blocking H+/K + adenosine triphosphatase.

As a class, PPIs have demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Overall, complications have been infrequent and minor. The most common unwanted effects reported have been headaches, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In fact, the favorable adverse effect profile has led to movement of some of these agents to non-prescription status. However, as the use of PPIs has grown more widespread so have safety concerns. A growing body of literature suggests that this class of drugs may be linked to acute kidney injury, which can potentially lead to chronic injury or kidney failure. In 1992, a sentinel case-report identified the PPI omeprazole as a possible cause of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in an elderly woman. Since that time, numerous biopsy-confirmed case reports and retrospective descriptive reports have been published suggesting a connection between PPI use and AIN. Detailed summaries of these case reports have been published. However, research in this area has been limited and consisted of small sample sizes without comparator groups. As a result, no estimate of the effect size is currently available. In turn, determining if an association between PPI use and AIN exists requires studies using larger sample sizes and control groups.

### Proton pump inhibitors and risk of incident CKD and progression to ESRD [^114ygbc8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The association between proton pump inhibitors (PPI) use and risk of acute interstitial nephritis has been described. However, whether exposure to PPI associates with incident CKD, CKD progression, or ESRD is not known. We used Department of Veterans Affairs national databases to build a primary cohort of new users of PPI (n = 173,321) and new users of histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 blockers; n = 20,270) and followed these patients over 5 years to ascertain renal outcomes. In adjusted Cox survival models, the PPI group, compared with the H 2 blockers group, had an increased risk of incident eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and of incident CKD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18 to 1.26; and HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.34, respectively). Patients treated with PPI also had a significantly elevated risk of doubling of serum creatinine level (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.65), of eGFR decline > 30% (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.37), and of ESRD (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.18). Furthermore, we detected a graded association between duration of PPI exposure and risk of renal outcomes among those exposed to PPI for 31–90, 91–180, 181–360, and 361–720 days compared with those exposed for ≤ 30 days. Examination of risk of renal outcomes in 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts of patients taking H 2 blockers versus patients taking PPI and patients taking PPI versus controls yielded consistent results. Our results suggest that PPI exposure associates with increased risk of incident CKD, CKD progression, and ESRD.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^115z62B1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A number of non-randomized epidemiologic studies have suggested a potential association between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), CKD, progression of CKD, and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It has also been observed that patients with CKD are prescribed PPIs for longer durations and in higher quantities than patients without CKD, which may contribute to worsening kidney outcomes in this high-risk population. Prevalence and duration of PPI treatment are reported to increase with age; thus, the risk of the adverse kidney outcomes is likely higher among older adults.

Although there is no physiologic explanation for the effect, some studies report that these associations are well established. Non-randomized studies (NRS) of the effects of interventions (benefits or harm) are important to many areas of health care decision-making. However, critical limitations inherent to the data sources (lack of detailed information on clinical parameters, OTC medications, lifestyle, etc.) and study design of observational studies can lead to an increased risk of residual confounding (surveillance bias, channeling bias) and selection bias. Across NRS, it is possible to find many different types of data sources, each with unique strengths and limitations, and various methodologic and analytic approaches. Many times, the likelihood of residual confounding cannot be ruled out, particularly in cases where only weak associations were observed. More importantly, a review by Vaezi et al. has questioned the value of recent meta-analyses of observational studies on this topic because of the presence of potential bias and confounding in individual studies. The authors made a plea to the research community for future systematic reviews to evaluate the trustworthiness of the individual studies in terms of the presence of bias and confounding.

Given the importance of these data for evidence-based practice and specific need for a different approach, a more detailed, comprehensive, and critical systematic review of the existing observational literature is needed to evaluate the quality of non-randomized observational studies reporting on potential associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. Specifically, the present study systematically reviews the literature and assesses the risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for NRS, to allow, for the evaluation of the strength of the evidence on the association of PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes.

### Estimates of all cause mortality and cause specific mortality associated with proton pump inhibitors among US veterans: cohort study [^111FRFKq]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To estimate all cause mortality and cause specific mortality among patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Design

Longitudinal observational cohort study.

Setting

US Department of Veterans Affairs.

Participants

New users of PPIs (n = 157625) or H2 blockers (n = 56842).

Main Outcome Measures

All cause mortality and cause specific mortality associated with taking PPIs (values reported as number of attributable deaths per 1000 patients taking PPIs).

Results

There were 45.20 excess deaths (95% confidence interval 28.20 to 61.40) per 1000 patients taking PPIs. Circulatory system diseases (number of attributable deaths per 1000 patients taking PPIs 17.47, 95% confidence interval 5.47 to 28.80), neoplasms (12.94, 1.24 to 24.28), infectious and parasitic diseases (4.20, 1.57 to 7.02), and genitourinary system diseases (6.25, 3.22 to 9.24) were associated with taking PPIs. There was a graded relation between cumulative duration of PPI exposure and the risk of all cause mortality and death due to circulatory system diseases, neoplasms, and genitourinary system diseases. Analyses of subcauses of death suggested that taking PPIs was associated with an excess mortality due to cardiovascular disease (15.48, 5.02 to 25.19) and chronic kidney disease (4.19, 1.56 to 6.58). Among patients without documented indication for acid suppression drugs (n = 116377), taking PPIs was associated with an excess mortality due to cardiovascular disease (22.91, 11.89 to 33.57), chronic kidney disease (4.74, 1.53 to 8.05), and upper gastrointestinal cancer (3.12, 0.91 to 5.44). Formal interaction analyses suggested that the risk of death due to these subcauses was not modified by a history of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or upper gastrointestinal cancer. Taking PPIs was not associated with an excess burden of transportation related mortality and death due to peptic ulcer disease (as negative outcome controls).

Conclusions

Taking PPIs is associated with a small excess of cause specific mortality including death due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer. The burden was also observed in patients without an indication for PPI use. Heightened vigilance in the use of PPI may be warranted.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^113Szxtu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has several notable strengths. This is the first systematic review to assess the risk of bias in NRS reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. To accomplish this, a complete and thorough literature search with explicit eligibility criteria was undertaken across several databases with articles subsequently screened for inclusion in this review. Selection, data extraction, and adjudication of risk of bias were done by two independent reviewers. Additional strengths of the review include its compliance with established guidelines for systematic literature reviews (i.e. PRISMA statement), including the use of a pre-specified protocol and search criteria. In addition, we used the ROBINS-I tool, which assesses a higher number of major methodological elements compared with several other risk of bias assessment tools. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO to promote transparency and allow for future replication or updates. Furthermore, this review includes more recently published data, and is consistent with seven previously published systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses, which showed a positive association with adverse kidney outcome (with OR/RR estimates ranging from 1.20 to 3.76).–

We recognize our review has some limitations. Although this review was designed to capture a wide range of literature, it is limited to recent publications in the last 10 years, as well as publications in the English language, and may therefore be limited by a lack of representativeness for the full body of published literature. Some of the studies were based on a single facility and/or included small sample sizes of PPI-treated patients. Also, several studies evaluated were limited by short follow-up duration. Finally, these findings may not be generalizable to patients of different age groups, races, or patients living in different countries. For example, four studies in the US Department of Veterans Affairs databases identified adverse kidney outcomes among users of PPIs relative to users of H 2 blockers. In addition, several of the studies identified describe older cohorts, where the use of PPIs and the incidence of kidney outcomes may be greater due to aging. Moreover, these patient populations are potentially more likely to experience comorbidities and be treated with several concomitant medications compared with younger populations. Despite these limitations, our study is the first systematic review using the ROBINS-I tool to indicate that potential reported associations between PPI and adverse kidney outcomes, although generally positive, are likely influenced by inadequate control of confounders and the selection of participants with prior PPI treatment.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^112RYrcB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the first-line treatment for acid-related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPIs are one of the top ten most prescribed drugs worldwide. The global PPI market was evaluated at $2.9 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to grow by 6.9% annually from 2023 to 2030.

Although the pharmaceutical industry has made remarkable progress in novel drug discovery for safer and better PPIs, there has been a growing concern over the potential adverse effects of long-term PPI usage. In 2021, an umbrella review of 42 meta-analyses showed that long-term use of PPIs was associated with a variety of diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and enteric infection. Moreover, the reporting of new PPI-associated adverse effects continues. In the past 2 years alone, epidemiological studies, for the first time, linked PPI use to increased risk of biliary tract cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, type-2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cholelithiasis. The evidence for these associations was generally observational. Reporting of these adverse events attracted increasing attention to the appropriate use of PPIs, while it also resulted in fears and reduced adherence to PPI treatment in patients. The need for personalized strategies for reducing unnecessary PPI use has become an urgent subject to be addressed.

There are several weaknesses in existing studies. First, most of the previous studies only evaluated single outcomes within one population. Some studies might be limited by selective reporting or lack of validation in different populations. Second, a comprehensive evaluation of the overall safety profile and dose–response effects, particularly for major diseases with top global disease burden remains lacking. Finally, and more importantly, there exists a major knowledge gap on which group of people are more vulnerable to PPI-related adverse events. Thus, individualized treatment based on patients' underlying risk may confer benefits and reduce harms. Such a risk stratification approach, successfully implemented in selecting patients for antihypertensive and statin therapy, has also been applied to individuate avoidance of additional risks related to PPI use, such as type-2 diabetes, stroke, and cholelithiasis. However, its application for other PPI-associated adverse events remains unclear. To address these concerns and improve decision-making for the appropriate use of PPIs in the public, patients, clinicians, and industry, we comprehensively evaluated the overall safety profile, dose–response relationships, and individual risk stratification for PPI use and the top 30 causes of global disease burden based on five large cohorts from the US, the UK, and China.

### Using proton pump inhibitors correlates with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease: a nationwide database-derived case-controlled study [^115mD1Ta]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Those taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might have a higher risk of acute kidney injury. The long-term safety, especially the PPI-associated chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the subsequent concern.

Objective

This study explores the potential relationship between using PPIs and CKD in Taiwan.

Methods

Using a database collated by the Taiwan National Health Insurance programme, we conducted a population-based case-controlled study to identify 16 704 cases of patients aged 20 years or older with newly diagnosed CKD between 2000 and 2013. 16 704 controls were randomly selected and were matched by sex, age and comorbidities. 'Use' of PPIs was defined as when subjects had received at least a prescription for PPIs before the index date. 'Non-use' was defined as subjects who had never received a prescription for PPIs before the index date. The odds ratio (OR) for CKD associated with the use of PPIs was estimated by a logistic regression model.

Results

The OR for CKD was 1.41 for subjects using PPIs [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34, 1.48] compared with subjects who had never used PPIs. Almost all major types of PPIs present a weak association with increased odds of CKD in cumulative duration and dosage regression analysis. The OR in relation to cumulative duration (per month) of PPIs use was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01, 1.02) and the OR in relation to cumulative dosage (per microgram) of PPIs use was 1.23 (95% CI 1.18, 1.28).

Conclusions

Using PPIs presented 1.4-fold higher odds of CKD in Taiwan health insurance claims data analysis.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^111oVPTo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review evaluating potential bias using the ROBINS-I tool in non-randomized observational studies reporting on putative associations between PPIs and adverse kidney outcomes. We applied the ROBINS-I, a comprehensive risk of bias assessment tool, because it is based on essential principles of causal inference and addresses the common problem of confounding in non-randomized observational treatment comparisons, relying on a transparent framework that evaluates sources of bias. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have applied the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias in other conditions, including reviews on GI function, cardiovascular disease, and treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The current review identified 26 epidemiological studies published within the last 10 years for the assessment of risk of bias. The important finding of this work is that the majority of studies (n = 19) were deemed to have an overall risk of bias rating of moderate for the reported adverse kidney outcomes, which according to ROBINS-I criteria indicates that across domains 'the study appears to provide sound evidence for a non-randomized study but cannot be considered comparable to a well-performed randomized trial'Studies with a moderate risk of bias generally reported a positive association between PPI and adverse kidney outcomes, but the magnitude of effect estimates varied widely (0.24–7.34). Another critical finding of this work is that a total of six studies were viewed as having serious risk of bias for the reported adverse kidney outcomes, primarily in the confounding and selection bias domains. According to ROBINS-I criteria, a serious risk of bias rating across domains indicates 'the study has some important problems'. The magnitude of the association between PPI and adverse kidney outcomes was weak to moderate for these six studies, with effect estimates ranging from 0.82 to 2.85. It is unclear whether the potential magnitude of bias is large enough to overwhelm the association observed in these six studies. Finally, we could not evaluate the overall risk of bias for adverse kidney outcomes reported in two studies (one of which was judged as having a moderate risk of bias for a different adverse kidney outcome in the same study), although the risk of bias was judged as low to moderate for individual domains.

Among the 19 studies with an overall moderate risk of bias rating, eight assessed CKD outcomes. In total, they represented 1,146,346 patients from the United States, Brazil, Taiwan, Sweden, and Denmark. Effect estimates for the association between PPI treatment (compared with non-PPI users or H 2 blocker users) and CKD ranged from an adjusted HR of 1.12 (95% CI 1.08–1.17)to 7.34 (95% CI 3.94–13.71), and an adjusted OR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.11–1.29)to 1.42 (95% CI 1.35–1.49). A single study reported that the magnitude of the association was similar between individual PPIs and CKD. Furthermore, a study in the Geisinger Health System found that twice daily dosing of a PPI was associated with a higher risk of CKD relative to once daily dosing.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^114vGqzm]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The exact mechanisms by which PPIs contribute to renal function deterioration are not fully understood. Previous studies have indicated a link between PPI use and the development of AKI, which may progress to chronicity. However, this association is contested by findings from Xie et al. who reported that AKI does not mediate the relationship between PPI use and the onset of CKD. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the potential nephrotoxic effects of PPIs. One theory suggests that PPI use may induce hypomagnesemia or elevate levels of asymmetrical dimethylarginine, both of which are factors associated with the decline in kidney function. Additionally, PPIs are implicated in promoting enteric infections such as Clostridium difficile. These infections are thought to result from decreased gastric acidity and alterations in the gut microbiome, as well as the translocation of endotoxins into the circulation, which could contribute to uremic toxicity, inflammation, and the progression of kidney disease. Moreover, the metabolic pathways of most PPIs, with the exception of rabeprazole, involve significant processing (> 80%) by the CYP2C19 enzyme. Omeprazole and esomeprazole, in particular, act as inhibitors of CYP2C19. The drug interaction between PPIs and other nephrotoxic drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 could further increase the risk of renal function impairment in patients with renal diseases. Additionally, there is a possibility that PPIs, either alone or in combination with other medications, may accumulate in the kidneys, leading to a reduction in renal function.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^114HQNi9]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study in Taiwan has illustrated that the use of PPIs is associated with an increased and accelerated risk of progressing to ESRD and AKI compared to H2B among pre-ESRD patients. This finding is particularly showed the accelerated renal risk than other cohort studies, especially in the pre-ESRD patients. Our subgroup analyses revealed that PPIs like omeprazole and esomeprazole, which exhibit auto-inhibition effects on CYP2C19, were associated with higher hazard ratios for ESRD development than other PPIs. Given Taiwan's status as having the highest global incidence of ESRD, our findings emphasize the necessity for a more personalized approach to PPI use in pre-ESRD populations. This may involve reevaluating the prescription practices for PPIs in high-risk groups, particularly in the late stage CKD and to de-prescribing PPIs to ensure renal safety.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^112fn5K6]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

In the primary model, 854 cases of renal disease were matched to 3,289 controls. Of the 854 cases, 727 (85.1%) were matched to four controls, while the remaining 127 (14.9%) were matched to three controls. As Table 2 shows, most of the identified renal disease diagnoses were for acute renal insufficiency and acute renal failure. Cases were more likely to use a PPI and were considerably sicker, higher prevalence chronic diseases, (Table 3) than controls. Renal disease was positively associated with PPI use (OR = 2.04; CI 1.53, 2.71) even after controlling for potential confounding conditions (Table 4). Given the incidence in this population (0.0046), the number needed to harm equals 303 patients.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^116KWwMW]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Our study showed that the use of PPIs is associated with a 75% increased risk of mortality. Other studies have also shown a similar association of PPI use and increased risk of death, especially in elderly and institutionalized patients and among patients who were on clopidogrel.

There are a few limitations to this study. There is potential for indication bias in our results. However, indication bias in this cohort is unlikely. In fact, the study patients on PPI were less likely to have a higher comorbidity burden than those who did not receive PPI. This actually strengthens the case for the association of PPI use with CKD and mortality. Covariates that are not associated with either treatment or outcome do not cause a bias. The covariates that are associated with both treatment and outcome were included in the model and, hence, were controlled for. It is possible that variables not in our data set, such as use of NSAIDs, smoking and therefore not controlled for could cause indication bias, as is true in all observational studies. Furthermore we also did propensity score analyses to mitigate indication bias, and the results didn't change. However, we note the potential for indication bias as a limitation of any observational study. We used one eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 as the definition of CKD, because although this does not meet the KDOQI definition, most large epidemiologic studies have used a single eGFR definition for CKD. Our results may not be generalizable due to the fact that females and non-whites are underrepresented in the VA study population. However, this was a real world cohort from the largest integrated health care system in United States and utilizes a uniform data collection system.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^111oawsk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Association between PPI use and all-cause mortality is difficult to interpret due to the large variance in patients studied to date. PPI use has been associated with increased mortality in cancer patients, liver cirrhotics, and those requiring artificial nutrition. However, these patient cohorts are dissimilar to the CKD population, and thus of limited use in determining true risk. Of the studies that more closely resemble our patient cohort, there are some that also suggest increased mortality in patients using PPIs. Xie and colleagues showed a small excess of cause specific mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney, disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer in patients taking PPIs. In addition, another cohort study determined increased risk of overall mortality with PPI use in kidney transplant recipients with average eGFR of 52. These findings are in contrast with the results from Grant's study which looked at the CKD population specifically and found no association between PPI use and increased mortality. Overall, the reports to date have major limitations including the observational nature of the studies and the degree of illness in the cohorts analyzed. Our study could find no association between PPI use and overall mortality when assessing patients with pre-established CKD.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^112TSVh4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The results abstracted from included studies are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3, organized according to the overall risk of bias rating for the reported outcome. A complete listing of study results is provided in. Patients treated with PPI (compared with non-PPI users or H 2 blocker users) were reported to have a significantly higher risk of AKI in 10 of the 12 studies, with adjusted HRs ranging from 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.33]to 2.52 (95% CI 2.27–2.79), and adjusted ORs ranging from 1.78 (95% CI 1.72–1.83)to 3.93 (95% CI 2.61–5.93)with the magnitude of the association (HR) similar by individual PPIs. A single study by Ikemura et al. found a protective association [OR = 0.239 (95% CI 0.06–0.89)] between PPI and AKI. However, the study had a small number of patients with PPI exposure (n = 33), failed to adjust or balance baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (beyond exclusion of patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2), comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, liver failure, heart failure), and lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking, alcohol consumption), and there were potential differences in the duration of PPI use prior to study initiation.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics and risk of acute kidney injury: a self-controlled case series study [^113GkG4j]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs.) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. Although PPIs have been recognized to show high efficacy, there are growing safety concerns about PPI causing a potential risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and chronic kidney disease. The effect of PPI use on the development of AKI has been detected in several large observational studies. However, those studies defined AKI based on the medical records with ICD-9 or ICD-10. Because AKI is commonly under-recorded in hospital data, the absolute risk of AKI in the target population may be underestimated in those studies. Other studies have used laboratory data to detect AKI in PPI users. However, these studies have the following limitations. First, they identified H 2 -receptor antagonist users as active comparator. With this design, the effect of PPIs could be significantly affected by confounding by indication. Second, it was not investigated whether AKI occurred during the exposure period to PPIs. In addition, no studies have classified the stage of AKI. Therefore, further studies are required to validate whether PPI use is associated with the risk of any stage of AKI or more severe AKI.

PPIs play a pivotal role in the standard of care for Helicobacter pylori eradication and are often concomitantly used with antibiotics, such as macrolides and penicillins. Although macrolide antibiotics are considered to have relatively low nephrotoxicity, they are well known to increase the risk of AKI due to drug-drug interactions. For example, the concomitant use of macrolide antibiotics with calcium channel blockers or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) cause a decrease in the clearance of these drugs, and a resultant increase in circulating drug, thereby increasing the risk of drug-induced AKI. For PPIs, previous studies have shown that clarithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, decreases the clearance of omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole. However, it is unclear whether the risk of AKI is affected by the interactions between PPIs and macrolide antibiotics. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the effect of macrolide antibiotic use on the risk of AKI in PPI users.

### Gastrointestinal disease and the kidney [^116D1CWV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Renal disease at any stage, from insufficiency to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or following renal transplantation, is often accompanied by significant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Conversely, patients with GI disease may present with significant renal complications. Patients with end-stage renal disease, patients undergoing dialysis, and recipients of renal grafts are at increased risk for GI complications, including erosive disease and GI bleeding. Selection of pharmacotherapy for GI conditions in patients with concomitant renal disease is complicated by three factors: (1) the potential for a significant negative impact on renal function, which is already compromised; (2) the requirement for dosing alteration in renal insufficiency; and (3) the potential for drug-drug interactions with concomitant medications. Proton pump inhibitors appear to be the most suitable acid-suppressing therapy for patients with renal disease; recently developed drugs in this class (e.g. rabeprazole) may be the best choice for treatment of patients with both acid-related GI conditions and renal disease.

### Proton pump inhibitors accelerate endothelial senescence [^111ENJgn]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are popular drugs for gastroesophageal reflux, which are now available for long-term use without medical supervision. Recent reports suggest that PPI use is associated with cardiovascular, renal, and neurological morbidity.

Objective

To study the long-term effect of PPIs on endothelial dysfunction and senescence and investigate the mechanism involved in PPI-induced vascular dysfunction.

Methods and Results

Chronic exposure to PPIs impaired endothelial function and accelerated human endothelial senescence by reducing telomere length.

Conclusions

Our data may provide a unifying mechanism for the association of PPI use with increased risk of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological morbidity and mortality.

Results

Systematic literature search

Figure 1 displays the PRISMA diagram. Our electronic search initially returned 615 articles; an additional five were identified from a manual search of other sources (e.g. review articles) and 100 duplicates were deleted. Of the 520 records screened based on their titles and abstracts, we excluded 448 (primarily due to ineligible study design, intervention, or outcome), and included 72 in the full-text assessment. Of those, 46 were excluded based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (reasons for exclusion included in Figure 1). We included a total of 26 studies for final qualitative synthesis for PPI-related adverse kidney outcomes.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute interstitial nephritis [^117FsKa8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a widely prescribed class of drugs, and their usage worldwide is increasing. Although well-tolerated, there have been case reports and a recent case series implicating these drugs in acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and progression to acute renal failure (ARF). The aim of this study was to investigate how widespread this complication is in Australia, to identify which PPIs are implicated, and to establish whether PPI-induced AIN is a class effect.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective case review of potential cases at 2 teaching hospitals and a review of registry data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (TGA). Parameters sought included the drug implicated, concurrent medications, symptoms, signs, serum creatinine, and time of onset after prescription.

Results

We identified 18 cases of biopsy-proven PPI-induced AIN causing ARF in the retrospective case review, which is the largest hospital-based case series to date. The TGA registry data identified an additional 31 cases of "biopsy proven interstitial nephritis". An additional 10 cases of "suspected interstitial nephritis", 20 cases of "unclassified acute renal failure", and 26 cases of "renal impairment" were also identified. All 5 commercially available PPIs were implicated in these cases.

Conclusion

With the ever more widespread use of this class of medications, PPI-induced AIN is likely to become more frequent. There is now evidence to incriminate all the commercially available PPIs, suggesting there is a class effect. Failure to recognize this entity might have catastrophic long-term consequences including chronic kidney disease. Increased awareness might facilitate more rapid diagnosis and management of this potentially reversible condition.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective matched cohort study [^112GxsmU]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant complication for hospitalized patients and is related to severe short-term and long-term mortality and morbidity, including increased risk of death, progression of kidney disease, and heart failure. Post-hospitalization AKI, including the new incidence of AKI and recurrent AKI, is a common sequela after one AKI episode and is associated with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), progression of pre-existing CKD, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Potential risk factors for new incidence and recurrent AKI include older age, African ancestry and chronic comorbidities, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are widely used for acid suppression therapy in the United States, with over 15 million adults using PPI every year. PPIs are commonly prescribed to treat acid-related gastrointestinal disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and peptic ulcers. Kidney disease is one of the side effects of using PPI. Occurrence of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been histologically confirmed as an adverse event of PPI use. AKI is observed as a potential adverse effect of PPI use, while the mechanism behind it still is obscure.

Previous epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between PPI use and AKI mainly were based on retrospective cohort analyses of data collected as part of routine clinical care. These studies also are limited in their interpretation because they focused only on the incidence of AKI, only focused on death or kidney disease progression, and rarely addressed recurrent AKI. In an effort to address these concerns, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to employ a matched prospective cohort design to investigate relationship between PPI use and multiple AKI counts during follow-up periods. We conducted this study with a large prospective cohort to test two hypotheses: (1) PPI use is related to the risk of post-hospitalization AKI, including incidence of AKI and recurrent AKI; (2) PPI use is associated with kidney disease progression.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^116BT2v3]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical methods

Descriptive baseline statistics were produced for the study population. Patients were divided in 2 groups based on PPI use, Group 1 -on PPI, Group 2 –not on PPI. These two groups were compared using Fisher exact test for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Similarly descriptive baseline statistics were produced for patients who developed CKD versus those who did not and between patients who died versus those who did not. A prospective logistic analysis of case–control data was used to investigate the association of treatment (exposure to PPI) with each outcome of interest; onset of CKD and mortality, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, GI and pre-PPI comorbidities. It was shown by Prentice and Pyke that the odds ratio estimators and associated confidence intervals for the effects of risk factor on an outcome variable in case–control studies may be estimated by applying the standard logistic regression modeling to the case–control data as if the data had been obtained in a prospective study. Their work generalizes the findings of Breslow & Powers on the equivalence of odds ratio estimators when both prospective and retrospective logistic models are applied to case–control data. We also performed adjusted stratified analysis by levels of dichotomized versions of the variables in the initial main-effects model, to test for PPI effects within subgroups.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective matched cohort study [^1172VMcm]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) are among the most commonly used drugs to treat acid-related gastrointestinal disorders in the United States. Although PPI use has been linked to acute interstitial nephritis, the side effects of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury (AKI) and the progression of kidney disease still are controversial. We conducted a matched cohort study to examine the associations between PPI use and the side effects, especially in post-hospitalization AKI.

Methods

We investigated 340 participants from the multicenter, prospective, matched-cohort ASSESS-AKI study, which enrolled participants from December 2009 to February 2015. After the baseline index hospitalization, follow-up visits were conducted every six months, and included a collection of self-reported PPI use by participants. Post-hospitalization AKI was defined as the percentage increase from the nadir to peak inpatient SCr value was ≥ 50% and/or absolute increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL in peak inpatient serum creatinine compared with baseline outpatient serum creatinine. We applied a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model to test the relationship between PPI use and post-hospitalization AKI. Stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models also were conducted to examine the association between PPI use and the risk of progression of kidney disease.

Results

After controlling for demographic variables, baseline co-morbidities and drug use histories, there was no statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of post-hospitalization AKI (risk ratio [RR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.45). Stratified by AKI status at baseline, no significant relationships were confirmed between PPI use and the risk of recurrent AKI (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.56) or incidence of AKI (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.76). Similar non-significant results also were observed in the association between PPI use and the risk of progression of kidney diseases (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% CI, 0.51 to 4.36).

Conclusion

PPI use after the index hospitalization was not a significant risk factor for post-hospitalization AKI and progression of kidney diseases, regardless of the AKI status of participants at baseline.

### Inhibiting the proton pump: mechanisms, benefits, harms, and questions [^116CmbRZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the H + /K + -adenosine triphosphatase (the proton pump) is the final common mechanistic pathway in reducing gastric acid secretion pharmacologically. Proton pump inhibitors are widely used in upper gastrointestinal diseases, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, eradication of Helicobacter pylori in combination with antibiotics, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced peptic ulceration. Reviewing their benefits and harms in BMC Medicine, Scarpignato et al. report effectiveness in these conditions, and harms that are generally mild and uncommon (1–3%). Serious adverse reactions, such as tubulointerstitial nephritis, are rare. However, the risks of gastric and pancreatic cancer are unclear. Drug–drug interactions can occur through effects on P glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. Several questions remain. Do all proton pump inhibitors carry the same risks of serious adverse reactions? Which individuals are most susceptible? What are the time courses of individual reactions? What monitoring strategies are best? New drugs for the same indications continue to emerge, including potassium-competitive acid blockers, inhibitors of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, serotonergic agents/prokinetics, mucosal protectants, histamine H 3 receptor agonists, anti-gastrin agents, and esophageal pain modulators. Their benefit to harm balance remains to be discovered.

### Kidney function decline associated with proton pump inhibitors: results from the ELSA-Brasil cohort [^112zH2GB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Investigate the longitudinal association of use and time of use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) with incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney function change.

Methods

Prospective study with 13,909 participants from baseline (2008–2010) and second wave (2012–2014) of the ELSA-Brasil (mean interval between visits = 3.9 years (1.7–6.0)). Participants answered about use and time use of the PPI in the two weeks prior the interview. Renal function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate estimated by the Collaboration Equation for the Epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease. Values below 60ml/min/1.73 m² in wave 2 were considered incident CKD. Associations between PPI use and time of use at baseline and incident CKD and decline in renal function were estimated, respectively, by logistic regression and linear models with mixed effects, after adjusting for confounders.

Results

After adjustments, PPI users for more than six months had an increased risk of CKD compared to non-users. Compared to non-users, users PPIs for up to six months and above six months had greater decline in kidney function over time.

Conclusion

This cohort of adults and elderly, after a mean interval of 3.9 years, PPI use and initial duration were associated with kidney function change between visits.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^112tSgQc]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study revealed that PPI use was associated with increased odds of development of CKD and death. Although the association of PPI use with mortality has been widely reported, we found an association of PPI use with development of CKD. It is not surprising that PPI use is associated with CKD as these drugs are one of the most common causes of AIN in the United States.

Our study showed that PPI use increased the odds of development of CKD by 10%. The most likely explanation is unrecognized or partially recovered AIN. Thirty to 70% of patients with drug induced AIN do not fully recover their baseline renal function, likely due to rapid transformation of interstitial cellular infiltrates into large areas of fibrosis. Simpson et al found an incidence of AIN of 8.0 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 2.6–18.7), based on 15 cases and an estimated 750,000 1-month treatments dispensed annually. Blank et al found similar results in a case control study. Recovery from AKI occurs following withdrawal of the offending drug with or without corticosteroid treatment may not be complete and many patients are left with some degree of renal impairment. Geevasinga et al identified 18 cases of biopsy-proven PPI-induced AIN causing AKI in a retrospective case review. All patients recovered renal function, but the mean calculated creatinine clearance was 15.9 ml/min/ 1.73 m 2 and 11.5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 lower than baseline at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Simpson et al also noted an incomplete recovery of renal function after PPI induced AIN.

### Proton pump inhibitors and acute kidney injury: a nested case-control study [^111SnmTw]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Case and control definition

Given that the true nature of PPI-induce renal injury (i.e. AIN) is frequently misdiagnosed, multiple ICD-9 codes for acute or chronic renal disease were used to capture un-recognized cases. A practicing nephrologist was asked to identify renal disease diagnoses (Table 1) within the universe of ICD-9 codes that could be used to bill for AIN. Cases were defined as patients with at least two renal disease claims following 12 months of coverage within the study period. At least two claims were required to ensure that the first claim was not merely a diagnostic test used to rule out a renal disease.

Each case was then matched, using incident density sampling based on age, gender, county, and initial date of coverage with up to four randomly selected controls. Cases and controls were matched with the initial date of insurance coverage to account for changes in treatment patterns over the course of the study and to allow for the assignment of a common index date for each case and its controls. The index date was the service date of each case's first renal disease claim and was assigned to both the cases and matched controls to determine the timing of PPI use and the presence of potential confounders at the time of diagnosis.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^111QmKNU]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

No information to assess risk of bias

There were two studies with insufficient information to evaluate the overall risk of bias for the adverse kidney outcome assessed. In one study of PPI treatment (compared with non-users) and ESRD, there was insufficient information presented on adjustment for potential confounders and selection of reported results [adjusted HR = 4.44 (95% 1.83–10.78)]. However, we were able to assess the risk of bias as moderate for the selection and missing data domains, respectively. In addition, a study assessing the potential association between PPI (compared with non-users) and AKIas a sensitivity analysis [HR = 1.47 (95% 1.41–1.54)] did not provide sufficient information to evaluate the risk of bias due to confounding for this particular outcome. Per ROBINS-I criteria, the overall risk of bias was graded as no information. However, it should be noted that the risk of bias was graded as low for the remaining six domains.

Moreover, some studies have reported an association between omeprazole and both chronic kidney disease and acute interstitial nephritis. It was also the first PPI-related kidney injury reported as an adverse drug reaction. Cellular and molecular mechanisms have shown that omeprazole directly induces cell death in cultured renal tubular cells, both in vivo and in vitro, through the generation of oxidative stress. It also causes mitochondrial injury, leading to decreased ATP availability and increased oxidative stress, which, in turn, drives cell death. These findings provide biological plausibility to the epidemiological data linking omeprazole with AKI and ESRD.

Furthermore, our subgroup analyses revealed a consistent trend of increased ESRD risk in PPI users compared to H2B users, particularly in patients with advanced chronic renal disease. This effect was more pronounced in patients over 65 years and in females, as shown in Figure S2. Given that GERD more commonly affects women, and the prevalence of reflux esophagitis significantly increases with age in women, especially post-50s, prescribing PPIs other than omeprazole or esomeprazole may be a safer alternative for female patients or those over 65, particularly in Asian populations.

To our knowledge, this study represents the first population-based and focused on pre-ESRD population cohort analysis in Asia, a region characterized by a higher prevalence of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, to assess the risk of renal-adverse events associated with PPI use in CKD patients. A significant strength of our study is the enrollment of the study population in Taiwan's pre-ESRD program. This enrollment indicates that the participants were receiving consistent healthcare, allowing us to attribute the observed differences more confidently in ESRD and AKI risk to the use of PPIs and H2B, rather than to variances in healthcare delivery. Additionally, we employed a propensity score method, based on a counterfactual framework, to mitigate confounding factors and enhance the reliability of the association between the drug exposure and the observed outcomes.

Despite its strengths, our study has several limitations. One major constraint is our inability to assess medication compliance and the use of over-the-counter PPIs.

### Practical issues in clinical scenarios involving CKD patients requiring antithrombotic therapy in light of the 2017 ESC guideline recommendations [^115nce78]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussing the brand new class I indication on proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and DAPT for CKD patients

Observational studies have raised concerns that several PPIs, especially omeprazole, may decrease the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel through an inhibition of CYP2C19, resulting in an increased rate of major cardiovascular events when DAPT and PPIs were combined. However, a major confounder is the fact that patients receiving PPIs frequently represent a high-risk population, having several comorbidities, including CKD, which are themselves associated with worse outcomes and a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The latest ESC Update granted a class I level B indication for using a PPI in combination with DAPT. This recommendation mostly stems from the Clopidogrel and the Optimization of Gastrointestinal Events Trial (COGENT), which assessed the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of clopidogrel (75 mg) and omeprazole (20 mg) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (including patients with an ACS undergoing PCI), who are receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin (75 to 325 mg/d) for at least 12 months. The event rate for the primary gastrointestinal end-point was reduced from 2.9% with placebo to 1.1% with omeprazole at 180 days after randomization (P < 0.001).

Although there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary cardiovascular end-point between the two groups (P = 0.98), a finding which was consistent in higher-risk subgroups, these results " do no not rule out a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular events due to use of a PPI ". Importantly, as acknowledged by the authors themselves, the trial was not designed to represent high-risk patients. Since exclusion criteria comprised " clinically significant laboratory abnormality at screening or any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes participation in the study ", one may hypothesize that CKD patients were mostly excluded. Of note, neither the manuscript table of baseline patient features nor subgroup analyses reported any data related to baseline kidney function, although serum creatinine was measured at baseline according to the protocol. It is therefore actually unknown whether the COGENT findings may apply to CKD patients since it is likely that no interaction with baseline CKD could be sought in this trial.

Materials and methods

Study protocol

This systematic literature review was performed as outlined in guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The study protocol was developed with input from clinical experts and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42021227555).

Search strategy and data sources

Two electronic data sources (PubMed and Embase) were searched to identify potentially relevant studies published within 10 years of the search date, 17 December 2020. The search strategy included terms for AKI, AIN, or chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), CKD, ESRD, PPIs (including individual brand names), observational studies, and measures of association. All terms were searched using title/abstract and relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms in PubMed (details in) and title/abstract and database-recommended candidate terms in Embase (details in). A manual search of key publications and references was also conducted.

Study selection process and criteria

Dual process screening was individually conducted by two trained epidemiologist reviewers, with any disagreements in screening resolved during consensus or through consultation with a third senior reviewer. Titles and abstracts of articles identified using the search strategy were individually screened, and studies that included information on the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Timeframe, and Study Design/Setting (PICOTS)according to inclusion criteria were carried forward to the full-text review. All studies that were considered out-of-scope based on the inclusion criteria during the full-text review were excluded with a documented rationale.

Studies included in the final extraction met the following criteria: (1) adult patients (⩾18 years), (2) an original observational study (i.e. case-control, cohort/registry), (3) included PPI(s) as an intervention, (4) included H 2 blockers and/or non-users of PPIs as a comparator, and (5) measured at least one of the outcomes of interest (AKI, AIN, CIN, ATN, CKD, ESRD) with a measure of association [hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD)] (detailed eligibility requirements in).

### Kidney function decline associated with proton pump inhibitors: results from the ELSA-Brasil cohort [^1179jhHq]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs used for gastric disorders. Because of their low toxicity, they are overprescribed and not always used rationally. Although PPIs are safe, observational studies suggest that PPI use is associated with an increased risk of several adverse health events, including acute kidney injury (AKI), development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

According to the Kidney Disease Improvement Global Outcomes (KDIGO), CKD is characterized by persistent kidney damage (more than three months), usually identified by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. In developed countries, the estimated prevalence of CKD ranges from 5 to 15%. In Latin America, these data are still scarce, although some studies show an increasing number of people on renal replacement therapy. In a large epidemiological study in Brazil, the prevalence of CKD was estimated at 6.6% (95%CI 6.0–7.4%) among adults. The prevalence of CKD was determined in baseline exams (2008–2010) of the Longitudinal Health Study (ELSA-Brasil) and 8.9% had a glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### Proton pump inhibitors augment the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease in patients with acute kidney injury after temporary dialysis [^113nzq64]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been reported to increase the risk of acute and chronic renal disease. However, the data are unclear in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis (AKI-D) who are often candidates for PPIs. To investigate this important issue, we identified 26,052 AKI-D patients from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database weaning from dialysis. During a mean follow-up period of 3.52 years, the PPI users had a higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than the PPI nonusers (P < 0.001). After propensity score matching and treating mortality as a competing risk factor, the PPI users had a higher risk of ESRD (subhazard ratio (sHR) 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.31–1.50) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE, sHR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.37–1.71) compared with the PPI nonusers with AKI-D survivors. In conclusion, the use of PPIs was associated with a higher risk of ESRD and MACE, compared with the PPI nonusers in AKI-D patients who weaned from dialysis.

The inclusion of a propensity score in the model did not change the relationship between PPI use and renal disease (OR 2.05, CI 1.52, 2.72). Analyses of H2 Blockers showed that there was not a statistically significant relationship between H2 Blocker use and renal disease (OR 1.37, CI 0.46, 4.13).

To account for the potential that a 90 day exposure status may include patients not currently using PPIs, sensitivity analyses using a 15 and 30 exposure window were also conducted. The results, not presented, were consistent with and confirmed the base case analyses. Similarly, inclusion of just incident users (first PPI prescription within 90 days) confirmed the results of the base case analyses.

Patients and methods

Study design

Our study was a retrospective, nationwide population-based cohort study conducted in Taiwan. It aimed to estimate the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among adult pre-ESRD patients (CKD stage 3b to 5) associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), in comparison to the use of H2 blockers (H2B). The study received approval from the institutional review board of National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan (IRB no. A-EX-108–013).

Database

This study utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), provided by Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, encompassing comprehensive medical claims from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2018. The database included both inpatient and outpatient records, detailing disease diagnosis, prescription drugs, medical procedures, and surgeries. All healthcare service providers in Taiwan are mandated to submit diagnosis information, using the International Classification of Disease-Clinical Modification, ninth and tenth revisions (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10), along with all related service claims, for processing by the National Health Insurance. Validation studies of diagnoses in the NHIRD have shown a high positive predictive value for major diseases, making it useful for long-term follow-up observational studies.

Worsening Kidney Function

The number of observed events varied depending on the severity of the endpoint, ranging from 109 cases with eGFR below 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 to 2,601 cases with eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. The corresponding crude incidence rates ranged from 1.26 to 31.57 cases per 1,000 person-years (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6). Crude incidence rates were consistently lower for ranitidine than for PPIs, with the highest incidences observed for pantoprazole. For instance, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 had an IR 18.7 95%CI (12.0–27.8) for ranitidine and an IR 31.2 95%CI (29.9–32.5) for omeprazole. The analysis stratified by sex and age showed higher IRs of worsening kidney function as advancing age (Supplementary Tables 7–9). Figure 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 represent the cumulative incidence of worsening kidney function during the first two and the first year of follow-up, respectively.

Clinical outcomes

In our intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome, progression to ESRD, occurred in 9.71% of PPI users compared to 7.36% in H2B users during about 1 year follow-up (Table 2). The adjusted HR for this outcome was 1.495 (95% CI: 1.198–1.867, Fig. 2 A). Similarly, the secondary outcome, AKI, was observed in 6.18% of PPI users and 4.81% of H2B users, with an adjusted HR of 1.395 (95% CI: 1.058–1.840, Fig. 2 B). Specific analysis of individual PPIs showed that both omeprazole and esomeprazole were significantly associated with a higher risk of progression to ESRD and AKI, with adjusted HRs of 1.784 (95% CI: 1.079–2.951) and 1.847 (95% CI: 1.332–2.561). Conversely, rabeprazole was associated with a potentially lower risk of progression to ESRD and AKI (Table 3).

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^114q3Jpa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Moderate risk of bias

The overwhelming majority of studies (n = 19; 73%) were judged as having a moderate risk of bias for the adverse kidney outcomes assessed. Among these 19 studies, 14 were cohort (retrospective, prospective), with the remainder being case-control. Across the 19 studies, confounding bias was assessed as moderate due to the lack of control for potential critical confounders of interest (i.e. age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure/hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, liver disease, and NSAID use), which varied across the studies. In addition, 10 of the 19 studies. were judged as having a moderate risk of selection bias for the adverse kidney outcomes assessed, mostly due to the inclusion of patients with PPI use prior to study initiation (i.e. prevalent users).

The description of individual PPI (or a specific PPI) used by participants was not uniformly reported across studies. For those studies reporting this information, PPI type generally comprised omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole; the limited information on dosage differed by PPI type (15 mg/day or 30 mg/day of lansoprazole, 20 mg/day of esomeprazole, 10 mg/day of rabeprazole, and 20 mg/day of omeprazole). The length of follow-up varied widely, ranging from 14 days to approximately 14 years for AKI, 120 days to approximately 16 years for CKD, and 1 to 5 years for ESRD.

Among the 19 studies, nine reported more than one outcome. AKI was the most frequently assessed outcome assessed as having a moderate risk of bias with 12 studies identified. In total, they represented 7,958,698 patients from the United States, Canada, China, Japan, Denmark, France, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, with 65% of patients stemming from a large aggregation of three national databases in New Zealand. Patients were more likely to be older, with 11 studies reporting a mean or median age over 60 years at baseline.

### Kidney function decline associated with proton pump inhibitors: results from the ELSA-Brasil cohort [^117F6T9b]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study showed that PPI use and duration of its use of up to six months and above are associated with reduced eGFR. We also showed that PPI use for over six months is associated with an increase in the risk of developing CKD in a large sample of adult and elderly Brazilian people. Although observational studies do not have the best design to determine cause and effect, due to the large number of individuals currently using PPIs, healthcare professionals need to be cautious when prescribing, as well as monitoring the use of these drugs, due to the potential effects adverse.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^113kw8zK]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Multivariate analysis

Logistic analyses revealed a statistically significant increase in the rate of occurrence of mortality and CKD among patients who were taking PPIs compared to those who were not taking PPIs (Table 3). Figures 1 and 2 give the estimated probabilities of event by age for CKD and mortality analysis. We estimated probability of event by age from the fitted model (mean time at risk were 12.4 quarters and 15.9 for CKD and mortality, respectively). There was a significant effect of the interaction of age and PPI use (p -value < 0.0001), in models for both development of CKD and mortality. The result shows patients younger than 53 years old were significantly at higher risk of CKD incidence if taking PPI. Patients younger than 78 years old had significantly in higher risk of death if taking PPI. To determine whether the effect of PPI varied according to baseline characteristics, we performed stratified analyses for the risk of CKD and mortality. Patients who were white, male, < 65 years and did not have DM, vascular disease, cancer were at greater risk of CKD outcome if on PPI than if not on PPI blockers. However mortality outcome with PPI did not vary based on demographic or comorbidity (Table 4).

Sensitivity analyses

1 Adding CKD (Yes/No) as a covariate in the analysis of mortality, the CKD effect was significant but the PPI effect on mortality did not change; 2. When we controlled for propensity score the odds ratio for CKD outcome was 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13), and for mortality outcome the odds ratio was 1.70 (95% CI 1.62–1.79), for PPI versus no PPI. 3. For the propensity matched data results were similar.

### Proton pump inhibitors in the elderly population [^116Anx8J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of acid-related diseases, including gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), are important health care priorities, particularly in the elderly. Both the prevalence and severity of GORD are increased in older individuals. The reason for the age-related increase in the prevalence of GORD is not completely understood, but it appears to result from both age-related changes in physiology and effects of the medications often taken by older people. The diagnosis of GORD in the elderly is also difficult because of its potential atypical presentation in these patients, as well as the overlap between GORD symptoms and those of other chronic conditions, including coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are now considered the treatment of choice for patients with GORD, and these drugs have excellent efficacy and safety profiles. One of the newer drugs in this class, rabeprazole, may be particularly suited for use in older patients. Rabeprazole requires no dosing adjustment in the elderly or in patients with renal insufficiency or mild-to-moderate hepatic disease. It is also relatively free of clinically significant drug-drug interactions, which strongly differentiates rabeprazole from omeprazole, the prototype PPI. Overall, the clinical and pharmacokinetic profiles for rabeprazole suggest that it is an excellent first choice for the management of older patients with GORD.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^115kotyo]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

We did several sensitivity analyses: 1. We removed individuals with baseline CKD for the analysis of mortality and added CKD (Yes/No) as a covariate in the analysis of mortality outcome; 2. For the second sensitivity analysis, we first defined the propensity score as the estimated probability of receiving PPI, which was obtained from a logistic regression analysis of PPI on age, race, sex and the pre-PPI comorbidity variables: vascular disease, COPD, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. We repeated our analysis of case–control data for each outcome of interest controlling for propensity score instead of controlling for comorbidities prior to PPI; 3. We also used propensity score matching (PSM) technique to reduce the bias due to confounding variables.

It should be noted, in the sensitivity analyses that involved propensity scoring, all potentially confounding variables except GI were included in the propensity score. GI was of particular interest separately and, therefore, was added to the model directly as a covariate. This allows interpretation of the coefficient on PPI as the effect of PPI unconfounded by preceding GI and the coefficient on GI as the effect of preceding GI that is not mediated through the effect of GI on the decision to prescribe PPI. Thus, since GI is an indication for PPI prescription and it is known that GI is associated with CKD and death, including GI as a covariate directly allows us to assess whether the effect of GI is mediated through its effect on PPI.

All of the analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) [Statistical significance was set to α = 0.05]. The Logistic procedure in SAS was used for the analysis of each model.

### Accelerated risk of renal disease progression in pre-ESRD patients with proton pump inhibitors use: a nationwide population-based study [^111JX96N]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our comprehensive, nationwide population-based study in Taiwan, we observed a significant association between the use of PPIs and the increased risk of progression to ESRD and AKI, compared to H2B use, in patients with moderate to advanced kidney disease (CKD stage 3b to 5). This association was notably pronounced in PPIs, such as omeprazole and esomeprazole.

Most previous cohort studies have identified an association between PPI use and adverse renal outcomes, including incident CKD, ESRD, and AKI, in patients with normal baseline renal function. In contrast, our study specifically focused on patients with moderate to advanced kidney disease (CKD stages 3b to 5). This difference in the study population likely explains why we observed a higher incidence of progression to ESRD compared to previous studies that included patients with normal renal function.

Similar findings were reported by Grant et al. and Liabeuf et al. who examined PPI safety in CKD (estimated Glomerular filtration rate, eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) and employed a new-user study design, but compared to non-PPI use. Grant et al. identified that an association between PPI use and an increased risk of major adverse renal events, including the doubling of creatinine or progression to ESRD. Liabeuf et al. also noted a significant association between PPI use and an elevated risk of ESRD, particularly in new users compared to long-term users, and found a dose–response relationship with PPIs, based on the defined daily dose (DDD).

Our findings contrast with Cholin et al. study, which also focused on patients with established CKD and utilized H2B as an active comparator. Although Cholin et al. enrolled patients with CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m 2), the patients with CKD stage 3a was more than 70% in this study population. Cholin et al. reported that PPI use in a CKD population was not associated with an increased progression to ESRD compared to H2B use or no medication, with cumulative incidence at four years being 2.0%, 1.5%, and 1.6% respectively (P = 0.22).

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with increased risk of development of chronic kidney disease [^114iVnJ2]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

Two separate retrospective case–control study designs were employed with a prospective logistic regression analysis of data to evaluate the association of two different outcomes (development of CKD and death) with PPI use. The data were obtained from the Veterans Affairs Health Care Upstate New York (VISN2) network, which is composed of five VA medical centers and 29 community based outpatient clinics. The VISN2 database contains longitudinal records of 180,553 VA patients, who were seen in primary care VISN2 clinics from 4/2001 until 4/2008.

Participants

Patients were included only if they had at least one outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated by the Chronic Kidney Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equation during their observation period. For the CKD study, we excluded patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 at entry (pre-existing CKD patients). Cases were identified as those patients who were subsequently diagnosed with CKD (ie, had an observed eGFR < 60). Controls were identified as those patients who were not diagnosed with CKD during their observation period. Records were retrospectively reviewed starting from the time of CKD diagnosis for cases, and from the time of last observation for controls to assess whether or not risk factors existed in the history of each patient. For the mortality study, cases were identified as individuals who died during the observation period and controls as individuals who were alive on March 31, 2008.

Risk factor variables

The primary risk factor to be tested for significance was the prescription of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the history of cases or controls. PPI use was determined by whether a prescription was filled during a quarter. In addition to use of PPI (Yes/No), the following control variables were included in the analyses: age, gender, race, time at risk (ie, time from initial observation in the data system to the case–control outcome), and the pre-PPI comorbidity variables: vascular disease, gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^112woTnL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Similar rates of progression to ESKD and overall mortality were noted among PPI vs H2B users in the CKD population. There were several limitations to this study, the biggest one being the inability to confirm duration of prescription use. However, the results from this study are still relevant, as a large portion of the CKD population rely on acid-suppressing therapy to manage their co-morbidities. Although more prospective research is still needed, the results from this study suggest that proton-pump inhibitors may be safe for use in select CKD patients.

### Patients' perceptions of proton pump inhibitor risks and attempts at discontinuation: a national survey [^113KComp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Little is known about how reports on the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) impact patients' perceptions of these drugs and medication use. We sought to determine patients' level of concern about PPI adverse effects and its association with attempts to discontinue these drugs.

Methods

This study is an online survey of US adults who use PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Topics included awareness of and concern about PPI adverse effects, prior discussion with providers, and attempts to stop PPI because of concern about adverse effects. For the primary analysis, we used logistic regression to identify associations between having attempted to stop PPI and concern about PPI-related adverse effects, a provider's recommendation to stop, risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), age, and gender.

Results

Among 755 patient participants, mean age was 49 years (s.d. 16), 71% were women, and 24% were at high risk of UGIB. Twenty percent of patients were able to write in ≥ 1 reported adverse effect, and 46% endorsed awareness of ≥ 1 adverse effect when presented with a list, most commonly chronic kidney disease (17%). Thirty-three percent of patients were slightly concerned, 32% somewhat concerned, and 14% extremely concerned about adverse effects. Twenty-four percent of patients had discussed PPI risks and benefits with a provider, and 9% had been recommended to stop. Thirty-nine percent had attempted to stop their PPI, most (83%) without a provider recommendation. Factors associated with an attempt at stopping PPI included: (i) provider recommendation to stop (odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [1.82–5.83]); (ii) concern about adverse effects (OR 5.13 [2.77–9.51] for slightly, 12.0 [6.51–22.2] for somewhat, and 19.4 [9.75–38.7] for extremely concerned); and (iii) female gender (OR 1.64 [1.12–2.39]). Patients at high risk of UGIB were as likely to have attempted to stop as others (OR 0.98 [0.66–1.44]).

Conclusions

Concern about PPIs is common and strongly associated with attempts at discontinuation, even without a provider's recommendation. Notably, individuals at high risk of UGIB, who benefit from PPIs, were equally likely to have tried stopping PPIs as others. Providers should proactively discuss the risks and benefits of PPIs with their patients, who may otherwise make unwise decisions about PPI management on their own.

Associations of regular use of PPIs with the risk of all-cause and specific-cause mortality

For individual PPIs, regular use of omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and other PPIs showed no associations with all-cause mortality (Figure 1). We generally found no evidence of interaction for sex, age, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, PPI indications, and regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see Supplementary Figures S2–S8, Supplementary Digital Contents 6–12).

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective matched cohort study [^1127wazr]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With a prospective cohort study of 340 participants, after adjusting for demographic variables, baseline co-morbidities and drug use histories, PPI use after the index hospitalization was not a significant risk factor for post-hospitalization AKI and progression of kidney diseases, regardless of the AKI status of participants at baseline.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and worsening kidney function: a retrospective cohort study including 122, 606 acid-suppressing users [^116bzg5i]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study showed a similar risk of worsening kidney function in PPI initiators compared with ranitidine users, and PPI initiators had a lower risk of AKI compared to ranitidine initiators based on the Aberdeen algorithm. The latter finding was not observed when AKI was defined based on hospitalizations (small number of cases). Also, the results based on the Aberdeen algorithm seem to be more valid because laboratory values play a critical role in AKI diagnosis, as previously reported in other studies. Compared with previous publications, our study included a large sample size with laboratory results available for over 120,000 acid-suppressing drugs initiators.

In recent years, it has been hypothesized that PPI may cause CKD secondary to recurrent AKI or hypomagnesemia. Lazarus et al. first reported that PPI use was an independent risk factor for CKD, but not H2-blocker use. Arora et al. described an increased risk of CKD in PPI users vs. non PPI users in a retrospective case–control study. Xie et al. found a small increased risk of eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2, incident CKD, eGFR decline over 30%, and ESRD or eGFR decline over 50% in PPI users compared with H2-blockers users, independently of AKI occurrence. Klatte et al. also found a slight increased risk of doubling sCr and > 30% eGFR decline in PPI users as compared with H2-blockers. However, these findings were not confirmed in randomized controlled trials. Other studies such as Dos Santos et al. only found a borderline association between higher incidence of CKD and PPI use after adjusting by confounders.

### Risk of bias in non-randomized observational studies assessing the relationship between proton-pump inhibitors and adverse kidney outcomes: a systematic review [^112Zoy8Q]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

We also identified six studies, with a moderate risk of bias that assessed ESRD outcomes (e.g. MARE, ESRD, ESRD, or > 50% decline in eGFR, ESKD). In total, they represented 660,560 patients from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, France, and Taiwan. Effect estimates for the association between PPI treatment (compared with non-PPI users or H 2 blocker users) and ESRD-related outcomes ranged from an adjusted HR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.02–1.25)to 5.32 (95% CI 1.53–18.55), with a single study reporting an adjusted OR of 1.88 (95% CI 1.71–2.06). Finally, three studies, reported on the association between PPIs and AIN, with an adjusted HR of 3.00 (95% CI 1.47–6.14)reported in a single study among 581,184 patients in Canada and adjusted ORs ranging from 2.05 (95% CI 1.52–2.72)to 3.20 (95% CI 0.80–12.79)among 4143 patients from the United States and 3415 patients from the United Kingdom, respectively.

Serious risk of bias

A total of six studies (four cohort, one case-control, one case-cohort), reported outcomes that were assessed as having a serious risk of bias (see Table 2). Adverse kidney outcomes included three studies of AKI, in 2043 patients and three studies of CKD, in 650,685 patients. The primary reasons for an overall serious risk of bias judgment for these six studies included potential bias due to confounding, selection bias, and classification of interventions. Across these six studies, PPI treatment (compared with non-users) was moderately associated with AKI and CKD outcomes, respectively, with adjusted HRs ranging from 0.82 (95% CI 0.40–1.67) to 2.85 (95% CI 1.34–6.08)and adjusted ORs ranging from 1.10 (95% CI 1.05–1.16)to 2.85 (95% CI 1.81–4.48).

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective matched cohort study [^1111K1Pu]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, there was no statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of kidney disease progression, while most previous studies showed PPI as a significant harmful factor for kidney disease progression. Participants in our study were provided access to more professional medication instructions and supervision than those in the population retrospective studies. Previous studies suggested that monitoring of kidney function was essential to lower the risk of adverse events of PPI. The ASSESS-AKI study was a prospective cohort study in which participants underwent annual clinic visits to assess their health status and receive appropriate health guidance. The individuals included in retrospective data analyses do not always have that opportunity. Our analysis strongly suggests that judicious use of PPI with instructions from health care providers could decrease potential risks of unwanted side effects.

A clinical concern regarding our study is the possibility of insufficient PPI exposure, which could result in a non-significant impact on post-hospitalization AKI. Unlike retrospective studies, which can trace back to the initiation of PPI use, our prospective study can only capture the PPI use period after participant recruitment. We did not collect information as to when participants began using PPIs or their reasons for requiring PPIs. In our cohort, the median PPI exposure duration was 3.8 years (interquartile range, 1.1–5.2). This exposure period is comparable to a previous study that reported 3.9 years (interquartile range, 3–4.2) and demonstrated a significant HR of 2.89 (95% CI, 1.91–4.38) for PPI use in relation to AKI events. Therefore, PPI users in our study have a similar exposure period to those in previous research. An additional concern pertains to the dosages of PPI use in our study. A previous investigation indicated that higher PPI dosages are associated with increased hazard ratios for kidney diseases compared to standard dosages. Regrettably, we did not gather dosage information in our cohort, preventing us from assessing the effect of PPI dosage on post-hospitalization AKI outcomes.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics and risk of acute kidney injury: a self-controlled case series study [^114ctQgf]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. However, several studies have suggested that PPI use increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). PPIs are often concomitantly used with antibiotics, such as macrolides and penicillins for Helicobacter pylori eradication. Although macrolide antibiotics are considered to have relatively low nephrotoxicity, they are well known to increase the risk of AKI due to drug-drug interactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PPI use and the development of AKI. We also evaluated the effect of concomitant use of PPIs and macrolide antibiotics on the risk of AKI.

Methods

This self-controlled case series study was conducted using electronic medical records at Kyoto University Hospital. We identified patients who were prescribed at least one PPI and macrolide antibiotic between January 2014 and December 2019 and underwent blood examinations at least once a year. An adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) of AKI with PPI use or concomitant use macrolide antibiotics with PPIs was estimated using a conditional Poisson regression model controlled for the estimated glomerular filtration rate at the beginning of observation and use of potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics.

Results

Of the 3,685 individuals who received PPIs and macrolide antibiotics, 766 patients with episodes of stage 1 or higher AKI were identified. Any stage of AKI was associated with PPI use (aIRR, 1.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.04)). Stage 2 or higher AKI was observed in 279 cases, with an estimated aIRR of 2.01 (95% CI 1.57 to 2.58, for PPI use). For the period of concomitant use of macrolide antibiotics with PPIs compared with the period of PPIs alone, an aIRR of stage 1 or higher AKI was estimated as 0.82 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.13).

Conclusions

Our findings added epidemiological information for the association between PPI use and an increased risk of stage 1 or higher AKI. However, we did not detect an association between the concomitant use of macrolide antibiotics and an increased risk of AKI in PPI users.

### The association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of post-hospitalization acute kidney injury: a multicenter prospective matched cohort study [^114YkGKx]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Association between PPI use and the risk of post-hospitalization AKI

After controlling for demographic variables, baseline co-morbidities and drug use histories, there was no statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of post-hospitalization AKI (rate ratio [RR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.45). Stratified by AKI status at baseline, no significant relationships were confirmed between PPI use and the risk of recurrent AKI (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.56) or incidence of AKI (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.76) (Table 2).

Outcome of kidney disease progression

After controlling for demographic variables, baseline co-morbidities and drug use histories, there was no statistically significant association between PPI use and risk of kidney disease progression (Hazard Ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% CI, 0.51 to 4.36). Similar non-significant results also were observed in participants with AKI at baseline (HR 2.41, 95% CI, 0.68 to 8.61) and participants without AKI at baseline (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.96) (Table 2).

Power justification results

Throughout the 10,000 simulation iterations, approximately 8,000 of the simulated data sets resulted in statistically significant rate ratios (P < 0.05). At this point, we achieved 80% empirical power. With 68 participants in the exposure group and 272 participants in the matched control group, we determined the detectable effect size (rate ratio) to be 1.40 in our study.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular, renal or gastrointestinal comorbidities: joint APAGE / APLAR / APSDE / APSH / APSN / PoA recommendations [^111X1Brb]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most commonly prescribed medications, but they are associated with a number of serious adverse effects, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney injury and GI complications.

Objective

To develop a set of multidisciplinary recommendations for the safe prescription of NSAIDs.

Methods

Randomised control trials and observational studies published before January 2018 were reviewed, with 329 papers included for the synthesis of evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Whenever possible, a NSAID should be avoided in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, high risk of cardiovascular disease and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Before treatment with a NSAID is started, blood pressure should be measured, unrecognised CKD should be screened in high risk cases, and unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be investigated. For patients with high cardiovascular risk, and if NSAID treatment cannot be avoided, naproxen or celecoxib are preferred. For patients with a moderate risk of peptic ulcer disease, monotherapy with a non-selective NSAID plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), or a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor should be used; for those with a high risk of peptic ulcer disease, a selective COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI are needed. For patients with pre-existing hypertension receiving renin-angiotensin system blockers, empirical addition (or increase in the dose) of an antihypertensive agent of a different class should be considered. Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored in most cases.

Conclusion

NSAIDs are a valuable armamentarium in clinical medicine, but appropriate recognition of high-risk cases, selection of a specific agent, choice of ulcer prophylaxis and monitoring after therapy are necessary to minimise the risk of adverse events.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease… [^112GXH3k]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

In the Geisinger Health System replication cohort, PPI use was associated with CKD in all analyses, including a time-varying new-user design. Twice-daily PPI dosing was associated with a higher risk than once-daily dosing. Conclusions and Relevance Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with a higher risk of incident CKD. Future research should evaluate whether limiting PPI use reduces the incidence of CKD. 14, 15 and acute kidney injury. 16–18 It is plausible that PPI use may also be a risk factor for CKD, potentially mediated by recurrent AKI, 19, 20 or by hypomagnesemia, which has been associated with PPI use21 and with incident CKD. 22 To our knowledge, no population-based studies have evaluated the association between PPI use and the risk of CKD.

The objective of this study was to quantify the association between PPI use and incident kidney disease in the general population. We hypothesized that PPI use is an independent risk factor for CKD and that the use of Histamine2 receptor antagonists, another common class of medications used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, is not. In a prospective community-based cohort of more than 10 000 adults, we found that baseline use of PPIs was independently associated with a 20% to 50% higher risk of incident CKD, after adjusting for several potential confounding variables, including demographics, socioeconomic status, clinical measurements, prevalent comorbidities, and concomitant use of medications. The observed association persisted when PPI exposure was modeled as a time-varying ever-use variable and was replicated in a separate administrative cohort of 248 751 individuals.

The risk was specific to PPI medications because the use of H2 receptor antagonists, which are prescribed for the same indication as PPIs, was not independently associated with CKD. Similar findings were demonstrated for the outcome of AKI and collectively suggest that PPI use is an independent risk factor for CKD and for AKI. Each of these sensitivity analyses showed a consistent association between PPI use and a higher risk of CKD.

### Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors in chronic kidney disease… [^111ZqX5P]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor We took interest in an article by Lazarus and colleagues published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine about proton pump inhibitors. 1 Proton pump inhibitors are common drugs worldwide that are essential for the treatments of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, and dyspepsia. However, several recent studies reported that PPIs increased the risk of fractures, hypomagnesemia, myocardial infarction, and cryptogenic liver abscess. 2–5 In the article by Lazarus and colleagues, 1 the authors examined the association of PPI use and the risk of kidney disease and drew the conclusions that PPI use was associated with a higher risk of incident chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury. 5 Here, we raise some points that should be noted.

### Adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors… [^113Prj1F]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors have been among the most widely prescribed medications in the United States for decades. This is largely due to 2 very common uses of PPIs: treatment of dyspepsia and prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients prescribed antiplatelet therapy, coupled with the belief that PPIs have few adverse effects. However, mounting evidence demonstrates that PPIs are associated with a number of adverse effects and are overprescribed. This issue was highlighted in JAMA Internal Medicine's launch of the Less Is More series in 2010. 1, 2 Since then, additional evidence of adverse effects of PPIs has accumulated. In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Lazarus et al3 add chronic kidney disease to the list of possible harms of PPIs. Schoenfeld AJ, Grady D. Adverse Effects Associated With Proton Pump Inhibitors. JAMA Intern Med. 2016; 176: 172–174.

### Ibuprofen-associated renal dysfunction… [^11176MPk]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Ibuprofen-associated, acute, reversible renal failure with hyperkalemia, tubular necrosis, and proteinuria developed in a patient who had no predisposing underlying disease. A renal biopsy specimen revealed mesangial hypercellularity without glomerular crescent formation. A profound interstitial nephritis with focal inflammatory cell infiltrates of predominantly mononuclear cells and neutrophils as well as focal tubular destruction was seen. Vasculitis was not observed. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the light microscopic diagnosis of a tubulointerstitial nephritis and, in addition, indicated the presence of electron-dense mesangial and subepithelial deposits. Direct immunofluorescence examination showed diffuse mesangial IgM and C3 deposition as well as vascular C3 deposition. Renal failure rapidly resolved after discontinuation of ibuprofen therapy and initiation of steroid therapy, with return to normal levels of serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, potassium, and sodium.

Proteinuria also resolved. Marasco WA, Gikas PW, Azziz-Baumgartner R, Hyzy R, Eldredge CJ, Stross J. Ibuprofen-Associated Renal Dysfunction: Pathophysiologic Mechanisms of Acute Renal Failure, Hyperkalemia, Tubular Necrosis, and Proteinuria. Arch Intern Med. 1987; 147: 2107–2116.
