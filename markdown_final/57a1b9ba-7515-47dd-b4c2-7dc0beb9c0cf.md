Labs for hyperparathyroidism

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step laboratory evaluation algorithm for hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect PHPT and how to screen. Then, I should confirm the biochemical diagnosis with repeat measurements and appropriate assay selection. Next, I need to assemble a baseline laboratory panel and urinary evaluation, differentiate PHPT from FHH and secondary causes, and assess end-organ involvement. After that, I will consider indications for genetic testing, pre-operative biochemical preparation, and surveillance strategies if surgery is deferred. Finally, I will summarize the algorithm and double-check assay nuances and underdiagnosis pitfalls to ensure completeness.

> Let me first confirm when to suspect PHPT and what to obtain initially. PHPT often presents as asymptomatic hypercalcemia on routine chemistry panels, but I should also keep nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis or low BMD (especially distal radius), and neurocognitive complaints in mind; in places without routine screening, symptomatic presentations are more common, so vigilance matters. The initial laboratory step is an adjusted total serum calcium, with ionized calcium added if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected or albumin abnormalities make interpretation uncertain [^113LrxeF] [^114guUzo]. Hold on, I should also remember that PHPT is frequently missed in stone formers and even in general hypercalcemia cohorts; ensuring timely PTH testing in those contexts reduces underdiagnosis [^1113BYYS] [^112jCwYy].

> Next, I should review how to biochemically confirm hypercalcemic PHPT. Wait, let me verify that a single abnormality is insufficient. The diagnosis requires repeat testing on at least two occasions, generally two weeks apart, documenting elevated albumin-adjusted calcium with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH using a second- or third-generation assay. I need to ensure that the PTH is interpreted as "inappropriately normal" when calcium is high, since true suppression would be expected otherwise [^115mxSJ5] [^113jGG36] [^111g74q9].

> Now, I will examine the criteria for normocalcemic PHPT, but I must not jump to conclusions. For nPHPT, both adjusted total and ionized calcium should be normal on at least two occasions over 3–6 months while PTH remains persistently elevated, and only after exhaustive exclusion of secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, CKD, malabsorption, and medications. Let me double-check that the interval is 3–6 months and that both second- and third-generation assays are acceptable; yes, that's correct [^114KmBRe] [^111PJEAj] [^113LrxeF].

> Next, I should assemble the core baseline laboratory panel to characterize disease and guide management. The essentials include adjusted total calcium (or ionized if needed), intact PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, and phosphorus; magnesium is reasonable to add. Hmm, wait a minute — do I prefer eGFR or CrCl for renal assessment? I initially thought eGFR would be sufficient, but I should correct that: the Fifth International Workshop emphasizes CrCl as preferred over eGFR for longitudinal renal assessment in PHPT, so I need to ensure CrCl is available or calculated [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs] [^1145Xcuv].

> I will now examine the urinary evaluation and differentiation from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. A 24-hour urinary calcium and creatinine are needed to calculate the calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio; a ratio less than 0.01 suggests FHH, and the 0.01–0.02 zone is a gray area with overlap that may warrant genetic testing. Hold on, I should verify stone risk assessment as well; in stone formers, a full 24-hour urine stone risk profile is recommended when feasible [^115DeQBZ] [^1173ejdr] [^111aZ7bs].

> But wait, what if secondary hyperparathyroidism is the real issue rather than PHPT. I need to ensure meticulous exclusion of secondary causes when calcium is normal with elevated PTH: replete vitamin D to at least 30 ng/mL, account for CKD, malabsorption, dietary calcium insufficiency or hypercalciuria from other etiologies, and review thiazide or lithium exposure; ectopic PTH is exceedingly rare but should be on the long differential checklist. Let me reconsider the vitamin D target and confirm it aligns with the latest guidance; maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL and below the lab ULN is recommended [^114DBWVe] [^111H4sYr] [^113LrxeF].

> Next, I should review end-organ assessment because it drives surgical decision-making and monitoring. For renal involvement, I should confirm CrCl, assess nephrolithiasis risk with the 24-hour urine (calcium, oxalate, citrate as indicated), and obtain renal imaging if symptoms or history suggest stones. For skeletal involvement, I should confirm DEXA at three sites — lumbar spine, total hip, and distal one-third radius — and consider alkaline phosphatase or bone turnover markers if available, recognizing their adjunctive rather than diagnostic role [^113LrxeF] [^114guUzo] [^111aZ7bs].

> I need to check indications for genetic testing, especially in younger patients or those with atypical features. Indications include diagnosis under age 35, a family history of hypercalcemia or parathyroid disease, prior unsuccessful parathyroid surgery, multigland disease, urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio less than 0.02 suggesting FHH, and syndromic features concerning for MEN or CDC73-related disease. Let me verify the specific genes to consider: MEN1, RET, and CDC73 for hereditary PHPT, and CaSR, GNA11, AP2S1 for FHH; genetic counseling should precede testing [^115K4TYH] [^11359pDe] [^112yz8Bz].

> Before surgery, I should confirm appropriate pre-operative biochemical preparation and baselines for intraoperative interpretation. Immediate pre-incision intact PTH and serum calcium establish context for intraoperative PTH kinetics; vitamin D should be repleted to at least 30 ng/mL to mitigate hungry bone risk, and renal function should be verified. Hold on, I should also verify special cases: lithium-associated PHPT may alter surgical strategy, and very high calcium and PTH should raise suspicion for carcinoma and prompt careful planning and pathology review. Preoperative localization imaging, while not diagnostic, is standard for operative planning using high-resolution neck ultrasound and sestamibi or 4D-CT when needed [^111H4sYr] [^1139yAGB] [^114cXnqP] [^112goaqb] [^114QRTai].

> For patients managed nonoperatively, I should double-check surveillance intervals. Annual labs should include serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and renal function with CrCl preferred over eGFR; PTH can be measured as clinically indicated. DEXA at three sites is recommended every 1–2 years, and 24-hour urine calcium can be repeated if stone risk is present or changes occur. Indications to reconsider surgery include progressive hypercalcemia, declining renal function, new or recurrent nephrolithiasis, and significant declines in bone mineral density or the emergence of symptoms [^1145Xcuv] [^114guUzo].

> Let me summarize the algorithm to ensure I have not missed a step. Screen with adjusted serum calcium and add ionized calcium if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected; confirm PHPT with repeat adjusted calcium and intact PTH on two occasions using second- or third-generation assays; complete a baseline panel including 25-hydroxyvitamin D, phosphorus, creatinine with CrCl, and magnesium; obtain a 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine to calculate the Ca/Cr clearance ratio and to evaluate stone risk; exclude secondary causes rigorously; assess bone and kidney involvement with DEXA at lumbar spine, hip, distal radius and appropriate renal evaluation; consider genetic testing in the appropriate clinical scenarios; prepare preoperatively with calcium, PTH, vitamin D optimization, and renal review; and if nonoperative management is chosen, surveil with annual biochemistry and periodic DEXA while maintaining readiness to pivot to surgery if criteria emerge [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs] [^114fQoUh] [^115DeQBZ].

> Hold on, I should verify assay-related caveats because they can influence interpretation though not usually the diagnosis itself. Second- and third-generation PTH assays are both acceptable for PHPT diagnosis; absolute PTH values vary across assays and labs, so consistency and awareness of reference intervals matter. During parathyroidectomy, rapid PTH dynamics may be detected earlier with third-generation assays, but for initial diagnosis the key is the inappropriate elevation relative to calcium rather than the exact numeric value [^113jGG36] [^111g74q9].

> Finally, I need to ensure we address the real-world gap of underdiagnosis. Stone formers with hypercalcemia should have PTH checked, and health systems often miss opportunities to evaluate hypercalcemic patients for PHPT. Embedding reflex PTH prompts or education can reduce missed cases and expedite definitive management when indicated [^1113BYYS] [^112jCwYy].

The key labs for hyperparathyroidism are **serum calcium and PTH** measured on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart, with calcium adjusted for albumin and PTH assessed by a second- or third-generation assay [^115mxSJ5]. Also obtain **phosphorus, 25(OH)D, creatinine/eGFR, and 24-hour urine calcium** to confirm diagnosis, exclude secondary causes, and assess complications [^113LrxeF] [^111aZ7bs]. Use the **urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio** to distinguish PHPT from FHH (PHPT > 0.02; FHH < 0.01) [^115DeQBZ]. For normocalcemic PHPT, confirm normal calcium with elevated PTH on two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding secondary causes [^114KmBRe]. Monitor serum calcium and 25(OH)D annually, and check PTH, renal function, and 24-hour urine calcium as indicated [^1145Xcuv].

## Core diagnostic laboratory tests

### Serum calcium

For serum calcium assessment, **total serum calcium** is elevated in PHPT and should be adjusted for albumin to avoid misclassification [^115mxSJ5]. Measure **ionized calcium** if normocalcemic PHPT is suspected or if total calcium is borderline [^113LrxeF].

---

### Parathyroid hormone (PTH)

Intact **PTH** is elevated or inappropriately normal despite hypercalcemia and should be measured with second- or third-generation assays [^115mxSJ5]. In **normocalcemic PHPT**, PTH is elevated with normal calcium on at least two occasions over 3–6 months after excluding secondary causes [^114KmBRe].

---

### Serum phosphorus

Serum phosphorus is typically **low or low-normal** due to PTH-mediated renal phosphate wasting [^113LrxeF].

---

### Vitamin D status

Measure **25-hydroxyvitamin D** to exclude secondary hyperparathyroidism and guide correction of deficiency [^113LrxeF].

---

### Renal function tests

Serum **creatinine and eGFR** assess renal function and help exclude secondary hyperparathyroidism from CKD [^113LrxeF].

---

### 24-hour urinary calcium excretion

24-hour urine **calcium** is typically elevated in PHPT and helps distinguish PHPT from FHH [^111aZ7bs]. The **calcium/creatinine clearance ratio** is usually > 0.02 in PHPT and < 0.01 in FHH [^114DBWVe].

---

## Additional laboratory tests for differential diagnosis

### Differentiating PHPT from secondary hyperparathyroidism

Vitamin D **deficiency** shows low 25(OH)D and elevated PTH with normal or low calcium, consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Chronic **kidney disease** features elevated PTH with reduced eGFR, indicating secondary hyperparathyroidism from CKD.

---

### Differentiating PHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)

Urinary **calcium excretion** is low in FHH but normal or high in PHPT [^114DBWVe]. Genetic **testing** for CaSR, GNA11, or AP2S1 should be considered if FHH is suspected [^11359pDe].

---

## Laboratory monitoring during treatment

### Surgical management (parathyroidectomy)

During parathyroidectomy, **intraoperative PTH monitoring** uses a rapid PTH assay to confirm adequate gland removal. Postoperative **calcium and PTH** should be monitored for hypocalcemia and recurrence.

---

### Medical management

During medical management, **serum calcium and PTH** should be monitored regularly to assess control and detect progression. Renal **function and urinary calcium** should be assessed periodically to monitor complications.

---

## Laboratory monitoring during follow-up

- **Serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Annually [^1145Xcuv].
- **PTH levels**: As clinically indicated [^1145Xcuv].
- **Renal function (CrCl)**: Annually [^1145Xcuv].
- **24-hour urine calcium**: If clinically indicated [^1145Xcuv].

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^1145Xcuv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

The PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines provide recommendations regarding follow-up and surveillance for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly for patients who do not undergo parathyroidectomy.

- **Blood tests**: Obtain serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D annually. Consider measuring PTH levels as clinically indicated.

- **Skeletal**: Conduct DEXA at three sites every 1 or 2 years unless bone mineral density is normal. Perform vertebral X-ray, vertebral fracture assessment, or trabecular bone score if clinically indicated.

- **Renal**: Check CrCl annually, as it is preferred over eGFR. Conduct abdominal imaging, such as X-ray, CT, or ultrasound if clinically indicated. Perform a 24-hour urine test for calcium if clinically indicated.

To discuss the rare association between primary hyperparathyroidism and chronic urticaria, a detailed case report with clinical and laboratory details is presented, along with a review of pertinent literature. A 29-year-old patient with chronic urticaria for more than two years, which was partially responsive to medical treatment, was diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism. Following a parathyroidectomy, the urticaria resolved and had not recurred during a one-year follow-up period. This suggests that primary hyperparathyroidism can be a rare cause of chronic urticaria.

Biochemistry:

All Danish citizens are assigned a Civil Personal Registration (CPR) number, which allows linkage between different registers. Using the CPR number, we requested results of measurements of plasma PTH, calcium, and creatinine levels from major Danish medical biochemistry laboratories.

We considered a diagnosis of pHPT as confirmed if blood tests on two separate occasions showed an average PTH level in the upper third, or above the upper limit of the reference interval, with concomitant hypercalcemia (hyperparathyroid hypercalcemia). Since calcium levels were measured as a mixture of both ionizing and total levels at different laboratories, we accepted a diagnosis of hypercalcemia under the following conditions:

- **Mean measurement criteria**: A mean of two measurements of ionized or total calcium levels were above the upper limit of the reference interval.
- **Single measurement criteria**: Both ionized and total calcium levels were above the upper limit of the reference interval, if only one measurement of ionized or total calcium levels was available.
- **Normalization post-PTX**: Hypercalcemia and a high PTH level, which were normalized following PTX, if only one measurement of plasma calcium was available.

We used reference ranges from the local laboratories performing the analyses.

### Subclinical and asymptomatic parathyroid disease: Implications of emerging data [^1167SxAw]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by hypercalcemia due to the autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone, is common, particularly in postmenopausal women. Although parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic patients, most individuals with the disorder are asymptomatic and lack classic complications, such as renal stones and osteoporosis, at diagnosis.

Consensus guidelines suggest which individuals might be suitable for medical follow-up instead of parathyroidectomy. However, there are no long-term randomized controlled trials to confirm the safety of medical surveillance, and some patients experience progression over time. Data from observational studies suggest that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and might be predicted by parathyroid hormone concentrations, even in individuals with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism.

Whether parathyroidectomy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism remains unproven, but data indicate that surgery reduces fracture risk and might improve neuropsychological symptoms. Studies also show that patients with normocalcemic (subclinical) hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism have a low risk of progression to overt disease, though their long-term risks are not defined.

In this review, we explore the increasing range of asymptomatic parathyroid disorders, focusing on evidence about their natural history and potential complications, with a particular emphasis on primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Advanced 3d-dxa insights into bone density changes in hyperparathyroidism [^111GYWTr]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

A common endocrine condition called primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), which affects calcium metabolism, causes mild or asymptomatic hypercalcemia and high or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH) levels. However, normocalcemic individuals also exhibit PHPT. Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) is a form of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) where the patient has normal levels of calcium in the blood but elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This condition can be challenging to diagnose because it lacks the classic symptom of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) typically associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Normal serum calcium levels and ionized calcium levels, as well as the absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterize normocalcemic nPHPT.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where increased PTH secretion is a compensatory response to other physiological conditions. To accurately diagnose nPHPT, secondary causes must be ruled out. The most common causes include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, malabsorption syndromes, and other metabolic disorders. Diagnosing normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism requires careful exclusion of all potential secondary causes of elevated PTH. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation that includes tests for vitamin D levels, renal function, phosphate levels, and other relevant metabolic parameters is essential.

PHPT results from inappropriate PTH secretion from one or more of the four parathyroid glands. The majority of PHPT patients (80%) have a single adenoma.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and PTH. Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation; thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. The Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. It is almost always due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue, either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Typically, primary hyperparathyroidism is discovered when asymptomatic, but the disease has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate.

Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described, in which the serum calcium concentration is within the normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands; however, identifying patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism, cognition, and health-related quality of life [^112Ncn5d]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

To provide a rigorous and critical review of studies in which formal neuropsychological (NP) testing and measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQL) were conducted pre- and post-parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), these data contribute to the discussion on the utility of surgical intervention for nonclassic PHPT.

PHPT is a complex endocrinopathy involving calcium metabolism and a potent hormone made by the parathyroid glands. Approximately 1.5% of Americans age 65 years and older, representing more than 3.9 million people, have PHPT, and the prevalence in postmenopausal women is estimated at 3.4%. National Institutes of Health guidelines for curative surgical intervention of PHPT exclude 80% of patients with hyperparathyroid disease who have subjective neurobehavioral and physical symptoms that affect the quality of their lives.

An electronic search was conducted of prospective studies in which cognitive functioning was measured with formal NP tests and HRQL was measured with valid and reliable instruments before and following parathyroidectomy for PHPT.

- **Results**: In studies conducted pre- and post-parathyroidectomy for PHPT, six small studies of cognitive functioning report inconsistent findings; however, seven well-designed studies of HRQL report improvement across multiple domains following surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Surgical treatment of PHPT is a viable option for patients with laboratory-diagnosed "nonclassic" PHPT. Formal NP testing and evaluation of HRQL are useful tools that may assist…

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117Uskx7]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with biochemically determined, mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are not investigated or followed up properly. The high proportion of patients presenting with biochemically determined, mild pHPT underlines the importance of providing local instructions to ensure that patients are investigated and followed up according to the most recent international guidelines.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: What is the role of parathyroid surgery [^114L9MaD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is an endocrine condition resulting from inappropriate parathyroid hormone (PTH) hypersecretion. Traditionally, the biochemical profile of PHPT is characterized by elevated serum calcium levels (> 2.6 mmol/l) with elevated or 'inappropriately normal' PTH levels, which may result in multi-system complications, including fractures and nephrolithiasis.

However, an increasingly common biochemical profile involves raised PTH levels in the context of normal serum calcium (total and ionized), vitamin D, and renal function, recognized as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). This biochemical picture is largely being discovered in patients through osteoporosis screening. Although the reported prevalence of nPHPT varies significantly within the literature (0.1–8.9%), a recent retrospective study of 6,280 patients by Schini et al. reported a prevalence of 0.18%.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^1125F8xM]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A cohort of 82 patients was identified, all with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) according to preset criteria, and with no other explanation for the disturbed calcium homeostasis. Of these 82 patients, 9 had been diagnosed with pHPT and/or had monitoring planned in a primary care center.

Five patients had both serum PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference intervals. Conversely, a total of 27 patients had both PTH and albumin-corrected serum calcium within the reference ranges. Eight cases were normocalcemic with high serum PTH, while 42 individuals were hypercalcemic with PTH within the reference interval.

- **Data collection**: Data were collected during 2014, and none of the patients had been assessed by a specialist. Patients who were referred to or primarily managed by a specialist were excluded from the cohort.

- **Figure description**: Figure 2 plots the distribution of albumin-corrected serum calcium and serum PTH in the 82-patient cohort. The black dotted lines represent the upper limits of the normal range of albumin-corrected serum calcium (= 2.50 mmol/L) and serum PTH (= 6.9 pmol/L). The cases are sorted by age.

This study highlights that pHPT is often underdiagnosed and inadequately managed in clinical settings, indicating a need for improved diagnostic and treatment strategies in primary care environments.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^112Yiz5z]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

The methods involved searching the laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. In 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, conducting new blood tests, and performing clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

The results showed that altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists, while 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

The conclusion highlights that primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It emphasizes the importance of providing local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up.

### A patient with persistent primary hyperparathyroidism due to a second ectopic adenoma [^115tqeZy]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old woman presented with renal stones and malaise to her primary-care physician. Laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentration. A diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was established, and the patient was referred for parathyroidectomy. During neck exploration, three parathyroid glands were visualized, one of which was enlarged and subsequently removed. Postoperatively, serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels decreased but did not normalize, and her symptoms persisted. Planar (99m)Tc-sestamibi and ultrasound scans failed to conclusively localize another enlarged parathyroid gland. The patient was referred to our Endocrinology Unit for further investigations and management.

- **Investigations**: Laboratory investigations, ultrasound of the kidneys, BMD measurements, selective venous sampling for parathyroid hormone, and (99m)Tc-sestamibi single photon emission CT imaging.

- **Diagnosis**: Persistent hyperparathyroidism due to an ectopically located parathyroid adenoma.

- **Management**: During further neck exploration, a 1.5 cm by 0.7 cm by 0.5 cm ectopic parathyroid adenoma was excised from the site indicated by localization studies. No further exploration was attempted after intraoperative parathyroid hormone levels fell by 70%. Serum calcium levels and 24-hour urine excretion of calcium rapidly normalized, and all of the patient's symptoms completely disappeared within a few weeks of surgery.

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^112Euznm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any signs and symptoms of high or low blood calcium levels.

What is Natpara? Natpara is a prescription parathyroid hormone (PTH) used with calcium and vitamin D to control low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) in people with low PTH blood levels (hypoparathyroidism). Natpara is only for people who do not respond well to treatment with calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone, because it may increase the possible risk of bone cancer (osteosarcoma). It has not been studied in people with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations, nor in people who acquire sudden hypoparathyroidism after surgery.

It is not known if Natpara is safe and effective for children 18 years of age and younger. Natpara should not be used in children and young adults whose bones are still growing.

Do not use Natpara if you are allergic to parathyroid hormone or any of the ingredients in Natpara. See the end of the Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in Natpara.

Before you start using Natpara, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you have any issues related to your health that may affect the use of this medication.

### The utility of the Cl:PO4 ratio in patients with variant versions of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115jSq6v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

To determine the significance and impact of additional chloride testing as part of a diagnostic laboratory test battery for borderline primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), a retrospective database review was conducted on parathyroidectomy patients. The study was set in a tertiary care, academic health sciences center and focused on patients referred to a head and neck endocrine clinic for evaluation and treatment for pHPT.

After exclusions, a total of 226 patients underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism with the requisite preoperative and postoperative labs. Seventy-seven additional patients who had a thyroid operation for a nonmalignant cause were included as controls. Of the 303 total patients, 166 had normal calcium levels (106 mmol/L). Among the 47 patients with normal calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (< 88 pg/mL), 6 (12.8%) had hyperchloremia, and of the 118 patients with normocalcemic pHPT, 48 (40.7%) were hyperchloremic. The area under the curve for the Cl:PO4 was 0.712. When using a cutoff of 33, the reported sensitivity and specificity of the curve were 58.4% and 28.6%, respectively.

The Cl:PO4 ratio was found to be a moderately sensitive test for diagnosing the borderline variants of primary hyperparathyroidism. The Ca:PO4 ratio proved to be superior to the Cl:PO4 ratio. Additionally, the data demonstrated the superiority of preoperative calcium and ionized calcium over PTH when predicting the presence of pHPT.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^116SAsJ3]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical consequences of dysregulated parathyroid function are significant in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The cardinal biochemical finding in PHPT is hypercalcemia. Clonally dysregulated overgrowth of one or more parathyroid glands, accompanied by a reduced expression of the CaSR in that tissue, is the most common pathophysiologic basis for this finding. Therefore, there is both a mass effect, with a net increase in the amount of PTH being secreted, as well as an altered set-point for calcium-mediated suppression of PTH secretion. Due to these dual pathophysiologic mechanisms, serum levels of PTH do not correlate particularly well with the size of the adenoma in typical cases of PHPT. Even when such a correlation has been reported, gland size has been found to vary widely with a given level of circulating PTH, especially when the PTH value is mildly to moderately elevated. Extreme elevations in PTH, however, raise the specter of parathyroid carcinoma.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. More patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, identifying a subset of individuals with a biochemically mild form of pHPT. This condition expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not meet the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, presenting a challenge in diagnosis and management.

The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT to better characterize this patient population and determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that some patients with mild pHPT exhibit overt symptoms that improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who progress to classic pHPT over time; however, predicting which patients will transition is not possible. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent the progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications. Parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high-volume centers.

### Sensipar [^111WuHcb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients with hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism participated in a study. Seventeen patients with severe hypercalcemia caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), who had either failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy, were included in an open-label, single-arm study. The study consisted of two phases: a dose-titration phase and a maintenance phase. In this trial, severe hypercalcemia was defined as a screening serum calcium level of greater than 12.5 mg/dL. Patients initially received 30 mg of cinacalcet twice daily, and dosages were titrated every 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily. Dosage escalation during the variable-length (2 to 16 weeks) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L), the highest possible dosage was reached, or adverse events prevented further dosage increases.

The median exposure to cinacalcet was 270 days, with a range of 32 to 1,105 days. At baseline, the mean (SE) serum calcium level was 12.7 (0.2) mg/dL. By the end of the titration phase, the mean (SE) serum calcium had decreased to 10.4 (0.3) mg/dL, representing a mean reduction of 2.3 (0.3) mg/dL from baseline. Figure 4 illustrates the mean serum calcium levels (mg/dL) over time for all patients still in the study at each time point, from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80. During the study, the daily dose ranged from 30 mg twice a day to 90 mg four times a day.

### Analysis of primary hyperparathyroidism screening among US veterans with kidney stones [^1113BYYS]. JAMA Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Approximately 3% to 5% of patients with kidney stones have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a treatable cause of recurrent stones. However, the rate of screening for PHPT in patients with kidney stones remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the prevalence of parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing in veterans with kidney stones and hypercalcemia, and to identify the demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics of veterans who were more or less likely to receive PTH testing.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study obtained Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health records from the Corporate Data Warehouse for veterans who received care in one of the 130 VHA facilities across the United States from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2013. Historical encounters, medical codes, and laboratory data were assessed. Included patients had diagnostic or procedural codes for kidney or ureteral stones. Patients with a previous serum PTH level measurement were excluded. Data were collected from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2014, with data analysis conducted from June 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020.

- **Exposures**: Elevated serum calcium concentration measurement between 6 months before and 6 months after kidney stone diagnosis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Proportion of patients with a serum PTH level measurement and proportion of patients with biochemical evidence of PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy.

- **Results**: The final cohort comprised 7,561 patients with kidney stones and hypercalcemia, with a mean (SD) age of 64.3 (12.3) years.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

- **Methods**: In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

- **Results**: PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

- **Conclusions**: Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112YG5xb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Recent advances described in this report have clarified certain aspects of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). However, there remain many unanswered questions that are recommended for future research, as detailed below.

- **Epidemiology of PHPT**: The diagnosis of asymptomatic PHPT is largely determined by the measurement of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with large variations between regions and healthcare systems. The incidence of PHPT is threefold to fivefold higher in postmenopausal women for unclear reasons, but identification of such factors may provide insight into its etiology. The consequences of mild PHPT are still unclear due to disparate population‐based clinical findings, including uncertainty regarding long‐term consequences of untreated disease on morbidity and mortality, which merits further investigation. This will especially be important given the increasing recognition of mild forms of PHPT in countries outside of North America and Europe. There is a need for a prospective study concomitantly carried out in different parts of the world to better define the prevalence and incidence of the hypercalcemic and normocalcemic forms of PHPT.

- **Pathophysiological and clinical aspects of PHPT**: The pathophysiologic basis for normocalcemic and hypercalcemic forms of PHPT requires further investigations to identify whether they are different points on a continuum of disease and/or different stages of disease evolution. The breadth of pathophysiological alterations resulting in PHPT is not fully defined.

### Sensipar [^117254cz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sixty-seven patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) who met criteria for parathyroidectomy based on corrected total serum calcium (> 11.3 mg/dL [2.82 mmol/L] and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL [3.12 mmol/L]), but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 33 patients were randomized to Sensipar and 34 patients were randomized to placebo. The mean age of the patients was 72 years; 52% were female, 61% were Caucasian, and 5% were Black. The study began with a 12-week titration phase, followed by a 16-week efficacy-assessment phase. Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range. During the efficacy period, a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet-treated patients, compared with the placebo-treated patients, achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (≤ 10.3 mg/dL [2.57 mmol/L], 75.8% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) and a ≥ 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration (84.8% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the study was 60 mg/day.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, contributing to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcemia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is the surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid, and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, medications, and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT.

### Elevated PTH with normal serum calcium level: A structured approach [^111PJEAj]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculating adjusted calcium, and a careful history should be taken to assess dietary calcium intake and the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review, we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid disorders [^111ct6Gh]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Disorders of the parathyroid glands most commonly present with abnormalities of serum calcium. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients, are often asymptomatic or may have bone disease, nephrolithiasis, or neuromuscular symptoms. Patients with chronic kidney disease may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with resultant chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. Hypoparathyroidism most often occurs after neck surgery; it can also be caused by autoimmune destruction of the glands and other less common problems.

Evaluation of patients with abnormal serum calcium levels includes a history and physical examination; repeat measurement of serum calcium level; and measurement of creatinine, magnesium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone levels. The treatment for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy. Management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism includes monitoring symptoms; serum calcium and creatinine levels; and bone mineral density. Patients with hypoparathyroidism require close monitoring and vitamin D (e.g. calcitriol) replacement.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically with respect to laboratory tests, the AAES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests in patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism:

- **Serum total calcium**: Measure to assess calcium levels in the blood.
- **PTH (parathyroid hormone)**: Determine to evaluate parathyroid function.
- **Creatinine**: Check renal function as it can be affected by parathyroid conditions.
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Assess vitamin D status, which can influence calcium metabolism.

### The diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^112J6QyU]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Classical primary hyperparathyroidism, a disease often referred to as affecting 'bones, stones, and psychic groans', is now considered a rarity in the US, though it is still seen in some parts of the world. Presently, most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. This shift in clinical profile is not solely attributed to improved detection techniques. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who lack symptoms, if untreated, rarely develop the 'classical' features that were previously common. Current data suggest a disorder with different, yet characteristic, effects on the end-organs involved in the hyperparathyroid process.

This review discusses the features of skeletal, renal, neuropsychologic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations of 'asymptomatic' primary hyperparathyroidism. A considerable body of data has emerged since recognizing the new clinical profile of this condition, prompting a reevaluation of care standards. These data were incorporated into new clinical guidelines during the 2002 NIH workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. The recommendations emphasize both the known aspects of the disease and the crucial areas requiring further investigation.

Continued interest in the skeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of the disease, as well as therapeutic trials of medical approaches for its management, will further refine our understanding. This could lead to additional modifications in the approach to patients with this common endocrine disorder.

### Can hyperparathyroid bone disease be arrested or reversed [^116H5WrJ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hyperplasia, oversecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and hyperparathyroid bone disease are characteristic features of chronic uremia; they develop early in the course of uremia and often progress over time. This review focuses on the potential for arresting or regressing hyperparathyroid-induced bone disease. It specifically addresses investigations that have used bone histology, rather than studies that indirectly demonstrated changes in the skeleton through measurements of bone mineral density or laboratory indices of bone turnover, other than PTH.

A prerequisite for inducing regression of hyperparathyroid bone disease is the significant suppression of PTH secretion or the reversal of hyperparathyroidism and uremia. Based on paired bone biopsy studies in patients with established hyperparathyroid bone disease, it is concluded that bone histology can be improved or normalized following treatments that diminish PTH levels. However, oversuppression of PTH levels might result in adynamic bone disease.

### Secondary osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease in patients 50 years and older with osteoporosis or with a recent clinical fracture: A clinical perspective [^116o9kGw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to clinicians about which laboratory tests should be performed in patients with osteoporosis or with a recent fracture.

Newly diagnosed secondary osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases (SECOB) have been found in 5–48% of patients with osteoporosis. In patients with a recent fracture, new SECOB is found in 10–47% of patients with osteoporosis, and in 26–51% if all patients with a fracture, regardless of bone mineral density (BMD), are screened. More than one SECOB can be found in the same patient, even when they have already known SECOB. In primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, and multiple myeloma, both SECOB and its treatment have an impact on BMD and fractures. For other SECOBs, no treatment is available, or there are no data about the effect of treatment of the SECOB on BMD and fractures.

We recommend performing the following tests in all patients with osteoporosis or a recent clinical fracture: calcium, phosphate, creatinine, albumin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in all patients; 24-hour urine calcium in men; and serum testosterone in men less than 70 years. Additional tests can be performed on indication.

- **Adverse reactions in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study**: In 26-week studies of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, 66% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 25% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Furthermore, 29% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 11% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Less than 1% of patients in each group permanently discontinued the study drug due to hypocalcemia.

- **Extended duration study**: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting up to 64 months, with an average treatment duration of 21 months in the cinacalcet group, 75% of patients receiving Sensipar, compared with 29% of patients receiving placebo, developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8.4 mg/dL. Additionally, 33% of cinacalcet patients, compared with 12% of patients receiving placebo, had at least one serum calcium value less than 7.5 mg/dL. Most cases of severe hypocalcemia, less than 7.5 mg/dL (64% of cases), occurred during the first 6 months. In this trial, 1.1% of patients receiving Sensipar and 0.1% of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued the study drug due to hypocalcemia.

- **Study in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT)**: During a placebo-controlled part of a 52-week study in patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy based on corrected total serum calcium levels (> 11.3 mg/dL), the study results provide further insight (text appears truncated).

### New parathyroid function index for the differentiation of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism: A case-control study [^116X15nY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is one of the most important hormones required for the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. This hormone induces the 1α-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)₂D, which promotes intestinal absorption and the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, while regulating mineral reabsorption in the renal tubules. The intrinsic abnormal excretion or extrinsic abnormal stimulation of PTH production leads to primary, secondary, or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

A diagnosis of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) can be made easily according to its biochemical, skeletal, and renal manifestations. However, increases in routine serum calcium testing, as well as the incidental discovery of parathyroid nodules on thyroid ultrasonography, have led to an increase in the detection frequency of asymptomatic PHPT (including normocalcemic PHPT, NPHPT) in recent decades. Thus, a correct clinical diagnosis of this disease is important.

Chronic renal insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency are the most common causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The former can be easily distinguished from the medical history and laboratory tests. However, it is difficult to distinguish vitamin D deficiency-induced SHPT (VD-SHPT) from PHPT. Patients diagnosed with either VD-SHPT or PHPT would have an elevated PTH concentration, and many present with vitamin D deficiency, as well as a normal serum calcium concentration. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between these diseases based on laboratory results.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available regarding evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. An international group of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT was convened to summarize these developments. This paper provides the results of the task force assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT.

For this task force, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology.

Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, provide the most complete information available at the time of writing. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. Evidence from all task forces is synthesized into the guidelines findings.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: Differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in a patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone.

The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

### Parathyroid disease diagnosis: A look at scintigraphy, ultrasound, and lab tests [^114Y8NhP]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The primary aim of this study is to assess how well ultrasonography and 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy perform as diagnostic tools for hyperparathyroidism (HPT) when compared to the clinical measurements of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This evaluation is intended to help formulate the most effective preoperative plan and guide clinical decision-making. A retrospective study of 350 HPT cases in King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital over a period spanning 2012 to 2023 was carried out. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operator characteristic curve AUC were used to determine the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography, 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy, and combined imaging in relation to the standard of biochemical PTH levels.

The statistical tests involved the McNemar test and logistic regression to evaluate the predictors such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). The combined imaging demonstrated diagnostic accuracy of 0.69 compared to 0.74 and 0.64 for scintigraphy and ultrasonography respectively. Scintigraphy had a total of 161 true positives and 73 false negative results, whereas ultrasonography had a total of 139 true positives and 95 false negative results. CKD was also a good determinant in HPT (odds ratio = 1.988, p = 0.026). According to the McNemar test, there was no significant difference between ultrasonography and scintigraphy (p = 0.494). The diagnostic inaccuracy of ultrasonography is lower in diagnosing HPT as compared to scintigraphy; however, using combined imaging may provide more reliability in diagnosis. Hence, it can be used in preoperative planning, especially in cases with concurrent conditions such as CKD.

The ratio of men to women in the primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) group before surgery was 1:4, with a median age of 37 years (interquartile range: 33 to 41 years) and a median illness duration of 3 years (interquartile range: 1.5 to 7 years) since the first symptoms or laboratory test abnormalities.

- **Baseline laboratory parameters**: The baseline laboratory parameters of mineral metabolism for both groups are presented in Table 1. Data are presented by medians and interquartile ranges (Median, IQR [25;75]%). The Mann–Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis. Notably, individuals in the PHPT group exhibited notable variations in parameters such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin-adjusted calcium (Ca adj), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and 25 Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D].

Insulin resistance (IR) was present in 54.2% of PHPT patients (n = 13), with four showing moderate IR, and none displaying severe IR.

- **Baseline metabolic parameters**: The baseline metabolic parameters of both groups are presented in Table 2. Data are presented by medians and interquartile ranges (Median, IQR [25;75]%). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney U-test.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically with respect to genetic testing, the CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend considering DNA analysis of MEN1, HRPT2 genes, and the RET oncogene for familial primary hyperparathyroidism in pediatric and adults under 35 years old with any of the following criteria:

- **Family history of hypercalcemia**: Consider testing if there is a known family history.
- **Prior unsuccessful parathyroid surgery**: Applicable if either the patient or a relative had unsuccessful surgery.
- **Hypercalcemia identified at a young age**: Testing is recommended if hypercalcemia is identified in a patient or relative under 25 years old.
- **Absence of symptoms of hypercalcemia**: Consider testing even if the patient presents without symptoms.
- **Urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.02**: Suggest testing if this specific urinary clearance ratio is observed.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is often asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage that progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcemia or organ damage, but there is no current method to predict which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, evaluating every indication for treatment is important, even in patients with mild pHPT.

A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcemic patients as in those with hypercalcemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcemic patients. In a group of 52 patients with pHPT, who did not meet any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery was shown to normalize serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, as well as improve self-reported symptoms, irrespective of whether patients were normocalcemic or hypercalcemic before surgery.

One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on the quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcemic patients. Based on these findings, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms, after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and for those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium levels and monitoring for the development of organ damage should be conducted.

### When diagnostic testing leads to harm: a new outcomes-based approach for laboratory medicine [^111x3Ww5]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

The role of laboratory testing in establishing diagnoses typically results from the patient history and physical examination. However, diagnostic testing is often used to confirm initial impressions or rule out alternatives, and at least 10% of all diagnoses are not considered final until clinical laboratory testing is complete. This number most likely underestimates the actual impact of testing on diagnosis.

In the emergency room, clinical laboratory testing is ordered in more than 41% of all visits. Family physicians order tests in 29% of all patient visits, and general internists in 38% of visits. These percentages would be even higher if the calculations were based only on the 33.9% of primary care visits that involve a new complaint.

Advances in technology have also contributed to the increased importance of laboratory tests. In the past, laboratory tests were used to identify organ and system dysfunctions or diseases. While this is still true, testing nowadays is used to diagnose disease subtypes, as occurs when pathology reports of cancer are accompanied by tumor-specific and patient-specific molecular analyses. These data help physicians determine optimum therapies and a patient's likely response to treatment. Laboratory testing is also increasingly being used to diagnose treatment failures associated with newer measures of effective care, such as reduced hospital readmissions. The clinical laboratory's growing significance may also reflect physicians' increasing reliance on objective data from diagnostic testing to partially compensate for reduced history and physical examination.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: Summary statement and guidelines from the Fifth International Workshop [^114QRTai]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly concerning preoperative thyroid evaluation, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining high-resolution neck ultrasound, technetium-99m-sestamibi subtraction scintigraphy, or contrast-enhanced four-dimensional CT for preoperative imaging.

### Sensipar [^111KFxga]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Monitoring for hypocalcemia**: Once the maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis, and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

	- For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis, if serum calcium falls below 8.4 mg/dL but remains above 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium levels. If serum calcium falls below 7.5 mg/dL, or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased, withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8.0 mg/dL and/or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved. Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### The effect of parathyroidectomy compared to non-surgical surveillance on kidney function in primary hyperparathyroidism: A nationwide historic cohort study [^116n6cVt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Biochemistry was performed by various laboratories, and we have no information on the exact measurement methods. We tried to compensate for this by using local reference ranges from the specific laboratories during the relevant periods. To minimize differences caused by the different measurement methods, we calculated a percentage difference between baseline and follow-up levels of creatinine and eGFR, as most patients had these measurements performed in the same laboratory.

Comparing our study with similar studies, other studies used additional exclusion criteria for the study population. For example, in the study from Tassone et al, patients with thyroid and liver disease were excluded. We did not include information on comorbidities, although this could have added information on the studied patients.

Furthermore, it would have been advantageous if aldosterone levels had been included to test the hypothesis of an effect on eGFR by lowering aldosterone levels in response to PTX. However, aldosterone levels are not measured regularly in patients with PHPT and therefore are not captured in our database. Nevertheless, we excluded patients with known kidney impairment more than one year before the time of diagnosis to eliminate other reasons for kidney impairment, as well as tertiary hyperparathyroidism as a reason for the hyperparathyroid hypercalcemia.

We cannot exclude that the observed effect on kidney function may be due to regression towards the mean. Prospective studies are needed to gain a more profound understanding of this. Lastly, as pHPT is considered an incompleted statement, prospective studies have not been fully explored.

### 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy reveals parathyroid adenoma masquerading as esophageal diverticulum [^113XYcy4]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old woman with primary hyperparathyroidism, diagnosed from routine laboratory tests, described symptoms of fatigue and difficulty with concentration. During surgical consultation, MRI scans of the cervical and thoracic spine from the preceding 10-year period, performed for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, were reviewed. In this clinical context, the slowly enlarging left upper paraesophageal lesion, initially reported as a lateral proximal esophageal (Killian-Jamieson) diverticulum, was reevaluated for a potential parathyroid adenoma. 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT demonstrated focal uptake in the paraesophageal lesion, and surgical resection confirmed it to be a large parathyroid adenoma.

### Investigating the effectiveness of intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assay in parathyroidectomy surgery in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [^114nyJWS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

After obtaining written consent from the patients, they were enrolled in the study. Five blood samples were collected from each patient. The first sample was drawn following anesthesia induction but prior to the initial incision. The second sample was taken following a comprehensive exploration of the parathyroid glands and before any parathyroid resection. These two samples were used for pre-excision parathyroid hormone (PTH) assessment.

For those undergoing subtotal parathyroidectomy, approximately 50 mg of the most normal parathyroid gland was preserved, with the remainder excised. The surgery was then completed with an upper thymectomy. Intraoperative neural monitoring was conducted to prevent nerve damage. Subsequently, blood samples were taken 10 and 20 minutes after excising the parathyroid glands.

- **Total parathyroidectomy and upper thymectomy**: All parathyroid glands, along with the upper part of the thymus, were completely excised. Blood samples were likewise obtained 10 and 20 minutes post-excision. During the 10 to 20 minute wait, no tissue manipulation occurred as we awaited frozen section and lab results.

When results confirmed the successful excision of parathyroid glands, 50–80 mg of seemingly normal parathyroid tissue were auto-transplanted into the subcutaneous pocket in the infra-clavicular area. If laboratory findings showed a more than 50% decrease in serum PTH in the post-excision samples compared to the pre-excision ones, the intervention was considered successful.

### Unknown and already known thyroid abnormalities in primary hyperparathyroidism [^1161myN4]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and thyroid diseases are highly prevalent in the general population, but the putative link between the two conditions remains unclear.

- **Methods**: A monocentric consecutive series of 434 patients with PHPT was retrospectively evaluated by lab and ultrasonography to look for thyroid abnormalities. Patients were classified into three groups: without thyroid abnormalities (group 1, n = 171); with thyroid diseases not previously known (group 2a, n = 69); and thyroid diseases previously known (group 2b, n = 194).

- **Results**: In terms of thyroid disease, no significant difference was found between groups 2a and 2b, except for the significantly larger number of patients with toxic nodular goiter in group 2b. PHPT was more frequently symptomatic in group 2a than in group 2b, despite no differences in serum calcium, creatinine, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels.

- **Conclusion**: A total of 60% of PHPT patients had a thyroid disease that was unknown prior to PHPT diagnosis in almost one-third of cases. The newly diagnosed and previously known thyroid diseases were similar, both mostly affecting postmenopausal females.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2018). High credibility.

In this review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), focusing on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions where serum calcium levels are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria, as well as vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcemic PHPT, are less common.

Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended for patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum calcium levels, but no single drug can achieve both. More data are needed on the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT, the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, and the risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work advancing our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

- **Participants**: This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

- **Evidence**: Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and genetics of primary hyperparathyroidism [^111wk6QT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Once considered rare, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is now a common disease of mineral metabolism. The most recent increase in its incidence has been driven mainly by routine serum calcium determination or by calcium and parathyroid hormone measurements during investigations for osteoporosis. The Fourth International Workshop on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism did not specifically focus on the global epidemiology of PHPT. Therefore, this narrative review fills this knowledge gap in the context of hypercalcemic PHPT. It is based on a literature review covering the period between 1980 and 2020, utilizing available databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. This section also highlights recent advances in the pathophysiological aspects and genetics of PHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^113gWFLf]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data from 92 patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism were identified through a search of the laboratory results database at Östersund Hospital. The data were collected in 2014, and all patients had been referred to or primarily managed by a specialist.

- **Median laboratory values**: Two groups of patients with biochemically determined primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) were identified and compared based on whether they had been assessed by a specialist. A Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine the significance of differences.

The 82 patients not assessed by a specialist were invited to complete a survey investigating previous medication, comorbidity, and body mass index (BMI). From this survey, 12 patients taking medications such as thiazides, calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates, which could potentially influence serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, were identified and excluded. Additionally, seven patients with a BMI ≥ 30, two who had died, and four cases deemed too severely ill with multiple diseases to undergo treatment or further investigation of their hyperparathyroidism were excluded. Three patients declined further participation, four did not reply to the invitation, and three had moved to other parts of the country and were lost to follow-up. Another two patients had been diagnosed with pHPT and were consequently cared for. All these cases were excluded from the study cohort.

### Clinical guidelines and PTH measurement: Does assay generation matter [^111g74q9]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and bone remodeling. It is metabolized into PTH fragments, which are measured to varying extents by PTH assays of different generations due to differences in fragment recognition and lack of assay standardization. PTH measurement is crucial in the workup of several conditions, and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements.

This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays when applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines address PTH measurement in various ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold increase above the upper reference limit, or an absolute PTH cutoff value.

For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the type of PTH assay used will not affect diagnosis or management since the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease, guidelines recommend treating secondary hyperparathyroidism for a PTH increase between twofold to ninefold, which will result in different clinical decisions depending on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery, guidelines state absolute cutoff values for PTH; however, the impact of different generation assays is unknown, as direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed. During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third-generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly than second-generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding these variations is essential.

### Testing for primary hyperparathyroidism in 17,491 patients with hypercalcemia [^112jCwYy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is underdiagnosed and associated with many adverse health effects. Historically, many hypercalcemic patients have not received parathyroid hormone (PTH) testing; however, underlying reasons are uncertain. Our goals are to determine the PTH testing rate among hypercalcemic individuals at a large academic health system and to assess characteristics associated with testing versus not testing for PHPT to inform future strategies for closing testing gaps.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included adult patients with ≥ 1 elevated serum calcium result between 2018 and 2022. Based on the presence or absence of a serum PTH result, individuals were classified as "screened" versus "unscreened" for PHPT. Demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups were compared.

- **Results**: The sample comprised 17,491 patients: 6567 male (37.5%), 10,924 female (62.5%), mean age 59 years. PTH testing was performed in 6096 (34.9%). Characteristics independently associated with the greatest odds of screening were 5+ elevated calcium results (odds ratio [OR] 5.02, P < 0.0001), calcium > 12.0 mg/dL (OR 2.48, P < 0.0001), and osteoporosis (OR 2.42, P < 0.0001). Characteristics associated with the lowest odds of screening were age < 35 years (OR 0.60, P < 0.0001), death during the study period (OR 0.68, P < 0.0001), age ≥ 85 years (OR 0.70, P = 0.0007), and depression (OR 0.84, P = 0.0081).

- **Conclusions**: Only 35% of hypercalcemic patients received PTH testing. Although the presence of PHPT-associated morbidity was recognized.

### Spontaneous resolution of hypercalcemia [^11795BSX]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently encountered endocrine disorder due to benign neoplastic lesions or gland hyperplasia. It is often discovered incidentally when routine lab work reveals hypercalcemia.

- **Methods**: This case presents a 55-year-old male with a neck mass and electrolyte irregularities consistent with PHPT. However, his laboratory values suddenly normalized prior to surgery.

- **Results**: Post-operative pathologic analysis of the specimen demonstrated massive infarction of the affected gland and explained the spontaneous resolution of the patient's electrolyte derangements.

- **Conclusions**: The objective of this case study is to demonstrate the importance of further investigation in patients with fluctuating lab values and emphasize the potential dangers of gland infarction.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

The methods involve reviewing the latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The results indicate that the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels, in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism — the skeleton and the kidneys — continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement, with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared to the lumbar spine, where bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for, or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

In conclusion, primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically concerning diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend including the following in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH:

- **Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia**: Present in younger patients with a urinary Ca/Cr clearance ratio < 0.01 and/or a family history of hypercalcemia.
- **Thiazide diuretics and lithium**: Should be considered in the assessment.
- **Ectopic secretion of PTH**: Although very rare, this should also be considered.
