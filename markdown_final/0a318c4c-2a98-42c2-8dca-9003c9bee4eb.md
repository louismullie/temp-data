## Question

E coli antibioti

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about E. coli antibiotic management across different syndromes, with a focus on explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome classification because treatment hinges on site and severity. Then, I should verify the resistance epidemiology that drives empiric choices. Next, I will examine syndrome-specific management for STEC diarrhea, uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis/cUTI, and invasive infections. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship principles. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key takeaways with supporting citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome classification, because E. coli spans intestinal and extraintestinal disease and management diverges sharply; I need to ensure I separate Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) diarrhea from urinary tract infection (uncomplicated cystitis versus pyelonephritis/complicated UTI) and from invasive bloodstream or intra-abdominal infections, as each category has distinct risks, resistance patterns, and guideline-backed therapy choices.

> Next, I should review resistance epidemiology to anchor empiric decisions; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking thresholds. For uncomplicated cystitis, first-line agents are generally avoided if local resistance exceeds about 20%, and globally, pediatric and adult data show high resistance to ampicillin, TMP-SMX, and rising resistance to fluoroquinolones, whereas nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin retain relatively low resistance, which supports their preferred status in many settings [^113UcpBW] [^117Aimg2] [^112NTTp8]. I should double-check that ESBL-producing E. coli are increasingly community-onset and that ceftriaxone non-susceptibility often proxies for ESBL, which pushes empiric choices toward agents active against ESBLs in higher-risk presentations [^114EyVD3] [^113AUQrZ].

> Now, STEC diarrhea: I need to ensure I do not conflate supportive care with antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotics can increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome, so I should avoid antibiotics in suspected or confirmed STEC, particularly when Shiga toxin 2 is possible or unknown, and focus on hydration and close monitoring instead [^116kzmXH] [^116MgTtt]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence — multiple reviews and guidelines converge on avoidance, and this is one of the clearest scenarios where no antibiotic is the correct treatment [^116AFiJx] [^111cm1bz].

> For uncomplicated cystitis, I should confirm first-line options and when to pivot. Nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX remain preferred if local resistance is acceptable, with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems as alternatives when first-line agents are inactive or contraindicated, and single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin as additional options, especially for ESBL-E when susceptible [^111DJoMB] [^115gXGo1]. Hold on, I should verify the ESBL-E specifics — guidelines suggest nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX first if active, and if those are not options, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems can be used, with single-dose aminoglycoside or fosfomycin for E. coli as alternatives; I need to ensure I note that fosfomycin activity is variable and not reliably tested for all organisms, which tempers its empiric use outside E. coli [^111DJoMB] [^115mC5vf].

> For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, I should confirm that TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone are preferred if susceptible, with carbapenems reserved when resistance or toxicity preclude those options. Critically ill patients warrant early carbapenem therapy with step-down to active oral agents once stable and susceptible, and I need to remember the nephrotoxicity trade-offs with aminoglycosides as alternatives [^114SRmeB] [^113u3k1t]. But wait, what if piperacillin-tazobactam is already started — let me reconsider; while some data suggest noninferiority in cUTI, mortality signals in ESBL bloodstream infections and IDSA caution argue against relying on piperacillin-tazobactam for serious ESBL-E infections, so I should avoid it for invasive disease and prefer carbapenems in that setting [^113u3k1t] [^112BoJV8].

> For invasive infections outside the urinary tract or E. coli bacteremia, I should confirm that carbapenems are first-line for ESBL-E, with meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin preferred in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients, and transition to active oral TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones after clinical response if susceptible. I need to ensure I do not overstate piperacillin-tazobactam here, as IDSA advises against its use for serious ESBL-E infections despite in vitro susceptibility in some cases [^115rp3Xo] [^115SPMPY]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal again — higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible bloodstream infection reinforces this stance [^112BoJV8].

> Special populations and stewardship now require attention. In pediatrics, I should double-check that high resistance to ampicillin and TMP-SMX in many regions necessitates culture-directed therapy whenever feasible, and that nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin often remain appropriate choices for cystitis. In pregnancy, I need to avoid fluoroquinolones and ensure safe agents are selected, and in older adults, I should be cautious with fluoroquinolones given adverse effects and resistance prevalence, aligning with stewardship to minimize collateral damage [^117Aimg2] [^112ZuMBn] [^111opq5j]. Let me verify the stewardship anchors — obtain cultures before antibiotics when possible, de-escalate based on susceptibilities, and avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in specific indications, as overtreatment fuels resistance without benefit [^111opq5j].

> I will now examine intra-abdominal infections briefly. For lower-risk community-acquired IAI, ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole or a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole are acceptable, but I should confirm local ESBL prevalence because high ESBL rates shift empiric choices away from fluoroquinolones or ceftriaxone toward agents like ertapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam in broader coverage scenarios, balancing spectrum with stewardship goals [^116bFM7y] [^111bbZn8] [^112nayjC]. Wait, I should verify that these are empiric recommendations and that definitive therapy should be narrowed promptly once cultures return to limit resistance selection [^112nayjC].

> Next, I should review emerging tools and diagnostics. Rapid susceptibility methods and machine learning models can personalize empiric choices and expand access to narrow-spectrum agents, and while I need to ensure I do not overpromise, these approaches show promise in aligning therapy with local resistance and patient-specific risk, potentially reducing unnecessary broad-spectrum use pending culture results [^112zxxVk] [^111sq4BN] [^116VfxPM]. Hold on, I should verify that these tools complement, not replace, clinical judgment and local antibiograms in urgent care settings [^112uPgiX].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework without oversimplifying. First, classify the syndrome and severity. Second, assess risk factors for resistance including prior antibiotics, healthcare exposure, travel, and local epidemiology. Third, select empiric therapy aligned with IDSA guidance and local resistance thresholds. Fourth, obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible. Fifth, narrow or stop therapy based on susceptibilities and clinical response. And sixth, apply stewardship principles throughout, including avoidance of antibiotics in STEC and asymptomatic bacteriuria, and preference for narrow-spectrum agents when effective [^116kzmXH] [^114SRmeB] [^111opq5j]. I should double-check that this aligns with the major guidelines referenced and that each step is supported by the cited evidence base [^116kzmXH] [^114SRmeB].

> Key takeaways I need to ensure are explicit: antibiotics are contraindicated in STEC diarrhea due to HUS risk. Nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX remain first-line for uncomplicated cystitis where resistance allows. Carbapenems are preferred for serious ESBL-E infections. Piperacillin-tazobactam should not be relied upon for invasive ESBL-E disease. Stewardship with culture-directed therapy and de-escalation mitigates resistance and improves outcomes, with rising resistance to fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX demanding vigilance and local data integration [^116kzmXH] [^114SRmeB] [^112BoJV8] [^113UcpBW]. Hold on, I should verify that these conclusions reflect the cited guidance and adjust if any point is overstated. After reviewing, they are consistent with contemporary IDSA guidance and resistance epidemiology [^114SRmeB] [^111DJoMB].

E. coli antibiotic selection depends on the **clinical syndrome** and **local resistance patterns**. For uncomplicated cystitis, **nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX** are first-line if susceptible; **fosfomycin** is an alternative. For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, **fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins** are preferred if susceptible; **carbapenems** are used for ESBL/CRE. For STEC, **avoid antibiotics** due to HUS risk. Always obtain cultures to guide therapy and apply **stewardship principles** to limit resistance [^116kzmXH] [^114SRmeB].

## Antibiotic selection by clinical syndrome

| **Clinical syndrome** | **Preferred antibiotics** | **Alternative antibiotics** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - TMP-SMX | - Fosfomycin <br/> - Fluoroquinolones (if resistance ≤ 20%) | - First-line agents if susceptible [^112NTTp8] <br/> - Avoid fluoroquinolones if resistance > 20% [^113UcpBW] |
| Complicated UTI/pyelonephritis | - Fluoroquinolones <br/> - Cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefepime) | - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) for ESBL/CRE | - Tailor to local resistance and patient factors [^116uTTsD] |
| STEC infection | - Supportive care only | - None | - Antibiotics increase HUS risk; avoid [^116kzmXH] [^116MgTtt] |

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Local resistance patterns**: Use local antibiograms to guide empiric therapy [^112uPgiX].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, pregnancy, allergies, comorbidities, and severity of illness [^116BugNg].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Use narrow-spectrum agents when possible to limit resistance [^114NaTe7].

---

## Emerging resistance patterns

- **ESBL production**: Increasing globally, limiting cephalosporin use [^114EyVD3].
- **Fluoroquinolone resistance**: Rising in many regions, necessitating caution [^1115L2w2].
- **Carbapenem resistance**: Rare but increasing, requiring novel agents [^1129xunM].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- **Inappropriate therapy**: Increases morbidity, mortality, and length of stay [^113A1zGS] [^112nayjC].
- **Resistance development**: Linked to treatment failure and higher healthcare costs [^112NTTp8] [^114nfavR].
- **Adverse effects**: Include nephrotoxicity, C. difficile infection, and allergic reactions [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

IDSA guidelines recommend **nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin** as first-line agents for uncomplicated cystitis, with fluoroquinolones reserved for resistant cases. For complicated infections, **cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones** are preferred, with carbapenems for ESBL/CRE. Antibiotics should be avoided in STEC due to HUS risk [^116kzmXH] [^116MgTtt].

---

## Future directions

- **Rapid diagnostics**: Enable timely, targeted therapy and reduce resistance [^112zxxVk].
- **New antibiotics**: Development of agents active against resistant E. coli [^114UPXv9].
- **Stewardship programs**: Essential to curb resistance and optimize outcomes [^114NaTe7].

---

Effective E. coli management requires **syndrome-specific therapy**, attention to **local resistance**, and **stewardship** to optimize outcomes and limit resistance.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, although the likelihood of susceptibility to any of these agents is low. Administer a single dose of an aminoglycoside, oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only), colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as alternative options.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114EyVD3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Aimg2]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To systematically review studies investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli in children and, when appropriate, to meta-analyse the relation between previous antibiotics prescribed in primary care and resistance.

Design and data analysis Systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled percentage prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in children in primary care, stratified by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study country. Random effects meta-analysis was used to quantify the association between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and resistance.

Data sources Observational and experimental studies identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, searched for articles published up to October 2015.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported resistance in community acquired urinary tract infection in children and young people aged 0–17. Electronic searches with MeSH terms and text words identified 3115 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results 58 observational studies investigated 77 783 E coli isolates in urine. In studies from OECD countries, the pooled prevalence of resistance was 53.4% (95% confidence interval 46.0% to 60.8%) for ampicillin, 23.6% (13.9% to 32.3%) for trimethoprim, 8.2% (7.9% to 9.6%) for co-amoxiclav, and 2.1% (0.8 to 4.4%) for ciprofloxacin; nitrofurantoin was the lowest at 1.3% (0.8% to 1.7%). Resistance in studies in countries outside the OECD was significantly higher: 79.8% (73.0% to 87.7%) for ampicillin, 60.3% (40.9% to 79.0%) for co-amoxiclav, 26.8% (11.1% to 43.0%) for ciprofloxacin, and 17.0% (9.8% to 24.2%) for nitrofurantoin. There was evidence that bacterial isolates from the urinary tract from individual children who had received previous prescriptions for antibiotics in primary care were more likely to be resistant to antibiotics, and this increased risk could persist for up to six months (odds ratio 13.23, 95% confidence interval 7.84 to 22.31).

Conclusions Prevalence of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics in primary care in children with urinary tract infections caused by E coli is high, particularly in countries outside the OECD, where one possible explanation is the availability of antibiotics over the counter. This could render some antibiotics ineffective as first line treatments for urinary tract infection. Routine use of antibiotics in primary care contributes to antimicrobial resistance in children, which can persist for up to six months after treatment.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^114KFTvZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing with clinical prediction modelling informs appropriate antibiotic use [^111sq4BN]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is a key weapon against antimicrobial resistance. Diagnostic microbiology laboratories use one-size-fits-all testing approaches that are often imprecise, inefficient, and inequitable. Here, we report a personalised approach that adapts laboratory testing for urinary tract infection to maximise the number of appropriate treatment options for each patient. We develop and assess susceptibility prediction models for 12 antibiotics on real-world healthcare data using an individual-level simulation study. When combined with decision thresholds that prioritise selection of World Health Organisation Access category antibiotics (those least likely to induce antimicrobial resistance), the personalised approach delivers more susceptible results (results that encourage prescription of that antibiotic) per specimen for Access category antibiotics than a standard testing approach, without compromising provision of susceptible results overall. Here, we show that personalised antimicrobial susceptibility testing could help tackle antimicrobial resistance by safely providing more Access category antibiotic treatment options to clinicians managing urinary tract infection.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^1129xunM]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is increasingly becoming a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. To date, the treatment for serious CRE infections remains difficult. The intelligent use of antimicrobials and effective infection control strategies is crucial to prevent further CRE spread. Early consultation with experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms is valuable in patient management. This brief review will focus on the current, yet limited, treatment options for CRE infections.

### Targeting virulence traits: potential strategies to combat extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli infections [^114mCH32]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are able to colonize, invade and induce disease in body niches outside the gastrointestinal tract. The emergence of (multi)resistant ExPEC variants calls for alternative antimicrobial strategies with a reduced pressure on selection of antibiotic resistances. We report on recent research efforts to target such virulence traits or to interfere with ExPEC colonization of extraintestinal niches in order to prevent or treat ExPEC infections and reduce the risk of further emergence of antibiotic resistances.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1132qh1Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — combination antibiotic therapy: Combination antibiotic therapy (the use of a β-lactam in combination with an aminoglycoside, fluoroquinolone, tetracycline, or polymyxin) is not suggested for CRE infections. Data do not indicate that continued combination therapy — once the β-lactam has demonstrated in vitro activity — offers improved outcomes, and clinical data indicating prevention of resistance are lacking; randomized trial data comparing novel β-lactams as monotherapy versus in combination are not available. In an observational study, 165 patients received ceftazidime-avibactam and 412 received ceftazidime-avibactam plus a second agent, with 30-day mortality essentially identical at approximately 25% in both arms; accordingly, the panel does not suggest combination therapy for CRE infections when susceptibility to a preferred β-lactam has been demonstrated.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^11515DY3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^115yiKKA]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection — ceftazidime plus metronidazole: Based on the available data, the task force suggests that ceftazidime plus metronidazole can be used for the treatment of patients with IAI and grades this as a weak recommendation because of the lack of contemporary data; this regimen should be reserved primarily for empiric treatment of higher-risk patients, should most likely be avoided in regions where there is a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and in general the task force prefers use of cefepime rather than ceftazidime when an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin is believed warranted; in vitro susceptibilities of E. coli to ceftazidime remain greater than 90% in North America and Europe but are appreciably lower in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America where ESBL strains are prevalent.

### High prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant UTI among US emergency department patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, 2018–2020 [^112nMC2Q]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

FQ‐resistant E. coli is widely prevalent and ESBL‐mediated resistance appears to be increasing across US sites highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and, at some locations, modification of empirical treatments.

### Urinary tract infection in women over the age of 65: is age alone a marker of complication? [^112bWJbi]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We were interested to know if our older female patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) might have differing pathogens or rates of Escherichia coli antibiotic sensitivity and if our physicians managed them in a manner similar or dissimilar to the care provided to younger patients with no complications.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis from patients excluded from a previous retrospective study regarding uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

Twenty-six percent of total patients with UTIs were older than 65 and otherwise medically uncomplicated whereas 21% were older patients who did have complicating factors. E. coli was a pathogen in 81% of uncomplicated elders' and 54% of complicated elders' cultures. E. coli sensitivity rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) in both groups was 86%. Physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP for complicated older patients with complications than for young patients with an uncomplicated UTI (P = 0.017); there was a significant trend of physicians to be less likely to prescribe SMX/TMP with advancing age in a patient and complications across all 3 groups (P = 0.011). Antibiotics rarely needed to be changed after cultures.

Conclusions

The presence of E. coli on culture in patients with a UTI changes based on medical complications, not age. Being medically complex did not result in reduced sensitivity of E. coli to SMX/TMP but was associated with increased rates of the presence of other pathogens. In our setting, treatment employed with SMX/TMP and without the use of culture and sensitivity may be effective for appropriately selected older women. Prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal approach to management.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Antimicrobial susceptibility trends for urinary isolates in the veteran population [^111vNp5W]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance on empiric treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) is lacking for the male population which comprises much of the Veteran population in the United States. This study evaluated susceptibility trends in antimicrobials used for treatment of UTIs in the inpatient and outpatient Veteran population nationwide.

Methods

Urine culture data was retrospectively obtained from Corporate Data Warehouse. All urine cultures from Veteran Health Administration patients 18 years of age or older who were treated at any VA health care center in the years 2009 and 2018 were eligible. Antibiograms were constructed for bacterial isolate susceptibility.

Results

In 2009 and 2018 isolates from 54,788 and 58,983 Veterans were analyzed, respectively. Escherichia coli was the most common bacteria isolated. For ceftriaxone, E coli susceptibilities were relatively high but trended downward from 2009 to 2018. Common urinary pathogen susceptibilities remained low for fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Discussion

Empiric therapy for Veterans with UTIs should be based on local susceptibility patterns as previously recommended first-line agents have fallen out of favor due to increasing resistance rates.

Conclusions

Both inpatient and outpatient stewardship is needed to ensure appropriate treatment, as viable treatment options for UTIs are becoming increasingly limited.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2022 guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^116W23Bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. The initial guidance document on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) was published on 17 September 2020. Over the past year, there have been a number of important publications furthering our understanding of the management of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections, prompting a rereview of the literature and this updated guidance document.

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections reviewed, updated, and expanded previously developed questions and recommendations about the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States.

Results

Preferred and alternative treatment recommendations are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Recommendations apply for both adult and pediatric populations.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This document is current as of 24 October 2021. The most current versions of IDSA documents, including dates of publication, are available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

IDSA 2023 extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — preferred and alternative antibiotics are specified as follows: Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

Ceftolozane–tazobactam for AmpC-producing Enterobacterales — limited activity and recommendation against routine use. The text notes less is known about ceftolozane-tazobactam's activity against AmpC-E and reports at least 1 investigation where the agent was active against only 19% of Escherichia cloacae isolates producing moderate levels of AmpC enzymes. Based on the limited available data, the panel suggests against the use of ceftolozane-tazobactam as a treatment option for AmpC-E infections. In polymicrobial infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and AmpC-E, the use of ceftolozane-tazobactam can be considered, with close monitoring for an appropriate clinical response.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111opq5j]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic stewardship and culture-directed management emphasizes that culture-directed, not empiric, therapies are associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic use, and that obtaining cultures for each symptomatic episode is associated with reduced rates of overtreatment and more appropriate antibiotic selection. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, risk of continued rUTIs as well as progression to later pyelonephritis is enhanced by unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria without any demonstrable benefit, and collateral damage from antimicrobial therapy includes alterations of the normal gut microbiome and promotion of multidrug resistant organisms. Escherichia coli isolates continue to demonstrate high in vitro susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and mecillinam, with these agents having minimal effects on the normal fecal microbiota, whereas TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones promote increased rates of antimicrobial resistance. Continued intermittent courses of antibiotics in rUTI patients are associated with significant adverse events, particularly in older adults, and thus substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of an acute cystitis episode. In asymptomatic women with a history of rUTIs, a placebo-controlled trial found those treated for ASB were more likely to have additional symptomatic cystitis episodes in a year of follow-up than those randomized to placebo, and over two years of follow up, treatment aimed at eradicating residual bacteriuria was associated with a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a higher incidence of pyelonephritis, and a poorer quality of life compared to non-treatment.

Ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole for lower-risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI): We recommend ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for the empiric treatment of lower-risk adults with CA-IAI. Based on all data, the task force concludes that ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole is a reasonable option for the treatment of lower-risk patients with CA-IAI, and in geographic localities with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, a non-fluoroquinolone-based regimen would be preferable.

### Medical and economic impact of extraintestinal infections due to Escherichia coli: focus on an increasingly important endemic problem [^1179jzVg]. Microbes and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is probably the best-known bacterial species and one of the most frequently isolated organisms from clinical specimens. Despite this, underappreciation and misunderstandings exist among medical professionals and the lay public alike regarding E. coli as an extraintestinal pathogen. Underappreciated features include (i) the wide variety of extraintestinal infections E. coli can cause, (ii) the high incidence and associated morbidity, mortality, and costs of these diverse clinical syndromes, (iii) the pathogenic potential of different groups of E. coli strains for causing intestinal versus extraintestinal disease, and (iv) increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated "killers". Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli. New treatments and prevention measures will be needed for improved outcomes and a diminished disease burden.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^112Wcxye]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin–clavulanic acid — empiric therapy considerations for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): The literature search did not identify any RCTs published since 2000 evaluating this agent, and a small prospective trial comparing IV amoxicillin–clavulanic acid plus metronidazole versus IV ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole found lower success rates with the amoxicillin–clavulanic acid regimen, although not statistically significant. An observational study from The Netherlands reported amoxicillin–clavulanic acid-resistant E. coli was increasingly common and use of this agent in such patients was associated with increased death. Susceptibility of E. coli to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was 50%–51%, only marginally better than ampicillin–sulbactam (45%–47%). Because of these efficacy and resistance concerns and lack of recent RCTs, the task force does not support use of amoxicillin–clavulanic acid for empiric treatment of patients with IAI; IV preparation is not available in the United States.

### Mortality following bacteraemic infection caused by extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli compared to non-ESBL producing E. coli [^11475pH4]. The Journal of Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the differences in mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with bacteraemic infection caused by ESBL and non-ESBL producing Escherichia coli. Main outcome measures were mortality, time from bacteraemia to death and length of inpatient stay.

Methods

From June 2003 to November 2005, we prospectively collected clinical and microbiological data on all adult patients with E. coli bacteraemia.

Results

ESBL producing E. coli caused 16/242 (6.6%) community-acquired and 30/112 (26.8%) hospital-acquired bacteraemic infections. The most common sites of infection were urine 239/354 (67.5%) and bile 41/354 (11.6%). All ESBL producers were resistant to cephalosporins. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, gentamicin and amikacin were 42/46 (91.3%), 39/46 (84.8%), 14/46 (30.4%) and 2/46 (4.3%), respectively. A significantly higher proportion of patients died following a bacteraemic infection caused by ESBL producing E. coli, 28/46 (60.8%), compared to non-ESBL producing E. coli, 73/308 (23.7%). The adjusted odds ratio for death was 3.57 (95% CI 1.48–8.60, p < 0.005). Delay in initiating an appropriate antibiotic was significantly associated with death and ESBL production. There was no significant difference between time from bacteraemia to death (median time 7 days (ESBL +ve group) vs 5 days (ESBL -ve group); p = 0.69) and, in those who survived, length of inpatient stay (median time 9 days (ESBL +ve group) vs 12 days (ESBL -ve group); p = 0.111).

Conclusions

Mortality following bacteraemic infection caused by ESBL producing E. coli was significantly higher than non-ESBL producing E. coli. These findings have serious implications for antibiotic prescription, as cephalosporins are ineffective treatment for many E. coli infections.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternative options. Do not use the latter if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Administer a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) as another alternative option.

### Increase in the community circulation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli despite reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [^1115L2w2]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance has reached pandemic proportions in the last few decades, increasing the mortality rates and healthcare costs associated with the prescription of ineffective antibiotics. These developments prompted the establishment of antimicrobial stewardship programs in healthcare institutions to minimize the overuse of antibiotics and optimize appropriate antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration of therapy. However, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are often circulating in the community as 'commensal' microbiota colonizing healthy individuals –, and it remains unclear how antibiotic use reduction has affected their prevalence in that reservoir.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) — bladder cystitis, pyelonephritis, and urosepsis of both community and nosocomial origin — are among the most common reasons for antibiotic treatment. Women of postmenopausal age — generally 50 years or older (50+ yo) — are especially at high risk for severe and drug-resistant forms of UTI. UTIs are primarily caused by extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli that are mostly associated with strains from specific clonal groups. Resident gut bacteria carried by the patient as commensal microbiota are the primary reservoir of UTI-causing E. coli, including the drug-resistant strains.

Consider use of levofloxacin plus metronidazole for lower-risk adults if a fluoroquinolone is warranted and it is the only fluoroquinolone available (Grade 2-C), and consider this regimen for lower-risk children if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111MaVrx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Key strengths of our study include the first evaluation of nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed antibiotic classes indicated for treatment of uUTI in the US using a large, rich EHR database. Second, features included in our predictive models were identified based on a comprehensive literature search and input from clinical experts, yielding the identification of clinically relevant predictors of antibiotic nonsusceptibility. Lastly, we used 2 approaches to contextualize and assess antibiotic nonsusceptibility in uUTI, namely, estimating probabilities of nonsusceptibility to each antibiotic class based on predictive models with good performance and temporal validity, and using a risk categorization framework to construct low, moderate, and high risk categories of antibiotic nonsusceptibility for E. coli isolates from patients with uUTI.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^114TEMVT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We developed predictive models and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed antibiotic classes for uUTI. Our predictive models identified number of previous UTI episodes, prior β-lactam nonsusceptibility, prior fluoroquinolone treatment, Census Bureau region, and race as important predictors of nonsusceptibility to at least 3 antibiotic classes evaluated. Findings from our study provide valuable insight on key patient characteristics to consider when assessing risk of antibiotic nonsusceptibility, thereby advancing the understanding of antibiotic nonsusceptibility in uUTI, and potentially informing optimal treatment strategies in this population. Future studies can provide additional insights by validating our models in different clinical settings and in ex-US populations and recalibrating them to include population-level features such as local antibiotic nonsusceptibility rates.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112NTTp8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Policy, clinical, and research implications

Our findings detail global high level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID)recommend that an antibiotic should be selected for first line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries and that as a result many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20% (appendix 5), suggesting that choices of first line treatment might need to be re-evaluated in less well developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad spectrum second line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins, and quinolones, resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics and bacterial resistance.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^115XEKrr]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^112nayjC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^111Wt4YA]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Current treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

The optimal treatment of infections with CRE is uncertain, as most data come from retrospective case series and anecdotal case reports; few prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are published on this topic. Since carbapenem-producing organisms are often resistant to other antimicrobial classes in addition to most beta-lactams, additional susceptibility testing to antimicrobials such as colistin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, aztreonam, and rifampin is needed. Consultations from experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms may also prove valuable in patient management. The following antimicrobial therapies have been used with various levels of success in the treatment of CRE infections.

### The emerging clinical importance of non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli [^1177acZ5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

In 1982, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome were linked to infection with Escherichia coli O157:H7, a serotype now classified as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Thereafter, hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with non-O157 STEC serogroups were reported, with the frequency of non-O157 STEC illness rivaling that of O157:H7 in certain geographic regions. In the United States, non-O157 E. coli may account for up to 20%-50% of all STEC infections. A high index of suspicion, paired with options to test for non-O157 STEC infection, are necessary for early recognition and appropriate treatment of these infections. Supportive care without the use of antibiotics is currently considered to be optimal treatment for all STEC infections. This commentary provides a perspective on the non-O157 STEC as human pathogens, how and when the clinician should approach the diagnosis of these organisms, and the challenges ahead.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^116vNZeZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Conserved collateral antibiotic susceptibility networks in diverse clinical strains of Escherichia coli [^113aMtBf]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

There is urgent need to develop novel treatment strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance. Collateral sensitivity (CS), where resistance to one antimicrobial increases susceptibility to other drugs, might enable selection against resistance during treatment. However, the success of this approach would depend on the conservation of CS networks across genetically diverse bacterial strains. Here, we examine CS conservation across diverse Escherichia coli strains isolated from urinary tract infections. We determine collateral susceptibilities of mutants resistant to relevant antimicrobials against 16 antibiotics. Multivariate statistical analyses show that resistance mechanisms, in particular efflux-related mutations, as well as the relative fitness of resistant strains, are principal contributors to collateral responses. Moreover, collateral responses shift the mutant selection window, suggesting that CS-informed therapies may affect evolutionary trajectories of antimicrobial resistance. Our data allow optimism for CS-informed therapy and further suggest that rapid detection of resistance mechanisms is important to accurately predict collateral responses.

### Extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamase producing Escherichia coli: changing epidemiology and clinical impact [^115gNPYH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the recent findings (July 2008-January 2010) on extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, mainly focussed on the epidemiology and clinical impact of infections owing to this pathogen.

Recent Findings

CTX-M-producing E. coli, mainly the CTX-M-15 producers, has emerged and disseminated worldwide as an important cause of both nosocomial and community-onset infections. The clonal spread of the ST131 epidemic E. coli strain is linked not only to the CTX-M-15 pandemia but also to other ESBLs types. The most commonly reported risk factors for community-onset ESBL-producing E. coli infections are contact with healthcare centres, recent use of antimicrobial agents, and presence of comorbidities. But infections owing to ESBL-producing E. coli in patients without obvious risk factors can occur, probably related to the increase of healthy carriers colonized with this pathogen. The main significant predictor of mortality caused by ESBL-producing E. coli is inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy. Alternatives of treatment of severe ESBL-producing E. coli infections included carbapenems, amikacin, tigecycline, and [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations; with some of them enough clinical evidence is lacking (tigecycline, [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations). For urinary tract infections, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin could be useful.

Summary

The worldwide emergence of multiresistant ESBL-producing E. coli raises key therapeutic problems; interventions addressed to their quick detection and early appropriate antibiotic treatment and prevention are urgently needed.

### Integrating Escherichia coli antimicrobial susceptibility data from multiple surveillance programs [^117MJMVZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

E. coli is the most common cause of infections by gram-negative bacilli and the bacterial organism most often isolated from blood cultures. It is a frequent cause of outpatient urinary tract infections in women worldwide, of hospitalization due to pyelonephritis and septicemia, and of nosocomial infections among hospitalized patients. Meningitis caused by E. coli in neonates is frequently fatal. Resistance to recommended first- and second-line agents, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, and fluoroquinolones is high in many countries and is commonly associated with treatment failure.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^116VfxPM]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have seen rapid increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which is threatening the efficacy of many antibiotic therapies, and ultimately leading to treatment failure –. Although new drugs are urgently needed, new antibiotic development is restricted by costs, limited government support, and regulatory requirements. For instance, as of 2019, major pharmaceutical corporations, commonly known as "big pharma", were progressively divesting themselves of antibiotic research and development (R&D) assets. This shift restricts the opportunities available to smaller companies and their investors, leading to heightened financial constraints and a lack of infrastructure for antibiotic R&D.

Furthermore, antibiotic resistance leads to increased reliance on broad-spectrum therapies, which select for further resistance, exacerbating the issue at hand. To avoid these risks, it is critical for clinicians to accurately align available antibiotic therapies with the precise susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens. Ideally, this alignment should occur when initiating empirical treatment, even before culture results are obtained (which might take several days to be available). In this study, we present interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which decreases the risk of non-susceptible and therefore, ineffective treatment, and facilitates rapid effective clinical intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these systems for urinary tract infections (UTIs), where the problem of antibiotic resistance is of particular importance.

UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting more than 150 million people each year. The pathogens that cause UTIs, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, can be carried asymptomatically and thus, are frequently exposed to antibiotics, including those intended for other infections. This exposure, combined with high recurrence rates, often results in multidrug-resistant strains, with resistance rates of over 20% for commonly used drugs. As treatment-outcome is associated with the infecting pathogen's susceptibilities, clinicians are faced with the challenging task of correctly prescribing patients with the most appropriate antibiotics. However, to offer rapid intervention, treatment is commonly administered empirically, lacking insight into the specific antibiotics that the infecting pathogen may be susceptible to. This scenario adds to the potential of choosing an inadequate treatment regimen.

### Why antibiotics should not be used to treat Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^116MgTtt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been much debate about treating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections with antibiotics. No data convincingly demonstrate that antibiotics are better than no antibiotic treatment at all, and many studies suggest antibiotics increase the risk of developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This topic is timely, because emerging technology enables rapid identification of STEC-infected patients, and we anticipate questions about management will increase. This review is designed to familiarize readers with the series of observations that underlie our recommendations.

Recent Findings

The long debate over antibiotics in STEC infections appears resolved by gradually accruing information that show that antibiotics do not benefit infected patients. In fact, they are associated with an increased likelihood of developing HUS. A meta-analysis published in 2016 demonstrated that low risk of bias studies find a clear association between antibiotic use and development of HUS. Subsequent publications do not refute these findings.

Summary

In high-income countries, antibiotics should not routinely be given to patients with acute diarrhea unless testing demonstrates a pathogen for which antibiotics are indicated, and STEC infection has been excluded. Future work to prevent HUS should focus on preventing primary infections, and mitigating extraintestinal consequences of STEC gut infections.

### Non-Escherichia coli versus Escherichia coli community-acquired urinary tract infections in children hospitalized in a tertiary center: relative frequency, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance and outcome [^113xXaxs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Currently hospitalization for children with urinary tract infections (UTIs) is reserved for severe or complicated cases. Changes may have taken place in the characteristics and causative uropathogens of hospital-treated community-acquired UTI.

Objectives

To study children hospitalized in a tertiary center with community-acquired UTI, compare Escherichia coli and non-E. coli UTI, define predictors for non-E. coli UTI and elucidate the appropriate therapeutic approach.

Patients and Methods

A prospective clinical and laboratory study from 2001 through 2002 in a tertiary pediatric medical center. Patients were divided by results of the urine culture into E. coli and non-E. coli UTI groups, which were compared.

Results

Of 175 episodes of culture-proved UTI, 70 (40%) were caused by non-E. coli pathogens. Non-E. coli UTI was more commonly found in children who were male (P = 0.005), who had underlying renal abnormalities (P = 0.0085) and who had received antibiotic therapy in the prior month (P = 0.0009). Non-E. coli uropathogens were often resistant to antibiotics usually recommended for initial therapy for UTI, including cephalosporins and aminoglycosides; 19% were initially treated with inappropriate empiric intravenous antibiotics (compared with 2% for E. coli UTI, P = 0.0001), with a longer hospitalization.

Conclusions

Current treatment routines are often inappropriate for hospitalized children with non-E. coli UTI, which is relatively common in this population. The defined risk factors associated with non-E. coli UTIs and its antimicrobial resistance patterns should be considered to improve empiric antibiotic therapy for these infections.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159bwqx]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognised threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and are associated with increased healthcare costs. In low income countries, affordability of second line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a lot of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months. Most of the contributing studies, however, were conducted in adults.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections seen in primary care. In children with a suspected urinary tract infection, the most common management strategy is to treat empirically with an antibiotic while results of culture and sensitivity testing are awaited. Young children are more vulnerable to immediate and long term complications, including renal scarring and renal failure, and therefore require prompt appropriate treatment. Escherichia coli is responsible for over 80% of all urinary tract infectionsand is also the most common cause of bacteraemia and foodborne infections and a cause of meningitis in neonates.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the prevalence of resistance in community acquired E coli urinary tract infection to the most commonly prescribed antibiotics given to children in primary care and to quantify the relation between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and bacterial resistance. We stratified results by OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study countries as antibiotics tend to be used differently in these groups. In the more developed OECD countries antibiotics are obtained mostly only by prescription, whereas in "developing" non-OECD countries many antibiotics, including those commonly used to treat urinary tract infection, can be obtained over the counter, without the need for a prescription.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^114UPXv9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Prevalence of antibiotic tolerance and risk for reinfection among Escherichia coli bloodstream isolates: a prospective cohort study [^115LNBJw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy is a key determinant of favorable patient outcome and is based on the susceptibility of bacteria to selected therapy. Antibiotic resistance directly relates to the concentration of the antibiotic that is required to inhibit bacterial growth. Tolerance, a resistance-independent pathway for bacterial survival under antibiotic exposure, is defined as a transient ability of bacteria to survive under an otherwise bactericidal treatment. Tolerance may also lead to the failure of antibiotic therapy and facilitate the emergence of resistance. Current antibiotic treatment decisions are based on standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing, which does not detect tolerance. Hence, tolerant strains may be misclassified as susceptible, thereby resulting in treatment failure. Indeed, tolerant bacteria have been found among clinical isolates and associated with treatment failure. These reports, however, mostly involved few selected strains. We used a prospective cohort of bloodstream infections (BSIs) involving Escherichia coli to characterize the epidemiology of tolerance more broadly in a clinical population and define the risk of BSIs among patients with prior tolerant E. coli BSIs.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: a randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

Objectives

To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible E coli or K pneumoniae.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least 1 positive blood culture with E coli or Klebsiella spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results

Among 379 patients (mean age, 66.5 years; 47.8% women) who were randomized appropriately, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the primary analysis population, 378 (99.7%) completed the trial and were assessed for the primary outcome. A total of 23 of 187 patients (12.3%) randomized to piperacillin-tazobactam met the primary outcome of mortality at 30 days compared with 7 of 191 (3.7%) randomized to meropenem (risk difference, 8.6% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 14.5%]; p = 0.90 for noninferiority). Effects were consistent in an analysis of the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 188 patients (2.7%) in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 3 of 191 (1.6%) in the meropenem group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with E coli or K pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance, definitive treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with meropenem did not result in a noninferior 30-day mortality. These findings do not support use of piperacillin-tazobactam in this setting.

### Desirability of outcome ranking for the management of antimicrobial therapy (DOOR MAT) reveals improvements in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients from the veterans health administration [^114NaTe7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reductions in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a cornerstone of antimicrobial stewardship. We aim to demonstrate use of the Desirability of Outcome Ranking Approach for the Management of Antimicrobial Therapy (DOOR MAT) to evaluate the treatment of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections in patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) across a decade.

Methods

Using electronic records, we determined empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments, clinical characteristics, and 30-day mortality of patients with monomicrobial E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections hospitalized in VHA medical centers from 2009 to 2018. Focusing on patients treated with parenteral β-lactams and with available antibiotic susceptibility testing results, we applied a range of DOOR MAT scores that reflect the desirability of antibiotic choices according to spectrum and activity against individual isolates. We report trends in resistance and desirability of empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments.

Results

During the 10-year period analyzed, resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones increased in E. coli but not in K. pneumoniae, while resistance to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam remained unchanged. In 6451 cases analyzed, we observed improvements in DOOR MAT scores consistent with deescalation. Improvement in desirability of definitive treatment compared with empiric treatment occurred in 26% of cases, increasing from 16% in 2009 to 34% in 2018. Reductions in overtreatment were sustained and without negative impact on survival.

Conclusions

DOOR MAT provides a framework to assess antibiotic treatment of E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections and can be a useful metric in antimicrobial stewardship.

### Fosfomycin Vs ciprofloxacin as oral step-down treatment for Escherichia coli febrile urinary tract infections in women: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial [^113vMb2M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Febrile urinary tract infections (fUTIs), defined as UTIs with systemic symptoms, frequently occur in women and are predominantly caused by Escherichia coli. Guidelines recommend treating fUTIs that require hospitalization with a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics that usually consists of empiric intravenous (IV) treatment preferably followed by an oral step-down treatment targeted to the susceptibility pattern of the causal uropathogen. Optimal treatment of fUTIs is hampered by the increase in multiresistant gram-negative bacteria. While new antibiotics are being developed for the IV treatment of fUTIs, the arsenal of oral antibiotics has remained stable for decades. Based on antimicrobial resistance, 2%–5% of patients hospitalized for community-acquired fUTIs in the Netherlands cannot be treated with oral antibiotics, with even higher rates of antimicrobial resistance in other parts of the world, implying the need for prolonged IV antibiotic therapy and extended hospitalization.

Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analogue that is orally available as fosfomycin–trometamol. It is licensed for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in women, has a good safety profile, and has in vitro activity against E. coli. Despite its increased use, persisting low resistance rates are observed against fosfomycin, up to 2%. In retrospective studies, fosfomycin appeared effective as a step-down treatment for fUTIs. Our objective in this randomized, controlled trial was to determine if fosfomycin is noninferior to ciprofloxacin for the oral step-down treatment of fUTIs caused by E. coli in women.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^115Aib5q]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary clinical outcome measure was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic treated, UTI episodes self-reported by participants over the 12 month treatment period. An episode of UTI was defined as the presence of at least one symptom reported by patients or clinicians from a predefined list produced by Public Health England, together with the taking of a discrete treatment course of antibiotics for UTI. Consequently, the occurrence of the primary outcome was always defined by the independent prescribing clinician via confirmation of the likely diagnosis and recommendation of antibiotic treatment. The end of one UTI episode was defined as 14 days after the final antibiotic dose. If symptoms restarted or further antibiotics were prescribed within 14 days, this event was counted as the same episode.

Secondary outcomes were the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic treated UTI in the six months after treatment; microbiologically confirmed UTIs; antibiotic resistance profiles in Escherichia coli isolated from urine and perineal swabs; asymptomatic bacteriuria; total antibiotic use; and hospital admissions due to UTI. Participant satisfaction with treatment was measured using the treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication, which assessed four domains of treatment satisfaction: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.

Microbiologically confirmed UTIs were episodes defined as per the primary outcome but with an additional criterion of positive urine culture at the time of UTI. A positive urine culture was defined as one isolate of a potential uropathogen at a concentration of ≥ 10⁴ colony forming units/mL or two species of uropathogens isolated at ≥ 10⁵ colony forming units/mL. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined as a positive urine culture from urine samples submitted to the central laboratory in the absence of symptoms. Antibiotic resistance was assessed from urine and perineal swabs with antimicrobial sensitivity tested in triplicate against a panel of antibiotic drugs. Multidrug resistance in E coli was defined as resistance to at least one antibiotic drug in at least three antimicrobial categories (supplementary material, page 1).

### Increase in the community circulation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli despite reduction in antibiotic prescriptions [^117AzNY8]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The commensal gut microbiota is the primary reservoir of UTI-causing E. coli, with gut carriage profiles mirroring UTI from the perspectives of clonal composition and drug-resistance profiles of E. coli as well as patient age demographics. In particular, elderly women are colonized more often by FQREC and are at a higher risk for FQR forms of UTI than younger women. As recently as 2016, FQs were the most prescribed antibiotic for treating UTIs. However, accumulated evidence for adverse effects combined with a sharp rise in FQ resistance of uropathogenic enterobacteria led to FDA, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for curbing FQ use in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. However, FQ continues to be recommended for patients who have no alternative treatment options, complicated UTIs, pyelonephritis, or other severe infections where the benefits of FQ outweigh the risks of adverse effects. Thus, resistance to FQ in uropathogens remains a significant clinical problem, and a reduction in gut carriage of FQREC would be a welcome development. This is especially important because the FQR phenotype of E. coli has a strong association with UTI-caused bacteremia in individuals aged 50+ yo and overall sepsis mortality rates in adults.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae: an emerging public-health concern [^113AUQrZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The medical community relies on clinical expertise and published guidelines to assist physicians with choices in empirical therapy for system-based infectious syndromes, such as community-acquired pneumonia and urinary-tract infections (UTIs). From the late 1990s, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mostly Escherichia coli) that produce extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs), such as the CTX-M enzymes, have emerged within the community setting as an important cause of UTIs. Recent reports have also described ESBL-producing E coli as a cause of bloodstream infections associated with these community-onset UTIs. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Thus, more rapid diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the possible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteraemia associated with UTIs are required.

### Antimicrobial resistance and mortality followingbacteremia [^114wrRTy]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

E. coli bloodstream infections are associated with a high 90 day mortality rate, and the crude mortality is significantly higher for strains resistant to each class of common antimicrobial agents. Some of the current elevated mortality with AMR E. coli is explained by patient characteristics, and in particular confounding by extent of prior healthcare exposure. Therefore many estimates of the current mortality associated with AMR may be over-estimates, and ongoing surveillance for AMR-associated mortality should incorporate adjustment for patient characteristics. However, our data detected strong signals of associated increased mortality with AMR, even after multivariable adjustment. The association was strongest for the most important empiric and therapeutic classes of agents, and so future estimates will also need to take into account antibiotic availability and treatment practices in different regions. Ongoing global and local efforts are essential to help curtail AMR, and thereby minimize mortality among patients with E. coli bloodstream infection and other common bacterial pathogens and syndromes.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and doxycycline guidance is as follows: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not suggested for the treatment of ESBL-E cystitis, with a randomized trial comparing a 3-day amoxicillin-clavulanic regimen (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) to ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) in 370 women showing clinical cure in 58% versus 77% and higher persistent vaginal bacterial colonization in 45% versus 10%; the proportion infected with ESBL-E strains was not available and both agents were administered at dosages lower than generally suggested. The panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis, citing limited urinary excretion (35%–60%) and lack of convincing data for clinical effectiveness.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115D6P2i]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Of the five studies we included in our meta-analysis, most reported the association between previous antibiotic exposure and resistance within overlapping time periods. This implies that the associations with longer time periods (such as 0–6 months) could reflect a combination of long and short term associations. The odds ratios were highest in the 0–6 months time period; probably because this individual study measured exposure to antibiotics for a combined total of four weeks or more within the previous six months compared with no exposure within the six month time period. The other studies measured exposure to antibiotics within an undefined combined length of prescription time within the measured time period versus no antibiotic prescriptions. None of the studies we included in our meta-analysis reported antibiotic doses, so we were unable to evaluate any dose-response effects.

In most countries it is standard practice to treat empirically with an antibiotic when a child presents to primary care with a suspected urinary tract infection. Sometimes a urine sample is taken only if the illness does not respond to first line antibiotic treatment. This can lead to falsely high reported resistance rates to first line antibiotics. This problem would be removed if only incident cases were included or systematic urine sampling was used, but studies did not present this information. That said, there were no obvious differences in resistance rates according to the timing of the urine sampling. Furthermore, variation in sampling strategies could explain some of the variation in pooled prevalence of resistance between OECD and non-OECD countries, though this could not be explored from the data available. Reverse causality and other confounding associations could also have introduced bias to our findings; including previous hospital admissions, comorbidities, age, and sex. Studies that attempted to adjust for confounding factors, however, did not show differences between crude and adjusted estimates of association.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^114akPFB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115mC5vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1112MmYz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

Methods

A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-E, AmpC-E, CRE, DTR-P. aeruginosa, CRAB, and S. maltophilia. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States.

Results

Preferred and alternative suggested treatment approaches are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, transitioning to oral therapy, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggested approaches apply for both adult and pediatric populations, although suggested antibiotic dosages are provided only for adults.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant infections. This document is current as of December 31, 2022 and will be updated periodically. The most current version of this document, including date of publication, is available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Consensus review of the epidemiology and appropriate antimicrobial therapy of complicated urinary tract infections in Asia-Pacific region [^1127rChk]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the general population. They cause a substantial financial burden in the community and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitals. With increased rates of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, treatment of complicated UTIs (cUTIs) can be challenging for clinicians. Consideration of an optimal antimicrobial agent should be based on local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, and cost. In the Asia-Pacific region, nearly half of Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant (including intermediate and resistant) to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and ≥ 30% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) and cefepime. Overall, 33% of urinary E. coli isolates exhibited extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing phenotypes. Prevalence of ESBL-producing urinary E. coli was highest in India (60%), followed by Hong Kong (48%) and Singapore (33%). All urinary isolates of E. coli were susceptible to both ertapenem and imipenem. All urinary isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem and 4% of them were resistant to ertapenem. Care should be exercised when using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins for the empirical treatment of UTIs, particularly cUTI among moderately to severely ill patients. Empiric antimicrobial treatment for serious cUTIs in which risk factors for resistant organisms exist should include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam. Aminoglycosides, tigecycline, and polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) can be used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms or serious cUTIs when first-line options are deemed inappropriate or patients fail therapy. Because of considerable variability in different countries, local epidemiological data is critical in the effective management of UTIs in the Asia-Pacific region.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases in ambulatory care: a clinical perspective [^1123Mfs5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms are emerging as a cause of infection in outpatients in many areas of the world. Most of these involve urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli harbouring CTX-M types of ESBLs. Risk-factors for such infections include older age and previous use of quinolones and cephalosporins. Oral alternatives for such infections are limited. These organisms may also cause some community-acquired life-threatening infections, such as bacteraemic urinary tract or intra-abdominal infections. Patients with these infections are at increased probability of receiving inappropriate empirical treatment. More studies addressing the risk-factors and therapeutic options for these infections are needed.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^115JhTEJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### Risk factors for community-acquired ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli urinary tract infection [^117QSmwN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the empiric treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in communities in which uropathogen resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is ≥ 10% to 20%. However, recent studies also have demonstrated an increase in the isolation of fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. Identification of outpatients at increased risk for fluoroquinolone resistance would improve the selection of empiric treatment.

Objective

To identify risk factors for community-acquired UTIs due to ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli (CREC).

Methods

All medical records from the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center from January to December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with community-acquired UTI due to CREC. Patients with community-acquired UTI due to ciprofloxacin-susceptible E. coli presenting during the same time period were randomly selected as the study group in a 1:2 ratio of case to controls.

Results

Independent risk factors for CREC included recurrent UTI (OR 8.13) and prior exposure to fluoroquinolones (OR 30.35).

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolones continue to be appropriate empiric treatment in most patients with uncomplicated UTI. Nitrofurantoin or a cephalosporin may be better choices in patients with recurrent lower UTI and/or previous fluoroquinolone use.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^117Y6SAC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Emerging trends in antibiotic resistance: implications for emergency medicine [^114nfavR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Many bacteria are demonstrating increasing levels of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. While this has implications for the healthcare system as a whole, many patients infected with these resistant organisms will initially present to the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of current trends in infections caused by the most clinically relevant resistant organisms encountered in emergency medicine.

Methods

Bacteria were selected based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, and PubMed database.

Results

The following bacteria were included: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, Escherichia coli, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All have shown increasing rates of resistance to one or more of the antibiotics commonly used to treat them. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance are associated with worse clinical outcomes and greater healthcare costs.

Conclusions

Antibiotic resistance is increasing and poses significant a risk to both the patient and public health as a whole. Appropriate choice of initial antibiotic is important in improving clinical outcomes, which is often the role of the ED provider. On a broader level, the ED must also take part in institutional efforts such as Antibiotic Stewardship Programs, which have been shown to decrease costs and rates of infection with resistant organisms. Ultimately, a multifaceted approach will be required to curb the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^112WEVzq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

E. coli O157:H7 can cause potentially lethal illness in hosts of all ages. These patients often are evaluated and treated by gastroenterologists. The treating physician should administer adequate hydration, usually parenterally, and avoid the use of antibiotics and antimotility agents. The physician needs to notify immediately the appropriate public health authorities of the diagnosis and to ensure that the isolate is recovered by the microbiologist and forwarded for molecular linkage analyses.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^113u3k1t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option? [^113DBEdm]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in women recommend empiric therapy with antibiotics for which local resistance rates do not exceed 10–20%. We hypothesized that resistance rates of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones may have surpassed this level in older women in the Israeli community setting.

Objectives

To identify age groups of women in which fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric treatment of UTI.

Methods

Resistance rates for ofloxacin were calculated for all cases of uncomplicated UTI diagnosed during the first 5 months of 2005 in a managed care organization (MCO) in Israel, in community-dwelling women aged 41–75 years. The women were without risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance. Uncomplicated UTI was diagnosed with a urine culture positive for E. coli. The data set was stratified for age, using 5 year intervals, and stratum-specific resistance rates (% and 95% CI) were calculated. These data were analyzed to identify age groups in which resistance rates have surpassed 10%.

Results

The data from 1291 urine cultures were included. The crude resistance rate to ofloxacin was 8.7% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.2). Resistance was lowest among the youngest (aged 41–50 y) women (3.2%; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18), approached 10% in women aged 51–55 years (7.1%; 95% CI 3.4 to 10.9), and reached 19.86% (95% CI 13.2 to 26.5) among the oldest women (aged 56–75 y).

Conclusions

Physicians who opt to treat UTI in postmenopausal women empirically should consider prescribing drugs other than fluoroquinolones. Concomitant longitudinal surveillance of both antibiotic utilization patterns and uropathogen resistance rates should become routine practice in this managed-care organization.

### Treatment of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections [^111cm1bz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The management of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections is reviewed. Certain management practices optimize the likelihood of good outcomes, such as avoidance of antibiotics during the pre-hemolytic uremic syndrome phase, admission to hospital, and vigorous intravenous volume expansion using isotonic fluids. The successful management of STEC infections is based on recognition that a patient might have an STEC infection, and appropriate use of the microbiology laboratory. The timeliness of STEC identification cannot be overemphasized, because it avoids therapies prompted by inappropriate additional testing and directs the clinician to focus on effective management strategies. The opportunities during STEC infections to avert the worst outcomes are brief, and this article emphasizes practical matters relevant to making a diagnosis, anticipating the trajectory of illness, and optimizing care.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11587YSF]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To systematically review studies investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli in children and, when appropriate, to meta-analyse the relation between previous antibiotics prescribed in primary care and resistance.

Design and Data Analysis

Systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled percentage prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in children in primary care, stratified by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study country. Random effects meta-analysis was used to quantify the association between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and resistance.

Data Sources

Observational and experimental studies identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, searched for articles published up to October 2015.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported resistance in community acquired urinary tract infection in children and young people aged 0–17. Electronic searches with MeSH terms and text words identified 3115 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results

58 observational studies investigated 77,783 E coli isolates in urine. In studies from OECD countries, the pooled prevalence of resistance was 53.4% (95% confidence interval 46.0% to 60.8%) for ampicillin, 23.6% (13.9% to 32.3%) for trimethoprim, 8.2% (7.9% to 9.6%) for co-amoxiclav, and 2.1% (0.8 to 4.4%) for ciprofloxacin; nitrofurantoin was the lowest at 1.3% (0.8% to 1.7%). Resistance in studies in countries outside the OECD was significantly higher: 79.8% (73.0% to 87.7%) for ampicillin, 60.3% (40.9% to 79.0%) for co-amoxiclav, 26.8% (11.1% to 43.0%) for ciprofloxacin, and 17.0% (9.8% to 24.2%) for nitrofurantoin. There was evidence that bacterial isolates from the urinary tract from individual children who had received previous prescriptions for antibiotics in primary care were more likely to be resistant to antibiotics, and this increased risk could persist for up to six months (odds ratio 13.23, 95% confidence interval 7.84 to 22.31).

Conclusions

Prevalence of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics in primary care in children with urinary tract infections caused by E coli is high, particularly in countries outside the OECD, where one possible explanation is the availability of antibiotics over the counter. This could render some antibiotics ineffective as first line treatments for urinary tract infection. Routine use of antibiotics in primary care contributes to antimicrobial resistance in children, which can persist for up to six months after treatment.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) as an alternative option. Consider administering TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of pyelonephritis or complicated UTIs caused by AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^113fmdam]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

It's not an unusual presentation in primary care — an alert, responsive preschool child with a temperature of 39°C, unremarkable findings on examination, but with leucocytes and nitrites in the urine. Given a strong suspicion of a urinary tract infection, and with Escherichia coli being the most likely organism, empirical management with one of a small number of cheap and available antibiotics would follow.

In a linked paper, Bryce and colleagues (doi:) present compelling evidence of the need to reconsider current approaches to community based management of paediatric urinary tract infection. Their findings confront long established patterns of practice and are inextricably linked to the emerging global problem of antimicrobial resistance.

Bryce's team undertook a systematic review designed to identify the global prevalence of resistance to commonly recommended antibiotics in children with community acquired E coli urinary tract infection. They systematically reviewed 58 studies in 26 countries. Five of these studies allowed them to measure the association between previous prescription of antibiotics and subsequent E coli resistance in the same child. Drugs of interest included ampicillin, co-amoxiclav, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. Ceftazidime was used as a marker for cephalosporin resistance.

For an antibiotic to be considered a first line empirical treatment for urinary tract infection, resistance should not exceed 20% in the most likely infecting strain. Bryce and colleagues show that this threshold has been reached for many first line antibiotics used for paediatric E coli urinary tract infection. Within countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), a half of all isolates were resistant to ampicillin, a third to co-trimoxazole, and a quarter to trimethoprim. Resistance was substantially greater in non-OECD countries. Data confirmed the group's previous reviewsuggesting that previous antibiotic use in primary care increased the subsequent risk of E coli resistance to that particular antibiotic.

Despite the clinical mixed inclusion criteria (a women aged 17 with symptoms of cystitis presents a very different clinical picture than a toddler with a fever of unknown origin), the findings have important implications for the management of paediatric urinary tract infection in primary care and for clinical decisions that have remained largely unchanged since the 1990s.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa) [^113FpsFc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions. The most current version of the guidance including the date of publication can be found at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance/.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

Avoid using tetracycline derivatives for the treatment of UTIs or bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Personalized antibiograms for machine learning driven antibiotic selection [^112uPgiX]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 700,000 people already die annually due to antibiotic resistant infections, and expects this number to exceed 10 million per year by 2050. Increasing antibiotic resistance is a natural and inevitable consequence of regular antibiotic use, raising the looming threat of a post-antibiotic era that could cripple routine medical care with higher infection-related mortality and costs of care –.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify improving antibiotic prescribing through antibiotic stewardship as the most important action to combat the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria. For example, sixty percent of hospitalized patients receive antibiotics despite the fact that half of antibiotic treatments are inappropriate — meaning antibiotic use was unwarranted, the wrong antibiotic was given, or the antibiotic was delivered with wrong dose or duration. A key challenge is that antibiotics must often be prescribed empirically, before the identity of the infecting organism and antibiotic susceptibilities are known. Microbial cultures are the definitive diagnostic tests for this information, but may take days to confirm final results, far too long to delay initial therapy.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics help ensure coverage of a range of organisms that would lead to rapid clinical deterioration if left untreated. Yet, it is precisely the excessive use of antibiotics that increases drug resistant organisms. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics can thus have severe immediate and indirect consequences ranging from increasing antibiotic resistance to drug-specific toxicities and secondary infections such as Clostridioides difficile colitis –.

Existing standards of care for selecting empiric antibiotics involve referring to clinical practice guidelines combined with knowledge of institution-specific antibiograms — an annual report from an institution's microbiology lab that tracks the most common organisms isolated by microbial cultures and the percentages that were found susceptible to different antibiotics –. An institution's antibiogram might report for example that 1000 Escherechia Coli were isolated in the prior year, and that 98% were susceptible to meropenem, while only 89% were susceptible to ceftriaxone. These approaches may not consider many or any patient-specific features. Microbial culture results found within the electronic health record can be used to objectively measure not only whether chosen antibiotics were appropriate, but if alternatives would have sufficed. Here we hypothesize that the standard of care may benefit from machine learning-based clinical decision support for personalized treatment recommendations.

IDSA 2023 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach — If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### A general method for rapid determination of antibiotic susceptibility and species in bacterial infections [^112zxxVk]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

To ensure correct antibiotic treatment and reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, there is an urgent need for new rapid methods for species identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility in infectious pathogenic bacteria. We have developed a general method for the rapid identification of the bacterial species causing an infection and the determination of their antibiotic susceptibility profiles. An initial short cultivation step in the absence and presence of different antibiotics was combined with sensitive species-specific padlock probe detection of the bacterial target DNA to allow a determination of growth (i.e., resistance) and no growth (i.e., susceptibility). A proof-of-concept was established for urinary tract infections in which we applied the method to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of Escherichia coli for two drugs with 100% accuracy in 3.5 h. The short assay time from sample to readout enables fast appropriate treatment with effective drugs and minimizes the need to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics due to unknown resistance profiles of the treated infection.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid using polymyxin B and colistin for the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Consider administering colistin as an alternative option for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Management of serious nosocomial bacterial infections: do current therapeutic options meet the need? [^113A1zGS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired bacterial infections pose a formidable challenge for healthcare providers, as patients often need to be treated empirically, at least initially, although delay of appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is known to increase morbidity significantly and to increase mortality among affected patients. This elevated risk is compounded by the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prompt initiation of treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms is prudent for patients with nosocomial infections. As the continued usefulness of vancomycin comes into question, the number of alternative agents that provide efficacy equal to that of vancomycin remains limited. The development of novel and effective alternative agents, such as tigecycline, is therefore important.

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^115e4DU4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.
