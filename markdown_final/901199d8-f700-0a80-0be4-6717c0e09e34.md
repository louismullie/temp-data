## Question

treatment resistant depression

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining TRD and confirming adequacy of prior treatments. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and common contributors to apparent treatment resistance. Next, I will review evidence-based management strategies, including pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and neurostimulation options, and I should double-check guideline positions. After that, I need to consider special populations and prognostic factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure I cite the best available evidence throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor prematurely on a single criterion. TRD is most commonly defined as failure to achieve remission after two adequate antidepressant trials of different classes at adequate dose and duration, with adherence verified; however, I should note that some contemporary frameworks broaden the concept to "difficult-to-treat depression" emphasizing persistent burden despite usual care and multidimensional barriers, and that expert consensus statements increasingly call for standardized, mechanism-aware definitions to improve comparability across studies [^1111HenB] [^111YRew7] [^113rQpzq].

> Wait, let me verify what constitutes an "adequate" trial. I initially thought 6–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose was standard, but I should confirm the range. Most guidelines and studies accept 4–6 weeks at a recognized minimum effective dose as adequate, with some extending to 8–12 weeks in certain contexts; importantly, I need to ensure adherence and that the two failures are not within the same class or mechanism, as some consensus statements recommend different mechanisms rather than merely different classes to better reflect pharmacologic diversity [^117VTy5M] [^113rQpzq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "resistance" before excluding pseudoresistance. I should double-check for subtherapeutic dosing, short duration, poor adherence, and misdiagnosis such as bipolar spectrum disorder, psychotic depression, substance use, or medical comorbidity like hypothyroidism; these are frequent culprits of apparent nonresponse and must be addressed before labeling TRD, as emphasized in primary care and psychiatric reviews alike [^116LpCpY] [^114y49tA] [^111AWheU].

> Next, I should review the epidemiology and burden to frame prognosis. TRD affects roughly 10–30% of patients with MDD, carries higher relapse rates after each treatment step, and is associated with substantial functional impairment and healthcare costs; STAR*D showed cumulative remission rates around 37% after step 1, 31% after step 2, 14% after step 3, and 13% after step 4, with relapse risk rising with each step, underscoring the need for early, effective intervention and maintenance planning [^11618xgQ] [^116jwsSD] [^116dYiUs].

> I will now examine pharmacologic strategies, starting with augmentation. Atypical antipsychotics have the most robust evidence: aripiprazole and quetiapine are FDA-approved adjuncts, with meta-analytic support showing clinically meaningful benefit, though I should confirm side-effect profiles including metabolic effects and akathisia; lithium and liothyronine (T3) also have supportive evidence and are reasonable options, particularly when bipolar spectrum features or thyroid dysfunction are suspected or present [^111EzeEL] [^116DtpAG] [^112J5FPm].

> Let me consider combination antidepressants. Combining agents with different mechanisms (for example, bupropion with an SSRI/SNRI, or mirtazapine with an SSRI) can leverage complementary pharmacology, but I should double-check the strength of evidence; much of the data are from smaller, uncontrolled studies, with a mean response around 60% in pooled open-label and RCT data, so I need to balance potential benefit against polypharmacy risks and monitor closely for tolerability and interactions [^115ckRNH] [^115UgHAK].

> Switching strategies are appropriate when there was minimal benefit or poor tolerability. Switching within or across classes is reasonable, and I should remember that STAR*D found no clear superiority among switch options at each step, so agent selection should be guided by prior side effects, comorbidities, and patient preference; in older adults, switching to bupropion or augmenting with aripiprazole or bupropion yielded similar improvements, with augmentation showing numerically higher remission than switching in one RCT, though differences were modest [^116jwsSD] [^115UZSty].

> But wait, what about psychotherapy and measurement-based care. I should confirm that adding psychotherapy, particularly CBT or interpersonal therapy, to antidepressants improves outcomes in some patients, and that systematic symptom tracking with validated scales (PHQ-9, QIDS) helps detect partial response and guide timely adjustments; mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may also help in chronic, recurrent presentations, though evidence quality varies and should be individualized [^114Hm3TR] [^113ieToV] [^113RZaTM].

> I need to check neurostimulation options for severe, urgent, or refractory cases. ECT remains the most effective treatment for TRD with suicidality, psychosis, or catatonia, with high response rates but cognitive side effects; rTMS is FDA-cleared for patients who have failed at least one antidepressant and has durable benefits in many trials, while VNS has weaker evidence and is generally reserved for highly treatment-resistant cases; DBS remains investigational and should be considered only in specialized centers [^112icXZK] [^115wYXzQ] [^114v1EXr].

> Let me verify the role of ketamine and esketamine. Intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine produce rapid antidepressant effects and reduced suicidal ideation in TRD, with effect sizes among the highest in meta-analyses of augmentation strategies; however, I should confirm that most guidelines still position them as second-line or later options due to safety, monitoring requirements, and durability concerns, and that real-world durability often necessitates maintenance strategies [^111tKVfj] [^116DgY3w] [^115wYXzQ].

> Next, I should review special populations and prognostic modifiers. In older adults, TRD is more common and often presents with cognitive slowing, anxiety, and medical comorbidity; augmentation with aripiprazole or bupropion is reasonable, and ECT should be considered earlier for severe or life-threatening presentations. Comorbid anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders predict poorer response and should be actively managed. Early improvement by week 2 predicts better outcomes with augmentation, supporting close early monitoring and timely strategy changes [^112NwbFk] [^115UZSty] [^116NyV1K].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical, stepwise algorithm so it's actionable. First, confirm diagnosis and adequacy of prior trials, including adherence and dose/duration. Second, address pseudoresistance contributors. Third, choose among optimization, switching, or augmentation based on degree of partial response and tolerability. Fourth, escalate to evidence-based neurostimulation for severe, urgent, or refractory cases. Fifth, integrate psychotherapy and measurement-based care throughout. Sixth, plan maintenance to prevent relapse, recognizing that each additional treatment step increases relapse risk and that functional recovery should be tracked alongside symptoms [^115wYXzQ] [^116jwsSD] [^111YRew7].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge gaps. While atypical antipsychotic augmentation, lithium, T3, ketamine/esketamine, ECT, and rTMS have supportive data, head-to-head comparisons between switch and augmentation are limited; the ASCERTAIN-TRD trial is a notable attempt to compare augmentation with rTMS versus atypical antipsychotic augmentation versus SNRI switch, highlighting the need for more comparative effectiveness research to personalize sequencing decisions [^114v1EXr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan aligns with patient-centered goals and shared decision-making. Many patients prioritize functioning, quality of life, and tolerability over symptom elimination; the DTD framework encourages identifying and remedying patient-, illness-, and treatment-related barriers, and I should incorporate patient preferences, access, and monitoring logistics into the care plan to sustain engagement and improve real-world outcomes [^111YRew7] [^115wYXzQ].

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is defined as **lack of remission after two adequate antidepressant trials** [^115wYXzQ] of different classes, each at an adequate dose and duration with confirmed adherence [^115wYXzQ]. TRD affects **10–30% of patients with MDD** [^11618xgQ] and is associated with higher relapse, suicidality, and functional impairment [^1117eMwL]. Management should first confirm the diagnosis, adherence, and comorbidities [^11567J87], then use evidence-based strategies: switch antidepressant class, augment with atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine) [^111EzeEL] or lithium, or combine with bupropion or mirtazapine [^115ckRNH]; consider CBT or rTMS [^115wYXzQ] if pharmacotherapy fails, and reserve ECT for severe, psychotic, or catatonic cases [^112icXZK]. Early identification and **measurement-based care** [^11567J87] improve outcomes, but many patients remain symptomatic, underscoring the need for individualized, multidisciplinary care [^111YRew7].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

TRD is most commonly defined as **failure to achieve remission** [^115wYXzQ] after two separate antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration (typically 6–8 weeks) [^1111HenB] from different classes, with confirmed adherence. Partial response is a 25–50% symptom reduction, whereas nonresponse is less than 25% reduction [^113XpMPU].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical burden

TRD affects **10–30% of patients with MDD** [^11618xgQ] and is linked to higher relapse, suicidality, and functional impairment [^1117eMwL]. It also imposes substantial economic costs due to increased healthcare utilization and lost productivity [^116dYiUs].

---

## Factors contributing to treatment resistance

Several factors contribute to TRD, including:

- **Biological factors**: Genetic predisposition, neurotransmitter abnormalities, and neuroplasticity deficits [^115zZHWB].
- **Clinical factors**: Comorbid psychiatric disorders (anxiety, substance use), chronicity, severity, and residual symptoms [^114y49tA].
- **Treatment-related factors**: Inadequate dosing, short duration, poor adherence, and inappropriate antidepressant selection [^111AWheU].

---

## Evidence-based treatment strategies

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Switching antidepressants**: Switching to a different class (e.g. SNRI, TCA, MAOI) is a common strategy [^116QPGY7].
- **Augmentation strategies**: Adding atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine) [^111EzeEL], lithium, or thyroid hormone (T3) is supported by evidence [^112J5FPm].
- **Combination strategies**: Combining antidepressants with different mechanisms (e.g. SSRI + bupropion or mirtazapine) can improve response [^115ckRNH].

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT) are effective adjuncts [^113ieToV].
- **Neurostimulation**: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) [^11691DrY] and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are effective for severe TRD [^112icXZK].
- **Emerging therapies**: Ketamine and esketamine show rapid antidepressant effects in TRD [^111tKVfj].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach**, starting with optimization of current treatment, then switching, augmenting, or combining antidepressants, and finally considering neurostimulation or emerging therapies. Measurement-based care and regular monitoring are essential to guide adjustments [^11567J87].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

TRD has a poorer prognosis than non-resistant depression, with higher relapse rates, chronicity, and functional impairment [^116jwsSD]. However, with appropriate management, about 50% of patients achieve meaningful improvement, though sustained remission remains challenging [^116jwsSD].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on identifying biomarkers, personalized medicine, and novel therapeutic targets (e.g. glutamatergic modulators, psychedelics) [^111dqd4i]. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate durability, safety, and cost-effectiveness of emerging treatments [^notfound].

---

Treatment-resistant depression is a complex, multifactorial condition requiring a **comprehensive, stepwise approach**. Early identification, adherence verification, and evidence-based pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are key to improving outcomes. Despite advances, many patients remain symptomatic, highlighting the need for ongoing research and individualized care.

### Treatment-resistant depression [^1142LZDp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common clinical occurrence among patients treated for major depressive disorder. However, a clear consensus regarding the criteria defining TRD is lacking in the psychiatric community. Many patients who are considered treatment resistant are actually mis-diagnosed or inadequately treated. Clinicians need to accurately diagnose TRD by examining primary and secondary (organic) causes of depression and acknowledging paradigm failures that contribute to a misdiagnosis of TRD. A correct determination of what constitutes TRD requires consensus on criteria of treatment response (i.e., dose, duration, and compliance) and on the number of adequate trials required before a patient is determined to be nonresponsive. Additionally, clinical validation of available staging models needs to be completed. While several studies have identified predictors of non-response, clinical studies investigating the predictors of resistance following the failure of 2 or more antidepressant trials should be pursued. In managing TRD, 3 pharmacotherapy strategies are in clinical use: optimization of antidepressant dose, augmentation/combination therapies, and switching therapies. However, the optimal strategy for treating TRD has yet to be identified. Therefore, further controlled clinical trials are essential to identify the most effective treatment strategies.

### Using treatment algorithms for the effective management of treatment-resistant depression [^1129Kt9m]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Increasingly, clinicians are looking to evidence-based medicine for information about treatment options. Treatment algorithms have been used with a variety of psychiatric disorders to assist physicians in making treatment decisions. The direct, prescriptive nature of algorithms also makes them suitable for use in treatment-resistant depression. Two major projects, the Texas Medication Algorithm Project and Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, have begun to address the questions of sequenced treatment options. Future directions for algorithm development and implementation are discussed.

### Management of patients with treatment-resistant depression [^115UtnfY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression can be attributed to multiple causes, including nonadherence to medication and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Selecting the appropriate strategy for a patient with treatment-resistant depression, whether it be a single antidepressant, a combination of medications, or a nonpharmacologic method, depends on a correct determination of the cause of the patient's resistance to treatment.

### Treatment-resistant depression: prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies [^1117eMwL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Full symptomatic remission is the optimal outcome for patients with major depression. Unfortunately, initial antidepressant efficacy is limited to partial response for many patients. Incomplete remission of depressive symptoms is associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased functioning in work and social settings, and increased risk of suicide. Factors that increase the likelihood of treatment resistance include chronicity, severe symptomatology, and comorbid illnesses. Strategies to manage patients who do not respond to an initial course of antidepressant medication include optimizing the dose, switching antidepressants, or adding adjunctive treatment (ie, psychotherapy or a second medication). Augmentation may be the preferred strategy for improving response if tolerability to the original agent is acceptable and the initial medication has had some beneficial effects. Tracking patients' depressive symptoms with standardized measurement tools during the course of treatment is necessary for identifying incomplete remission and providing appropriate treatment modification.

### Using mechanism of action to choose medications for treatment-resistant depression [^111TamRB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Remission rates for depression continue to be low, and for many patients, complex treatment regimens are needed for optimal response. Many physicians do not fully understand how and why depression medications work or which ones will complement each other. This CME Webcast covers the different mechanisms of action of current pharmacotherapeutic options for depression, both monotherapy and adjunctive medications, and shows clinicians how to use their understanding of mechanisms of action to choose the most effective treatment strategy for their patients, especially those with treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression.

### Combining antidepressants for treatment-resistant depression: a review [^115ckRNH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Many patients with depression remain poorly responsive to antidepressant monotherapy. One approach for managing treatment-resistant depression is to combine antidepressants and to capitalize on multiple therapeutic mechanisms of action. This review critically evaluates the evidence for efficacy of combining antidepressants.

Method

A MEDLINE search of the last 15 years (up to June 2001), supplemented by a review of bibliographies, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to select studies included (1) published studies with original data in peer-reviewed journals, (2) diagnosis of depression with partial or no response to standard treatments, (3) any combination of 2 antidepressants with both agents used to enhance antidepressant response, (4) outcome measurement of clinical response, and (5) sample size of 4 or more subjects.

Results

Twenty-seven studies (total N = 667) met the inclusion criteria, including 5 randomized controlled trials and 22 open-label trials. In the 24 studies (total N = 601) reporting response rates, the overall mean response rate was 62.2%. Methodological limitations included variability in definitions of treatment-resistant depression and response to treatment, dosing of medications, and reporting of adverse events.

Conclusion

There is limited evidence, mostly in uncontrolled studies, supporting the efficacy of combination antidepressant treatment. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination antidepressant strategy for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### What alternatives to first-line therapy for depression are effective? [^115Bfngj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression is often a chronic illness that requires a methodical, long-term approach to manage it optimally. A single antidepressant trial is often insufficient for patients to achieve remission. Remission rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are about 30% to 35%. Using successive treatment steps with optimal medication dosing and making measurement-based treatment decisions can help patients achieve remission, but, at each step, remission is less likely than at the first step. Depression is considered treatment-resistant if 2 adequate trials of medication fail. Clinicians can use validated symptom checklists such as the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Sheehan Disability Scale to identify patients with treatment-resistant depression. Treatment resistance is likely in patients with a history of depressive chronicity and concurrent psychiatric and medical disorders and may be mistakenly suspected in patients who have had an inadequate trial of medication or who have been misdiagnosed. Strategies that can be effective to combat treatment resistance include optimizing treatment, switching to another antidepressant, combining antidepressants, and augmenting antidepressants with nonantidepressant treatments such as buspirone, lithium, liothyronine, atypical antipsychotics, or other agents. In addition, clinicians need to cultivate strong therapeutic alliances with patients, use objective measurements, practice evidence-based medicine, and educate patients about the disease and its treatments.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment. This article will review available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### Approach to diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression [^11567J87]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a chronic and recurrent illness that affects 20% of adults during their lifetime and is one of the leading causes of suicide in the United States. A systematic measurement-based care approach is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) by promptly identifying individuals with depression and avoiding delays in treatment initiation. As comorbidities may be associated with poorer outcomes to commonly used antidepressants and increase risk of drug-drug interactions, their recognition and treatment is an essential component of management of TRD.

### Depression: managing resistance and partial response to treatment [^115wYXzQ]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a nonantidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Treatment-resistant depression in adolescents: recognition and management [^115FtgSS]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of adolescents experience at least one depressive episode by the time they enter their adult years. For most adolescents, depression, although serious, either remits spontaneously or responds to treatment. For a smaller but significant proportion of adolescents, however, depression can be long-lasting and relatively unresponsive to initial treatment. In this article the authors provide an operational definition of treatment-resistant depression, identify factors associated with treatment nonresponse, describe an approach to the management of treatment-resistant depression, and advance suggestions for promising avenues of research.

### Using adjunctive treatments when first-line antidepressants fail [^112bwbGJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a common challenge for clinicians, as the majority of patients with depression do not achieve remission after an initial antidepressant trial. Major strategies for managing treatment-resistant depression include switching to another antidepressant or augmenting the initial antidepressant with another medication. Switching may be appropriate for patients experiencing little or no symptom relief or intolerable side effects with the initial antidepressant. For patients who experience partial response from the first-line antidepressant, adjunctive therapies avoid the loss of this response and the wash-out and cross-titration that are required when switching antidepressants. Several effective antidepressant augmentation agents are available, including lithium, thyroid hormone, anti-anxiety medications, and atypical antipsychotics. The evidence for the efficacy and risks of these strategies is discussed.

### To combine or not to combine? A literature review of antidepressant combination therapy [^115UgHAK]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Treatment resistant depression is a common clinical problem and a major public health concern. The use of antidepressant combinations to overcome treatment resistance, while somewhat controversial, is a popular strategy in practice. This paper reviews published trials on combination antidepressants with a view to inform clinical practice.

Method

A systematic but selective review of the published literature was conducted using EMBASE, PSYCHLIT and MEDLINE with relevant search terms.

Results

A number of trials suggesting efficacy of combination antidepressants were found. These are incorporated into a number of treatment guidelines for the management of treatment refractory depression. Clinicians should be cautious regarding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, including the serotonin syndrome, however combination strategies are an effective option.

Conclusions

Many antidepressants can be usefully combined especially if they engage separate mechanisms of action. Clinically, antidepressant combinations provide a useful resort in otherwise treatment resistant individuals. However, much further research is needed to determine relative efficacy and determine long term outcome.

### Issues in treatment-resistant depression [^11129XY9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease that imposes significant social and economic burdens not only on patients but also on society. Although various treatment options are available, treatment-resistant depression is common. Determining the exact prevalence of treatment-resistant depression is difficult because definitions vary, as do definitions of antidepressant response. Operational definitions of antidepressant response, nonresponse, partial response, and remission will be discussed in this article. Pharmacotherapy options for patients with treatment-resistant depression include augmentation, combination, and switching therapies; however, data from controlled clinical trials supporting these therapies are limited. Electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy offer additional treatment strategies. New nonpharmacologic therapies are under investigation. Remission is the goal of treatment.

### Management of treatment-resistant depression [^113bDUFL]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of evidence for treatment options that are consistently effective for TRD and the possibility that TRD is in fact a form of depression that has a low probability of resolving, how can clinicians help patients with TRD? Perhaps the most important conceptual shift that needs to take place before treatment can be helpful is to accept TRD as a chronic illness, an illness similar to many others, one that can be effectively managed but that is not, at our present level of knowledge, likely to be cured. An undue focus on remission or even a 50% diminution of symptoms sets unrealistic goals for both patients and therapists and may lead to overtreatment and demoralization. The focus should be less on eliminating depressive symptoms and more on making sense of and learning to function better in spite of them. It is important to acknowledge the difficult nature of the depressive illness, to remove blame from the patient and clinician for not achieving remission, to set realistic expectations, and to help promote better psychosocial functioning even in the face of persisting symptoms. The critical element when implementing such an approach is a judicious balance between maintaining hope for improvement without setting unrealistic expectations. It is important to reemphasize that following a disease management model with acceptance of the reality of a chronic illness is not nihilistic and does not mean the abandonment of hope for improvement. The first step in treating a patient with TRD is to perform a comprehensive assessment of the patient's past and current treatment history to ensure that evidence-based treatment trials have in fact been undertaken, and if not, such treatment trials should be implemented. If the patient continues to have significant residual symptoms, it is important to determine the impact is of these symptoms on the patient's quality of life and ability to function. It is also important to evaluate the factors that may be contributing to the persistence of depressive symptoms such as comorbid personality disorders, somatic disorders, substance abuse, and work and interpersonal conflicts. The treatment of patients with TRD needs to move beyond attempts to modify symptoms without taking into consideration and attempting to modify the patient's personality, coping skills, and social system. Further somatic treatment trials can be undertaken, if desired by the patient and therapist, as a small (5%–15%) percentage of patients may respond and further treatment trials, and this may engender hope. The risk with this approach is that patients and therapists may not work at disease management skills if they believe there may be a resolution of the depression if they could just find the right medication or intervention. Therapists may also feel pressured by patients, families, insurance companies, as well as their own sense of helplessness to escalate treatment in a more and more aggressive manner in an attempt to achieve an elusive remission. A disease management program can provide the therapist and patient with sufficient structure, skills, and goals to encourage ongoing treatment without resorting to unproven measures that may create more side effects and problems. It is particularly important to include the patient's significant others in the reformulation of the patient's problem and thereby learn how to manage the illness more effectively. Significant others and family members can be invaluable in providing support for dealing with the difficult process of acquiring a new skill set. Indeed, they spend significantly more time with the patient than does any therapist. Family members are likely to provide this kind of support only if they have been part of the assessment and treatment process. Patients with a wide range of chronic medical illnesses can and do learn to function effectively and to achieve a satisfying quality of life in spite of their illness. There is no reason to think that patients with TRD should not be able to achieve a similar level of illness management, functioning, and quality of life.

### Management of treatment-resistant depression: psychotherapeutic perspectives [^1144VxGJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a heterogeneous condition that occurs within a psychosocial milieu. The impact of prior pharmacologic interventions may have been adversely affected by a poor therapeutic alliance, low social support, life stress, or chronic adversity and cognitive or personality factors such as neuroticism or pessimism. This article considers the psychosocial factors that predispose to treatment-resistant depression and the psychotherapeutic principles thought to be helpful in both shorter- and longer-term treatment plans. We focus on the interpersonal, cognitive, and behavioral forms of treatment that constitute the depression-focused psychotherapies, which have been studied in major depressive disorder. Also discussed are modifications in treatment planning necessary to take into account the complexity of treatment-resistant depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111du1U9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

By using a more inclusive definition of early-stage TRD (non-response to one adequate course of antidepressant monotherapy), in addition to including psychological and combination treatments, we hope to strengthen the pooled evidence with a substantially greater number of studies and participants than previous meta-analyses of this topic.

The study aims to assess the impact of treatment intervention for patients with early-stage TRD. The objectives were to evaluate treatment improvement in depression, alongside acceptability and tolerability using pre-post treatment effects. Using pre-post effect meta-analyses, we were able to compare effectiveness estimates for heterogeneous treatment strategies and did not require a common comparator (e.g. placebo arm). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that pre-post ESs can estimate the magnitude of treatment effects appropriately, reflecting naturalistic clinical outcomes more closely and also take into account non-specific clinical effects.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113nxh5m]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many medications have proven efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD), but frequently and even with multiple medication exposures, they fail to improve MDD symptoms; one third of individuals do not achieve full symptomatic remission, and even fewer meet criteria for both symptomatic and functional remission. In individuals with ineffective initial treatments, even if subsequent treatments are effective, there is a very high relapse rate while continuing the treatment; for example, in the STAR*D trial, individuals who required more treatment steps had higher relapse rates (up to 71% after the fourth step).

'Incomplete response' is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but rather a continuum that ranges from partially responsive depression (PRD), to treatment-resistant depression (TRD), to 'multi-therapy-resistant MDD (MTR-MDD)', to 'refractory depression', which implies an absence of response to all currently available treatments. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus definitions around concepts such as PRD, TRD, and 'adequate' treatments. Moreover, guidelines on how to treat TRD/PRD, such as pharmacological augmentation, are not consistent, and evidence on effectiveness is sparse. This complicates the generalizability of results from research settings to the real-world, and hinders progress in this field, as there is no uniform population for clinical and biological investigations in TRD/PRD, including clinical trials for new or repurposed medications. Importantly, regulators acknowledge that response, partial response, and non-response exist on a continuum without universally accepted definitions, but nevertheless distinguish between these conditions; indeed, treatments for TRD and PRD already have accepted regulatory paths for drug approval.

### The hidden third: improving outcome in treatment-resistant depression [^112aucKL]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) presents many challenges for both patients and physicians. This review aims to evaluate the current status of the field of TRD and reflects the main findings of a consensus meeting held in September 2009. Literature searches were also conducted using PubMed and EMBASE. Abstracts of the retrieved articles were reviewed independently by the authors for inclusion. Evaluation of the clinical evidence in TRD is complicated by the absence of a validated definition, and there is a need to move away from traditional definitions of remission based on severity of symptoms to one that includes normalisation of functioning. One potential way of improving treatment of TRD is through the use of predictive biomarkers and clinical variables. The advent of new treatments may also help by focusing on neurotransmitters other than serotonin. Strategies such as the switching of antidepressants, use of combination therapy with lithium, atypical antipsychotics and other pharmacological agents can improve outcomes, and techniques such as deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation have shown promising early results. Despite consistent advances in the pharmacotherapy of mood disorders in the last decade, high rates of TRD are still a challenging aspect of overall management.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in treatment-resistant depression [^116JUvqC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of depressed patients show only partial or no response to antidepressants, and even among responders to antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are rather common. When depressions do not respond adequately to treatment with an antidepressant, clinicians may choose to keep the same antidepressant and add another "augmenting" compound. Such augmentation strategies involve the use of a pharmacologic agent that is not considered to be a standard antidepressant but may boost or enhance the effect of an antidepressant. Alternatively, clinicians may choose combination strategies, in which they combine the antidepressant that did not produce adequate response with another antidepressant, typically of a different class. There are only a few controlled clinical trials of these 2 strategies among patients with treatment-resistant depression or among patients who have only partially benefited from antidepressant treatment. Most of the time, clinicians' decisions are, therefore, guided by anecdotal reports, case series, and by some relatively smaller, uncontrolled clinical trials. These augmentation and combination strategies appear to be relatively safe and effective approaches to treatment-resistant depressions, although there is a relative paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. These strategies typically aim at obtaining a different neurochemical effect than the one obtained with the antidepressant that has not produced adequate response. While drug-drug interactions may limit the use of some of these strategies, the potential loss of partial benefit from the failed drug inherent in switching may increase the acceptability of augmentation and combination strategies among partial responders. Further studies are clearly needed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these different approaches in treatment-resistant depressions.

### Recognizing and assessing risk factors for difficult-to-treat depression and treatment-resistant depression [^112yqHSi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Many patients will not respond adequately to their initial trial of antidepressant medication or subsequent trials. By identifying features that can signal potential treatment-resistant or difficult-to-treat depression early in the course of illness, clinicians may be able to find the right balance of treatment strategies to help patients achieve remission. Here, follow the case of Alice, a 32-year-old lawyer with a treatment-resistant depressive episode.

### Evidence-based treatment strategies for treatment-resistant bipolar depression: a systematic review [^111wajMa]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Treatment resistance in bipolar depression is a common clinical problem that constitutes a major challenge for the treating clinician as there is a paucity of treatment options. The objective of this paper was to review the evidence for treatment options in treatment-resistant bipolar depression, as found in randomized controlled trials and with special attention to the definition and assessment of treatment resistance.

Methods

A Medline search (from database inception to May 2012) was performed using the search terms treatment resistance or treatment refractory, and bipolar depression or bipolar disorder, supplemented with 43 separate searches using the various pharmacologic agents or technical interventions as search terms.

Results

Only seven studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies examined the effects of ketamine (n = 1), (ar)modafinil (n = 2), pramipexole (n = 1), lamotrigine (n = 1), inositol (n = 1), risperidone (n = 1), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (n = 2).

Conclusions

The available level I evidence for treatment strategies in resistant bipolar depression is extremely scarce, and although the response rates reported are reassuring, most of the strategies remain experimental. There is an urgent need for further study in homogeneous patient samples using a clear concept of treatment resistance.

### Achieving remission and managing relapse in depression [^1125zSdF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although antidepressants are effective, no more than one third of the depressed patients who begin treatment achieve full remission within 8 weeks of therapy. Remission, defined as virtually complete relief of symptoms and return to full functioning in all areas of life, should be thought of as the optimal goal for the initial phase of treatment of depression. This goal is recommended because residual symptoms (i.e., response without remission) are associated with a myriad of risks, including a higher rate of relapse. When compared with monotherapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (i.e., the current first-line standard of care) strategies may improve remission rates. These strategies include using maximally tolerated (i.e., higher than usual) doses of medication, switching to an antidepressant thought to have more than one mechanism of action, combining dissimilar medications (to presumably treat a broader range of symptoms), and using a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Ensuring that patients are indeed adherent with treatment is also worthwhile before assuming that a treatment has failed.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for depression [^112J5FPm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression represents a common problem, with the vast majority of depressed patients showing incomplete response to antidepressant trials. Augmentation and combination strategies are commonly employed to address this problem, but there are few randomized, controlled studies to guide treatment choice. Indeed, some of the most common augmentation strategies in depression are those with the least controlled evidence. The popularity of bupropion, psychostimulants and atypical antipsychotics as augmentors may not be warranted by existing controlled studies, whereas two less commonly used augmentors-lithium and thyroid hormone- have substantial controlled evidence to support their use. This paper summarizes the state of the evidence for commonly used augmenting strategies and explores preliminary findings for more investigational approaches.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in resistant depression [^115edWSK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with depression achieves remission with first-line antidepressant treatment; consequently, a second medication is often added to enhance the effects of the initial agent. The second medication may or may not be another antidepressant. Clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of many agents commonly used for augmentation or combination therapy, but well-designed, large trials with a clear definition of treatment resistance are needed.

### Identifying difficult-to-treat depression: differential diagnosis, subtypes, and comorbidities [^117PK849]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common clinical presentation responsible for much of the burden of major depressive disorder worldwide. For this reason, TRD requires aggressive identification and management. Although several models have been proposed to describe TRD, consensus is still needed on the criteria (ie, dose, duration, compliance, number of trials required) used to define treatment response and resistance. When diagnosing patients with depression, clinicians should identify risk factors associated with treatment resistance, including clinical subtypes of depression and medical or psychiatric comorbidities that could affect the course of treatment. When evaluating a patient who has not responded to a first course of antidepressant treatment, the clinician should verify the primary diagnosis and ensure that the patient has adhered to a treatment regimen that was of adequate dose and duration.

### Electroencephalography in the diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression with comorbid epilepsy: a novel strategy [^115bicP8]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression, a common mental disorder, is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with a global prevalence ranging from 20% to 25% in women and 7% to 12% in men, and it has exhibited an increasing trend in recent decades.

Despite being known for decades, a consensus on the definition and diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is still lacking. A commonly accepted criterion requires a failure of at least two trials of antidepressant medications of adequate dosage and duration, given sequentially or in combination, to achieve a satisfactory response. The optimal duration of treatment for each trial is typically 4–6 weeks when the targeted dose is achieved. Non-response is defined as < 25% improvement on a standardised rating scale, and partial response is defined as > 25% but < 50% improvement. Treatment-resistant depression is a major contributor to premature mortality due to suicide and associated medical conditions. By standardising diagnostic criteria, researchers and clinicians will better understand the prevalence and characteristics of TRD, which can pave the way for developing effective treatment strategies.

Based on analysis of evidence from several studies that exhibit an existence of inherent and intrinsic reciprocal comorbidity between depression and epilepsy, the author believes that the categorisation of TRD based on the mere failure of two antidepressants could appear premature and erroneous. Therefore, in view of this analysis, this brief paper proposes a justified deliberation for revising the diagnostic criteria for TRD.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112Wjg3s]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment guideline — key questions and populations outline four key questions for individuals in each of the three age cohorts with major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or subsyndromal depression: the efficacy and risk of harms of psychotherapy or complementary and alternative medicine; the effectiveness and risk of harms of these treatments compared with one another or with pharmacotherapy; the effectiveness and risk of harms of combinations of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or complementary and alternative medicine compared with inactive or active single or combined treatments; and whether benefits and risks are moderated by subgroup characteristics including suicidal ideation, treatment-resistant depression, co-occurring anxiety disorders, or co-occurring personality disorders.

### Treatment-resistant depression [^116LpCpY]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Up to two thirds of patients with major unipolar depression will not respond to the first medication prescribed. Depression may be considered resistant to treatment when at least two trials with antidepressants from different pharmacologic classes (adequate in dose, duration, and compliance) fail to produce a significant clinical improvement. Evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychotherapy for treatment-resistant depression is limited. A recent high-quality trial found that patients who did not respond to citalopram and who received cognitive behavior therapy (with or without continued citalopram) had similar response and remission rates to those who received other medication regimens. Initial remission rates in that trial were 37 percent, and even after three additional trials of different drugs or cognitive behavior therapy, the cumulative remission rate was only 67 percent. In general, patients who require more treatment steps have higher relapse rates, and fewer than one half of patients achieve sustained remission. No treatment strategy appears to be better than another. Electroconvulsive therapy is effective as short-term therapy of treatment-resistant depression. There is no good-quality evidence that vagal nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for this condition.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^114J3HyZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding these limitations (and the points of uncertainties further discussed in the Appendix), this report offers clear and consistent definitions of TRD/PRD for regulatory clinical trials and for clinical and biological studies more broadly, agreed among a large group of experts including clinicians, academics, industry, regulatory agencies, and PWLE. Our ultimate ambition is to advance tailored treatments and a truly 'precision medicine' approach for MDD, which in turn will finally help to deliver better care for people suffering from this severely challenging illness, which remains too often ineffectively treated.

### The identification, assessment and management of difficult-to-treat depression: an international consensus statement [^111YRew7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many depressed patients are not able to achieve or sustain symptom remission despite serial treatment trials - often termed "treatment resistant depression". A broader, perhaps more empathic concept of "difficult-to-treat depression" (DTD) was considered.

Methods

A consensus group discussed the definition, clinical recognition, assessment and management implications of the DTD heuristic.

Results

The group proposed that DTD be defined as "depression that continues to cause significant burden despite usual treatment efforts". All depression management should include a thorough initial assessment. When DTD is recognized, a regular reassessment that employs a multi-dimensional framework to identify addressable barriers to successful treatment (including patient-, illness- and treatment-related factors) is advised, along with specific recommendations for addressing these factors. The emphasis of treatment, in the first instance, shifts from a goal of remission to optimal symptom control, daily psychosocial functional and quality of life, based on a patient-centred approach with shared decision-making to enhance the timely consideration of all treatment options (including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, neurostimulation, etc.) to optimize outcomes when sustained remission is elusive.

Limitations

The recommended definition and management of DTD is based largely on expert consensus. While DTD would seem to have clinical utility, its specificity and objectivity may be insufficient to define clinical populations for regulatory trial purposes, though DTD could define populations for service provision or phase 4 trials.

Conclusions

DTD provides a clinically useful conceptualization that implies a search for and remediation of specific patient-, illness- and treatment obstacles to optimizing outcomes of relevance to patients.

### Enhancing outcomes in the management of treatment resistant depression: a focus on atypical antipsychotics [^114MurXs]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical trials indicate that over 50% of depressed patients show an inadequate response to antidepressant therapy, and that incomplete recovery from major depressive disorder (MDD) increases the risk of chronicity and recurrence. Recovery, complete remission of symptoms, and a return to baseline psychosocial function, should be the goal of therapy. Poor response to adequate antidepressant treatment has been termed treatment resistant depression (TRD). Issues such as adherence, missed diagnosis of psychotic depression, bipolar disorder, or comorbid anxiety must be investigated as reasons why patients have not responded to initial therapeutic strategies. Beyond ensuring optimal use of the index antidepressant, treatment strategies for TRD include switching to another antidepressant, and augmentation or combination with two or more agents. Since little comparative data exist it is important to consider side-effect burden, partial response, and previous medication history when deciding between strategies. In patients with TRD, adding or augmenting with lithium, tri-iodothyronine or atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated benefits. Augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and quetiapine, show promising results in terms of improving remission rates. Other interventions, including non-pharmacologic strategies and investigational physical treatments, have demonstrated some benefits, but availability and patient preference should also be considered. With today's therapeutic alternatives, full remission of depression is an attainable goal. For some patients, combination and augmentation strategies earlier in treatment may increase the likelihood of remission.

### New approaches to managing difficult-to-treat depressions [^111AWheU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

In a sense, all depression is difficult to treat. Most depressions are episodic conditions that, not infrequently, are slow to fully remit. Most also are complicated by comorbid psychiatric and general medical disorders. However, a minority of such difficult-to-treat depressions are treatment resistant. The most common cause of initial treatment failure is not resistance but undertreatment-that is, an insufficient duration of treatment, a subtherapeutic dosage of antidepressant, and/or poor adherence to the prescribed regimen. Complicating factors such as undiagnosed hypothyroidism or substance abuse can result in apparent treatment resistance unless addressed. Challenging subtypes of illness, including psychotic and bipolar subtypes of depression, are not necessarily inherently refractory but must be met with modified treatment approaches.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111tKVfj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment (augmentation/combination) is recommended for the ~50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

Methods:

We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

Results:

In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9 weeks (range 5 days to 18 months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73) and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a not inconsiderable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's (aripiprazole, (es)ketamine, mirtazapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). We report marked heterogeneity between studies for almost all analyses.

Conclusions:

Our findings support cautious optimism for several augmentation strategies; although considering the high prevalence of TRD, evidence remains inadequate for each treatment option.

### Experimental medication treatment approaches for depression [^116DtpAG]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Antidepressant efficacy: a review of current standards and challenges

How effective are antidepressants in treating patients with MDD? Data from STAR*D — the largest comparison trial, to date, of antidepressant effectiveness among agents from different classes — support the use of antidepressants in patients with MDD, as there was a cumulative 67% response rate after all four steps of the study. Furthermore, in an analysis that was independent of the STAR*D data set, Gibbons et al. found an estimated response rate of 58.4% (versus 39.9% for placebo) to antidepressants. Indeed, antidepressants can be helpful to many patients.

However, antidepressant monotherapy alone may not always be enough to treat depression. Towards this end, augmentation strategies with other classes of medications can be a useful option. For example, a meta-analysis of antipsychotic efficacy in 16 trials (n = 3480) found that adjunctive atypical antipsychotics significantly outperformed placebo as treatment strategies for depression response and remission (though their use is associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events). Quetiapine and aripiprazole are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as adjunctive therapies for the treatment of depression, while olanzapine/fluoxetine combination therapy is approved for patients with treatment-resistant depression (as per the FDA definition ⩾2 failed treatments). Furthermore, ziprasidone was recently found to significantly outperform placebo in patients with depression (n = 139) with regard to reductions in depression scores (as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Similarly, 8-week adjunctive use of the atypical antipsychotic cariprazine 2–4.5 mg per day (n = 276) was effective for treating depression in patients with refractory disease compared with cariprazine 1–2 mg per day (n = 274) or placebo (n = 269). Drug tolerability was favorable, adding to its potential promise for treatment-resistant depression.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^115f9K6T]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications

Clarifying effective treatment for patients with treatment-resistance in primary care is key, as these patients are a common group that suffer from poorer quality of life, are harder to manage and utilize substantial healthcare resources. When depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur, they represent a more severe end of the population of depressed people. This is reflected in the baseline characteristics of participants in our high generalized anxiety group (GAD-7 ⩾16) who had higher baseline depression, rates of suicidal ideation and rates of struggling financially in addition to lower quality of life measures.

These results add support to existing evidence that mirtazapine is a useful treatment in managing generalized anxiety in those with depression. Additionally, this analysis suggests the possibility that this use of mirtazapine in those with severe generalized anxiety may improve both depressive symptoms and social functioning. This result was achieved by the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI, a strategy previous trials did not examine. These findings suggest a possible path to selectively targeting the addition of mirtazapine based on comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms when first-line treatment fails. This is in line with existing expert-consensus-based guidance on the use of mirtazapine in those with anxiety-predominant depression.

Conversely, these findings did not find any evidence for adding in mirtazapine in those without generalized anxiety symptoms, who have failed to respond to first-line antidepressant therapy. This is important, given the increase in prescriptions of antidepressants, to identify groups where antidepressants fail to work, in addition to those in whom they might be effective.

### Comparative effectiveness research trial for antidepressant incomplete and non-responders with treatment resistant depression (ASCERTAIN-TRD) a randomized clinical trial [^114v1EXr]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MDD is a serious, debilitating, life-shortening illness that affects many persons of all ages and backgrounds. A particularly critical decision in everyday practice is choosing what to do next when patients with MDD present after antidepressant treatments have failed to produce a clinical response, and a large evidence gap exists with respect to this common clinical scenario. There are many augmentation and switch options to choose from for patients with TRD, each of these with varying degrees of evidence. As discussed in a review on the integrative management of TRD, the authors conclude that two pharmacotherapeutic options have accrued the most evidence for efficacy from well-controlled studies of TRD patients: switching to an antidepressant of a different class and augmenting the antidepressant with atypical antipsychotics. Despite both augmentation with atypical antipsychotic agents and switching to a different antidepressant class having well-established efficacy, strikingly, there has never been a direct comparison of them for TRD.

To date, aside from the atypical antipsychotic agents, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and esketamine, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents the only other modality approved for use in MDD patients who have not responded to antidepressant therapy. rTMS has been extensively studied for MDD (29 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)), as well as in TRD specifically (18 RCTs), including as augmentation, with an evidence-base greater than for almost any other intervention for TRD save for the atypical antipsychotic agents (21 RCTs). The results of a meta-analysis showed rTMS to be efficacious in MDD and in TRD, with equivalent efficacy when delivered as monotherapy or augmentation. There is also accumulating evidence for the durability of the antidepressant effect of rTMS in clinical practice.

In summary, TRD remains a significant challenge for clinicians and patients alike, and further research is needed to help improve both the standard of care and the outcome for patients with TRD. A critical evidence gap exists with respect to whether pharmacological or non-pharmacological augmentation is superior to antidepressant switch, or vice-versa. An additional evidence gap exists with regards to our limited knowledge as to which US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved augmentation versus switch strategies to employ. Our proposal was designed to address these evidence gaps by comparing two FDA-approved treatments for patients with TRD, namely augmentation with atypical antipsychotics versus augmentation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), with one of the commonly used strategies for TRD: switching to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) venlafaxine extended release (XR) or duloxetine.

### Real-world evidence from a European cohort study of patients with treatment resistant depression: treatment patterns and clinical outcomes [^11618xgQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment resistant depression (TRD) characterizes a subgroup of 10–30% of patients with major depressive disorder, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. A consensus treatment for TRD does not exist, which often leads to wide variations in treatment strategies. Real-world studies on treatment patterns and outcomes in TRD patients in Europe are lacking and could help elucidate current treatment strategies and their efficacy.

Methods

This non-interventional cohort study of patients with TRD (defined as treatment failure on ≥ 2 oral antidepressants given at adequate dose and duration) with moderate to severe depression collected real-world data on treatment patterns and outcomes in several European countries. Patients were started on a new treatment for depression according to routine clinical practice.

Results

Among 411 patients enrolled, after 6 months, only 16.7% achieved remission and 73.5% showed no response. At Month 12, while 19.2% achieved remission and 69.2% showed no response, 33.3% of those in remission at Month 6 were no longer in remission. Pharmacological treatments employed were heterogenous; 54 different drugs were recorded at baseline, and the top 5 treatment types according to drug classes accounted for 40.0% of patients. Even though remission rates were very low, at Month 12, 60.0% of patients had not changed treatment since enrolment.

Conclusions

The heterogeneity of treatments highlights a lack of consensus. Moreover, despite low response rates, patients often remained on treatments for substantial periods of time. These data further support existence of an unmet treatment need for TRD patients in Europe.

### Augmentation with aripiprazole or bupropion, or a switch to… [^115UZSty]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best pharmacologic approach in adults 60 years and older with treatment-resistant depression. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 69 years, 67% were women, and the mean PHQ-9 score was 16. The primary outcome was patient-reported symptoms based on the Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction subscales of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Emotion Battery. Remission was defined as a score of 10 or lower on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. It was an open-label randomized trial with two phases. In the first phase, 618 participants were randomized into one of three groups for 10 weeks: aripiprazole augmentation bupropion augmentation, or switching from their current medication to bupropion, 150 to 450 mg daily.

At baseline, self-reported symptom scores were 33. 2 to
33. 7 points. At 10 weeks, the improvement in symptom scores was 4. 83 points for aripiprazole augmentation,
4. 33 points for bupropion augmentation, and 2. 0 points for switching to bupropion. Rates of remission were 28. 9%,
28. 2%, and 19. 3%, respectively. Improvement in the MADRS scores followed a similar pattern. The authors make much of the fact that the difference between aripiprazole augmentation and the switch to bupropion was statistically significant, whereas the difference between bupropion augmentation and the switch to bupropion was not, although numerically and clinically, the results were similar for both kinds of augmentation. In phase 2, patients who did not achieve remission were randomized to 10 weeks of lithium augmentation.

The improvement in the MADRS score was 4. 6 points with lithium augmentation and
5. 3 points with the switch to nortriptyline (.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117VTy5M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 12%. MDD imposes a substantial burden of illness and is the leading cause of disability internationally. The most common treatments for MDD are broadly classified as pharmacological or psychological, with a multitude of different treatments from each category available.

A significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatment(s) and are considered 'treatment resistant'. Although there is no universally accepted definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the most frequently used criterion is the failure to respond to two trials of pharmacological therapy of adequate dose and duration, in the current episode. Less commonly, failure of psychological therapies is also considered to contribute towards the definition of treatment resistance. The most widely used staging model of TRD is the Thase and Rush model. In this model, failure to respond to one adequate antidepressant trial from a major antidepressant class is considered Stage I TRD, and those who then do not respond to a second adequate antidepressant trial (from a different class than the antidepressant used in Stage I) are termed Stage II TRD. There are variations between measures, studies and groups in terms of requiring a second antidepressant to be from a different class, however. It has been suggested that permitting two 'failed' treatments from within a class, and permitting psychological treatments, should be incorporated in updated definitions of Stage II TRD.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116ggtVb]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review was pre-registered (PROSPERO: CRD42018117366) and is described in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The full search and extraction strategy is described below. Studies were included based on the following a priori eligibility criteria:

Study designs

We included RCTs that assessed at least one augmentation or combination treatment (with sample sizes of 10 or more). To avoid duplication of data, where multiple manuscripts described one RCT, the eligible comparison with the largest sample size was included.

Participants

Adults (aged ⩾18 years old) with MDD who had failed to remit despite at least one adequate antidepressant monotherapy trial were included. MDD was defined using either validated rating scales (e.g. the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;) or operationalised diagnostic criteria (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;). In keeping with previous meta-analyses, we considered an adequate antidepressant trial to be at least 4 weeks of treatment at recognised minimum-effective doses (where available). Inadequate response to both pharmacological and psychological therapies was permitted, consistent with previous meta-analyses on this subject and in keeping with standardised staging of TRD. RCTs in which the participant population contained ⩾10% of patients with diagnoses of either bipolar or psychotic depression were excluded because of accepted differences in treatment approaches.

### Examination of the utility of psychotherapy for patients with treatment resistant depression: a systematic review [^113ieToV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the utility of psychotherapy in managing treatment resistant depression.

Data Sources

PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, article bibliographies.

Review Methods

Eligible articles had to be in English and include English-speaking adult outpatients from general medical or mental health clinics. Studies had to be randomized clinical trials (RCT) involving at least one of the following psychotherapy modalities: cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, or behavior therapy. Patients were considered treatment resistant if they reported partial or no remission following treatment with an adequate antidepressant dose for ≥ 6 weeks. Exclusion criteria included receiving psychotherapy at the time of recruitment, and/or comorbid psychiatric conditions unlikely to be treated outside of specialized mental health care (e.g., severe substance abuse). Due to heterogeneity in study designs, a summary estimate of effect was not calculated. Studies were critically analyzed and a qualitative synthesis was conducted.

Results

Of 941 original titles, 13 articles evaluating 7 unique treatment comparisons were included. Psychotherapy was examined as an augmentation to antidepressants in five studies and as substitution treatment in two studies. A total of 592 patients were evaluated (Mean age ~40 y; Females = 50–85%; Caucasians ≥ 75%). The STAR*D trial used an equipoise stratified randomization design; the remaining studies were RCTs. Compared to active management, two good quality trials showed similar benefit from augmenting antidepressants with psychotherapy; one fair quality and one poor quality trial showed benefit from psychotherapy augmentation; and one good and one poor trial found similar benefit from substituting psychotherapy for antidepressants. One fair quality trial showed lithium augmentation to be more beneficial than psychotherapy.

Conclusions

Review demonstrates the utility of psychotherapy in managing treatment resistant depression. However, evidence is sparse and results are mixed. Given that quality trials are lacking, rigorous clinical trials are recommended to guide practice. In the interim, primary care providers should consider psychotherapy when treating patients with treatment resistant depression.

### What are the comparative benefits and harms of augmentation treatments in major depression? [^114VJXjM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients do not experience sufficient response to their initial antidepressant medication. Augmentation strategies, particularly the use of atypical antipsychotics to augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have proliferated over the last 15 years, and 2 atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole and quetiapine, have received US Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression. Alternatively, data in treatment-resistant depression exist for most of the atypicals and for other treatments, including lithium, bupropion, methylphenidate, pindolol, and buspirone.

### Risk factors for treatment resistance in unipolar depression: a systematic review [^115zZHWB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment resistant depression is a complex disorder and an important source of morbidity and mortality. Identification of risk factors of resistance may be useful to improve early recognition as well as treatment selection and prediction of outcome in patients with depression.

Methods

The aim of this paper was to review the current status of knowledge regarding risk factors of treatment resistance in unipolar depression, in patients who failed to respond to at least two successive and adequate antidepressant treatments.

Results

Systematic literature search yielded 8 publications exploring clinical and biological factors. Specific psychiatric comorbidities, psychosocial factors, clinical characteristics of the depressive episode and biological markers emerge as possible risk factor for treatment resistant depression.

Limitations

Due to the lack of objective definition and diagnostic criteria for treatment resistant depression, and the paucity of reports on risk factors, our review only summarized a small number of studies.

Conclusion

Future investigations of risk factors should help to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance in mood disorders and contribute to improve their therapeutic management.

### Difficult-to-treat depressions: a primary care perspective [^113nn4t9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Depression is common in primary care and more difficult to treat than many clinicians are aware. The goal of treatment is symptomatic remission, and by current estimates 50% or more of patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy may suffer from residual neurovegetative, cognitive, and somatic symptoms. Bipolar disorder, in particular, is more prevalent in primary care than previously recognized, is easily misdiagnosed, and may be a significant source of treatment failure. This article reviews treatment resistance, its causes, and management approaches. Many strategies are straight-forward and within the skill set of primary care clinicians. The use of antidepressants with multiple mechanisms of action may reduce first-order resistance. Antidepressant augmentation strategies (e.g., with lithium or atypical antipsychotics) are often very effective and readily instituted by informed and motivated practitioners.

Type of medications

Different classes and mechanisms of action

The EMA mentions that the two treatment failures could be with medications of "same or different class". Other guidelines, including the FDA guidance, do not make this distinction. Interestingly, the concept of 'different mechanisms' may overlap with 'different classes', although the pharmacological overlap between classes and mechanism of action is not absolute; the Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN) for psychotropic agents has greatly contributed to clarify this issue. Moreover, there are some geographically-relevant label limitations to the usage of some medications (see also Appendix).

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 75%) that, to define TRD, the two antidepressant treatment failures should be with two established (licensed) medications for MDD of different mechanisms of action. The two treatments could be separated by a drug free period (and there is failure to both), prescribed sequentially (switching, with failure to both), or one is prescribed as augmentation to the other (because of the first drug failing, and with the augmentation also failing).

Moreover, we also recommend (with moderate consensus, 78%) that a failed course of psychotherapy should not be included as one of the previous treatments required for the definition of TRD/PRD, but this information should be reported for staging (see below). Notably, this recommendation does not have implications for the role of psychotherapies in the treatment of TRD, and, similarly to other TRD models proposed, we support the use of psychotherapies as a treatment strategy for TRD in clinical practice.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^1111HenB]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent reviews usually define failure to respond as "lack of decrease in depressive severity of at least 50%" (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). The report from the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression identifies resistance as less than 50% symptom reduction (Bartova et al. 2019). Although reports do not consistently agree on a definition of adequate dose and duration, the minimum duration cited is typically 4 weeks (Gaynes et al. 2018), and the range of 4–12 weeks (Ng et al. 2019). This expert panel proposes the following criteria for initial treatment resistance (Table 3).

Table 3
Operational definition suggested for the initial stage of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD)

The treatment failure component of the definition of TRD revealed a diversity of opinions among experts based on conflicting data on the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and the benefits of using antidepressants from different groups in managing TRD. There exists mixed evidence regarding the advantages of prescribing medications from the same class or different classes and therefore this study deliberately did not explore this (Bschor et al. 2018; Carvalho et al. 2014). The other area of consideration is how the failure of an antidepressant trial is defined. On one hand, failure of two antidepressants can mean nonresponse during the initiation of treatment, but the failure of an antidepressant may also occur during the maintenance phase of treatment with the relapse of a depressive episode following a remission despite being on adequate doses of medication. The mechanism of tachyphylaxis remains unclear and continues to be under investigation (Targum, 2014). Given the multifactorial etiology for medication failures, these considerations further warrant a dimensional approach to define TRD and clarify the heterogeneity of this population.

### Defining treatment-resistant depression [^113vrr12]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Varying conceptualizations of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have made translating research findings or systematic reviews into clinical practice guidelines challenging and inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a review for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to clarify how experts and investigators have defined TRD and to review systematically how well this definition comports with TRD definitions in clinical trials through July 5, 2019.

Results

We found that no consensus definition existed for TRD. The most common TRD definition for major depressive disorder required a minimum of two prior treatment failures and confirmation of prior adequate dose and duration. The most common TRD definition for bipolar disorder required one prior treatment failure. No clear consensus emerged on defining adequacy of either dose or duration. Our systematic review found that only 17% of intervention studies enrolled samples meeting the most frequently specified criteria for TRD. Depressive outcomes and clinical global impressions were commonly measured; functional impairment and quality-of-life tools were rarely used.

Conclusions

Two key steps are critical to advancing TRD research: (a) Developing a consensus definition of TRD that addresses how best to specify the number of prior treatment failures and the adequacy of dose and duration; and (b) identifying a core package of outcome measures that can be applied in a standardized manner. Our recommendations about stronger approaches to designing and conducting TRD research will foster better evidence to translate into clearer guidelines for treating patients with this serious condition.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^112Vu4PK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of augmentation strategies for TRD using the definition of two failed treatments (FTs) identified only 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological therapies for qualitative synthesis, of which only 27 were suitable for network meta-analysis. Similar results were reported in a previous meta-analysis, using the same inclusion criteria. Only three psychological trials were identified. High pre-post effects were evident across several interventions, albeit in the presence of high between-study heterogeneity. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-targeting agents, which are not included as first-line augmenters in treatment guidelines, elicited higher effect sizes (ESs) than other classes and with lower heterogeneity.

However, this TRD definition does not capture the large proportion of clinical trials of adjunctive treatments in MDD that utilise an inclusion criterion of non-response to one adequate treatment in the current episode. This is clinically significant as non-responders to first-line treatment are at increased risk of non-response to subsequent treatments and poorer long-term functional outcomes. Moreover, in large pragmatic trials, such as STAR*D, approximately one in every two patients with MDD do not respond to initial antidepressant treatment. Therefore, they represent a large, clinically important population in whom further study of treatment efficacy is necessary. Additionally, to our knowledge, ketamine treatments have not been subjected to meta-analysis in this population of individuals with early-stage TRD. We acknowledge that there are various considerations being made around the terminology used to refer to this population of people. The most common name still in use here is Stage I of the Thase and Rush model of treatment resistance. However, neither this nor other validated staging models incorporate non-response to psychological therapies in their definitions, despite there being arguments in favour of this. In order to mirror the substantial previous research using the term 'TRD' but to differentiate this article's definition from TRD defined as non-response to two therapies, we henceforth use the term 'early-stage TRD' in reference to a non-response to one adequate pharmacological or psychological therapy for depression. Although we use the term early-stage TRD, which we believe does describe a clinically important and distinct group, we do not suggest that this cohort necessarily follows a linear progression into Stage II TRD.

### Current treatments used in clinical practice for major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression in england: a retrospective database study [^114QDM8n]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic recurrent or episodic psychiatric illness that can be successfully treated with oral antidepressants, yet one-in-three patients do not respond to currently-available treatments. According to the FDA and EMA, patients are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) when their MDD fails to respond adequately to ≥ 2 successive antidepressants in a single episode.

Aims

To describe current clinical management of patients with MDD and TRD in England, including treatment strategies and referral to secondary mental healthcare.

Method

A retrospective cohort study of adult patients identified in primary care with diagnosed MDD, including a TRD subgroup (≥ 2 treatment failures as determined by treatment dynamics) was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD primary care database linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Mental Health Services Data Set data (Protocol 19_019R).

Results

41,375 patients with MDD (mean age 44yrs, 62% female, median follow-up 29mths); and 1,051 (3%) patients with TRD were identified. Mean time-to-TRD was 18 months. Most patients (> 99%) received first-line antidepressant monotherapy. Following TRD criteria being met, antidepressant monotherapy use remained most frequent from TRD first-line (70%) to fifth-line (48%). Dual/triple antidepressant use remained constant (range:24%-26%), while augmented antidepressant use increased from TRD first-line (7%) to third-line (17%). Minimal non-pharmacological therapies were observed.

Conclusions

Despite current clinical guidelines recommending a stepwise approach, many patients frequently cycle through numerous antidepressants with similar mechanisms of action and efficacy. These findings indicate a high unmet need for new treatments that improve outcomes in these patient populations.

### Defining treatment-resistant bipolar depression: recommendations from the ISBD task force [^1125Jtv4]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although there are approved and guideline‐recommended medications for bipolar depression, a significant unmet need remains in effectively addressing its treatment. Achieving improvement often necessitates the use of multiple drug classes in combination; yet this approach does not always guarantee clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms.

Indeed, approximately 25% of patients experience treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (TRBD), defined by severe, persistent depressive symptoms unresponsive to standard treatments. TRBD is characterized by significant heterogeneity, influenced by factors such as genetic predisposition, bipolar subtype distinctions, rapid cycling course, cognitive impairments, and increased suicide risk. Comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions, including anxiety, substance use disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease, further compound this complexity, resulting in diverse depressive phenotypes and challenges in achieving uniform therapeutic responses. Some authors have argued that clinical formulation is a pragmatic way to individualize treatment in such circumstances.

Similar to treatment‐resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), no universal and validated definition of TRBD exists. This absence complicates prevalence estimates and hinders the development of precise treatment strategies.

A consensus definition of TRBD is essential for several reasons. It would provide a basis for reliable diagnosis, enable interpretable research results, and ensure uniformity in clinical trials and regulatory submissions. Such standardization could also improve estimates for research and development (R&D), facilitate clinical decision‐making, and inform reimbursement policies. Furthermore, defining TRBD with clinical and predictive validity could support the development of innovative therapeutic interventions tailored to individual patient profiles.

Recognizing these challenges, the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Task Force on TRBD was established. The Task Force aims to refine the definition of TRBD, identify mechanisms underlying treatment resistance, develop evidence‐based guidelines for clinicians, researchers, regulators, and the industry, and promote research into novel therapeutic approaches. This report focuses on establishing a clear definition of TRBD and providing initial evidence‐based management recommendations. While the Task Force's mandate includes broader aims (e.g. identifying biological mechanisms and promoting novel therapies), the present manuscript addresses the definition and clinical consensus recommendations as a foundational first step. This consensus document represents a foundational step in achieving these objectives and aims to provide a clear and actionable definition of TRBD for clinical trials while recognizing the ongoing need to address the intricate realities of TRBD in everyday clinical settings.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116apAE7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential sources of variability not examined

Although we examined TRD severity as a dichotomous factor for its potential to influence treatment efficacy, we were neither able to look in detail at the different approaches used to assess treatment resistance (e.g.vs Massachusetts General Hospital staging models), nor we categorised studies employing a sequential design or prospective open-label standardised treatment to determine TRD. Relatedly, we did not examine the severity or chronicity of patients' depressive episodes as potential effect modifiers on clinical outcome.

There are several other factors confounders, which could have impacted ESs. These include blinding (and indeed incidences of unblinding), allegiance effects or statistical methods, as well as the extent of the likely efficacy expectation effect, recruitment sources of patients, trial-specific eligibility criteria and generalisability (clinical or demographic) and treatment delivery. It is important to note that these effect modifiers may even differ between treatments (e.g. newer interventions being subject to different methodologies than older interventions). In traditional between-subjects meta-analyses, these factors are largely accounted for, within each study, by the direct group comparisons. Our comparison of within-subjects ES' between treatments does not account for this study-to-study variability directly.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^111CTPbt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations and conclusions

While we discuss many points of debate in the Appendix, here we want to acknowledge the main limitations of this report.

First, the recommendations are based on experts' and stakeholders' clinical and professional judgement, supported by research and clinical evidence, but without any hard and objective validation. Second, our recommendations try to strike a balance between being 'too broad' and being 'too narrow', with the aim to identify 'clinically homogenous' samples, based on a pragmatic and non-aetiologically-based approach; still, we cannot exclude that significant phenotypic or biological heterogeneity is present within the defined TRD/PRD samples, and future research will allow to define this inherent variability, if any, in clinical features, biomarkers, and clinical response. Third, the opposite risk is also present: that we define groups so narrowly that the findings are not generalisable to the larger population of PWLE in clinical settings, and do not translate into better care; however, maintaining narrow definitions may help avoiding overmedicalisation and may prevent the lowering of the threshold above which treatments which are specific for TRD are offered to patients, as a recent commentary on this topic highlighted.

In terms of theoretical limitations, some of our contributors have argued that the proposed TRD/PRD definitions are unhelpful from a clinical and a conceptual perspective, as they arbitrarily apply thresholds on a continuum, and are influenced by the different healthcare systems. Moreover, TRD and PRD concepts are based upon a conceptualisation of depression as an episodic illness with good inter-episode recovery, while many individuals with MDD have a chronic illness with waxing and waning course; this might create difficulties when trying to accurately identify the beginning and end of the current/previous episodes, in order to define response to the antidepressants. Finally, we recognise that, according to our recommendations, individuals with MDD with an ineffective (< 25%) single antidepressant trial are not defined as either TRD or PRD; as in standard clinical practice, these subjects should be prescribed a second antidepressant before a decision can be made on their TRD status.

### Switching treatments for complicated depression [^116REw2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients will not experience remission when treated with a first-line antidepressant. As a next-step strategy for patients who achieve partial response to the initial antidepressant, clinicians may opt to augment the first antidepressant with another medication or combine it with a second antidepressant. For nonresponders or for patients experiencing intolerable side effects, clinicians may choose to switch medications. Switching can be done within the same drug class to obtain different pharmacologic properties, or to another class to obtain a different neurochemical effect. Switching appears to be fairly well tolerated and effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and preferences.

### Predictors of response to augmentation treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression: a systematic review [^116NyV1K]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant depression is an important contributor to the global burden of depression. Antidepressant augmentation is a recommended treatment strategy for treatment-resistant patients, but outcomes remain poor. Identifying factors that are predictive of response to augmentation treatments may improve outcomes.

Aims

This review aimed to synthesise the existing literature examining predictors of response to augmentation treatments in patients who had insufficiently responded to initial treatment.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted identifying 2241 unique manuscripts. 24 examining predictors of outcome to pharmacological or psychological augmentation treatment were included in this review.

Results

Atypical antipsychotics were the most frequently assessed treatment class (nine studies), closely followed by mood stabilisers (eight studies). Only one eligible psychological augmentation study was identified. Early response to treatment (week 2) was the best-supported predictor of subsequent treatment outcome, reported by six studies. Many predictor variables were only assessed by one report and others such as pre-treatment severity yielded contradictory results, both within and across treatment classes.

Conclusions

This review highlights the importance of early response as a predictor of pharmacological augmentation outcome, with implications for both the monitoring and treatment of resistant unipolar patients. Further replication is needed across specific interventions to fully assess the generalisability of this finding. However, the clear lack of consistent evidence for other predictive factors both within and across treatments, and the scarce examination of psychological augmentation, demonstrates the need for much more research of a high quality if response prediction is to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

Data were extracted by 3 of us (L.B.R. J.K. L.S.M.) and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data were confirmed by 1 of us (B.D.M.J.). Variables extracted included demographic characteristics, methodologic data, clinical/outcome data, and placebo-specific data. The demographic characteristics were age and sex. Methodological data included treatment strategy (augmentation vs monotherapy), multicenter setting, length of the trial (calculated as number of days for double-blind treatment), number of treatment arms, year of publication, trial design (ie, whether the trial used open-label prospective treatment to determine treatment resistance before double-blind randomization), and whether the trial was industry sponsored (defined as being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company or a medical device manufacturer). Randomized clinical trials funded by the US Department of Veterans Affairs; government agencies, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research or National Institute of Mental Health; nonprofit foundations, such as National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia & Depression, or Brain & Behavior Research Foundation; or hospitals or universities were not considered to be industry sponsored. Clinical/outcome data comprised treatment modality, sample size, mean (SD) scores of depression rating scales at baseline and end point in both the placebo and active groups, number of responders/remitters (as defined by the individual studies), number of failed antidepressant trials, past depressive episodes, and length of the current episode. Placebo-specific data included route (eg, oral vs parenteral) of administration and number of days receiving placebo. This variable was calculated by determining how many days during the trial period participants would receive placebo or sham intervention.

### Clinical features of treatment-resistant depression [^114y49tA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

As many as 30% to 40% of patients with major depressive disorder are unresponsive to a trial of antidepressant medication. Many patients labeled with treatment-resistant depression actually have pseudoresistance, in that they have been inadequately treated or are misdiagnosed. Others may have unrecognized comorbid psychiatric or general medical conditions that contribute to treatment resistance. Variables such as gender, family history, age at onset, severity, and chronicity have also been evaluated as possible risk factors for treatment-resistant depression. This article reviews the current literature regarding the clinical characteristics of treatment-resistant depression, with particular attention to the relevance of these factors for clinical decision making.

Introduction

Depression is one of the most devastating human conditions. In the Unites States alone, the economic burden attributed to major depressive disorder (MDD) increased by over 21% from 2005 to 2010; this cost is representative of the combination of direct effects, suicide-related expenditures and workplace costs. Several reasons may explain this sharp uptick in costs in a short period of time: an increase in both the population of the United States as well as in the prevalence of MDD; an increase in the costs of treatments; changes in the composition and quality of treatment services; and changes in the rates of employment and treatment-seeking behaviors. Without a doubt, the discovery of treatments to combat depression is essential.

Though there are several classes of approved antidepressant treatments for depression — including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors — about a third of patients do not respond to these medications. Even when patients do respond to available treatments, the effects often take weeks to months to meet their full potential. Furthermore, treatment-resistant depression (a form of depression that does not respond to one or more antidepressant treatments of adequate dose and duration) is severe and, in some cases, debilitating. For example, 17% of patients with treatment-resistant depression have a prior suicide attempt, underscoring the severe nature of this disease. In addition to lost productivity and poorer quality of life, in the United States alone, it is estimated that treatment-resistant depression costs nearly $50 billion annually. These reasons underscore the critical need for rapid and novel therapies for treatment-resistant depression.

After a brief review of the efficacy of standard antidepressants, we will discuss the status of experimental antidepressant therapeutics. The mechanism by which many of these novel antidepressants are thought to work represents a departure from traditional antidepressants (which may affect their antidepressant actions primarily through the modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission). Specifically, new medications that modulate the glutamatergic system are at the forefront of antidepressant research and development.

### What role do atypical antipsychotic drugs have in treatment-resistant depression? [^1157HQkk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in the treatment of depression, many patients fail to respond to treatment with adequate dose and duration. Multiple therapeutic approaches are available for the treatment of patients not responding to standard antidepressant medication. These include switching medication or combination and augmentation strategies. A substantial number of patients do not respond to multiple treatment trials. These patients suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and represent a challenge to the treating physician. There have been a growing number of reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmenting agents in nonpsychotic TRD. Second-generation antipsychotics are less likely to provoke parkinsonian side effects. It has also been reported that these agents produce lower rates of tardive movement disorders than traditional neuroleptics. Furthermore, second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-2A/2C antagonists, possibly allowing them to improve the efficacy and some aspects of the side effect profile of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Weight gain and sedation are likely to be the most common adverse events of such combined therapy. In a recent controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was combined with fluoxetine therapy in an 8-week, double-blind clinical trial in patients with TRD. This combination drug therapy demonstrated clinical efficacy on several rating scales and showed rapid onset of action. Although more studies will be required to confirm and extend these findings, the results suggest that there may be a clinical benefit to combining atypical antipsychotics with SSRIs in nonpsychotic TRD.

### Finding treatment-resistant depression in real-world data: how a data-driven approach compares with expert-based heuristics [^1122h4YG]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Depression is associated with substantial morbidity, heathcare cost, mortality and family burden (Kessler, 2012; Rush et al. 2006b), and affects 5% to 8% of the adult US population annually (Blazer, Kessler, McGonagle, & Swartz, 1994; Cepeda, Stang, & Makadia, 2016; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005; Pratt & Brody, 2008).

No single treatment for depression is universally effective and sequential interventions are often needed (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2016; Rush et al. 2006b). About 20% of those receiving treatment do not achieve remission, while 50% have no response at all (Trivedi et al. 2006). Relapse rates increase with increases in the number of treatments required (Rush et al. 2006a). When a patient does not respond to multiple therapeutic courses of antidepressant medications, the patient is classified as having treatment‐resistant depression (TRD).

Changes since protocol registration

It was originally planned for data from all included studies to be extracted independently by paired authors and then discrepancies assessed. However, considering the large number of included studies, the protocol was amended so that data were extracted by one author, and then independently reviewed for accuracy by a second author. This was decided in order to complete the review in a timely manner, so that the findings accurately reflected the current evidence base. For this reason, pairwise meta-analyses were also not undertaken. Due to the increased heterogeneity in previous analyses of class- and modality-level analyses (see), these were not undertaken. Due to the number of studies and extent of heterogeneity between included study methodologies, the planned subgroups of depression severity, comorbidities, episode duration, continuation treatments and treatment setting were not ultimately considered in analyses.

### Suicide risk management for the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression study: applied NIMH guidelines [^111sv2ZL]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

NIMH guidelines to manage subjects who are suicidal during their participation in clinical trials include a full range of procedures to minimize suicidal risk, yet no reports to date have shown how researchers should best implement these guidelines. The architects of the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) study operationalized and implemented the NIMH guidelines by developing a comprehensive set of procedures to detect, monitor, and manage suicidal subjects during a large, complex, multisite clinical trial. Because of the large size of the study (anticipated n = 4000), the wide geographic distribution, the large number of treating STAR*D clinicians, the broad array of subjects with psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and the focus on treatment-resistant depression, along with the complexity of multiple treatment steps and randomization points in STAR*D, the risk of suicide, safety monitoring of suicidal subjects presented a unique challenge. This paper describes methods derived from the NIMH guidelines used to manage suicidal risk in STAR*D including the use of an interactive voice response system to alert clinicians, regional center directors, and safety officers.

3 RESULTS/DISCUSSION

Results are presented as a logical sequence of essential questions and answers to assist with clinical and research utility. Each item contains a body of evidence‐based literature review and the experts' consensus opinions. The consensus results are complemented by the experts' comments. Table 2 presents the summary of the 27 items which reached consensus from this group of experts.

Table 2
Summary of statements from the modified Delphi methodology

3.1 Is TRD a useful concept?

The concept of TRD captures clinical reality since it reflects a large clinical population with a common clinical outcome. It is not a new concept as the term has been utilized by the mental health community since the 1970s. Historically, it has survived over more than 4 decades and has periodically attracted more attention every time a new potentially effective treatment emerges.

As with any concept, however, TRD does not perfectly fit the clinical variability of real‐life cases. Each of the two major components of the concept, response and treatment, has inherent limitations when it comes to individual responses. For instance, the line between response and nonresponse is clouded by partial responders, fully refractory cases and those with very different sets of symptoms and heterogeneity of treatment resistance (Malhi & Byrow, 2016). The treatment component is often characterized as treatment adequacy and may be difficult to assess due to the variability of treatment options, the match between treatment and sets of symptoms, or the presence of comorbid conditions and psychosocial factors.

Despite the imprecision of the concept of TRD, the expert panel reiterated its usefulness both for clinical practice and research. In the first round of the survey, 92% felt that TRD is a meaningful concept and 85% of respondents use a TRD definition in their clinical practice. All (100%) respondents indicated that an operational definition of TRD was needed. A definition for TRD helps clinicians to become aware of the persistence of depression in individual cases in a timely fashion and to foresee potential treatment challenges and consider more effective interventions.

### Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with chronic, treatment-resistant depression: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^113RZaTM]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Major depressive disorder is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (Lopez, Mathers, Ezzati, Jamison, & Murray, 2006). Despite evidence‐based treatments, about 20% of all depressed patients develop a chronic course (Kessler et al. 2003), typically defined as a period of 2 years or longer of depressive symptoms (DSM‐IV‐TR, 2000). Chronic depression not only affects the personal life of a patient, but is also associated with high costs for society in terms of health care costs and workplace losses (Pincus, 2001). Unfortunately, a large number of chronically depressed patients do not respond to treatment (Torpey & Klein, 2008). Therefore, novel treatment strategies for this severely ill population are much needed (Cuijpers, Huibers, & Furukawa, 2017).

Surprisingly, no unified definition of treatment‐resistant depression exists. Staging methods to measure treatment resistance mostly focus on the number of biological treatment steps (Trevino, McClintock, Fischer, Vora, & Husain, 2014). In line with these staging methods, most clinical trials define a depressive episode as treatment‐resistant if two or more trials with antidepressant medication were unsuccessful (Rush, Thase, & Dubé, 2003; Trevino et al. 2014). However, this definition conflicts with multidisciplinary treatment guidelines (NICE, 2009), which state that depressed patients with moderate to severe symptoms should receive a combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments. Therefore, a new staging method to measure treatment resistance was developed, which is termed as the "Dutch Measure for quantification of Treatment Resistance in Depression" (DM‐TRD) (Peeters et al. 2016). In contrast to previous staging methods (Fekadu, Wooderson, Donaldson, et al. 2009; Fekadu, Wooderson, Markopoulou, & Cleare, 2009; Petersen et al. 2005; Souery et al. 1999; Thase & Rush, 1997), the DM‐TRD not only focuses on biological treatments but also includes evidence‐based psychological treatments. For these reasons, we have chosen to apply the criteria of the DM‐TRD for treatment resistance in the current study.

### The burden of disease for treatment-resistant depression [^112dVNgz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Assessing the consequences of specific diseases on global, national, and individual levels is complex. The Global Burden of Disease Study was launched in 1992 to develop objective measures of the burden of disease. Two measures have become widely accepted: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) assesses years of life lost due to a disease plus years lived with the disability due to that disease, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is a related measure with greater relevance for diseases that do not routinely produce earlier mortality. When DALYs and YLDs were compared world-wide for 100 disorders, they revealed a huge burden of disease for depression. Indeed, the findings were startling. Neuropsychiatric conditions are by far the world's leader in YLDs, accounting for almost 30%. Unipolar major depressive disorder alone accounted for 11% of global YLDs. The disability of major depressive disorder produces its greatest burden upon women and starts early in life. No separate disability assessments have been compiled for treatment-resistant depression, but of individuals with major depressive disorder, the most severely disabled are those with treatment-resistant depression. The contributions to the morbidity associated with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression include widespread prevalence; relatively early symptom onset; severe underdiagnosis and undertreatment; genetic vulnerabilities and precipitation or accentuation by relatively unavoidable stressors; a longitudinal pattern of frequent recurrences with increasing frequency, severity, and consequences unless treated with maintenance strategies; inadequate prioritization of recurrence prevention among clinicians; and possible suppression of brain neurogenesis, neuronal atrophy, cell death, hippocampal dysfunction, and magnetic resonance imaging changes for those with chronic treatment-resistant depression. Since the patterns of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increasing severity of treatment-resistant depression are key reasons for its high burden, reducing the burden requires an entire paradigm shift, including emphasis on the prevention of recurrences. Only then will this prevalent, disabling yet treatable disorder lose its ignominious status as a world leader in disease burden.

### The interface of depression and diabetes: treatment considerations [^112BJn76]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

This state-of-the-art review explores the relationship between depression and diabetes, highlighting the two-way influences that make treatment challenging and worsen the outcomes of both conditions. Depression and diabetes often co-occur and share genetic, lifestyle, and psychosocial risk factors. Lifestyle elements such as diet, physical activity, and sleep patterns play a role on the development and management of both conditions, highlighting the need for integrated treatment strategies. The evidence suggests that traditional management strategies focusing on either condition in isolation fall short of addressing the intertwined nature of diabetes and depression. Instead, integrated care models encompassing psychological support and medical management are recommended to improve treatment efficacy and patient adherence. Such models require collaboration across multiple healthcare disciplines, including endocrinology, psychiatry, and primary care, to offer a holistic approach to patient care. This review also identifies significant patient-related barriers to effective management, such as stigma, psychological resistance, and health literacy, which need to be addressed through patient-centered education and support systems. Future directions for research include longitudinal studies in diverse populations to further elucidate causal relationships and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets, as well as the effectiveness of healthcare models aimed at preventing the onset of one condition in individuals diagnosed with the other.

### Definition of treatment-resistant depression-Asia pacific perspectives [^113qC9oG]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The lack of uniformity in the definition of treatment resistant depression (TRD) within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region may have implications for patient management. We aimed to characterize the most commonly used TRD definition in selected APAC countries.

Methods

A systematic literature review of TRD definitions in APAC countries was conducted in Medline and Embase (2010–2016) and conference proceedings (2014 and 2016). TRD guidelines (APAC, Europe regional, US, or international) were also searched. An expert-panel explored APAC nuances in TRD definitions to achieve consensus for a regional-level definition.

Results

Ten guidelines and 89 studies qualified for study inclusion. Among the studies, variations were observed in definitions regarding: number of antidepressants failed (range: ≥ 1 to ≥ 3), classes of antidepressants (same or different; 59% did not specify class), duration of previous treatments (range: 4–12 weeks), dosage adequacy, and consideration of adherence (yes/no; 88% of studies did not consider adherence). No TRD-specific guidelines were identified. The emerging consensus from the literature review and panel discussion was that TRD is most commonly defined as failure to ≥ 2 antidepressant therapies given at adequate doses, for 6–8 weeks during a major depressive episode.

Limitations

Few studies provided definitions of TRD used in daily clinical practice, and a limited number of countries were represented in the included studies and expert panel.

Conclusion

Attaining consensus on TRD definition may promote accurate, and possibly early detection of patients with TRD to enable appropriate intervention that may impact patient outcomes and quality of life.

TRD and PRD definitions

What is lack of response?

A treatment response in MDD is defined by a reduction of at least 50% in MDD severity on a standardised rating scale (see below); 'lack of response', encompassing both TRD and PRD, is the mirror image of this definition, that is, less than 50% reduction in depression severity. TRD is further associated, in most definitions, with the 'classic criteria' of lack of response to at least two medications at an adequate dose and duration (see below). There is, however, much variability around the definition of TRD. In a recent systematic review, Brown et al. reported that, out of 155 TRD definitions identified in the published literature, 48.4% specified at least two sequential treatment failures as a requirement. In an even more recent systematic review, Gaynes and colleagues found that only 37% of intervention studies in TRD had enrolled individuals with MDD meeting the criteria of at least two failed antidepressants, and only 19% had also described failure to adequate doses and durations of treatments. In fact, the most common definition for TRD in intervention trials involved a minimum of only one previous failed treatment (48%). Thus, the majority of studies on TRD do not seem to use the 'classic criteria', making it difficult to pool or compare data across these TRD studies. Not surprisingly, there was a strong consensus (98%) for our first recommendation that a definition of TRD for clinical trials conducted for regulatory purposes is necessary.

Operational criteria for TRD and PRD

Based on a number of guidelines and other expert documents, in this report we adopt the definition of TRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of less than 25% in MDD severity to at least two antidepressants, and of PRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of between 25% and < 50% in MDD severity to at least one antidepressant. This should ideally be established using prospective psychometric assessments, or at least using clinical interviews and health records to measure retrospectively the improvement in depression severity (see below).

The majority of experts, even though with moderate consensus (85%), recommended the importance of this distinction between TRD and PRD for randomized clinical trials for new treatments, especially because of the potential advantage of separating these individuals for different types of randomized controlled trials (for example, switching for TRD vs. augmentation for PRD).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^116DgY3w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Progressing towards optimised evidence-based guidelines

Our demonstration of (es)ketamine being well-studied with high efficacy adds to the current literature indicating the potential for being upgraded in guidelines. It is not currently recommended as a first-line augmentation strategy in major national/international guidelines. Its highest position is in the MPG where it is considered a second-line choice, but some (older) guidelines do not recommend this yet (e.g.).

Likewise, bupropion appears effective and well-studied in early-stage TRD (albeit with marked heterogeneity), but is only regarded as a first-line pharmacological augmenter by one of the ~10 major national/international guidelines (MPG). Furthermore, its efficacy, safety and tolerability in MDD have been reasonably demonstrated. Monotherapeutic bupropion is not currently licenced for MDD in some countries (e.g. UK); therefore, we would cautiously recommend that the licencing status of bupropion in the UK be reconsidered.

Finally, despite a general paucity of evidence overall for psychological therapies, the ES of CBT was greater than for other treatments and although CBT is recommended in national guidelines for treating MDD, it is rarely specifically recommended as a therapy for TRD. Given the results presented in this work, we suggest reconsideration of this position.

In summary, in this large synthesis of augmentation and combination treatments of pharmacological and psychological treatments for TRD, we find both pharmacological and psychological therapies show larger treatment effects than placebo. Our findings firstly support lithium, aripiprazole and quetiapine as current first-line augmenters for TRD; our findings do not show support for brexpiprazole over these agents, although it is a second-line augmenter in some guidelines. We urge large-scale investigations of understudied agents showing promise, including modafinil, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy. Finally, we hope that our findings are considered in updating treatment guidelines, particularly in the potential for upgrading (es)ketamine, CBT, mecamylamine and bupropion. We acknowledge, however, that our findings are not free from methodological problems and considerable heterogeneity remains between studies for most treatment approaches, in addition to an enduring overall relative paucity of evidence for monotherapy-resistant depression.

### Depression: managing resistance and partial response… [^117UWGSc]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology Depression is among the most common psychiatric disorders in the United States. Major depressive disorder has a 12-month prevalence of 10% and a lifetime prevalence of 21%, with an average onset at 30 years of age. 1 Only about one-third of patients respond to an initial trial of a first-line antidepressant medication, and a significant proportion of patients will not respond despite multiple interventions. 2 Although it lacks a universal definition, treatment-resistant depression is most commonly defined as absence of remission using validated scoring tools despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications at adequate dose, duration, and adherence. 3, 4 This definition, however, does not account for partial response to treatment, which is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. When applied to treatment, these often overlapping criteria can make comparing and synthesizing studies difficult.

### Predictors of clinical response after rTMS treatment of patients suffering from drug-resistant depression [^111o48SD]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, is a brain-stimulation technique developed in the 1980s for the purpose of electrophysiological exploration. Technical progress has allowed this technique to evolve towards stimulation for therapeutic purposes, particularly in psychiatry. The effectiveness of stimulation of the right prefrontal cortex at low frequency or the left prefrontal cortex at high frequency for the treatment of depressive disorders and the clinical tolerance were established in the early 2000s. As a result, rTMS has been recommended for the management of drug-resistant episodes (Food and Drug Administration; 2008 and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments; 2009). European recommendations mention an efficacy of 30 to 64% (Grade A recommendation) but are unsure about its place in the therapeutic strategy for depression.

Indeed, in clinical practice, the first-line treatment for depressive disorder (excluding bipolar disorder) is still the use of antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)), alone or in combination with psychotherapy. Their effectiveness is between 40 and 50%, depending on the criteria used. However, a poor response to antidepressant therapies is one of the risk factors for developing chronic depression. The management of such resistant depressive episodes is, therefore, an important issue. The therapeutic strategy in situations of nonresponse to the first line of treatment is still unclear, as is the strategy after failure of the second line of treatment.

rTMS may represent an alternative by providing a clinical response for people in depressive episodes confronted with the failure of pharmacological antidepressant treatment. Given the time of action of antidepressants (clinical response after 3 weeks), as well as the duration of rTMS treatment (clinical effect at 2 or even 3 weeks), it is necessary to identify factors that can predict the success of the treatment in advance and more effectively guide therapeutic choices. Such factors are mentioned in the literature and can be divided into two main categories: "patient-related" factors and those "related to the characteristics of the depressive episode itself ".

Among patient-related factors, data in the literature on the efficacy of rTMS according to the age or gender of the patients are discordant. Indeed, a better response to rTMS treatment has been observed in young individuals (< 45 years), whereas other studies have found no correlation with age (< or > 65 years). In addition, female gender may be a factor in the positive response to treatment, but has been shown in only one isolated study.

### Treatment resistance in psychiatry: state of the art and new directions [^1147pkF5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

As mentioned above, there is also some evidence that high doses of certain antidepressants (e.g. venlafaxine) or antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine) can be effective strategies in the management of treatment resistant depression and schizophrenia respectively. In the case of venlafaxine, there is evidence that increasing the dose beyond 150 mg/day results in a greater effect on noradrenergic neurotransmission. This approach is most in keeping with disease model 1 of treatment resistance detailed above (Fig. 5A), although it should be recognised that, at higher doses, drug actions at other receptors may become more important.

In terms of neuro-stimulatory treatments, the FDA has approved use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of MDD in patients who have failed to achieve 'satisfactory improvement from one prior antidepressant medication'. However, it is unclear if such a definition reliably describes true treatment resistance (see 'Current definitions of treatment resistance across disorders' section above), and the FDA warns that efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation has not been established in patients with 'varying degrees of medication resistance'. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has widespread regulatory approval for treatment resistant depression and mania. The mechanism by which ECT effects response where medication has been unsuccessful remains poorly defined, but may stem from alterations in cerebral blood flow and regional metabolism. This novel mechanism of action is in keeping with disease model 2 of treatment resistance detailed above (Fig. 5B).

### The STAR*D project results: a comprehensive review of findings [^116jwsSD]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial enrolled outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder treated prospectively in a series of randomized controlled trials. These were conducted in representative primary and psychiatric practices. Remission rates for treatment steps 1 to 4 based on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-report were 37%, 31%, 14%, and 13%, respectively. There were no differences in remission rates or times to remission among medication switch or among medication augmentation strategies at any treatment level. Participants who required increasing numbers of treatment steps showed greater depressive illness burden and increasingly greater relapse rates in the naturalistic follow-up period (40%-71%). Prognosis was better at all levels for participants who entered follow-up in remission as opposed to those who entered with response without remission. These results highlight the prevalence of treatment-resistant depression and suggest potential benefit for using more vigorous treatments in the earlier steps.

TRD: treatment-resistant depression.

Characteristics of included studies

The characteristics of included studies can be found in. A total of 21,172 participants were included from 115 studies in the narrative synthesis. The mean sample size was 184 participants (median = 80, range = 13–1011). Definitions of TRD varied across studies, frequently using less strict criteria, that is, 68 studies (61%) allowing participants with as few as one FT to be enrolled as TRD. A further 12 (11%) of studies defined TRD as two FTs with either or both lasting less than 6 weeks, whilst only 32 (29%) of included studies met/exceeded the standard criteria for treatment resistance (two FTs in the current episode for a minimum of 6 weeks). Only 7% (n = 8) studies specifically stated that the two sequential treatments had to be from different antidepressant classes. Severity, or stage, of treatment resistance is included in.

The median study duration was 6 weeks, with a mean of 9 weeks and a range of 5 days to 18 months. Most included studies took place in North America (53%), with Europe and Asia also well represented (21% and 15%, respectively). Approximately 10% of included studies took place across multiple continents, with North America and Europe the most frequent combination. There was a paucity of data from South America, with only two studies (2%) taking place there (both in Brazil), and no studies taking place in Africa.

Study participant characteristics

Of the studies reporting participant age (n = 111), the mean study age was 46 years (SD = 6), with a range of 28–74. Sex was reported in 106 of the included studies, with the proportion of female participants ranging from 16% to 85% (mean = 63%, SD = 12%).

### Challenges and algorithm-guided treatment in major depressive disorder [^113N598u]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is complicated and difficult to treat, primarily because of its chronic and recurrent nature and the poor efficacy of most pharmacologic treatment options. Until more effective treatments become available, clinicians must focus on optimizing patient outcomes through patient care. Implementing measurement-based care and using treatment algorithms can reduce symptoms of depression and help patients achieve and maintain remission.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^115ewQdW]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3 What is the operational definition for initial treatment resistance?

On the basis of the most recent systematic review, no agreed‐upon dichotomous definition exists for TRD (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). Although experts often agree on a requirement for two treatment failures, they do not agree on the definition for the adequacy of either dose or duration or outcome measures. Definitions do not regularly incorporate failure with regard to augmentation agents (Vaccarino & Kennedy, 2020). Besides differences in criteria, none of the definitions of TRD have been systematically examined for reliability and predictive value utility (GRADE‐high; Gaynes et al. 2018; Souery et al. 2006). In reviewing the STAR*D reports, one can clearly see that the crucial point at which the risk of treatment resistance markedly increased was after two treatment failures (Rush, Trivedi, Wisniewski, Nierenberg, et al. 2006).

Future directions

This section makes recommendations that are not immediately applicable to clinical trials and highlights research gaps and new opportunities identified throughout the consultative process. Future trial sponsors may wish to incorporate one or more of these areas to expand the knowledge base. A more detailed discussion of these points is presented in the Appendix; here, we want to emphasise the main recommendations:
Future research should recognize and target different clinical phenotypes of TRD (and PRD) underpinned by a specific biological mechanism (strong, 100%).
For future research, diagnostic and history-taking instruments should be implemented in clinical cohorts and electronic health records, to allow a reliable, comprehensive, and multidimensional evaluation of the PWLE (strong, 100%).
Currently, no biomarker has been validated in clinical practice or in clinical trials to identify subjects with TRD (and PRD), or to further stratify them; however, collection of biological samples for subsequent subgroup or stratified analyses is recommended (moderate, 91%).
Preferences, perspectives, and reported outcomes of PWLE should be included in future TRD (and PRD) diagnostic tools and outcome measures (strong, 100%).
The usefulness of adherence assessment using blood levels or other methods (also in a run-in period) should be assessed through research, before deciding whether it should be implemented in future clinical trials (moderate, 92%).

### Major depressive disorder: understanding the significance of residual symptoms and balancing efficacy with tolerability [^112GrDhr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is a complex and frequent psychiatric condition that poses significant challenges to both the patients who experience it and the physicians who treat them. The goal of therapy is for patients to achieve remission, which requires identifying and measuring symptoms at the outset and throughout treatment to document both response and resistance to treatment. A number of validated instruments are available both for diagnosis of and response to treatment. Many factors affect a patient's ability to achieve remission, but although many patients do achieve remission, a significant number continue to have residual symptoms that cause functional impairment.

Methods

Review of the literature for treatment of major depression, including mechanisms of action, individualized treatment optimization, residual symptom reduction, and minimization of side effects.

Results

For sustained remission, all symptoms must be treated until they are undetectable. Patients who do not achieve remission after adequate treatment trials should be evaluated for adherence to treatment, as well as comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders. In these cases, consideration should be given to changing therapy by switching, combining, or augmenting initial therapy, as well as referring some patients to a psychiatrist for treatment with specialized modalities. Linking symptoms with malfunctioning brain circuits and neurotransmitters provides a targeted approach for achieving sustained remission. Neurobiology also provides a rational basis for combination therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression, because it can aid selection of different drugs with different mechanisms of action or of multifunctional/multimodal antidepressant drugs that target more than 1 molecular mechanism.

Discussion

Recent advances and better understanding of neurobiology provide a rational basis for individualizing treatment of patients with major depression.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112NwbFk]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Older adult depression — prevalence and course is marked by high inpatient rates, frequent relapse, and treatment resistance. Prevalence is reported as higher still (10%-42%) among older patients in inpatient settings, including long-term care. Subthreshold depression is 2–3 times more common than major depression in older adults, and 8%-10% of those with subthreshold symptoms develop major depression each year. The clinical presentation in older adults differs from earlier life by following a relapsing and recurrent course, and depression is often treatment resistant, with partial response linked to continuing disability, caregiver burden, and elevated risk for early relapse and recurrence.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^116Wk65d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and partially responsive depression (PRD) as subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD) are not unequivocally defined. In the present document we used a Delphi-method-based consensus approach to define TRD and PRD and to serve as operational criteria for future clinical studies, especially if conducted for regulatory purposes. We reviewed the literature and brought together a group of international experts (including clinicians, academics, researchers, employees of pharmaceutical companies, regulatory bodies representatives, and one person with lived experience) to evaluate the state-of-the-art and main controversies regarding the current classification. We then provided recommendations on how to design clinical trials, and on how to guide research in unmet needs and knowledge gaps. This report will feed into one of the main objectives of the EUropean Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatforms, Innovative Medicines Initiative (EU-PEARL, IMI) MDD project, to design a protocol for platform trials of new medications for TRD/PRD.

### The cost consequences of treatment-resistant depression [^116dYiUs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Context

Treatment-resistant depression is a significant public health problem with profound effects on general medical and mental health-related health care costs.

Objective

To describe health care costs of patients with treatment-resistant depression as their illness progresses, in terms of pharmaceutical and medical expenditures, and to identify factors associated with increasing degrees of treatment resistance.

Data Sources

The MEDSTAT MarketScan Private Pay Fee for Service (FFS) Database, a medical and prescription claims database covering over 3.5 million enrollees, from 1995–2000.

Design and Study Subjects

7737 patients with depression (ICD-9) who had 2 or more unsuccessful trials of antidepressant medication at an adequate dose for at least 4 weeks from 1995–2000 were defined as treatment-resistant in this study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed for these patients with treatment-resistant depression. The number of changes in depression medication treatment regimens was used as a proxy for increasing degrees of treatment resistance and its severity. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in health care expenditures associated with increasing degrees of treatment-resistant depression.

Results

Total depression-related and general medical health care expenditures increased significantly as treatment-resistant depression increased in severity. Multivariate analyses of patient demographic characteristics were not associated with ongoing treatment resistance. Disease severity, type of antidepressant at index, comorbid mental health disorders, and membership in a managed health care plan were associated with increasing degrees of treatment resistance.

Conclusions

Depression and general medical health care expenditures increase with the degree of treatment-resistant depression. Disease management interventions for treatment-resistant depression that result in sustained remission early in the course of illness are most likely to be cost effective.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^114bPo8Z]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression the largest cause of disability globally. Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together and the patient burden and complexity increases when both are present. Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with poorer chances of response to treatment, increased severity of depression and increased chance of suicide. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressants prescriptions increasingly yearly, with 67.5 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions on relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis, while a small study has shown promising anti-depressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder.

These trials did not, however, examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.

There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines around treating depression with comorbid anxiety. Most evidence-informed guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not offer any specific advice on treating comorbid psychiatric conditions or preferred augmentation agents. This issue is recognized by a recent guideline from the French Association for Biological Psychiatry: "Although the issue of comorbidity is recognized by evidence-based guidelines, few specific recommendations are provided regarding acute treatment with antidepressant drugs". This guideline, based on expert consensus, suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, NbN: SERT) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, NbN: SERT and NET) as first-line therapy for depression with any comorbid anxiety disorder, with mirtazapine recommended as a possible second-line agent.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. IV. neurostimulation therapies [^11691DrY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008–2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is renewed interest in refined approaches to brain stimulation, particularly for treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Neurostimulation Therapies" is one of 5 guidelines articles.

Results

Among the four forms of neurostimulation reviewed in this section, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has the most extensive evidence, spanning seven decades. Repetitive transcranial magnetic (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been approved to treat depressed adults in both Canada and the United States with a much smaller evidence base. There is also emerging evidence that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for otherwise treatment resistant depression, but this is an investigational approach in 2009.

Limitations

Compared to other modalities for the treatment of MDD, the data based is limited by the relatively small numbers of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and small sample sizes.

Conclusions

There is most evidence to support ECT as a first-line treatment under specific circumstances and rTMS as a second-line treatment. Evidence to support VNS is less robust and DBS remains an investigational treatment.
