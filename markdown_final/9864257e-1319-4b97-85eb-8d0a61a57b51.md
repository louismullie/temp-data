## Question

Hep A AB Nonreactive

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "Hep A AB Nonreactive" means and how to interpret and act on this test result. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the test actually measures and which antibody class it detects. Then, I should verify the clinical meaning of a nonreactive result. Next, I will consider important exceptions such as very early infection, immunocompromise, and assay limitations. After that, I should outline practical next steps, including when to vaccinate and when to add IgM testing. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable interpretation and recommendation, making sure I anchor each point to guideline-based sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misinterpret the result. "Hep A AB" typically refers to total anti-HAV antibodies, which capture both IgM and IgG. In routine clinical use, a nonreactive total anti-HAV essentially reflects absence of detectable IgG anti-HAV, indicating no evidence of prior infection or vaccination-induced immunity, whereas a reactive total anti-HAV in a symptomatic patient should prompt reflex IgM testing to distinguish acute from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv].

> Now, I should interpret the result. A nonreactive Hep A AB means the patient is susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection. They have neither prior natural infection nor vaccine-induced immunity, and therefore are not protected from future HAV exposure [^114URhTh] [^114XqR4G].

> Wait, let me verify important exceptions before concluding. Very early acute infection can be antibody-negative during the pre-symptomatic incubation period, so if there is a compelling recent exposure and compatible symptoms, I should add IgM anti-HAV testing rather than relying on total antibody alone; false negatives are uncommon but possible in this window, and IgM becomes detectable within about 5–10 days of symptom onset in most cases [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv]. I also need to check for immunocompromised states, where serologic responses can be blunted; in such patients, if clinical suspicion is high, repeating serology or considering HAV RNA may be reasonable, though routine RNA testing is not standard for HAV diagnosis in immunocompetent hosts [^114URhTh] [^113HNQCv]. Finally, I should double-check assay performance near the immunity threshold; while modern assays are highly specific, borderline titers can occasionally be misclassified, so clinical context remains paramount [^116tpYDs].

> Next, I should review what to do clinically. If the patient is nonreactive and lacks documented prior vaccination, I should offer HAV vaccination according to ACIP recommendations, prioritizing children, persons with HIV, those with chronic liver disease, travelers to endemic regions, MSM, persons who use drugs, and persons experiencing homelessness, among others. Prevaccination serologic testing is not routinely required and should not delay vaccination in settings where access is challenging [^115QMYy7] [^115UG5jo] [^114XqR4G]. Hold on, I should verify postvaccination testing needs; routine postvaccination serology is unnecessary for most, but it is recommended in immunocompromised persons, including those with HIV, to confirm seroconversion and guide revaccination if needed [^114Qfvvn] [^1169TaxZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is symptomatic with jaundice, dark urine, or elevated aminotransferases and the total anti-HAV is nonreactive? I should not stop there; I need to add IgM anti-HAV to evaluate for acute HAV, because total antibody alone cannot diagnose acute infection and IgM is the marker that confirms it when clinically suspected [^115nEEUF] [^116Qf8FR] [^114URhTh].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. "Hep A AB Nonreactive" means the patient is susceptible to hepatitis A and should be vaccinated unless contraindicated; it does not exclude very early infection, so if there is a suggestive exposure or symptoms, I should order IgM anti-HAV and interpret results in the clinical context, recognizing that vaccine-induced immunity would typically show IgG positivity rather than IgM unless tested very soon after vaccination [^114URhTh] [^1121W6A4] [^115nEEUF].

---

A "Hep A AB nonreactive" result means **no detectable hepatitis A antibodies**, indicating no prior HAV infection or vaccination and therefore **no immunity to hepatitis A** [^114URhTh]. This confers susceptibility to HAV, so **vaccination is recommended** for nonimmune individuals, especially those with risk factors or chronic liver disease [^115QMYy7] [^115UG5jo]. If acute HAV is suspected, **order IgM anti-HAV** to distinguish acute from past infection [^115nEEUF] [^116Qf8FR].

---

## Clinical interpretation of "hep a ab nonreactive"

- **No prior infection**: The patient has never been infected with HAV [^notfound].

- **No vaccination**: The patient has not been vaccinated against HAV [^notfound].

- **Susceptibility**: The patient is susceptible to HAV infection [^114XqR4G].

- **No immunity**: The patient has no protective immunity against HAV [^114XqR4G].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

### Vaccination

Vaccination is **recommended** for individuals with a nonreactive hepatitis A antibody test, particularly those with risk factors or chronic liver disease [^115QMYy7] [^115UG5jo]. The hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective and provides long-lasting immunity [^1158P7ka] [^11712pn9].

---

### Additional testing

If acute hepatitis A infection is suspected, **obtain an IgM anti-HAV test** to confirm acute infection [^115nEEUF] [^116Qf8FR]. IgM antibodies typically appear within 5–10 days of symptom onset and persist for several months [^114URhTh].

---

### Clinical management

Provide **counseling on hygiene, sanitation, and avoidance of high-risk behaviors** to reduce the risk of HAV infection [^notfound]. Consider post-exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis A vaccine or immunoglobulin if exposure is recent [^113AcJHW] [^116SjMtx].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Window period**: Early infection may yield a nonreactive antibody result; repeat testing may be needed if clinical suspicion is high [^112fLM8J].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Serologic responses may be blunted; consider alternative diagnostic methods if clinically indicated [^1146p3dU].

- **False negatives**: Rarely, false-negative results may occur due to assay limitations or laboratory error [^111mDWDt].

---

A "Hep A Ab nonreactive" result indicates no detectable hepatitis A antibodies, meaning the patient is susceptible to HAV infection. Vaccination is recommended, and **additional testing** may be needed if acute infection is suspected.

Clinical Guidance

ACIP recommends that adults aged 19–59 years and adults aged ≥ 60 years with risk factors for hepatitis B should receive HepB vaccines, and that adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors for hepatitis B may receive HepB vaccines. In previous HepB vaccine recommendations, providers were advised to administer HepB vaccine to all patients who requested it. The new language for adults aged ≥ 60 years without known risk factors is intended to prompt all providers to offer HepB vaccination to patients in that cohort, rather than wait for a patient to request vaccination, thus shifting the responsibility of initiating the consideration of HepB vaccination from the patient to the provider.

Persons who have completed a HepB vaccination series at any point or who have a history of HBV infection should not receive additional HepB vaccination, although there is no evidence that receiving additional vaccine doses is harmful. However, there are cases where revaccination might be indicated as specified in the 2018 ACIP recommendation (e.g. nonresponder infants born to persons testing positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], health care providers, and persons on hemodialysis). Providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. Vaccination of persons immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or HepB vaccination does not increase the risk for adverse events. However, in settings in which the patient population has a high rate of previous HBV infection, prevaccination testing, which may be performed concomitantly with administration of the first dose of vaccine, might reduce costs by avoiding complete vaccination of persons who are already immune. Prevaccination testing consists of testing for HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). The presence of HBsAg indicates current HBV infection. The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating immunity, either from HepB vaccination after a complete series or after recovery from HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV. Detailed interpretations of serologic markers for HBV infection are available (2). Lack of access to serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially in populations that are difficult to reach. Testing is not a requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of persons recommended to receive the vaccine should continue.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10^4 IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log10 IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

Procedures

We tested the serum samples using the ARCHITECT HAVAb-IgG assay (Abbott) for the presence of IgG anti-HAV. The presence of IgG antibodies indicates either a past infection or vaccination against HAV. The presence of IgG anti-HAV in the specimen was determined by comparing the chemiluminescent signal in the reaction (measured as relative light units (RLUs)) to the cutoff signal determined from an active calibration. Specimens with signal to cutoff (S/CO) values ≥ 1.00 are considered reactive, whereas S/CO values < 1.00 are non-reactive. The assay has a sensitivity of ≥ 98% and specificity of ≥ 99.2% (95% CI: 98.4%–99.6%). We randomly selected five percent of samples and retested them for quality control.

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children-United States, 2023 [^116Chnhf]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of HCV Infection Among Pregnant Persons and Perinatally Infected Children

Hepatitis C screening with an anti-HCV test is recommended for all pregnant persons during each pregnancy. A nonreactive test (i.e. no detectable antibody or negative antibody) indicates no HCV antibody detected and the person likely has never been infected. A nonreactive anti-HCV result also might represent an acute infection during the window period (if exposure was recent) or, among rare cases, a seronegative infection. A reactive HCV antibody (i.e. detectable antibody or positive antibody) indicates current or past infection and should be followed with a NAT for HCV RNA (i.e. reflex NAT for HCV RNA). An undetectable HCV RNA result by NAT indicates no current HCV infection. A detectable HCV RNA result is indicative of current HCV infection, and the person should be linked to care and considered for treatment.

Before 2018, recommendations for hepatitis C testing during pregnancy were limited to persons with known risk factors. However, this strategy left multiple infections undiagnosed. In 2018, because of low testing rates and increases in HCV infections among persons of reproductive age, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommended universal screening during pregnancy. In 2020, both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and CDC recommended universal screening during pregnancy. This universal screening during pregnancy recommendation was followed by similar recommendations from two obstetrical organizations, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) in 2021.

Because recommendations have recently shifted from risk-based to universal screening, uptake of HCV screening during pregnancy is evolving, as demonstrated by two studies using commercial laboratory data. During 2011–2016, analysis of laboratory data determined HCV testing increased from 5.7% to 13.4% among pregnant persons within the population eligible for inclusion in the study. Another analysis of 5,048,428 pregnant persons using laboratory data indicated an increase in the percentage of pregnant persons with an HCV screening test from 16.6% in 2011 to 40.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Systematic review of the literature indicated the median anti-HCV prevalence during pregnancy was 1.2% (range: 0.1%–70.8%); 66.1% (range: 61.3%–77.2%) of pregnant persons with a reactive anti-HCV test also had detectable HCV RNA.

### Progress toward the elimination of hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the country of Georgia, April 2015-April 2024 [^113bJjii]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Programmatic Indicators for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Elimination

Diagnosis and treatment of current chronic HCV infection. By April 2024, among the 2.8 million adults in Georgia, 2.5 million (89.3%) had been screened for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) (Figure 1). An additional 18,586 persons received a reactive anti-HCV test result using an anonymized code at harm reduction sites or prisons. Among adults screened for anti-HCV during January 2023–April 2024, 80% had been screened previously and consistently received nonreactive test results. Among the 2.5 million adults screened, 164,951 (6.7%) received a reactive anti-HCV test result. Among this group, 138,746 (84.1%) persons received testing for HCV presence (HCV RNA or HCV core antigen), of whom 107,604 (77.6%) had detectable HCV RNA or HCV core antigen, indicating current chronic infection. By April 2024, among 130,000 persons estimated to have current chronic HCV infection in Georgia, 107,604 (82.8%) had received a diagnosis of current chronic HCV infection. Among 101,138 (94.0%) of those 107,604 who were eligible ††† for treatment, 87,047 (86.1%) initiated treatment, 82,516 (94.8%) of whom completed treatment. Among 61,071 persons who received testing for sustained virologic response (absence of detected HCV RNA ≥ 12 weeks after completing treatment), 60,449 (99.0%) were cured of HCV infection (Figure 2). Overall, among 157,674 persons who received a reactive anti-HCV test result and were eligible for further testing, 18,928 (12.0%) did not receive an HCV RNA or HCV core antigen test. Among 101,138 persons who received a positive test result for current chronic HCV infection and were eligible for treatment, 14,091 (13.9%) did not initiate treatment.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

### Hepatitis A booster vaccination: is there a need? [^11712pn9]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis A is one of the most common vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the world. Effective vaccines against hepatitis A have been available since 1992, and they provide long-term immunity against the infection. However, there is no worldwide consensus on how long protection will last or whether there will be a need for hepatitis A virus (HAV) booster vaccinations in the future. In most countries, booster-vaccination policy is guided by manufacturers' recommendations, national authorities, or both. In June, 2002, a panel of international experts met to review the long-term immunogenicity and protection conferred by HAV vaccine in different population groups. Data have shown that after a full primary vaccination course, protective antibody amounts persist beyond 10 years in healthy individuals, and underlying immune memory provides protection far beyond the duration of anti-HAV antibodies. The group concluded that there is no evidence to lend support to HAV booster vaccination after a full primary vaccination course in a healthy individual. However, further investigations are needed before deciding if boosters can be omitted in special patient-groups.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112TCXHv]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### Hepatitis A immunisation in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis a… [^1158P7ka]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In many parts of the world, hepatitis A infection represents a significant cause of morbidity and socio-economic loss. Whilst hepatitis A vaccines have the potential to prevent disease, the degree of protection afforded against clinical outcomes and within different populations remains uncertain. There are two types of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine, inactivated and live attenuated. It is important to determine the efficacy and safety for both vaccine types.

Objectives

To determine the clinical protective efficacy, sero-protective efficacy, and safety and harms of hepatitis A vaccination in persons not previously exposed to hepatitis A.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to November 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing HAV vaccine with placebo, no intervention, or appropriate control vaccines in participants of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were undertaken by two authors and verified by a third author. Where required, authors contacted investigators to obtain missing data. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically apparent hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis). The secondary outcomes were lack of sero-protective anti-HAV immunoglobulin G (IgG), and number and types of adverse events. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using intention-to-treat analysis. We conducted assessment of risk of bias to evaluate the risk of systematic errors (bias) and trial sequential analyses to estimate the risk of random errors (the play of chance).

Main Results

We included a total of 11 clinical studies, of which only three were considered to have low risk of bias; two were quasi-randomised studies in which we only addressed harms. Nine randomised trials with 732,380 participants addressed the primary outcome of clinically confirmed hepatitis A. Of these, four trials assessed the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (41,690 participants) and five trials assessed the live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine (690,690 participants). In the three randomised trials with low risk of bias (all assessing inactivated vaccine), clinically apparent hepatitis A occurred in 9/20,684 (0.04%) versus 92/20,746 (0.44%) participants in the HAV vaccine and control groups respectively (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30). In all nine randomised trials, clinically apparent hepatitis A occurred in 31/375,726 (0.01%) versus 505/356,654 (0.18%) participants in the HAV vaccine and control groups respectively (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.17). These results were supported by trial sequential analyses. Subgroup analyses confirmed the clinical effectiveness of both inactivated hepatitis A vaccines (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30) and live attenuated hepatitis A vaccines (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) on clinically confirmed hepatitis A. Inactivated hepatitis A vaccines had a significant effect on reducing the lack of sero-protection (less than 20 mIU/L) (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.03). No trial reported on a sero-protective threshold less than 10 mIU/L. The risk of both non-serious local and systemic adverse events was comparable to placebo for the inactivated HAV vaccines. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions on adverse events for the live attenuated HAV vaccine.

Authors' Conclusions

Hepatitis A vaccines are effective for pre-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A in susceptible individuals. This review demonstrated significant protection for at least two years with the inactivated HAV vaccine and at least five years with the live attenuated HAV vaccine. There was evidence to support the safety of the inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. More high quality evidence is required to determine the safety of live attenuated vaccines.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1112Bw2z]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

Abbreviations: anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBIG = hepatitis B immune globulin; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; IgM = immunoglobulin M.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

Supplemental Testing for HCV Antibody

If testing is desired to distinguish between true positivity and biologic false positivity for HCV antibody, then, testing may be done with a second HCV antibody assay approved by FDA for diagnosis of HCV infection that is different from the assay used for initial antibody testing. HCV antibody assays vary according to their antigens, test platforms, and performance characteristics, so biologic false positivity is unlikely to be exhibited by more than one test when multiple tests are used on a single specimen.

### Laboratory diagnostics for hepatitis C virus infection [^111mHi5g]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Identification of prevalent infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is based serologically on detecting anti-HCV immunoglobulin G, using immunoassays, immunoblot assays, and, more recently, immunochromatography-based rapid tests. None discriminate between active and resolved HCV infection. Tests for detecting HCV RNA identify active HCV infection but are costly. Serologic assays for HCV antigens have been developed and show potential for diagnosis of active HCV infection, and their performance characteristics are undergoing evaluation. The diagnosis of acute HCV infection without the demonstration of seroconversion remains elusive.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

A combined hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen-antibody assay was evaluated for 115 seronegative individuals with occult HCV infection. The assay was reactive in one patient and negative to weakly reactive in three others (all four gave indeterminate results by supplemental assay) but failed to detect HCV in the remaining patients. Despite increased sensitivity the combined assay does not improve serodiagnosis of occult HCV infection.

- patients with HIV infection aged ≥ 1 year

- patients with chronic liver disease, including but not limited to HBV infection, HCV infection, cirrhosis, MASLD, alcoholic liver disease, AIH, or an ALT or AST level persistently 2× the ULN

- during hepatitis A outbreaks in patients aged ≥ 1 year at risk for HAV infection (injection or non-injection drug users, persons experiencing homelessness, or MSM) or at risk for severe disease from HAV (patients with chronic liver disease or HIV)

- settings providing services to adults in which a high proportion of persons have risk factors for HAV infection (such as healthcare settings with a focus on injection or non-injection drug users, group homes, and non-residential daycare facilities for developmentally disabled persons).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114XN4gN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166CBsE]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

HIV diagnostic algorithm — reactive results on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, undifferentiated. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend specific additional testing, without clinical follow-up, for specimens that are dually reactive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies on the differentiation immunoassay. Specimens that are reactive on the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT). A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection. A reactive HIV-1 NAT result and indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay result indicates the presence of HIV-1 antibodies confirmed by HIV-1 NAT. A negative HIV-1 NAT result and nonreactive or indeterminate HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. HIV-1 NAT results can distinguish acute HIV-1 infection from false-positive initial immunoassay results in specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody immunoassay and a nonreactive HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay result. HIV-1 NAT does not detect HIV-2, and no HIV-2 NAT is FDA-approved. Available evidence is insufficient to recommend testing for acute HIV-2 infection after a nonreactive HIV-1 NAT result.

What is the Transmission Route of HBV?

Today, we know that HBVs are highly infectious and are spread by exposure of mucosal membranes or nonintact skin to infected blood or other body fluids (saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid). In high endemic areas, HBV is most commonly transmitted from mother to child at birth (perinatal transmission) and during early childhood from infected to uninfected children (horizontal transmission). Most HBV infections in areas of low endemicity occur in adults in relatively well-defined risk groups, such as those at risk through sexual exposure, household members of an infected person, hemodialysis patients, incarcerated persons, injection-drug users, persons at risk for occupational exposure, developmentally disabled persons in long-term care facilities, and travelers to regions with moderate or high HBV endemicity. Today, only humans are a known reservoir for human HBV genotypes, but closely related HBV genotypes exist in higher primates [23]. Hence, a comprehensive control strategy could eventually lead to the eradication of HBV.

How is Hepatitis B Diagnosed?

Because clinical manifestations of hepatitis B are indistinguishable from other causes of viral hepatitis, a definitive diagnosis requires serological testing [24]. This testing uses different (combinations of) serologic markers to identify different phases of HBV infection and to conclude whether a person has acute or chronic HBV infection, or is immune to HBV as a result of prior HBV infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection. In Table 1 an interpretation of hepatitis B serologic test results is given.

Table 1.
Interpretation of Serologic Test Results for Hepatitis B

Chronic infection is arbitrarily defined by the persistence of HBsAg (with or without concurrent HBeAg) in serum for at least 6 months. Anti-HBs are neutralizing antibodies and their presence in serum confers long-term immunity against HBV infection. In persons with acquired immunity through vaccination, anti-HBs is the only serological marker detected. In contrast to persons with a past HBV infection where anti-HBs are present concurrently with anti-HBc IgG.

During the initial, highly replicative phase of HBV infection patients are also seropositive for HBeAg, of whom some remain HBeAg positive for years. All HBsAg-positive persons should be considered infectious; however, the presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the infected individual are highly contagious (ie, HBV DNA levels of 10 7 to 10 9 IU/mL). Although HBsAg has been detected in multiple body fluids, only serum, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid have been demonstrated to be infectious [25].

### Timing and interpretation of tests for diagnosing perinatally acquired hepatitis C virus infection [^112AKj4d]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children born to HCV-infected women is based on serologic assays and HCV RNA measurement by PCR. Interpretation of the results of these tests is hampered by uncertainty about the age distribution of loss of maternal antibody and the sensitivity and specificity of PCR at different ages. On the basis of findings from a recent vertical transmission study, we estimated the posttest probability of a child's being infected or uninfected under several test result scenarios. These estimates may assist clinicians in assessing the likelihood of infection in an individual child and in using the currently available assays cost effectively.

### Multiple factors contribute to positive results for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M antibody [^1125NRG7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

In the United States, a successful vaccination program for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection has decreased both its incidence and the true positive rate for diagnostic immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to HAV in acute hepatitis.

Objective

To survey positive results of HAV IgM tests and determine the effect of changing ordering options.

Design

We reviewed all positive results for IgM antibody to HAV between January 2007 and December 2010. Patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory data were recorded and the encounter, order, and reason for test reviewed. Each result was categorized as indicating acute, recent, resolved, or indeterminate HAV infection.

Results

A total of 10,735 tests were performed; 35 patients had 49 positive results. Most positive test results were associated with outpatient visits and were ordered in the assessment of patients with liver disease, but not clinical acute hepatitis. In the final analysis, 4 patients had acute hepatitis A and 20 individual patients had recent and/or resolved hepatitis. All but 1 of the remaining 11 patients had another established cause of liver disease with a positive IgM HAV antibody test result; data to determine causality were insufficient. The total number of tests requested annually decreased more than 35% with the introduction of computerized physician order entry.

Conclusions

Current assays for IgM HAV antibodies are overused in the absence of clinical acute hepatitis; future clinical decision support may improve patterns of order entry. Most patients have findings consistent with HAV exposure but not acute hepatitis; dormant viral infection may be a continuing source of antigen.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 69: hepatitis B in pregnancy: updated guidelines [^114YkDap]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 290 million people worldwide, and almost 2 million people in the United States, are infected with hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic hepatitis B, a vaccine-preventable communicable disease. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in pregnancy is estimated to be 0.7% to 0.9% in the United States, with > 25,000 infants born annually at risk for chronic infection due to perinatal transmission. Given the burden of disease associated with chronic hepatitis B infection, recent national guidance has expanded both the indications for screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity and the indications for vaccination. The purpose of this document is to aid clinicians caring for pregnant patients in screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity status, discuss the perinatal risks of hepatitis B infection in pregnancy, determine whether treatment is indicated for maternal or perinatal indications, and recommend hepatitis B vaccination among susceptible patients. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend triple-panel testing (hepatitis B surface antigen screening, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) at the initial prenatal visit if not previously documented or known to have been performed (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend universal hepatitis B surface antigen screening alone at the initial prenatal care visit for all pregnancies where there has been a previously documented negative triple-panel test (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that individuals with unknown hepatitis B surface antigen screening status be tested on any presentation for care in pregnancy; we also recommend that those with clinical hepatitis or those with risk factors for acute hepatitis B infection be tested at the time of admission to a birthing facility when delivery is anticipated (GRADE 1B); (4) we do not recommend altering routine intrapartum care in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B; administration of neonatal immunoprophylaxis is standard of care in these situations (GRADE 1B); (5) we do not recommend cesarean delivery for the sole indication of reducing perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend that individuals with HBV infection can breastfeed as long as the infant has received immunoprophylaxis at birth (GRADE 1C); (7) we suggest individuals with hepatitis B infection who desire invasive testing may have the procedure performed after an informed discussion on risks and benefits in the context of shared decision-making and in the context of how testing will affect clinical care (GRADE 2C); (8) in individuals with hepatitis viral loads > 200,000 IU/mL (> 5.3 log 10 IU/mL), we recommend antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide at 25 mg daily or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg daily) in the third trimester (initiated at 28–32 weeks of gestation) as an adjunctive strategy to immunoprophylaxis to reduce perinatal transmission (GRADE 1B); (9) we recommend administering hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive pregnant patients or those with unknown or undocumented hepatitis B surface antigen status, regardless of whether antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy to the pregnant patient (GRADE 1B); and (10) we recommend hepatitis B vaccination in pregnancy for all individuals without serologic evidence of immunity or documented history of vaccination (GRADE 1C).

### Positive test results for acute hepatitis A virus infection among persons with no recent history of acute hepatitis – United States, 2002–2004 [^116aSgs1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis A is a nationally reportable condition, and the surveillance case definition includes both clinical criteria and serologic confirmation. State health departments and CDC have investigated persons with positive serologic tests for acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (i.e. IgM anti-HAV) whose illness was not consistent with the clinical criteria of the hepatitis A case definition. Test results indicating acute HAV infection among persons who do not have clinical or epidemiologic features consistent with hepatitis A are a concern for state and local health departments because of the need to assess whether contacts need postexposure immunoprophylaxis. This report summarizes results of three such investigations, which suggested that most of the positive tests did not represent recent acute HAV infections. To improve the predictive value of a positive IgM anti-HAV test, clinicians should limit laboratory testing for acute HAV infection to persons with clinical findings typical of hepatitis A or to persons who have been exposed to settings where HAV transmission is suspected.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Q45zf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic testing in infants and children — confirmation and chronicity criteria are specified: because of intermittent viremia, a single negative HCV RNA test is not conclusive, and two negative HCV RNA results obtained at or after age 2 months, including at least one test at or after age 12 months, definitively excludes HCV infection in an HCV-exposed infant (BIII); two positive HCV RNA results before age 18 months are required for definitive diagnosis (BIII). Most children with perinatal HCV infection will have a positive HCV RNA test by age 12 months. In children aged > 18 months, a positive anti-HCV antibody test indicates prior HCV infection, and supplemental HCV RNA testing is recommended to clarify whether the antibody reflects chronic active or resolved infection (AIII). A positive HCV RNA test confirms current HCV infection and, if positive for > 6 months, indicates chronic infection. Quantitative tests (branched-chain DNA amplification, quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and real-time PCR) are most useful for monitoring response to anti-HCV therapy; quantitative HCV RNA level does not correlate with degree of liver damage or measure disease severity, and continued use of the same quantitative assay for serial monitoring is strongly recommended.

### A Q-probes study involving utilization of free prostate-specific antigen, factor V Leiden, and hepatitis A serology tests [^112joU8b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context —

Managing the utilization of laboratory tests is an important quality improvement activity that adds value to health care.

Objective —

To examine utilization of 3 laboratory tests and identify factors that impact performance.

Design —

Test utilization performance was evaluated by determining the frequency with which appropriate preconditions for testing were met. This included 30 testing episodes each involving (1) free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) when total PSA was within an appropriate interpretable range, (2) total anti-hepatitis A virus antibody when previous anti-hepatitis A virus antibody results were either negative or not done, and (3) factor V Leiden mutation when a previous result was not already available. Participants also provided information regarding some of their utilization policies and procedures for these 3 tests.

Results —

The overall frequency with which testing criteria were met was 20.6% (163 of 790), 91.5% (649 of 709), and 95.2% (799 of 839) for free PSA, anti-hepatitis A virus antibody, and factor V Leiden, respectively. Utilization review was infrequent and done by 20.7% (6 of 29) of participants for factor V Leiden, 3.6% (1 of 28) for anti-hepatitis A virus antibody, and 3.6% (1 of 28) for free PSA. No practice or demographic characteristics were significantly associated with utilization performance for any test.

Conclusions —

Utilization review was infrequent for the 3 tests examined. Variable amounts of unnecessary testing were observed for all tests, most frequently for free PSA, for which reporting results carried the added risk of diagnostic error from misinterpretation of results.

### Breakthrough infection by hepatitis B virus in a vaccinated blood donor: an emerging threat for transfusion safety in low-endemic countries? [^116K2Je8]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a breakthrough infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV), intending to warn about the challenge that HBV represents for transfusion safety. Virological markers for HBV infection were assayed during a blood donor screening by detection of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and viral nucleic acid (HBV DNA) by a nucleic acid test (NAT). Additionally, samples were analyzed for detection of immunoglobulin M anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBs. A first-time donor repeatedly tested positive for HBV DNA by NAT and nonreactive for HBV-serological markers of infection. He stated having completed the anti-HBV vaccination schedule; thus, study of anti-Hbs resulted in reactive at protective level (18mIU/mL). The donor denied clinical symptoms of hepatitis and remained healthy during the follow-up period. 95 days postdonation, NAT was negative, seroconversion of anti-HBc ab was detected, and a significant increase in anti-HBs concentration was measured (> 1000mIU/mL). This is the first case of HBV-breakthrough infection reported in Argentina and to our knowledge, this potential threat to transfusion safety is novel in an HBV low-endemic region with high coverage of HBV vaccination. The occurrence of breakthrough infections challenges the current protocols for the identification of HBV-infected subjects, could be a source of silent HBV transmission.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of treatment response, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain HBV DNA nucleic acid testing (quantitative or qualitative) directly following a positive HBsAg serological test result as the preferred strategy to assess viral load level for monitoring treatment response.

### Balancing efficiency and accuracy in hepatitis C rapid antibody testing: insights from a cluster randomised crossover trial [^1139FKDx]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

The difference between five‐ and 20‐min OraQuick test readings reflects antibody levels in blood samples. Hepatitis C antibodies, produced in response to viral replication, are higher in active infection than in past or waning infections, and higher antibody titres correlate with hepatitis C viremia. Antibody titres decline in the absence of viral antigen following cure, but do not diminish immediately. In rapid testing, antibodies are typically detected earliest in individuals with current viremia or recent cure. In clinical and real‐world cohorts in Canada and Madrid, all 227 viraemic patients had positive OraQuick results within five minutes. Lower circulating antibody titres in individuals with long‐term resolved infections may require the OraQuick test's recommended 20 min for a positive result.

In our cohort, a five‐minute OraQuick test would eliminate 9% of all RNA testing and 13% of unnecessary RNA testing of non‐viraemic participants with residual hepatitis C antibodies (likely from previously resolved infections). However, rates of previously treated and/or spontaneously cleared infections will vary between study populations. In mixed cohorts, the specificity of rapid antibody testing for indicating viremia has varied, likely driven by variable rates of prior infection. About one‐third of hepatitis C infections are thought to clear spontaneously, which may have been underestimated historically.

Our study indicated a notable rate of previously resolved infections, with 66% of positive 20‐min OraQuick tests being confirmed as RNA negative. While spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C is estimated at 28%–36% in Australia, factors like genetics and co‐infections may influence this rate in subpopulations, making it difficult to determine its precise contribution in our cohort. In addition, underreporting of previous treatment may contribute to the rate of previously resolved infections given the evidence of social desirability response bias, fragmented healthcare experiences, and reduced health literacy in our study population. With 10% of treated individuals who have undergone retreatment, the likelihood of prior treatment may be higher in our cohort than in other countries, even if not accurately recalled. These findings highlight the need for context‐sensitive rapid testing, particularly in marginalised groups like people who inject drugs, and underscore the need for further research on the rate of previously resolved infections.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113HNQCv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV/HEV) laboratory diagnosis notes that diagnosis of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is confirmed by detecting HAV IgM antibody, which may persist for up to 6 months after exposure. However, false-positive HAV IgM antibody results can occur in populations with low prevalence (eg, < 5%) of acute hepatitis A, and NAAT for HAV RNA may be necessary to confirm diagnosis. The presence of HAV IgG antibody indicates either past or resolved hepatitis A infection or immunity to this viral infection from vaccination, and the same hepatitis A status can be deduced by the presence of HAV total antibodies in an asymptomatic patient with normal liver tests and/or absence of HAV IgM antibody. Specimen handling in Table 58 includes EDTA tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; PPT tube, RT, ≤ 6 h; Clot or SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h; and for HEV RNA, quantitative (viral load), SST tube, RT, ≤ 2 h.

### Improving the accuracy of clinical interpretation of serological testing for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A infection [^112kMVB7]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatitis A (HA) remains a common infection globally that results in a self-limiting hepatitis with gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Direct detection of the virus in blood or stool is often not possible once symptomatic. Serological testing is frequently performed to investigate abnormal liver function tests - and interpretation of equivocal and low-level positive anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM is difficult even in the context of accurate epidemiological and clinical information.

Objectives

The aim of this project was to characterise the association between low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results and clinical disease.

Study Design

Anti-HAV serology results recorded over 22 months were analysed. Equivocal and positive Architect anti-HAV IgM results were matched with available clinical and demographical data to identify confirmed and probable cases of acute HAV infection.

Results

Reactive anti-HAV IgM results were recorded for 88/7661 (1.15%) samples. Using clinical and laboratory data, 35 patients were confirmed to have acute HAV infection. Acute HA was associated with a mean Architect anti-HAV IgM value of 9.4 (SD 6.8–12.0). Cases of HA had a mean peak ALT value of 1920 (SD 682–3158). All confirmed cases (35/35) of acute HAV were associated with at least one clinical indicator, with 28/31 cases (90%) having a documented jaundice. All 35 (100%) cases of acute HAV infection had anti-HAV IgM > 4.0. A diagnosis other than acute HA was identified in 7/11 (63.6%) of low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results (clinical data unavailable for further 4/11, 36.3%). Where clinical information was available, acute HA was excluded in all 31 patients with equivocal or low-level reactive anti-HAV IgM results.

Conclusions

The accuracy of reports sent out to the clinician showed room for improvement. An interpretive algorithm is proposed including a clinically significant cut-off value for anti-HAV IgM.

### Balancing efficiency and accuracy in hepatitis C rapid antibody testing: insights from a cluster randomised crossover trial [^112JuXti]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Our results highlight a clinical trade‐off between reducing unnecessary reflexive RNA testing and ensuring accurate viremia detection. Reducing the OraQuick rapid antibody test read time from 20 min to five would have reduced unnecessary reflexive RNA testing by approximately 13% in our cohort, at the cost of failing to detect around 2.5% of viraemic participants. With the five‐minute OraQuick test, 64% of participants with detected antibodies were non‐viraemic, showing the need for confirmatory RNA testing to differentiate active from resolved infections.

Declining hepatitis C testing rates necessitate re‐evaluation of the testing and treatment paradigm. Rapid antibody tests, such as the OraQuick test, are adaptable, with a five‐minute read time proving a useful diagnostic complement to the 20‐min test. A positive OraQuick result at five minutes triggers reflexive RNA testing, while individuals without detectable hepatitis C antibodies at five minutes but with them at 20 min are likely non‐viraemic and do not require further RNA testing. This dual approach could streamline diagnosis, increase throughput in large screening programmes, and lower costs through reducing unnecessary RNA testing for non‐viraemic individuals. Our data indicate that, in our cohort, this approach would identify and administer RNA testing to 97.5% of viraemic individuals and 87% of non‐viraemic individuals with residual antibodies, with the remaining individuals not receiving RNA testing.

### Understanding the presence of false-positive antibodies in acute hepatitis [^116R7K5U]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Although false-positive antibodies (FPAs) have been well described in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), this has not been evaluated in acute viral hepatitis. Patients with acute viral hepatitis underwent antibody testing for other causes of liver disease and sexually transmitted diseases. Those with antibody positivity underwent confirmatory testing and monitoring. Patients with FPAs were compared with patients with acute hepatitis C infection without FPAs. In total 7 of 24 patients (29%) had FPAs. FPAs during acute viral hepatitis are associated with higher IgM levels and higher ESR in acute HCV. This has both mechanistic and clinical implications and should be evaluated further.

### Recommendations for screening, monitoring, and referral of pediatric chronic hepatitis B [^114AV8tN]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Most children with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (persistent hepatitis B surface antigen-positive for > 6 months) are asymptomatic and do not generally require treatment. These children are, however, at increased risk for severe complications later in life, including advanced liver disease and liver cancer. On November 11, 2008, the Hepatitis B Foundation, a nonprofit research and disease advocacy organization, convened a panel of nationally recognized North American pediatric liver specialists to consider and recommend an approach for the screening, monitoring, initial management, and referral of children with chronic hepatitis B. The panel developed recommendations to provide guidance to practitioners on determining what additional tests to conduct, how often to monitor on the basis of test results, and when to refer to a pediatric liver specialist to build a partnership between the practitioner and liver specialist to enhance the success of management of children with this lifelong infection.

### Screening for hepatitis A and B antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease [^116NW3vx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is highly prevalent, and hepatitis C is one of the leading causes. Acute hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic hepatitis C can lead to more severe hepatic injury and a higher fatality rate than in patients without hepatitis C. Thus, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that persons with CLD be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV), and the ACIP and the National Institutes of Health recommend vaccination against both HAV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Because coinfection with HAV or HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C or CLD is common, antibody screening prior to hepatitis A or B vaccination can identify patients who are already immune to these viruses and thus do not need to be vaccinated. Selective hepatitis A vaccination (i.e., vaccination of patients who test negative for either HAV antibody immunoglobulin G or total antibodies to HAV) is most cost-effective in areas where the local prevalence of hepatitis A is higher than the national prevalence and in populations with higher background rates of HAV exposure compared with the general population, such as older adults, foreign-born patients, African Americans, and persons with CLD or hepatitis C. Although not usually recommended for healthy adults or those with compensated CLD because of virtually 100% postvaccination seroconversion, serologic testing after hepatitis A vaccination is recommended in patients with decompensated or advanced end-stage liver disease because of the much lower seroconversion rates in these patients. Selective vaccination against HBV in patients with CLD or hepatitis C is also recommended. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is considered the most efficient and reasonably cost-effective method to screen for hepatitis B serologic markers because HBsAg identifies individuals with both acute and chronic HBV infection, and anti-HBs identify those who are immune secondary to vaccination or past infection. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen is needed to further distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to past infection, but it is not recommended as the only screening test for HBV immunity. Postvaccination testing for hepatitis B seroconversion is recommended in all patients with CLD, especially in those with more advanced disease, because the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adults. If patients with CLD are not adequately protected after a standard course of hepatitis B vaccination, a repeat course of vaccination using the standard schedule or an accelerated schedule (days 0, 7, and 21) should be considered.

Isolated anti‑HBc interpretation — Some persons may test positive for anti‑HBc but not HBsAg or anti‑HBs, and isolated anti‑HBc can reflect different states: it may indicate chronic HBV infection with undetectable HBsAg but detectable HBV DNA (more so in the liver than in serum), it may be a marker of immunity after recovery with an anamnestic response after one dose of HBV vaccine, it may be a false‑positive particularly in low‑prevalence persons with no risk factors, or it may be the only marker during the window phase of acute hepatitis B where anti‑HBc IgM should be positive.

Detection of Anti-HAV after Vaccination

Correlate of protection. The correlate of protection is defined as an immune response (i.e. IgG anti-HAV titer) that is responsible for and statistically interrelated with protection. Anti-HAV levels are measured in comparison with a World Health Organization reference IG reagent and are expressed as milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seroconversion (response to vaccination) is defined as achieving a detectable and quantifiable postvaccination IgG anti-HAV level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL by standard assays. Seroprotection is considered a surrogate of clinical protection and persists when IgG anti-HAV levels remain higher than the correlate of protection.

The absolute lower limit of anti-HAV needed to prevent HAV infection has not been determined, although the limit is likely quite low because IG provides about 90% efficacy in preventing hepatitis A, and very low levels of anti-HAV are detected in IG recipients. The concentrations of anti-HAV achieved after passive transfer by IG or active induction by vaccination are tenfold to 100-fold lower than those produced in response to natural infection. Clinical studies have yielded limited data from which a minimum protective antibody level can be derived because vaccine-induced levels of antibody are usually high and few infections have been detected among vaccinated persons (i.e. vaccine failure). Antibody levels of 10–33 mIU/mL using different assays have been proposed as the threshold for protection from HAV infection in humans, although one study proposed that any detectable level of IgG anti-HAV might suggest protection. Because no absolute protective level has been defined, the lower limit of detection of the particular assay being used has generally typically been considered the protective level; postvaccination studies use ≥ 10 mIU/mL as the minimum protective level.

IgM anti-HAV after vaccination. HepA vaccination can induce detectable IgM anti-HAV, particularly if the test is conducted within a few weeks after vaccination. IgM anti-HAV has been detected 2–3 weeks after administration of 1 dose of vaccine in 8%–20% of adults (CDC, unpublished data, 1995). To reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a serological assay, either rapid diagnostic test or laboratory-based immunoassay, meeting minimum quality, safety and performance standards (with regard to both analytical and clinical sensitivity and specificity) to detect HBsAg for the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged > 12 months) patients. Obtain laboratory-based immunoassays as the preferred assay format in settings where existing laboratory testing is already available and accessible. Obtain rapid diagnostic tests to improve access in settings where there is limited access to laboratory testing and/or in populations where access to rapid testing would facilitate linkage to care and treatment.

### Testing for HCV infection: an update of guidance for clinicians and laboratorians [^114enkj8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Recommended Testing Sequence

The testing sequence in this guidance is intended for use by primary care and public health providers seeking to implement CDC recommendations for HCV testing. In most cases, persons identified with HCV viremia have chronic HCV infection. This testing sequence is not intended for diagnosis of acute hepatitis C or clinical evaluation of persons receiving specialist medical care, for which specific guidance is available.

Testing for HCV infection begins with either a rapid or a laboratory-conducted assay for HCV antibody in blood (Figure). A nonreactive HCV antibody result indicates no HCV antibody detected. A reactive result indicates one of the following: 1) current HCV infection, 2) past HCV infection that has resolved, or 3) false positivity. A reactive result should be followed by NAT for HCV RNA. If HCV RNA is detected, that indicates current HCV infection. If HCV RNA is not detected, that indicates either past, resolved HCV infection, or false HCV antibody positivity.

Initial Testing for HCV Antibody

An FDA-approved test for HCV antibody should be used. If the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test is used, the outcome is reported as reactive or nonreactive. If a laboratory-based assay is used, the outcome is reported as reactive or nonreactive without necessarily specifying signal-to-cutoff ratios.

Testing for HCV RNA

An FDA-approved NAT assay intended for detection of HCV RNA in serum or plasma from blood of at-risk patients who test reactive for HCV antibody should be used. There are several possible operational steps toward NAT after initial testing for HCV antibody:

Blood from a subsequent venipuncture is submitted for HCV NAT if the blood sample collected is reactive for HCV antibody during initial testing.
From a single venipuncture, two specimens are collected in separate tubes: one tube for initial HCV antibody testing; and a second tube for HCV NAT if the HCV antibody test is reactive.
The same sample of venipuncture blood used for initial HCV antibody testing, if reactive, is reflexed to HCV NAT without another blood draw for NAT.
A separate venipuncture blood sample is submitted for HCV NAT if the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test for initial testing of HCV antibody has used fingerstick blood.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers and Diagnosis of HAV Infection

Hepatitis A cannot be differentiated from other types of viral hepatitis on the basis of clinical or epidemiologic features alone. Diagnosis of HAV infection requires the detection of either immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HAV in serum or HAV RNA in serum or stool. IgM anti-HAV, a marker of acute illness, becomes detectable within 5–10 days of the onset of symptoms in the majority of persons, usually peaks within 1 month of illness, and decreases to undetectable levels within 6 months after infection (,–) (Figure 2). However, positive tests for IgM anti-HAV in persons > 1 year after infection have been reported, as have likely false-positive tests in persons without evidence of recent HAV infection. Therefore, to reduce false-positive tests, persons should only be tested for IgM anti-HAV if they are symptomatic and suspected of having HAV infection. Total anti-HAV or immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HAV testing is used in epidemiologic studies to measure the prevalence of previous infection or clinically to determine whether a person with an indication for preexposure prophylaxis is already immune. IgG anti-HAV is produced either in response to natural infection or after vaccination with HepA vaccine, appearing early in the course of infection, remaining detectable for the person's lifetime, and providing lifelong protection against the disease. The antibody test for total anti-HAV measures both IgG anti-HAV and IgM anti-HAV. Although assays for the detection of IgG anti-HAV are available, in the absence of an IgG anti-HAV test, a total anti-HAV–positive sample from a symptomatic person should be subsequently tested for IgM anti-HAV to establish the acute stage of HAV infection. Persons who test positive from a total anti-HAV test and negative from an IgM anti-HAV test are considered immune, either from past infection or vaccination.

### Prevention of hepatitis A virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, 2020 [^1152KLBD]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Persons with HIV Infection

Data suggest that up to 87% of persons with HIV infection are susceptible (i.e. have negative total or IgG anti-HAV test results) to HAV infection because of lack of previous HAV infection, lack of receipt of HepA vaccination, or poor response to HepA vaccination. Persons with HIV infection who have underlying liver disease are at increased risk for severe disease from HAV infection. HAV infection in persons with HIV infection is prolonged and might increase HIV replication, potentially increasing HIV transmission, and can lengthen the HAV transmission period. Protracted hepatitis A outbreaks can occur among persons with HIV infection because HAV viremia in these persons tends to be elevated and the hepatitis A clinical course tends to be prolonged compared with HIV-uninfected persons, resulting in a higher risk for HAV transmission.

HepA vaccine seroconversion rates (i.e. achieving IgG anti-HAV levels after vaccination that are higher than the correlate of protection as determined by the study) in persons with HIV infection range from 50% to 94% (see Correlate of Protection). HepA vaccine does not increase HIV viral load, affect CD4 cell count, or accelerate progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Protection against HAV in persons with HIV infection can be achieved, despite lower seroconversion rates compared with HIV-negative persons (see Vaccine-Induced Seroprotection). In one study among 130 persons with HIV infection, 85% maintained seropositivity 6–10 years after a 2-dose vaccine series. Vaccination at higher CD4 counts is associated with better vaccine-induced immune responses (,–).

Persons with Chronic Liver Disease

Persons with chronic liver disease are not at increased risk for acquiring HAV infection. However, concurrent underlying chronic liver disease (e.g. HBV infection, HCV infection, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis) has been associated with increased risk for fulminant hepatitis when HAV infection occurs (,–). Among patients hospitalized for HAV infection in the United States during 2010–2011, the percentage hospitalized with any liver disease (e.g. other viral hepatitis, non-alcohol–related cirrhotic liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, liver disease not otherwise specified, and biliary tract disease) was high (38.3%; 2.7 per 100,000 population).

### Screening for autoantibodies in chronic hepatitis C patients has no effect on treatment initiation or outcome [^112dTa3N]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies in hepatitis C virus-infected patients may indicate autoimmune hepatitis or other immune-mediated diseases. This may impact safety and efficacy of interferon-based therapy of chronic hepatitis C. We investigated the association between a positive test result for a variety of autoantibodies and the initiation and efficacy of therapy for chronic hepatitis C. We analysed an observational cohort of 24 306 patients for an association between autoantibodies and treatment outcome. 8241 patients were tested simultaneously for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Matched-pair analysis was performed matching one autoantibody-positive patient to three controls. Control patients had negative tests for all four antibodies. Analyses were performed for patients with a single positive autoantibody test and for patients with multiple positive autoantibody tests. A positive test result for ANA, LKM, SMA or AMA did not affect the physician's decision to initiate therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In addition, a positive test for one or multiple autoantibodies did not adversely affect sustained virologic response. There was no difference in fibrosis stage or alanine transaminase at baseline or during therapy irrespective of antibody status. Thyroid dysfunction was more frequent in patients with positive LKM antibodies (P = 0.004). Initiation of therapy for chronic hepatitis C and outcome were not affected by the presence of ANA, LKM, SMA or AMA. Routine testing of these autoantibodies seems not warranted. Determination of autoantibodies should be guided by individualized clinical decisions.

### Accuracy assessment of total or IgG immunoglobulin to hepatitis A virus tests around immunity threshold [^116tpYDs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody titers at 20 IU/L are assumed to correlate with protection against HAV challenge.

Methods

We examined the accuracy and precision of currently in use immunoassays for total or anti-HAV IgG determination, by repeated testing of dilutions of the international anti-HAV standard, within a 10–50 IU/mL concentration range.

Results and Conclusion

Eight immunoassays were evaluated. All could confidently identify people who need to be vaccinated, or who might benefit from a booster vaccine: no positive interpretation for the 10 and 15 IU/mL concentrations. However, qualitative interpretation may differ from test to test in the 15–30 IU/mL range. This variation has to be taken into account when comparing seroprevalence data.

Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Anti-HBc-nonreactive occult hepatitis B infections with HBV genotypes B and C in vaccinated immunocompetent adults [^114yKvCC]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Follow‐up showed that seven of 15 (47%) vaccinated individuals remained HBV DNA low but detectable two to 65 months post index sample, while 8/15 (53%) became HBV DNA negative (Figure 2). All five unvaccinated individuals follow up had undetectable DNA 8 months post index sample at the latest. Overall, nine of 10 individuals with follow‐up samples keeping stable anti‐HBs levels remained HBV DNA positive two to 65 months post index sample while 6/7 donors with anti‐HBs response became HBV DNA negative, suggesting efficacy of the boosted anti‐HBs response. The transient viraemia observed in 65% (13/20) of isolated anti‐HBs OBI carriers suggests 'aborted' infection that is reminiscent of acute HBV infection previously reported in six vaccinated blood donors who carried isolated anti‐HBs OBI; four of them infected by high viral load HBV sexual partners. Differing from the cases described here, three of four cases with detailed follow‐up developed delayed low‐level anti‐HBc 1–4.5 months post index, while one who was infected with HBV genotype B showed no anti‐HBc reactivity over 9 months follow‐up. In addition, none of these individuals showed persistent viraemia after 135 days of follow‐up. These differences between the two studies may be due to the infected individuals in the Stramer study having been vaccinated as adults and had been exposed to different HBV genotypes and high viral loads. HBV infection in vaccinated individuals could induce faster innate and adaptive immune responses that may limit and possibly suppress viral replication in the presence of pre‐existing low level of anti‐HBs. A rapid suppression of low viraemia may limit the production of HBcAg and prevent the development of a specific immune response. It is possible that the paucity and often long delays of follow‐up sample collection in the present study missed low‐level anti‐HBc and transient viraemia. Hepadnaviral persistence in the absence of detectable serum surface antigen and antibodies to Core has been described in animals inoculated with low dose of woodchuck hepatitis virus and offspring of woodchuck dam convalescent from acute infection. Similarly, exposure of vaccinated subjects to a small amount of virus in the presence of non‐sterilizing anti‐HBs might result in isolated anti‐HBs OBI. The persistence of the isolated anti‐HBs OBI profile observed in 11 unvaccinated donors in the present study and in 9 Southeast Asian donors in a previous study remains puzzling. It is possible that some of these donors, particularly the two younger than 30, might have been vaccinated without recollection or evidence provided. Further studies are needed to determine whether this inability to produce anti‐HBc might be related to a selective defect in the host immune system. Overall, the prevalence of isolated anti‐HBs OBI carriage may be underestimated in vaccinated populations, especially in areas of high HBV endemicity, and these individuals may be at risk for HBV reactivation if immunosuppressed. In addition, HBsAg‐negative/anti‐HBc‐negative blood donors with barely detectable HBV DNA may participate to the residual risk of HBV transfusion‐transmission, although this risk is likely mitigated by the presence of anti‐HBs.

### Retrospective analysis of vertical hepatitis C exposure and infection in children in Western New York [^115gpWWq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C exposed infants and children seen at the pediatric specialty clinics, including the pediatric hepatitis C clinic opened in 2019, had a referral from the hospital where they were born or a referral from the primary care provider. At clinic, all patients underwent a clinical evaluation with physical exam and at the end of the visit parents or guardians received a laboratory requisition for hepatitis C testing, and a request for a follow up visit. Infants born premature and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at the university pediatric hospital in Buffalo, NY had testing done in-house once they reached 2 months of age. The hepatitis C testing included HCV antibody testing for children 18 months of age. If the antibody test result was nonreactive for hepatitis C, the patients were considered clear of infection and no further follow up was recommended. For infants less than 18 months of age, two HCV PCR tests were recommended, one test to be done at 2 months and the second test done 2 months later. Children were considered negative for hepatitis C if one PCR tests was negative for hepatitis C. Children above 18 months of age were diagnosed with hepatitis C if the antibody test was positive and a subsequent HCV PCR was also positive. Infants less than 18 months of age were considered infected with hepatitis C if the first HCV PCR was positive and a second confirmatory HCV PCR was also positive. All patients with confirmed diagnosis of hepatitis C had parents or guardians informed about the disease and were invited to continue to attend the clinic for clinical evaluations, treatment and counselling. The HCV antibody and HCV PCR testing systems available to patients were commercially approved by the New York State and were available at local laboratories within the WNY area. The HCV antibody test was a laboratory-based assay performed at the Kaleida Health Center for Laboratory Medicine (Williamsville, NY). The HCV antibody testing result was reported as: (i) nonreactive, if the signal to cut-off ratio (S/CO ratio) was 0.0 to 0.79; (ii) equivocal, if S/CO ratio was 0.80 to 0.99; and (iii) reactive, if S/CO ratio was > 1.0. The HCV PCR testing used on most patient blood specimens was the Cobas ® TaqMan ® HCV test, v2.0 performed at the Kaleida Health Center for Laboratory Medicine (Williamsville, NY). The quantitative range of the assay was 15 units/mL to 100 million units/mL, and any testing below the level of detection was considered HCV negative.

AASLD–IDSA hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure testing algorithm — For a discrete, recognized exposure, baseline testing should be performed within 48 hours of exposure using HCV RNA, HCV antibody (Ab), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Initial result pairs map to outcomes: HCV Antibody (Ab negative, HCV RNA negative leads to NO HCV infection; HCV Ab positive, HCV RNA negative indicates Prior resolved infection; HCV Ab negative, HCV RNA positive indicates Acute HCV infection already present; and HCV Ab positive HCV RNA positive indicates Prior chronic infection. Follow-up specifies Repeat testing for 6 months to assess new infection and to Test HCV RNA and HCV Ab; if HCV RNA positive or seroconversion, classify as Acute HCV infection and note that HCV treatment recommended for HCV RNA positive. If HCV RNA negative and HCV Ab negative, or no seroconversion for 6 months: NO HCV infection, and for prior resolved infection, if HCV RNA remains negative: NO HCV infection; additionally, implement Counsel on risk reduction and Annual testing for high-risk patients.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^1166x3xB]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Updated recommendations for HIV laboratory diagnosis state that laboratories should conduct initial testing for HIV with an FDA-approved antigen/antibody combination immunoassay that detects HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen, and no further testing is required for specimens that are nonreactive on the initial immunoassay. Specimens with a reactive antigen/antibody combination immunoassay result should be tested with an FDA-approved antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 antibodies from HIV-2 antibodies, and reactive results on both the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay should be interpreted as positive for HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, or HIV antibodies, undifferentiated. If the initial antigen/antibody combination immunoassay is reactive and the HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay is nonreactive or indeterminate, specimens should be tested with an FDA-approved HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT); a reactive HIV-1 NAT with a nonreactive differentiation immunoassay indicates laboratory evidence for acute HIV-1 infection, a reactive HIV-1 NAT with an indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates the presence of HIV-1 infection confirmed by HIV-1 NAT, and a negative HIV-1 NAT with nonreactive or indeterminate differentiation immunoassay indicates a false-positive result on the initial immunoassay. Laboratories should use this same testing algorithm, beginning with an antigen/antibody combination immunoassay, for serum or plasma specimens submitted after a reactive (preliminary positive) rapid HIV test; Exception: As of April 2014, data are insufficient to recommend use of the FDA-approved single-use rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody combination immunoassay as the initial assay in the algorithm.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

Typical interpretation of test results for hepatitis B virus infection

Abbreviations: - = negative; + = positive; anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV DNA = hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid; IgM = immunoglobulin class M.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112EPaYt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — viral hepatitis testing in abnormal liver chemistries specifies assays and high‑risk groups. Testing for chronic hepatitis C is with anti‑HCV and confirmation by HCV‑RNA nucleic acid testing; acute hepatitis C testing is with anti‑HCV and HCV RNA. Risk factors for hepatitis C include those born between 1945 and 1965. For hepatitis B, chronic infection is evaluated with HBsAg, and acute infection with HBsAg and IgM anti‑HBc; high‑risk groups include persons from areas with HBsAg prevalence > 2%. Testing for acute Hepatitis A (IgM HAV) should occur in patients with acute hepatitis and possible fecal–oral exposure. All items are labeled Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Prevaccination Serologic Testing

Among U.S.-born adults aged > 20 years, HAV susceptibility prevalence (i.e. total antibody to HAV was negative) was 74.1% (95% CI: 72.9%–75.3%) during 2007–2016. Prevaccination serologic testing for HAV immunity before vaccination is not routinely recommended; however, it can be considered in specific settings to reduce costs by not vaccinating persons who are already immune. Prevaccination serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially for populations that are difficult to access. If prevaccination testing is performed, commercially available tests for total anti-HAV or IgG anti-HAV should be used.

Persons for whom prevaccination testing will likely be most cost-effective include adults who were either born in or lived for extensive periods in geographic areas where HAV endemicity is high or intermediate. Prevaccination serologic testing of children is not indicated because of the low prevalence of infection among that age group.

For populations who are expected to have high rates of previous HAV infection, vaccination history should be obtained when feasible before testing or vaccination. Vaccination should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained, records are unavailable, or prevaccination testing is infeasible. Vaccinating persons immune from natural infection carries no known risk, nor does giving extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccination of a person who is already immune is not harmful. Persons who have a documented history of ≥ 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine do not need further vaccination or serologic testing.

Postvaccination Serologic Testing

Serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults. Testing for anti-HAV antibody after vaccination is recommended for persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status and persons for whom revaccination might be indicated (e.g. persons with HIV infection and other immunocompromising conditions).

† Susceptible persons include those who have never been infected with HBV (i.e. total anti-HBc negative) and either did not complete a HepB vaccine series per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations or who are known to be vaccine nonresponders.

Interpretation of Screening Tests

The three main serologic markers used to determine HBV infection status are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) (Table 1). Serologic markers change over typical courses of resolved acute infection and progression to chronic infection (Figure 1).

### Diagnosis of hepatitis E [^111iKE12]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis E, caused by infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV), is a common cause of enterically-transmitted acute hepatitis in developing countries. Occasional cases of sporadic hepatitis E have been increasingly recognized in developed countries over the past decade. These cases differ from those in developing countries in being possibly caused by zoonotic transmission, often affecting people with a suppressed immune system and occasionally leading to persistent HEV infection. The commonly used tests for HEV infection include detection of IgM and IgG anti-HEV antibodies and detection of HEV RNA. IgM anti-HEV antibodies can be detected during the first few months after HEV infection, whereas IgG anti-HEV antibodies represent either recent or remote exposure. The presence of HEV RNA indicates current infection, whether acute or chronic. Although several diagnostic assays for anti-HEV antibodies are available, they have undergone fairly limited testing and often provide discordant results, particularly for IgG antibodies. Thus, although the available antibody assays might be useful for case diagnosis in areas with high disease endemicity, their use for case diagnosis in areas with low endemicity and for seroprevalence studies remains problematic. Improved validation of existing anti-HEV antibody assays or development of new assays with superior performance characteristics is urgently needed.
