## Question

EBV titer interpretation negative IgM and positive IgG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an EBV serology pattern with negative IgM and positive IgG, including what this pattern suggests about timing of infection and immunity status. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core EBV antibody markers and their usual timelines. Then, I should verify how the specific combination of VCA IgM negative and VCA IgG positive is typically interpreted and whether EBNA IgG status has been checked. Next, I need to review age, symptom timing, and immune status that could sway the interpretation. After that, I should consider when to add EBV DNA PCR, IgG avidity, immunoblot, or heterophile testing. Finally, I will integrate assay variability and propose a practical, probability-informed algorithm with clinical implications including special populations like transplant candidates and immunocompromised hosts.

> Let me first confirm the serologic framework before I draw conclusions. VCA IgM typically arises early in primary infection and wanes within weeks to a few months, VCA IgG appears early and persists for life, and EBNA-1 IgG usually becomes detectable by several months post-infection and then persists, so the composite pattern matters more than any single marker for phase assignment [^115tnMWo] [^115tnMWo]. Wait, let me verify the role of EA IgG; I initially thought "EA IgG equals active replication", but I should be cautious because EA responses can be variable and context-dependent, and interpretation should be anchored to the full panel and clinical scenario rather than EA alone [^115tnMWo]. Hold on, I should also remember that assay platforms differ and discordances can occur, requiring resolution with reference methods when the clinical context is at odds with the serology pattern [^113nxJ3n].

> Now, to the specific pattern: VCA IgM negative with VCA IgG positive. If EBNA IgG is also positive, that composite — VCA IgM negative, VCA IgG positive, EBNA IgG positive — supports past infection and not acute disease, and I should confirm that this matches the clinical presentation before closing the loop [^114k6HkE]. I need to ensure EBNA status is actually known, because without EBNA IgG, calling this definitively "past infection" could be premature and might miss early or late primary windows in some patients [^115tnMWo].

> Let me now examine the "isolated VCA IgG" configuration — VCA IgG positive with both VCA IgM and EBNA IgG negative — which is the most ambiguous scenario and the one where I should not jump to conclusions. Immunoblot-based adjudication classifies the majority as past infection overall, but there is a meaningful subset representing early primary infection or late convalescence before EBNA IgG seroconversion; importantly, age shifts the probabilities substantially, with children under 10 more often representing acute infection and adults over 30 nearly always representing past infection in this pattern [^114ssRMY]. I should double-check that potential analytical issues or false positives are considered, especially if clinical features are discordant with the serologic pattern, because assay-specific variability can mislead if not carefully reconciled with the patient context [^114ssRMY].

> Next, I should review the clinical context and timing. If symptoms are within the first week, there is a small risk of testing during the IgM window before its appearance; conversely, if symptoms have persisted beyond several weeks and EBNA IgG remains negative, I need to consider late convalescence or atypical seroconversion dynamics, and correlate with age because adolescents and young adults have the highest VCA IgM positivity rates in acute EBV, while primary infection in infants and young children is often subclinical and may be missed serologically early on [^112sEWeA] [^114EWvav]. But wait, what if the host is immunocompromised? I should confirm immune status because immunocompromised patients may have blunted or delayed antibody responses and may require a greater reliance on nucleic acid testing and serial monitoring to correctly classify infection phase or risk for EBV-related disease [^111VQtjo].

> For ambiguous profiles or high-stakes decisions, I need to consider additional testing judiciously. EBV DNA PCR has a high negative predictive value for proven EBV disease in plasma and whole blood, so a negative result can be very reassuring; however, the positive predictive value is limited, and clinical correlation is essential to avoid over-calling disease based on low-level viremia alone [^117M1h6c]. Let me verify the early infection window: in immunocompetent primary EBV infection, serum PCR is typically positive early and becomes negative after roughly 2–3 weeks from symptom onset, making timing critical when I use PCR to adjudicate uncertain serologies [^115DLB13].

> I should also think about second-line serologic tools. IgG avidity can help distinguish recent from remote infection when VCA IgG is present; low avidity supports recent primary infection whereas high avidity supports past infection, and although not universally available, it can be pivotal in "isolated VCA IgG" dilemmas or in pregnancy, so I need to check local availability and turnaround times [^1143FV3D]. Immunoblot profiling across multiple EBV antigens is useful when standard ELISA panels are equivocal, improving classification in a subset of ambiguous cases and aligning with reference immunofluorescence where available, which I should consider if the clinical stakes are high or the presentation is atypical for EBV [^113nxJ3n]. If the heterophile/Monospot is negative but the clinical syndrome screams mononucleosis and the EBV-specific serologies are non-diagnostic, I should proceed with targeted EBV testing rather than dismissing EBV prematurely, acknowledging that up to 10% of true IM can be heterophile-negative early on [^111dVUED].

> Hold on, I should verify assay-specific performance, because platform variability can produce discrepant interpretations in early infection or in categorizing past infection. Independent evaluations show substantial agreement between Elecsys and Liaison for composite serostatus, yet highlight real differences in VCA IgM sensitivity for early primary infection and in VCA/EBNA IgG detection for past infection, necessitating complementary testing for discordant specimens or when clinical suspicion remains high despite an apparently incompatible profile [^113nxJ3n] [^116pTrp5]. I need to ensure that "isolated VCA IgG" called by one platform is not simply a sensitivity artifact, and I should consider confirmatory methods or repeat testing, as studies document assay-dependent isolated patterns and their reclassification after additional analyses such as immunoblot, heterophile testing, or PCR when the stakes are high [^115w8NLR] [^115WSttM].

> Let me integrate this into a practical, probability-based approach. If VCA IgM is negative and VCA IgG is positive with EBNA IgG positive, I can confidently call past infection in the vast majority and avoid further testing unless the presentation is atypical or high-risk decisions depend on precise staging; if EBNA IgG is negative, I should weigh age and timing, with greater suspicion for early primary infection in symptomatic children and adolescents and a higher likelihood of past infection in older adults, guiding me toward EBV DNA PCR and/or IgG avidity, and possibly immunoblot, when the distinction will change management or counseling [^114ssRMY]. I should double-check symptom chronology relative to testing and, if early, consider repeating serology or adding PCR within the first 1–2 weeks to improve accuracy, remembering that a negative plasma PCR strongly argues against active EBV disease in many clinical contexts [^115DLB13] [^117M1h6c].

> Now, clinical implications and follow-up. For confirmed past infection, there is no role for acute EBV-directed therapy, and counseling should emphasize that IgG persists lifelong and reactivation is usually subclinical; the main practice implications are in transplant medicine and oncology risk stratification rather than acute management of mononucleosis-like illness in immunocompetent hosts [^114k6HkE]. In transplant candidates and recipients, precise serostatus assignment (especially EBNA IgG) informs PTLD risk, and in the post-transplant setting, surveillance with EBV DNA monitoring can enable early detection and preemptive strategies; I need to ensure the testing matrix and thresholds align with local protocols and patient-specific immunosuppression [^115fGhK2] [^114wfiT3] [^111xHYYH].

> Special populations deserve added caution. In pregnant patients with an "isolated VCA IgG" pattern and compatible symptoms, I should not jump to conclusions; instead, I should verify with avidity and consider PCR to distinguish recent from remote infection, given counseling implications, and repeat testing if the initial study is too early in the course [^1143FV3D]. In immunocompromised patients, I should rely more on nucleic acid testing and serial trends rather than serology alone for diagnosis and monitoring, and I will reconsider the interpretation if antibody responses are blunted or atypical on serial testing [^111VQtjo].

> In summary, VCA IgM negative with VCA IgG positive most often signals past EBV infection if EBNA IgG is present, while an "isolated VCA IgG" pattern necessitates caution and context — age, timing, immune status, and clinical syndrome — often prompting EBV DNA PCR and/or IgG avidity or immunoblot to adjudicate, with assay variability and discordances requiring deliberate verification before final classification [^114k6HkE] [^114ssRMY] [^117M1h6c] [^113nxJ3n].

A serologic pattern of **negative EBV IgM and positive IgG** indicates a **past EBV infection** [^114k6HkE] with established latency and lifelong immunity, not an acute or recent infection [^114k6HkE]. This is the most common EBV serologic profile in adults [^112sEWeA] and requires **no treatment or isolation**. In immunocompromised patients, consider **EBV DNA testing** [^117M1h6c] if reactivation is suspected, but in immunocompetent hosts, no further testing is needed unless clinically indicated [^111VQtjo].

## Serological markers of EBV infection

EBV serology relies on **antibodies** against distinct viral antigens, each reflecting a specific stage of infection:

| **Antibody marker** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| VCA IgM | - Acute primary infection <br/> - Appears early and declines within weeks [^114k6HkE] [^116ug8Ue] |
| VCA IgG | - Past infection <br/> - Appears during acute infection and persists for life [^11241bMs] [^115fGhK2] |
| EBNA IgG | - Past infection <br/> - Appears 2–4 months after infection and persists for life [^11241bMs] [^112JeUeP] |
| EA IgG | - Active viral replication or reactivation <br/> - Transiently elevated [^111VQtjo] |

## Interpretation of negative EBV IgM and positive IgG

The combination of negative EBV IgM and positive IgG indicates **past infection** [^115tnMWo] with established latency and lifelong immunity [^11241bMs]. This pattern is typical in adults and older children [^1178HwA1], reflecting prior exposure and immune control.

---

## Clinical implications

- **No acute infection**: The patient is not experiencing acute EBV infection [^115tnMWo].
- **No recent infection**: The patient has not had a recent EBV infection [^11241bMs].
- **No infectious risk**: The patient is not contagious and does not require isolation.
- **No treatment required**: No antiviral therapy or specific treatment is needed [^115HZji5].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While this pattern generally indicates past infection, certain scenarios may warrant further evaluation — for example, **immunocompromised patients** [^114wfiT3], in whom reactivation can occur and EBV DNA testing [^117M1h6c] should be considered if clinically suspected [^111VQtjo], and **atypical serologic patterns**, in which, rarely, an isolated VCA IgG without EBNA IgG may reflect past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or acute infection with delayed IgM; immunoblotting can help clarify [^114ssRMY] [^116pTrp5].

---

## Recommended follow-up and management

For immunocompetent patients, **no further testing** or follow-up is needed [^115tnMWo]. For immunocompromised patients or when reactivation is suspected, consider EBV DNA testing [^117M1h6c] and clinical monitoring [^111xHYYH].

---

A negative EBV IgM with positive IgG indicates **past infection** [^11241bMs] with established latency and lifelong immunity, not acute or recent infection [^114k6HkE]. No treatment or isolation is needed, but consider EBV DNA testing in immunocompromised patients if reactivation is suspected [^111VQtjo] [^117M1h6c].

### A systematic study of Epstein-Barr virus serologic assays following acute infection [^11241bMs]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM) and IgG antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during the acute illness and at 1, 2, 6, and 48 months in a prospective population-based case series of 95 persons with an acute illness serologically confirmed as Epstein-Barr virus infection.

The acute illness was characterized by the presence of VCA-IgG and VCA-IgM (by ELISA) and by the absence of EBNA in most, but not all, patients. During follow-up, VCA-IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients, while the proportion with VCA-IgM declined and the number with detectable EBNA antibodies steadily increased. The primary differences between the two serologic test methods were the increased persistence of VCA-IgM during follow-up by ELISA and the earlier detection of EBNA by IFA. Clinicians should consider the illness stage and the laboratory technique to appropriately interpret serologic test results in suspected cases of mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.

### Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus infections using decision trees: an effective way to avoid antibiotic overuse in paediatric tonsillopharyngitis [^114k6HkE]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Microbiological investigations were conducted to detect EBV and CMV specific antibodies using an ETI-MAX 3000 microtiter plate analyzer (DiaSorin, Italy). Epstein-Barr Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) (Vircell, Spain), and Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) ELISA IgG (Vircell, Spain) were employed to identify EBV specific antibodies. Cytomegalovirus ELISA IgM capture and IgG (Vircell, Spain) were utilized to detect CMV-specific antibodies.

Primary EBV infection was confirmed by a positive/borderline anti-VCA IgM result and an anti-VCA IgG-positive result with negative anti-EBNA IgG test results. In cases of isolated anti-VCA IgM results, control serology was recommended. The presence of anti-VCA IgG and anti-EBNA IgG with negative anti-VCA IgM serology indicated a past infection. Anti-CMV IgM was positive, and seroconversion was detected in the second specimen of the primary CMV infection. Past infection was confirmed by the presence of anti-CMV-specific IgG without anti-CMV IgM.

To exclude other causes, throat swabs were cultured using 5% sheep Columbia blood agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), chocolate (PolyViteX, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and Sabouraud agar. Except for Sabouraud agar, agar plates were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ cabinet for 24 hours. In the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes, identification of the isolated strain was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility testing and evaluation of the results were conducted as part of the study.

### Molecular diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases [^111VQtjo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and may also be found in a wide variety of benign and malignant lesions, including oral hairy leukoplakia, inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Molecular testing is increasingly important in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients affected by these diseases.

- **Gold standard detection**: In biopsy tissues, molecular detection of EBV-encoded RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for proving that a histopathological lesion is EBV-related. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization and EBV LMP1 immunostains are used routinely to detect latent EBV in tissues affected by posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or in enlarged nodes from patients with infectious mononucleosis.

- **Serology and viral load tests**: Traditional serology is the best test for evaluating acute versus remote infection in healthy individuals. High serological titers serve as a tumor marker for some EBV-related malignancies, but titers are not a dependable tumor marker in immunocompromised hosts. EBV viral load testing by quantitative DNA amplification of blood samples is a promising new laboratory test that has proven useful for early diagnosis and monitoring patients with PTLD.

- **Future research**: Recent studies suggest a role for EBV viral load testing in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and AIDS patients with brain lymphoma. Further research is needed to define more fully the clinical utility of viral load tests in the full spectrum of EBV-associated diseases.

### A prospective evaluation of the diagnostic potential of EBV-DNA in plasma and whole blood [^117M1h6c]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA is an important diagnostic tool for EBV-associated disease, but interpretation of its clinical significance is challenging.

- **Objectives**: We assessed the diagnostic and clinical performance of WHO-standardized qPCR for EBV-DNA (WHO EBV-qPCR) in plasma and whole blood (WB) for proven EBV disease in a prospectively accrued patient cohort.

- **Study design**: Central Denmark Region patients, tested with WHO EBV-qPCR from November 2017 to March 2019, were screened for EBV disease. Incidence (IR) was estimated by Poisson regression. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for EBV-qPCR in plasma and WB. Risk of diagnostic latency was compared between patients with EBV-positive and EBV-negative lymphomas.

- **Results**: EBV disease was diagnosed in 95 of 1484 participants (IR: 16.3 per 1000 patient years; 95% CI: 13.3–19.9). Sensitivity and specificity of WHO EBV-qPCR in plasma were 82.4% (95% CI; 74.2–90.7%) and 87.8% (95% CI; 85.6–90%), yielding a PPV of 32.2% (95% CI; 24.9–39.5%) and NPV of 98.6% (95% CI; 97.7–99.5%) for proven EBV disease. Sensitivity and NPV were comparable in WB, while specificity and PPV decreased to 66.9% (95% CI; 60.6–73.1%) and 18.1% (95% CI; 7.5–28.7%). Risk of diagnostic latency was 2.3-fold (95% CI: 1.4–4.1) higher for patients with EBV-positive compared with EBV-negative lymphomas.

- **Conclusions**: WHO EBV-qPCR in plasma and WB have a low PPV but a high NPV for proven EBV disease. Implementation of WHO EBV-qPCR could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce latency in clinical settings.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in infancy [^114EWvav]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to be the cause of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and has more complicated associations with several malignant diseases. These EBV-associated diseases provide a strong incentive for the development of an EBV vaccine. Most primary EBV infections during infancy and early childhood are mild or subclinical. Little is known about its infection in infancy, but the pattern of EBV serological response during this period may be important for vaccine management.

- **Objectives**: This study clarifies the epidemiology and serology of primary EBV infection during early infancy.

- **Study design**: Longitudinal serum samples from 66 Hong Kong infants were tested for EBV antibodies by immunofluorescence. Cord blood and sequential serum samples from these infants were taken at birth and then at 4-month intervals up to 2 years of age.

- **Results**: Maternal antibodies were present at different levels in all cord blood specimens and in serum samples of 8 infants at 4 months of age. Evidenced by VCA-IgG seroconversion, 60.6% (40/66) of infants were infected during the first 2 years of life. One episode occurred before 8 months of age. Thereafter, for the remaining 16 months of follow-up until the infants were 2 years of age, the infection occurred at essentially a constant rate, affecting about 20% of the remaining seronegative infants every 4 months.

- **Conclusions**: The abrupt onset of the infection following a delay of 8 months is a remarkable feature of primary EBV infection during infancy, which implicates a protective role for maternal antibodies.

### Epstein-Barr virus: Dermatologic associations and implications: Part I. Mucocutaneous manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus and nonmalignant disorders [^115HZji5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus that has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, many of which have mucocutaneous manifestations. As a member of the Herpesviridae family, EBV causes lifelong infection by establishing latency in B lymphocytes. An intact immune response is critical in preventing the progression of EBV disease, and the clinical manifestations of infection are dependent on the intricate relationship between the virus and the host immune system. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnostic testing in EBV infection. In part I of this continuing medical education article, the mucocutaneous manifestations of EBV infection are reviewed with an emphasis on pathophysiology and management.

### Evaluation of a multiplex fluorescent microsphere immunoassay for the determination of Epstein-Barr virus serologic status [^112JeUeP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, affects up to 95% of adults. Diagnosing acute EBV infection can be challenging and often relies on the serologic antibody pattern to three distinct antigens, most often determined by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and, more recently, multiplex assays. We compared a multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA), nuclear antigen (EBNA), and early antigen (EA) of EBV with ELISAs, using IFA for resolving discrepancies.

Concordance of the multiplex assay was good for all four antigens:

- **VCA IgM**: 86.6% vs. ELISA and 92.9% vs. IFA
- **VCA IgG**: 92.8% vs. ELISA and 98.0% vs. IFA
- **EBNA IgG**: 90.3% vs. ELISA and 98.1% vs. IFA
- **EA IgG**: 83.8% vs. ELISA and 92.8% vs. IFA

After IFA resolution, the correlation between the multiplex assay and ELISA for serologic disease stage, based on the antibody profile of all four analytes, was 90%. The multiplex assay showed good correlation with an established ELISA and even better correlation with the "gold standard" IFA. Advantages of the multiplex assay over traditional methods include multiple results per assay, inclusion of internal controls for each assay, and well-to-well monitoring of assay drift.

### Epstein-Barr virus: An important vaccine target for cancer prevention [^115CWWLm]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Participants at the February 2011 meeting at the U.S. National Institutes of Health on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine research recommend that future clinical trials have two goals: prevention of infectious mononucleosis and EBV-associated cancers, facilitated by identification of disease-predictive surrogate markers.

### Elevated EBNA-1 IgG in MS is associated with genetic MS risk variants [^1124gGvu]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The etiology of MS involves genetic factors and exposure to environmental elements, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Genetic risk factors for MS include specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and currently, approximately 100 mainly adaptive immune-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with modest odds ratios (ORs) compared with the major HLA-DRB1✱1501 association and EBV exposure.

Almost all patients with MS are infected with EBV, compared with 90%–95% in healthy controls (HCs). A history of EBV-related infectious mononucleosis (IM) and elevated EBV nuclear antigen 1 immunoglobulin γ (IgG) levels increase the risk of developing MS later in life. Recently, a meta-analysis showed that antibodies against the latency-associated Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) are consistently increased in patients with MS compared with healthy EBV carriers, whereas results for the lytic viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen D (EA-D) are more heterogeneous.

Epidemiologic and genetic studies support interactions between EBV and HLA-DRB1✱15 on an additive scale. Whether the MS risk SNPs are associated with enhanced IgG levels against EBV is currently unclear. We hypothesized that certain MS risk SNPs are involved in the increased humoral immune response against EBV. Serum IgG levels against the EBV antigen EBNA-1 were measured and associations with MS risk SNPs were assessed.

### Antibody responses to Epstein-Barr virus in the preclinical period of rheumatoid arthritis suggest the presence of increased viral reactivation cycles [^1157BZFU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrate altered immune responses to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the presence and role of EBV during the preclinical disease period have not been fully explored. This study was undertaken to determine if EBV infection, as evidenced by an altered anti-EBV antibody response, either plays an important role in driving the development of RA or is a result of expanded RA-related autoimmunity.

A total of 83 subjects with RA, according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 83 age-, sex-, and race-matched control subjects without RA were included in our study. We collected sera from RA subjects and matched controls during the pre-RA and post-RA diagnosis periods. The sera were tested for the presence of five anti-EBV antibodies (anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 IgG isotype, anti-viral capsid antigen [anti-VCA] isotypes IgG and IgA, and anti-early antigen [EA] isotypes IgG and IgA), seven RA-related autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor measured by nephelometry [RF-Neph] as well as isotype-specific IgA-RF, IgM-RF, and IgG-RF, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibodies, including anti-CCP2, anti-CCP3, and anti-CCP3.1), 22 cytokines/chemokines, 36 individual anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, and IgG-cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies. Random forest classification, mixed modeling, and joint mixed modeling were used to determine differences in anti-EBV antibody levels between RA subjects and controls.

Random forest analysis identified the presence of preclinical EBV antibodies.

### Absolute level of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is not predictive of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma [^1121Z943]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

To study whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load can be used to predict the occurrence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AIDS-NHL), we determined EBV load longitudinally for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. EBV load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was high and displayed considerable fluctuations over time, indicating that absolute EBV load in PBMC is not predictive of the development of AIDS-NHL. EBV DNA was also detectable in serum at some time points but at a lower level.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115w8NLR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pretransplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician‐ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti‐VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti‐Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status. In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1). Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance.

### Anti-EBV antibodies: Roles in diagnosis, pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy [^114Gf2ct]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is prevalent in the global population and is associated with multiple malignancies and autoimmune diseases. During the infection, an EBV-harbored or infected cell-expressing antigen can elicit a variety of antibodies that play a significant role in the viral host response and pathogenesis. These antibodies have been extensively evaluated and found to be valuable in predicting disease diagnosis and prognosis, exploring disease mechanisms, and developing antiviral agents. This review discusses the versatile roles of EBV antibodies as important biomarkers for EBV-related diseases, potential driving factors of autoimmunity, and promising therapeutic agents for viral infection and pathogenesis.

### Epstein-Barr virus colonization of tonsillar and peripheral blood B-cell subsets in primary infection and persistence [^114T36KS]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) persists in the immune host by preferentially colonizing the isotype-switched (IgD(-)CD27(+)) memory B-cell pool. In one scenario, this is achieved through virus infection of naive (IgD(+)CD27(-)) B cells and their differentiation into memory via germinal center (GC) transit; in another, EBV avoids GC transit and infects memory B cells directly. We report two findings consistent with this latter view. First, we examined circulating non-isotype-switched (IgD(+)CD27(+)) memory cells, a population that much evidence suggests is GC-independent in origin. Whereas isotype-switched memory had the highest viral loads by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, EBV was detectable in the nonswitched memory pool both in infectious mononucleosis (IM) patients undergoing primary infection and in most long-term virus carriers. Second, we examined colonization by EBV of B-cell subsets sorted from a unique collection of IM tonsillar cell suspensions. Here viral loads were concentrated in B cells with the CD38 marker of GC origin but lacking other GC markers CD10 and CD77. These findings, supported by histologic evidence, suggest that EBV infection in IM tonsils involves extrafollicular B cells expressing CD38 as an activation antigen and not as a marker of ectopic GC activity.

### Positive correlation between Epstein-Barr virus viral load and anti-viral capsid immunoglobulin G titers determined for Hodgkin's lymphoma patients and their relatives [^113TZpv6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Markers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection include measures of specific serological titers and viral load (VLo) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Few studies have investigated the correlation between these two phenotypes. Here, we found that there was no correlation between VLo and either anti-EBV nuclear antigen type 1 or anti-early antigen immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers. However, anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers increased with VLo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (P = 3.10×10⁻³).

A similar pattern was observed in healthy first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of patients (P = 6.10×10⁻⁴). Our results indicate that anti-VCA IgG titers and EBV VLo are specifically correlated EBV phenotypes.

### Host genetics of Epstein-Barr virus infection, latency and disease [^113iW84A]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma

Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a tumor originating from B lymphocytes. Not all HLs are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, and the percentage of lymphomas positive for the virus varies by HL subtype, with EBV found in 50–80% of mixed-cellularity type HL. EBV-positive HL is more common than EBV-negative HL in young children and older adults, with the opposite pattern seen in adolescents. Epidemiologically, EBV is linked with HL, showing a relative risk of HL following infectious mononucleosis (IM) of 2.55.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms associated with the genetic risk of developing IM are also linked with the development of EBV-positive HL. A large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of EBV-positive and EBV-negative HL identified variants rs2734986 in HLA-A and rs6904029 in the HLA complex group 9 (HCG9) as associated with EBV-positive HL. The rs1800896 IL10 promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), associated with high IL10 expression, is more common in EBV-positive HL than in EBV-negative cases. The CC allele of IL6 SNP rs1800795 was associated with a lower risk of developing EBV-positive HL (odds ratio = 0.29) as a young adult, based on a study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins and matched controls.

A small candidate gene study of FCGR2A (known as CD32) examined the frequency of SNP rs1801274 in classical HL. This polymorphism leads to a histidine to arginine (H to R) substitution within FCGR2A, decreasing the affinity of the receptor for human immunoglobulin G. When comparing 23 EBV-positive and 81 EBV-negative HL cases, 87% of EBV-positive cases carried at least one arginine-encoding allele compared with 68% of EBV-negative HL cases (p = 0.06).

### Epstein-Barr-negative MS: A true phenomenon [^112dfDbw]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Only 1 of 1,047 patients (< 0.01%) was truly EBV-negative. Previous literature demonstrates a strong association between MS and EBV infection. In keeping with this, 41 patients (3.9%) showed no EBNA1-reactivity on initial screen. More detailed testing revealed a much higher rate of EBV seropositivity in CIS and MS patients than previously described.

There is significant antigenic diversity of anti-EBV-IgG responses in EBV carriers and patients with EBV-related disease. Serologic testing against multiple antigens is recommended to accurately define EBV status when examining the link between EBV infection and other diseases. In studies examining MS risk and EBV infection, the rate of EBV positivity in the population is highly dependent on the method used to determine EBV serostatus.

ELISA against two different EBV antigens provides a screening method; immunoblot on apparently seronegative samples increases sensitivity. The ETI-EBNA-G ELISA was validated for Food and Drug Administration approval against a cell-based EBNA1-anticomplement immunofluorescence. The cutoff value for this ELISA is likely set relatively high, giving borderline values a negative interpretation. The in-house ELISA that we used utilizes the same peptide antigen but was validated against purified EBNA1, increasing sensitivity and explaining the correlation between EBNA1 titers in the two ELISAs. Some EBNA1-IgG–negative sera are positive against other EBV antigens.

The fact that patients who were EBNA1-screen–negative were less likely to have OCBs provides an avenue for future research.

### Analysis of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^112sEWeA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases and demonstrates a considerable prevalence among various populations. Advances in molecular epidemiological research have enhanced our comprehension of EBV-related pathologies. In this study, our objective was to examine the epidemiological profile and clinical features of EBV infection in Chongqing, China. We enrolled patients suspected of EBV-related diseases who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between May 2013 and November 2022. Inclusion criteria were based on those who underwent EBV-specific immunofluorescence or plasma EBV-DNA testing.

Among 13,584 inpatients, the overall seropositivity rates for EBNA-1-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EBV-EA-IgG, EBV-EA-IgA, EBV-VCA-IgA, and EBV-DNA were 91.89%, 7.22%, 18.00%, 16.19%, 30.78%, and 18.00%, respectively. The seropositivity rate for EBNA-1-IgG steadily increased with age. The seropositivity rate for VCA-IgM, an indicator of acute EBV infection, was highest in patients aged 11–20 years at 26.41%, decreasing to 2%-6% in older patients. Additionally, among 205 outpatients, the EBV-DNA positivity rate was 14.15%.

In 3,670 individuals from health check-up centers, the seropositivity rates for EBV-EA-IgA and EBV-VCA-IgA were 11.96% and 28.09%, respectively, and the EBV-DNA positivity rate was 11.92%, all of which were lower than those in inpatients. Among the 762 EBV-DNA positive inpatients, adults aged 31–40 years were the least affected, with a seropositivity rate of 12.00%, which increased with age.

### Natural history of Epstein-Barr virus replication and viral load dynamics after alemtuzumab-based allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^111xHYYH]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021).

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load monitoring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) enables earlier detection of EBV replication and often serves as a trigger for preemptive therapies aimed at reducing EBV-related diseases. Our institutional strategy is to treat patients with clinical signs of EBV-related disease accompanied by a rising viral load, rather than intervening based solely on viral load. This approach affords an opportunity to study the natural history of EBV replication and assess whether our strategy reduces overtreatment without compromising outcomes.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the natural history of untreated EBV replication in patients who underwent alemtuzumab-based allogeneic HSCT and to examine whether our clinical strategy reduced overtreatment without compromising patient outcomes. In this retrospective single-center observational study of 515 consecutive patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing T cell-depleted allogeneic HSCT incorporating alemtuzumab, patients underwent surveillance monitoring for EBV by quantitative PCR in the peripheral blood at least weekly up to 100 days post-transplantation and longer if they remained on immunosuppressive therapy. The cumulative incidence of EBV detection and EBV-related disease were assessed.

Among the 515 patients, 192 had detectable EBV DNA on ≥ 1 occasion, with a cumulative incidence of 35.8% (31.8% to 40.4%), although this remained below the limit of quantification in 93 patients. The median time to first detection was 89.5 days (range, 0 to 2254 days).

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^113jbgAV]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), infects more than 95% of adult individuals and persists over the lifetime in the infected host. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic but can cause infectious mononucleosis (IM), occurring most often in young adults. EBV is an oncogenic virus associated with epithelial cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 10% of gastric cancer cases, as well as lymphomas including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. A history of IM has been associated with an increase in the risk of EBV-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis. Two recent reports supported the evidence that EBV is an etiological factor in multiple sclerosis.

EBV serology is mainly used for IM diagnosis and determination of the EBV status in the context of solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Its usefulness has also been explored in EBV-associated malignancies, in particular in nasopharyngeal carcinoma with the anti-EBV IgA-specific antibody marker in combination with serum EBV DNA. EBV serology testing makes it possible to detect antibodies against different antigens produced at various stages of EBV infection such as viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), and EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA). In clinical practice, three markers are commonly evaluated for the serological diagnosis: anti-VCA IgM, anti-VCA (EA) immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-EBNA-1 IgG antibodies.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^114x9GtR]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein–Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is a rare condition characterized by persistent EBV infection in previously healthy individuals. Defective EBV genomes were found in East Asian patients with CAEBV. In the present study, we sequenced 14 blood EBV samples from three UK patients with CAEBV, comparing the results with saliva CAEBV samples and other conditions. We observed EBV deletions in blood, some of which may disrupt viral replication, but not in saliva in CAEBV. Deletions were lost over time after successful treatment. These findings are compatible with CAEBV being associated with the evolution and persistence of EBV+ haematological clones that are lost on successful treatment.

### Serum IgA antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early lytic antigens are present in primary EBV infection [^11336gqg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is characterized by the presence of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen and the absence of antibodies to EB nuclear antigen. Using a flow cytometry-based assay, we investigated whether IgA antibodies are a marker for primary infection. Serum IgA antibodies in 15 individuals with primary EBV infection reacted with 15%-55.6% of HH514–16 Burkitt lymphoma cells expressing early lytic antigens (EAs), whereas IgA antibodies in serum samples from 15 healthy EBV-seropositive individuals reacted with 0.02%-2% of cells with EAs (p < 0.0001). IgA antibodies in primary infection were directed against the Bam Z Epstein-Barr replication activator (ZEBRA) (BZLF1) and diffuse EA (BMRF1) EAs. Thus, IgA antibodies to EBV EAs are produced during primary EBV infection and are likely to be stimulated as a result of lytic EBV replication in mucosal sites. Detection of IgA antibodies to EA may be developed into a diagnostic tool for primary EBV infection.

### The influence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus on childhood respiratory health: A population-based prospective cohort study [^113Za7Sr]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

In this population-based prospective cohort study, we observed that seropositivity for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in early childhood was associated with higher lung function at school age. This association was particularly pronounced in cases where seropositivity for EBV was accompanied by seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV). Neither EBV nor CMV seropositivity alone was associated with asthma. However, seropositivity for CMV, in the absence of EBV seropositivity, was associated with an increased risk of inhalant allergic sensitization. The relationships between these viruses and respiratory health were entirely explained by factors such as ethnicity, sociodemographic, health-related, and lifestyle-related factors.

### Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 infections in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [^111xUShs]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

ELISA testing was used to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) class antibodies specific to CMV, EBV, and HHV-6. All serum samples were tested using commercial ELISA kits for the following virus-specific antibodies: CMV IgM and IgG, and EBV capsid antigen (CA) IgM and IgG (EUROIMMUN, Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lubeck, Germany); HHV-6 IgG and IgM (VIDIA, Vestec, Czech Republic). The EBV-CA positive samples were further tested for the presence of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) IgG (EUROIMMUN, Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG).

The performance and interpretation of results for all tests were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each ELISA was run with negative and positive controls, and a calibrator (cutoff) was also used. For each measurement of antibody concentration, a ratio (R) (EUROIMMUN) and index value (Iv) (VIDIA) were calculated by dividing the sample optical density (OD) value by the cutoff OD value. Serum samples with R ≥ 1.1 (EUROIMMUN) and Iv > 1 (VIDIA) were regarded as positive. Test results with R/Iv > 5.0 were, for the purpose of this study, considered as highly positive. Samples with equivocal results were retested.

### How I treat EBV lymphoproliferation [^114wfiT3]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation is a life-threatening complication following hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. This condition arises from the outgrowth of EBV-infected B cells that would normally be controlled by EBV-cytotoxic T cells. Over the past decade, early detection strategies, such as the serial measurement of EBV-DNA load in peripheral blood samples, have facilitated the identification of high-risk patients and the early diagnosis of lymphoproliferation.

Treatment options focus on manipulating the balance between the outgrowing EBV-infected B cells and the EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. Additionally, they involve targeting the B cells with monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapy. Major challenges persist in defining the indications for preemptive therapies and in integrating both novel and conventional therapies.

### Host genetics of Epstein-Barr virus infection, latency and disease [^114GR6Wc]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

To further our understanding of the mechanisms by which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes pathology and predict which individuals are at greatest risk of EBV-mediated disease, an increased focus on the host genetics of EBV infection is required. The methodology of these studies must shift from candidate genes interrogated for associations with a disparate range of disorders in small populations to genome-wide approaches. Only large, well-powered studies can reliably identify common genetic polymorphisms contributing to the risk of EBV-related disease, with the hope of improving screening and treatment of these conditions. As the cost of such studies continues to fall, the next 50 years of EBV research may see more progress in this area.

### Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis [^114pzKT4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines the considerable evidence linking Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection to the risk and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). The background of the virus and its interactions with the human host is available in the online supplement. Critically reviewed evidence suggests that the similarity in geographic patterns of occurrence of MS and EBV infection, using infectious mononucleosis or EBV-specific serology as surrogate markers, is very limited. However, there is strong evidence that individuals with MS are more likely to report a past history of infectious mononucleosis, which is thought to represent initial EBV infection at an older age. Higher titres of EBV-specific antibodies are associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Elevated levels of these antibodies are apparent many years before MS onset, compared with non-MS controls. Furthermore, there is a dose-response relationship between MS risk and antibody titre, with antibodies to the EBV nuclear antigen-1 being particularly important.

The evidence regarding the EBV DNA load in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is conflicting, as is the evidence related to T cell responses to EBV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the links between EBV and MS risk, and these are reviewed. Additionally, gaps requiring further research are identified.

### Epstein-Barr virus serostatus: no difference despite aberrant patterns in athletes and control group [^1143FV3D]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serostatus in an athletic endurance population, with a particular focus on the prevalence of complex aberrant EBV antibody patterns. Additionally, the study aimed to determine whether serology in athletes is more complex than in the general population.

- **Methods**: The study protocol included serological testing of 202 advanced endurance athletes, involved in sports such as biathlon, cycling, and nordic skiing, at state to international levels (mean age 19 ± 4). This was compared to 200 control subjects (mean age 23 ± 2). Twenty-microliter serum samples were examined using a strip immunoassay with recombinant antigens for detection of EBV IgG antibodies, including anti-EBNA-1 (anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1), anti-p18, anti-p23, anti-p138, anti-p54, and anti-BZLF-1. Avidity determination was employed to differentiate between acute, recent, and past infections.

- **Results**: Among athletes, the study found 35 negative (17%), 6 unresolvable (3%), 1 acute (0.5%), 11 recent (5%), 122 past (61%), and 27 aberrant past (mainly anti-EBNA-1 negative) (13.5%) cases. The control group exhibited 31 negative (16%), 4 unresolvable (2%), 1 acute (0.5%), 1 recent (0.5%), 135 past (68%), and 28 (14.0%) aberrant past cases. Although endurance athletes included more recent infections (several months since acute infection), there was no significant difference (P = 0.144) in the total constellation of EBV serostatus between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: No evidence supported the assumption that endurance athletes are more susceptible to EBV infections than the general population. Additionally, no differences were found between the two groups regarding EBV serostatus.

### Epstein-Barr virus and disease activity in multiple sclerosis [^112ojtfK]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether exacerbations and brain activity in relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS), as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are associated with plasma levels of anti-Epstein Barr (EBV) antibodies and EBV DNA.

This was a prospective study involving 73 RR MS patients who were followed for an average of 1.7 years with frequent neurological examination and blood sampling. Antibodies to various EBV proteins were measured by ELISA and plasma EBV DNA was measured by PCR.

All MS patients had IgG antibodies to EBV, including viral capsid antigen (VCA) and/or EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), irrespective of whether samples were taken during stable disease or exacerbation. A significantly elevated percentage of the patients (48%) had antibodies against EBV antigens (early antigen, EA), indicating active viral replication compared with age-matched healthy controls (25%). Antibodies against a control herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, were similar between the two groups. The percentage of EA-positive individuals and EA titres did not differ between stable disease and exacerbation. Anti-VCA IgM was positive in three cases, unrelated to disease activity. Using a highly sensitive PCR on 51 samples taken at exacerbation visits, only three patients were found to have one time point with viraemia, which was unrelated to disease activity. Of special note, anti-EA seropositive patients remained seropositive during follow-up, with stable titres over time. We hypothesized that these patients may constitute a subgroup with higher disease activity.

### Serological diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infection by novel ELISAs based on recombinant capsid antigens p23 and p18 [^116ug8Ue]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

A new pair of Epstein-Barr virus ELISAs (Biotest Anti-EBV VCA IgG and VCA IgM ELISA) was evaluated for its usefulness in the routine diagnosis of acute EBV infections. The ELISAs are based on two viral capsid antigens (VCA), p23 (BLRF2, full-length) and p18 (BFRF3, carboxy-half), combined by autologous gene fusion. In total, 179 sera were tested in direct comparison with classical VCA immunofluorescence assays (IFA). With the assistance of clinical data and additional reference serology, such as heterophile antibodies, anti-EA IgG (IFA), and anti-EBNA-1 IgG (ELISA), patients were divided into the following categories: seronegatives (46), acute primary infections (67), previous infections (39), suspected reactivations (20), and constellations with intermediate serological patterns (7).

The VCA IgG and VCA IgM ELISAs showed an overall agreement with IFA of 95.0% and 94.4%, respectively. The calculated analytical performance (sensitivity; specificity) of VCA IgG and VCA IgM was 94.0%; 97.8% and 97.1%; 96.5%, respectively. A certain delay in seroconversion of anti-p23-p18 IgG may account for a significant difference in sensitivity of the VCA IgG ELISA between primary (88.4%) and previous infections (100%). In summary, the new recombinant VCA ELISAs yielded a good correlation to VCA IFA and, in combination with EBNA-1 IgG, allow rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis or EBV immune status in general.

### Prolonged illness after infectious mononucleosis is associated with altered immunity but not with increased viral load [^111MYuop]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection causes a spectrum of characteristics that range from asymptomatic seroconversion to severe infectious mononucleosis (IM), sometimes with prolonged symptoms and disability. We examined the relationships between clinical course, number of viral copies, and immunological parameters in a prospective cohort of subjects with recent IM.

- **Methods**: Eight case patients with at least 6 months of disabling symptoms and 31 matched control subjects who had recovered promptly were included. Symptom scores were recorded at regular intervals over the course of 12 months. Cellular EBV load, EBV-specific antibody responses, lymphocyte subsets, and EBV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma induction were measured.

- **Results**: In case patients with prolonged illness, the severity of acute-phase symptoms was greater, the development of anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 immunoglobulin G was more rapid, and the time to development of the peak IFN-gamma response to the majority of latent-cycle EBV peptides was generally slower than those in control subjects. However, in both groups, neither viral nor immune parameters correlated with the severity or duration of symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The resolution of symptomatic IM is not determined by control of viremia, nor is it easily explained by altered host responses to EBV infection. The detailed determinants of delayed recovery remain to be elucidated.

### Evaluation of the Architect EBV VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassays to assess EBV serostatus prior transplantation [^115fGhK2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Prior to the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells or solid organs, donor and recipient EBV serostatus must be determined to assess the risks of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. The sensitivity of EBV Viral Capsid Antigens (VCA) IgG and EBV Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is critical for defining past infection, and good specificity of VCA IgM is required to avoid the disqualification of cord blood (CB) units.

The Architect™ EBV antibody panel, which provides high throughput, was compared to a semi-automated ELISA (Etimax assays by Diasorin) to assess the sensitivities and specificities of VCA and EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgM on 419 sera collected from immunocompromised patients (n = 184) and pregnant women who agreed to donate CB cells (n = 235). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.63% to 4.8% for VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG.

The indices of VCA IgG, VCA IgM, and EBNA IgG from both assays were highly correlated. The concordance in interpretation between the two assays was moderate for VCA IgM (kappa = 0.5), substantial for VCA IgG (kappa = 0.60), and good for EBNA-1 IgG (kappa = 0.75). Using serial dilutions of positive controls and in accordance with clinical results, VCA IgG and EBNA IgG were detected at lower dilutions with the Architect assay than with Etimax. Conversely, 96.1% (74/77) of samples negative with Architect and positive with Etimax for VCA IgM did not have any heterophile antibodies and had VCA IgG and EBNA IgG antibodies supporting past infections.

The Architect™ EBV serology panel provided good sensitivities and specificities for EBV serostatus determination.

### Novel Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin G-based approach for the specific detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^111QMo9R]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

This study was designed to find a reliable Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G-based diagnostic/screening test for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) able to demarcate between the NPC-related seropositivity of EBV IgG antibodies and that of other head and neck cancer (HNCA) and control groups. The NPC-associated immunosuppression affects EBV IgA much more than IgG, leading to inconsistent detection of NPC using EBV IgA antibodies.

- **Materials and methods**: One hundred twenty-two HNCA patients, including 42 with NPC, 66 with laryngeal carcinoma, and 14 with hypopharyngeal carcinoma, along with 3 groups of 100 control subjects, were enrolled in this study. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to find a specific cutoff value for the NPC-related seropositivity of EBV IgG antibodies.

- **Results**: The NPC group showed higher serum levels of EBV IgG antibodies than control and other HNCA groups (P < .05). The new cutoff value, defined as the mean + 2 standard deviations (SDs) of the seropositive group of control subjects who had already been grouped by the traditional cutoff value, proved successful. It succeeded in demarcating between NPC-related EBV IgG seropositivity and that caused by persistent, latent, or reactivated EBV infection in the population (P < .05). The sensitivity and specificity of NPC detection by the new cutoff-based ELISA kit were 76.19% and 86%, respectively, which were close to or higher than those of EBV IgA antibodies.

- **Conclusion**: EBV IgG-based ELISA could be used…

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^113nxJ3n]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Various versatile new automated assays for EBV serology have launched in the market and need to be analyzed by independent evaluators. To our knowledge, this study is the first independent evaluation of the Elecsys EBV immunoassay in comparison with the Liaison EBV assay. Our prospective study, including 1043 patients, showed substantial agreement between the Elecsys and Liaison assays, with 88% concordant serological profiles based on the results of the combination of three EBV markers.

The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM) is based on clinical manifestations, including sore throat, fever, lymphadenopathy, and asthenia, in conjunction with laboratory test results. Serology remains the method of choice for the diagnosis of IM. In the present study, the Elecsys and Liaison assays concluded in the same EBV primary infection profile for 70 sera, whereas 21 sera required further analysis. For these 21 sera, the results of one assay were suggestive of a primary infection, but the other was not. These sera required complementary testing, including 63 EBV analyses by Vidas assays, 18 heterophile testing, 13 immunoblot tests, 10 immunofluorescence assays (IFA), six PCR tests, and review of medical records to conclude. Among these 21 discordant results, seven sera were classified as EBV primary infection, five as seronegative, two as isolated VCA IgG, one as past infection, and six remained inconclusive. Among these seven sera newly classified as primary infection, the majority were suspected of early primary infection by the Liaison assay (n = 5) or the Vidas assay (n = 4), with detection of isolated VCA IgM antibodies.

### Serum Epstein-Barr virus DNA load in primary Epstein-Barr virus infection [^115DLB13]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Specific viral laboratory diagnosis of primary Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection is usually based on antibody-detection assays. During the acute, lytic phase of infection, viral DNA can also be detected in serum. In the present study, the diagnostic utility of EBV DNA detection and quantitation in serum during primary EBV infection was investigated. The level of EBV DNA in the serum of 98 immunocompetent patients aged 1–47 years with symptomatic, antibody-confirmed EBV primary infection was assessed using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. The association between viral load, time after onset of disease, age, and clinical and laboratory data was investigated.

Quantitative PCR detected EBV DNA in 93 of 98 samples (94.9%), with measured viral loads ranging from 3.8 × 10¹ to 6.6 × 10⁴ copies/ml. EBV DNA detection exhibited a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 97.4% for primary EBV infection. EBV DNA was always detectable until day 12 after the onset of symptoms, whereas no further positive PCR results were found following a period of 22 days. Detection of EBV DNA also showed a clearer association with the clinical manifestation of disease than the presence of EBV-specific VCA IgG antibodies of low avidity. EBV DNA load was found to correlate inversely with the time after onset of disease (P < 0.001), with higher viral load levels detected in younger (P = 0.009) and hospitalized patients (P = 0.038). The results indicate that real-time PCR is a reliable tool for diagnosing primary EBV infection early in the course of disease.

### Epstein-barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon [^114uC8oe]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The International CIS study is a collaborative study across 33 centers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, along with methods for sample and data collection, have been previously described. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity against EBNA1 was initially evaluated using a commercially available ELISA (ETI-EBNA-G, Diasorin, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

- **Sample classification**:
	- Samples with anti–EBNA1-IgG reactivity less than the manufacturer's cutoff value (CoV) of 1.0 were considered positive.
	- Samples showing negative or borderline (0.8–1.2) results against both EBV antigens were further investigated using an EBV-specific immunoblot.

### Quantification of circulating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the diagnosis and monitoring of natural killer cell and EBV-positive lymphomas in immunocompetent patients [^113UX3vk]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphomas in immunocompetent patients, the release of EBV DNA from tumor cells into the plasma might be useful for disease monitoring and prognostication. To test this hypothesis, we quantified plasma EBV DNA serially by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 39 cases of EBV-positive lymphomas, which included natural killer (NK) cell (n = 23), T cell (n = 8), B cell (n = 4), and Hodgkin (n = 4) lymphomas. As a control, EBV DNA was undetectable in 34 cases of EBV-negative lymphomas at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. In all cases of EBV-positive lymphomas, EBV DNA was detectable (ranging from 10⁵ to 10¹⁰ copies/mL) at diagnosis and paralleled the clinical course, becoming undetectable at remission and remaining elevated in refractory disease.

- **Significant findings**: On multivariate analysis, high-presentation EBV DNA levels (> 7.3 × 10⁷ copies/mL) were significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS). Subgroup analysis of NK cell lymphomas, which was the largest cohort in this study, showed that presentation EBV DNA levels correlated with disease stage and lactate dehydrogenase levels. On multivariate analysis, high-presentation EBV DNA levels (> 6.1 × 10⁷ copies/mL) were significantly associated with inferior disease-free survival. During treatment, patients with rising EBV DNA levels or those whose EBV DNA failed to become undetectable had significantly inferior OS.

In summary, in EBV-positive lymphomas, plasma EBV DNA is valuable as a tumor biomarker and for prognostication.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis and risk of systemic lupus erythematosus [^1153cQwZ]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of serological markers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and observations that infectious mononucleosis (IM) may precede some cases of SLE suggest a possible role of EBV in the etiology of SLE. We evaluated the relationship between EBV-associated IM and subsequent risk of SLE in a population-based cohort study.

- **Methods**: We followed cohorts of Danes tested serologically for IM using the Paul-Bunnell (PB) heterophile antibody test between 1939 and 1989, and patients hospitalized with IM between 1977 and 2007 for subsequent first hospitalizations with SLE in the period 1977–2008. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) served as measures of relative risk.

- **Results**: Risk of SLE was not increased in individuals with a positive PB test (SIR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.8, 1.6; n = 27) or in individuals hospitalized with IM (SIR = 1.3; 95% CI 0.7, 2.2; n = 12). However, SLE risk in PB-negative individuals was significantly increased (SIR = 2.6; 95% CI 2.1, 3.2; n = 82), a risk that was particularly high 1–4 years after the PB test (SIR = 6.6; 95% CI 3.3, 13.2) and remained significantly elevated for more than 25 years.

- **Conclusions**: EBV-associated IM does not seem to be a risk factor for SLE. The temporal pattern of increased SLE risk in individuals with a negative PB test suggests that some patients who go on to develop SLE may present with unspecific symptoms, for which they may be tested for IM, long in advance of their SLE diagnosis.

### Fever with atypical lymphocytosis: Pearls and pitfalls in Epstein-Barr virus serology [^111dVUED]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The heterophile antibody (also known as the Monospot) test is a useful screening tool for infectious mononucleosis (IM) resulting from primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, up to 10% of patients with IM are heterophile negative. Heterophile-negative patients who have lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear should be further tested for EBV serologies. These tests include specific IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens, early antigens, and EBV nuclear antigen proteins.

A diagnostic dilemma arises when the patient has clinical and laboratory features of IM but is both heterophile negative and seronegative for IM, as illustrated in this case presentation. To avoid missed diagnoses of IM, misdiagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses, and unnecessary testing, knowledge of test characteristics and the evolving course of EBV serologies is important to assure and inform both the physician and the patient.

### Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas decoded [^111esiYA]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphomas cover a range of histological B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes. The role of EBV in B-cell malignant pathogenesis and its impact on the tumour microenvironment are intriguing but incompletely understood. Both the International Consensus Classification (ICC) and the 5th Edition of the World Health Organization (WHO-HAEM5) proposals give prominence to the distinct clinical, prognostic, genetic, and tumour microenvironmental features of EBV in lymphoproliferative disorders.

There have been major advances in our biological understanding, in how to harness features of EBV and its host immune response for targeted therapy, and in using EBV as a method to monitor disease response. In this article, we showcase the latest developments and how they may be integrated to stimulate new and innovative approaches for further lines of investigation and therapy.

### Epstein-Barr virus infection and expression of B-cell oncogenic markers in HIV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^116MAd9f]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-mediated lymphomagenesis in the setting of HIV infection has been widely accepted. However, little is known about how EBV impacts prognosis. We investigated the hypothesis that EBV infection is associated with the expression of specific B-cell oncogenic markers in HIV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and examined the prognostic use of detecting EBV infection.

HIV-related DLBCL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2007 within Kaiser Permanente California were identified. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze the expression of selected markers that are cell-cycle regulators, B-cell activators, and antiapoptotic proteins, among others. EBV infection was determined by in situ hybridization of EBV RNA. Correlations between EBV and marker expression were examined using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The prognostic use of EBV status was examined in a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for the International Prognostic Index (IPI). Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate improvement in model discrimination.

Seventy HIV-related DLBCL cases were included (31% EBV ±). EBV+ tumor was associated with increased expression of BLIMP1 and CD30 and reduced expression of BCL6 and LMO2. EBV+ tumor was independently associated with elevated 2-year overall mortality [HR, 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6–6.6]. The area under the ROC curve showed improved model discrimination when incorporating tumor EBV status with IPI in the prediction model [0.65 vs. 0.74 (IPI only)].

### Plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA as an archetypal circulating tumour DNA marker [^112g8kEw]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 5% of the general population harbors EBV DNA in their plasma. In the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) screening context, these subjects contribute to the false-positive group and would need to undergo unnecessary confirmatory procedures. However, they have indistinguishable levels of plasma EBV DNA from early-stage NPC patients by PCR-based quantitation. In the prospective screening study, we adopted a two-timepoint testing protocol for plasma EBV DNA analysis. Participants with detectable EBV DNA in their baseline plasma samples were retested 4 weeks after the first test. Those with detectable EBV DNA in the follow-up test were defined as 'screen-positive'. This strategy is based on the continuous release of EBV DNA from cancer cells in NPC patients, contrasted with transiently positive results in non-NPC subjects. This approach substantially reduced the false-positive rate from 5.4% to 1.4%, with a positive predictive value of 11.0% in our target population. However, it would be logistically inconvenient to implement a mass screening program based on this two-timepoint protocol.

### Development of a diagnostic algorithm for Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases: a retrospective observational study [^116e5rkq]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a spectrum of diseases. To investigate the characteristics of various EBV-associated diseases in China, we conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study examining molecular and serological features. EBV DNA copy numbers in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while four EBV-specific antibodies were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay. Our study included 746 patients with EBV-related diseases and 350 control adults without EBV-associated diseases.

Among the patient group, EBV DNA was detectable in 97.7% of PBMC samples and 92.6% of plasma samples, significantly surpassing the positivity rates observed in controls (46.7% in PBMCs and 4.6% in plasma). In terms of specific diseases, EBV DNA was positive in PBMCs in almost all the patients across most disease groups, except in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (87.4%), whereas the EBV DNA positivity rates in plasma varied considerably.

Most disease groups exhibited low positivity rates for viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgM and high positivity rates for EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-IgG. Conversely, infectious mononucleosis demonstrated a high seropositivity rate (94.2%) for VCA-IgM but a low rate (0.8%) for EBNA-IgG. EBV DNA in plasma effectively distinguishes patients with EBV-associated diseases from control subjects, and incorporating PBMC EBV DNA further enhances diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, our findings delineate distinct patterns of EBV DNA presence, levels, and antibody responses across various EBV-associated diseases.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115WSttM]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

EBV serology is also useful for determining the serological status in the context of transplantation to match the EBV status of the donor with that of the recipient and to assess the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders. In this setting, both assays showed excellent specificity regarding seronegative status, but the study revealed differences in the performance of the assays for clearly ascertaining the status of a past infection.

Among the sera classified as past infection, the Liaison assay reported 10% discrepant profiles with the EBV status established by the reference laboratory. The most frequently discrepant profiles obtained with the Liaison assays were isolated IgG VCA (n = 30), presence of the three markers (n = 23), isolated EBNA IgG (n = 15), and seronegative status (n = 3). Isolated VCA and EBNA IgG patterns obtained with the Liaison assay were consistent with a relative lack of sensitivity of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers with this assay.

Previous studies reported that an isolated VCA IgG pattern is commonly associated with a past infection and, to a lesser extent, can also correspond to a primary infection. Among the discrepant results displaying an isolated IgG VCA IgG profile in the Elecsys assay (n = 14), we classified four sera as seronegative, two sera as primary infection, three sera as confirmed isolated VCA IgG (using the immunoblot IgG test), two sera as past infection, and three sera remained inconclusive. All discrepant results with isolated VCA IgG with the Liaison assays were classified as past infection. An isolated EBNA IgG pattern with the Elecsys assay was noted.

### Evidence-based approach for interpretation of Epstein-Barr virus serological patterns [^115tnMWo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1). The use of all five markers results in 32 possible serological patterns, making the interpretation of EBV serologies a challenge. This study aimed to develop evidence-based tools for interpreting EBV results using a large patient population.

The study utilized 1,846 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. Chart reviews were performed for more than 800 patients, and diagnoses were assigned based on physician-ordered testing, clinical presentation, and patient history. Testing for all five EBV antibodies was performed separately on all serum samples using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 system. The presumed EBV diagnosis (based on previous publications) was compared to the EBV diagnosis based on a medical record review for each serological pattern.

Interestingly, of the 32 possible serological patterns, only 12 occurred in 10 or more patients. The remaining 20 patterns were uninterpretable due to their infrequency. Two easy-to-use tables were created to interpret EBV serological patterns based on whether three (EBV VCA IgG, IgM, and heterophile antibodies) or five markers are utilized. The use of these two tables allows for the interpretation of over 95% of BioPlex serological results.

### Sero-epidemiological patterns of Epstein-Barr and herpes simplex (HSV-1 and HSV-2) viruses in England as well as Wales [^1178HwA1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

The aim was to carry out a population-based sero-prevalence survey of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) across a wide age range in England as well as Wales and to identify any associations between EBV and herpes simplex virus types one and two (HSV-1 and 2). Sera from an age-stratified sample of 2,893 individuals, submitted for diagnostic purposes to 15 public health laboratories in England as well as Wales in 1994, were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to EBV. The samples had been tested previously for IgG antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2.

The serological profile of EBV was consistent with an endemic infection with peaks in transmission in those less than 5 years old and in young adults. An age-adjusted analysis found a significant association between EBV and HSV-1 seropositivity, most likely explained by similarities in their mode of transmission. The very low seroprevalence of HSV-2 in this sample complicated the comparisons of EBV and HSV-1 with HSV-2; any associations were most likely explained by chance.

Given the association between EBV and HSV-1, it is likely that recently documented epidemiological changes in HSV-1 also apply to EBV. Continuing surveillance of these herpes viruses is necessary as the predicted changes could have a significant public health impact, especially in the young adult population.

### Technology insight: Applications of emerging immunotherapeutic strategies for Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies [^111EEMQt]. Nature Clinical Practice Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is uniquely associated with a broad range of human malignancies. Despite their diverse cellular origins, most of these malignancies share common features, including the expression of some or all of the EBV latent proteins. These features can potentially be exploited for immune-based therapies. New and emerging strategies are being developed to manipulate the immune response in order to specifically boost T-cell immunity toward viral proteins expressed in EBV-associated malignancies. These strategies are applied either alone or as an adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibodies. Overall, this approach may serve as a new paradigm for the successful multi-modality treatment of malignancies.

### Diagnostic value of Epstein-Barr viral serology in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^1113VAVL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgA serology has been established as an effective marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), its usefulness and cost-effectiveness as a screening test remain unclear. This article aims to determine how these tests could be used most effectively in diagnosing NPC in an otolaryngology outpatient clinic. A total of 111 consecutive patients with NPC and an equal number of control subjects were studied. Forty-seven patients with NPC had early (AJCC stages 1 and 2), and 64 had advanced (stages 3 and 4) disease. A positive early antigen (EA) serology result was found in 81.2% of NPC patients and in none of the controls. Negative EA and viral capsid antigen (VCA) serology results were present in 2.7% of NPC patients and in 46.8% of controls. Negative EA and positive VCA serology results were found in 30.0% of NPC patients with early disease, 7.8% of NPC patients with advanced disease, and 53.2% of controls. Given its high specificity, serology for EA is recommended as a clinically useful screening test. Serology for VCA, although highly sensitive, has an unacceptably high false-positive rate, and its cost-effectiveness as a universal screening test is questionable.

### Single-assay combination of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1- and viral capsid antigen-p18-derived synthetic peptides for measuring anti-EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody levels in sera from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients: options for field screening [^111Dm5XW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Assessment of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody responses to various Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen complexes, usually involving multiple serological assays, is important for the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Through the combination of two synthetic peptides representing immunodominant epitopes of EBNA1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA)-p18, we developed a one-step sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the specific detection of EBV-reactive IgG and IgA antibodies in NPC patients (EBV IgG/IgA ELISA). Sera were obtained from healthy donors (n = 367), non-NPC head and neck cancer patients (n = 43), and biopsy-proven NPC patients (n = 296) of Indonesian and Chinese origin.

Higher values of optical density at 450 nm for EBV IgG were observed in NPC patients compared to the healthy EBV carriers, but the large overlap limits its use for NPC diagnosis. Using either EBNA1 or VCA-p18 peptides alone, IgA ELISA correctly identified 88.5% and 79.8% of Indonesian NPC patients, with specificities of 80.1% and 70.9%, whereas combined single-well coating with both peptides yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 90.1% and 85.4%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) for the combined EBNA1 plus VCA EBV IgA ELISA were 78.7% and 93.9%, respectively. In the Indonesia panel, the level of EBV IgA reactivity was not associated with NPC tumor size, lymph node involvement, metastasis stage, sex, and age group. In the China panel, the sensitivity/specificity values were 86.2/92.0% (EBNA1 IgA) and 84.1/90.3% (VCA-p18).

### Epstein-Barr virus: The impact of scientific advances on clinical practice [^116W3ajD]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a tumorigenic herpes virus that infects and persists in B lymphocytes in the majority of humans, generally without causing disease. However, in a few individuals, the virus is associated with significant pathology, particularly benign and malignant lymphoproliferations. Recently acquired knowledge on the mechanisms of EBV persistence, immune control of primary and persistent infection, and disease pathogenesis is now being translated into the clinic. Novel methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are contributing to improved patient care. This review concentrates on these recent advances in the field of hematology/oncology.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in sera of patients with primary EBV infection [^112k5ndP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Detection of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in serum had a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 94%, and positive and negative predictive values of 95% and 79%, respectively, for the diagnosis of primary EBV infection. We suggest that this is a useful addition to the panel of tests used for this purpose.

### Seroepidemiology of EBV and interpretation of the "isolated VCA IgG" pattern [^114ssRMY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of VCA IgG in the absence of VCA IgM and EBNA-1 IgG antibodies complicates the classification of EBV infection. This serological picture can indicate a past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or an acute infection with early disappearance or delayed onset of VCA IgM. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of this pattern in 2,422 outpatients with suspected EBV infection examined during 2005–2006 and to interpret its significance through immunoblotting.

One hundred and seventy-seven (7.3%) of the patients were VCA IgG-positive, VCA IgM-negative, and EBNA-1 IgG-negative, of whom 15 (8.5%) presented with heterophile antibodies.

- **Age analysis**: The prevalence of isolated VCA IgG ranged from 4.5% in subjects aged 1–10 years to 9% in those aged > 60 years.
- **Immunoblotting findings**: It allowed classification of 18.9% of cases as acute infections and 81.1% as past infections. Notably, past infection was observed in about 37% of patients aged less than 10 years and in 100% of those aged > 30 years.

In conclusion, the presence of isolated VCA IgG was predominantly associated with past infection, particularly among adults. However, in children aged less than 10 years, it was mostly linked to acute infection. The possibility of past infection in approximately one-third of these children should not be overlooked.

### The case for targeting latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus infection in multiple sclerosis [^114qeDSV]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

An alternative theory is that EBV infection causes dysregulation of the immune system, which is then primed to develop autoimmunity in the future; hence, EBV is necessary but insufficient to cause MS.

The second potential mechanism is viral-driven immune cell priming. EBV infection of naive B cells generates memory B cells. It has been proposed that latent EBV infection does this by providing infected B cells with a survival advantage, which allows putative autoreactive B cells to bypass endogenous tolerance mechanisms and thus have similar disease-induction potential as seen with antigen-driven immune cell priming; however, evidence for this is lacking.

The B-cell pro-survival signals come from EBV latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). LMP1 mimics CD40 signalling to activate multiple B-cell growth and survival pathways, particularly NF-κB. In parallel, LMP2A mimics the B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling cascade by bypassing the BCR and signalling directly through Syk/RAS/PI3K, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), and STAT3, leading to increased IL10 production. IL10 then promotes B-cell proliferation and survival via autocrine mechanisms. In addition, EBV infection also induces CD40 ligand expression that can provide co-stimulatory activity.

HLA-DRB1✱15–01, a major MS-related genetic risk factor, promotes EBV viral load and infection in contrast to the HLA-A✱02–01 resistance loci. This process could facilitate the development of other EBV-associated autoimmunities related to different HLA restrictions.

### Application of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA antibody detection with a polyantigenic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood [^114fni13]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The Enzygnost anti-Epstein-Barr virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, based on a defined antigen mixture and detection of antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA classes, was evaluated for its reliability in diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood. Samples were taken from 66 children to define the Epstein-Barr virus status and infection phase through indirect immunofluorescence and anticomplement fluorescence assays. Results showed that 11 children were seronegative, 8 had a primary infection, 20 had a recent primary or past infection, and 27 had a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection.

- **Indeterminate results**: 15 serum samples (22.7%) were not interpretable due to indeterminate results in at least one of the assays used and were therefore excluded from further evaluation.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**:
	- **Seronegativity**: 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
	- **Primary infection**: 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity.
	- **Recent primary or past infection**: 100% sensitivity and 52% specificity.
	- **Reactivated infection**: 10% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

This poor performance of the Enzygnost system with reactivated infections is due to the prerequisite of an IgG antibody value of more than 650 IU/ml for diagnosing viral activity, which was fulfilled in only two of the children. Despite the high rate of indeterminate results, the Enzygnost system is useful in diagnosing acute and past Epstein-Barr virus infection in childhood. For the serological diagnosis of viral activity in childhood, a suitable approach is necessary.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^116pTrp5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pre-transplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1,043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were further assessed using additional EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status.

Despite substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in their performance. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection compared to the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1).

Regarding the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays demonstrated similar performance.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^112D8Lk7]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects over 95% of the population worldwide. A small number of patients develop life-threatening persistence of high-level EBV replication following an infectious mononucleosis syndrome, often associated with splenomegaly and hepatitis. Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease is characterized by infiltration of tissues by EBV-positive T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, or less frequently B cells, and can progress into lymphoproliferative disease. Clonal expansion of EBV-infected T or NK cells is well described.

At the time of writing, CAEBV has been mostly described in Asian or South/Central American patients. Frequent deletions in the EBV genome have been found in samples from Japanese CAEBV patients (35%) and other EBV-driven neoplasms. However, it is unclear if these deletions are specific for Asian EBV strains, whether they are present in viral genomes in different sites, and how they evolve over time.

In the present study, we sequenced EBV from serial blood samples obtained from three UK patients with CAEBV disease. The results were compared with sequences from the saliva of patients with CAEBV and blood and tissue from other benign and malignant EBV-related conditions.

### Early identification of individuals at risk for multiple sclerosis by quantification of EBNA-1-specific antibody titers [^115EDmgt]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In 264 of these MS patients with follow-up samples (81.5%), EBV seroconversion occurred in the course of clinically evident infectious mononucleosis (IM). This was confirmed by the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillitis. In all patients with IM, EBV primary infection was further confirmed serologically by the presence of EBV viral-capsid antigen (VCA)-specific IgM in the absence of EBV-VCA- or EBV-EBNA-specific IgG antibodies. In all 264 patients with clinically evident IM, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive, VCA-IgG negative, and EBNA-IgG negative antibodies.

In 60 (18.5%) patients with MS, primary EBV infection had occurred asymptomatically. In these individuals, EBV seroconversion was confirmed by an additional plasma sample that was available and obtained at a median of 5.2 (3.2–7.2) months prior to the first detection of EBV-VCA-specific IgM or EBV-VCA-specific IgG. In all 60 patients with an asymptomatic EBV seroconversion, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive or VCA-IgG positive antibodies.

For each of the 324 follow-up MS patients, one healthy control individual was selected from the control cohort matched according to gender, age, time, and occurrence of IM. All MS patients and healthy controls were recruited in Austria and Germany. Furthermore, from all 324 control subjects, a follow-up was available for more than 5 years after the matching time point, and it was confirmed by follow-up records that none developed the disease.

### Atypical prediagnosis Epstein-Barr virus serology restricted to EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma [^112uTz6k]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

An altered anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serologic profile preceding diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unknown whether this atypical pattern predicts Hodgkin lymphoma risk further subdivided by determination of EBV in tumor cells. A nested case-control study of 128 incident Hodgkin lymphoma cases and 368 matched controls from active-duty military personnel with archived serum in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository was conducted to determine whether a panel of anti-EBV antibody titers differed in EBV(+) and EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma.

Among 40 EBV(+) Hodgkin lymphoma cases and matched controls, statistically significant increased risks were associated with elevated anti-EBV VCA IgG antibody titers (relative risk = 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–8.7), and an anti-EBNA-1/anti-EBNA-2 antibody ratio ≤ 1.0 versus > 1.0 (relative risk = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6–13.8). In contrast, no significant associations were found among 88 EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma cases relative to their matched controls. In case-case analysis, EBV(+) disease was significantly associated with a low anti-EBNA-1/anti-EBNA-2 antibody ratio. This distinctive serologic response to EBV latent antigens, indicative of immune dysfunction in other clinical settings, is associated with an increased risk of developing EBV(+) but not EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma.
