## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when ERCP should be performed without further imaging in cases of suspected choledocholithiasis, and how to justify that decision clinically and with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that ERCP is primarily therapeutic and should be reserved for high-likelihood scenarios. Then, I should verify the specific high-risk criteria that trigger direct ERCP. Next, I will review why further imaging is not recommended in those high-risk situations. After that, I should consider the intermediate-risk group where EUS or MRCP is preferred. Finally, I will double-check special contexts like gallstone pancreatitis and pregnancy, and close with a concise synthesis of the indications and rationale.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: ERCP carries meaningful risks, including pancreatitis, bleeding, cholangitis, and perforation, so it should be used therapeutically when the probability of stones is high rather than as a diagnostic test, which is why guidelines emphasize reserving ERCP for patients who clearly need endoscopic therapy [^116JpZ4J] [^1152aFPs] [^1176f8Kn].

> Now, I need to check the exact high-risk criteria that justify proceeding directly to ERCP without additional imaging. The ASGE 2019 guideline specifies three scenarios: a documented common bile duct stone on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging, clinical ascending cholangitis, or the combination of total bilirubin greater than 4 mg/dL with a dilated common bile duct on imaging, typically defined as greater than 6 mm with the gallbladder in situ or greater than 8 mm after cholecystectomy, and these are the triggers for prompt ERCP without further workup [^116JpZ4J] [^111iiPZD] [^112p1Cxq].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for skipping further imaging in these high-risk cases. If a stone is already visualized, the diagnosis is established and the next step is therapeutic clearance, and if cholangitis is present, urgent biliary decompression is indicated to prevent sepsis, while the combination of marked hyperbilirubinemia with ductal dilation carries a sufficiently high pretest probability that confirmatory imaging would only delay definitive therapy and add little value, aligning with the principle of avoiding diagnostic ERCP in favor of therapeutic ERCP when appropriate [^116JpZ4J] [^1134fFpD] [^1176f8Kn].

> Hold on, I should verify the intermediate-risk group so I don't overgeneralize. For patients with abnormal liver tests, age over 55, or a dilated duct without the high-risk features, guidelines recommend EUS or MRCP to confirm stones before committing to ERCP, because these modalities have high diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary ERCPs and complications, and the choice between EUS and MRCP should be guided by local expertise, availability, and patient factors [^116W1Tyr] [^115tkrPn] [^117NVuCi].

> I will now examine the special case of gallstone pancreatitis, since it often causes confusion. I initially thought early ERCP might be broadly indicated, but wait, I should double-check the evidence, which shows that routine early ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or ongoing biliary obstruction does not improve outcomes and increases harm, so urgent ERCP is reserved for those with concurrent cholangitis or rising bilirubin indicating obstruction, while stable patients should generally not undergo urgent ERCP within 48 hours [^1155K4Fd] [^1174QL4T] [^111Vk84Y].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant? I need to ensure the approach is safe for both mother and fetus; in pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line, MRCP without contrast is preferred if additional imaging is needed, and ERCP can be performed when clearly indicated, ideally in the second trimester and with shielding and procedural precautions, balancing maternal-fetal risks and the urgency of biliary decompression if cholangitis or high-grade obstruction is present [^112rEJKN].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I haven't missed anything. ERCP without further imaging is indicated when any of the following are present: a documented stone in the common bile duct on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging, clinical ascending cholangitis, or total bilirubin greater than 4 mg/dL together with a dilated common bile duct on imaging, whereas patients without these high-risk features should generally undergo EUS or MRCP to confirm stones before ERCP, consistent with contemporary ASGE and BSG guidance and the principle of minimizing nontherapeutic ERCP [^116JpZ4J] [^1157TLCa] [^1176f8Kn].

---

ERCP is indicated without further imaging when there is **definite CBD stone on ultrasound or CT** [^116Pd9YF] [^116JpZ4J], **ascending cholangitis** [^1134fFpD], or **total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with a dilated CBD (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ)** [^111iiPZD]. These are high-risk features with a > 50% probability of choledocholithiasis [^111PNYtJ], so **prompt ERCP is warranted** to achieve definitive diagnosis and therapy without delay [^112p1Cxq].

---

## Indications for ERCP without further imaging

According to the ASGE 2019 guidelines, **ERCP should be performed without further imaging** in patients who meet any of the following high-risk criteria [^116JpZ4J]:

| **High-risk criterion** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Definite CBD stone on imaging | Visualization of a common bile duct (CBD) stone on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) [^116Pd9YF] [^111iiPZD] |
| Ascending cholangitis | Clinical evidence of ascending cholangitis (e.g. Charcot's triad: fever, jaundice, right upper quadrant pain) [^111iiPZD] |
| Total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with dilated CBD | Total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL accompanied by a dilated common bile duct (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ) [^111iiPZD] |

---

These criteria indicate a **high probability (> 50%) of choledocholithiasis** [^111PNYtJ], and **prompt ERCP is recommended** to provide both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention [^112p1Cxq].

---

## Rationale for proceeding directly to ERCP

The rationale for proceeding directly to ERCP without further imaging in these scenarios includes:

- **High diagnostic yield**: Patients with high-risk criteria have a high likelihood of confirmed choledocholithiasis, making further imaging unnecessary [^111iiPZD].

- **Therapeutic necessity**: ERCP provides both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention (stone extraction, biliary drainage), which is essential in patients with cholangitis or significant biliary obstruction [^1134fFpD].

- **Risk of delay**: Delaying ERCP in high-risk patients can lead to progression of biliary obstruction, cholangitis, or pancreatitis, increasing morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

---

## Risks and benefits of proceeding directly to ERCP

### Benefits

Benefits include **definitive diagnosis and treatment** — ERCP provides both diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention in a single procedure — and **reduced delay**, as immediate ERCP prevents progression of biliary obstruction, cholangitis, or pancreatis [^notfound]. It also **improves outcomes** by reducing morbidity and mortality associated with delayed biliary drainage [^114wz9Pi].

---

### Risks

Risks include **procedure-related complications** such as pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation, and cholangitis (6–15%) [^1152aFPs] [^11227UAi]. Nontherapeutic ERCP may occur if stones are not present, exposing patients to unnecessary risks [^112eF8io].

---

## Alternative diagnostic imaging modalities

In patients who do not meet high-risk criteria, **alternative diagnostic imaging modalities** should be considered:

- **Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**: Non-invasive imaging with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting CBD stones, recommended for intermediate-risk patients [^116W1Tyr] [^114e66uD].

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool, particularly useful in intermediate-risk patients [^117NVuCi] [^114fHu7U].

- **Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)**: Useful during cholecystectomy to detect CBD stones intraoperatively [^113YJeSY].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ERCP is not indicated without further imaging

ERCP is **not indicated without further imaging** in the following scenarios:

- **Low-risk patients**: Patients without high-risk criteria should undergo further imaging (MRCP or EUS) before ERCP [^notfound].

- **Gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis**: Urgent ERCP is not recommended in patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction [^1155K4Fd] [^111Vk84Y].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Patients with asymptomatic choledocholithiasis or incidental findings should undergo further evaluation before ERCP [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

ERCP is indicated without further imaging in patients with **definite CBD stones on imaging**, **ascending cholangitis**, or **total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL with a dilated CBD** [^116Pd9YF]. These high-risk criteria warrant **prompt ERCP** for definitive diagnosis and therapy, minimizing delays and reducing morbidity and mortality [^112p1Cxq]. In patients who do not meet these criteria, **further imaging (MRCP or EUS)** is recommended before proceeding to ERCP [^116W1Tyr].

### Suspected common bile duct stones: which test is best? [^114Vaod1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

There is conflicting data in the literature regarding the optimum management from a length-of-stay (LOS) perspective in the management of patients with suspected choledocholithiasis. Lin et al. demonstrated a reduced LOS with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and IOC of 3.9 days compared to MRCP (7.0 days) and pre-ERCP (6.9 days). Ward et al. demonstrated no difference in LOS.

There is also a cost burden to society to consider with each of the three tests and the subsequent management of patients. Unfortunately, there is also conflicting literature reports on the optimum management strategy from this perspective depending on what factors are included in the calculation as well as the costs associated within each healthcare system. The vast majority of patients undergoing MRCP ultimately receive an invasive test (either ERCP or lap cholecystectomy) subsequently in their admission which raises the question on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Many of the modalities recommended (EUS, IOC, MRCP) are based on availability and feasibility given individual hospital resources. Use of an available modality (e.g. MRCP) may be beneficial if the alternative leads to delays in transfer for a more advantageous modality for evaluation. One reason for the inferior performance of MRCP could be due to the challenge of detecting small calculi in the distal common bile duct using this modality. Others argue that MRCP may reduce the need for unnecessary ERCP thus saving cost in terms of unnecessary procedures, anesthesia, and potential complications.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we recommend routine use of EUS before therapeutic ERCP in patients with a high probability of choledocholithiasis but negative CT scan, especially when clinically improving. This strategy can reduce unnecessary ERCP procedures and their adverse events. EUS prior to ERCP is also cost–benefit in area where EUS cost much less than ERCP.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^117EWVRy]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE choledocholithiasis guideline — gallstone pancreatitis management and ERCP role: The panel recommended that same admission cholecystectomy be performed for patients presenting with gallstone pancreatitis. In a very large cohort comparing endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) alone versus ES plus cholecystectomy, 7330 versus 4478 patients were included, with 39.3% recurrent adverse events after ES alone versus 18.0% with ES and cholecystectomy (adjusted OR, .38 [95% CI, .34-.42]). ERCP with prophylactic sphincterotomy to prevent recurrent pancreatitis or other biliary adverse events should not be used as an alternative to cholecystectomy unless surgery is absolutely contraindicated. A Cochrane analysis of 662 patients from 5 RCTs found increased risk with a nonoperative approach after ES and bile duct clearance, including recurrent biliary pain (14.6 [95% CI 5.0–42.8]), jaundice or cholangitis (2.5 [1.15–5.9]), and mortality (1.8 [1.2–2.8]) versus prophylactic cholecystectomy.

### A prospective multicenter analysis from the pediatric ERCP database initiative: predictors of choledocholithiasis at ERCP in pediatric patients [^115mStDE]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The management of suspected choledocholithiasis remains a challenge in pediatric endoscopy. Several recommendations are available for adult patients; however, it is unknown which pediatric patients are most likely to benefit from ERCP for evaluation of choledocholithiasis. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate adult-based criteria in the evaluation of pediatric patients with choledocholithiasis. A secondary aim was to evaluate the role of conjugated (or direct) bilirubin to improve the sensitivity of detecting choledocholithiasis.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter study in pediatric patients as part of the Pediatric ERCP Database Initiative (PEDI) with additional post-hoc analysis of updated guidelines. Patients < 19 years of age undergoing ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis or gallstone pancreatitis were enrolled at participating sites.

Results

Ninety-five patients were enrolled (69 with choledocholithiasis confirmed at ERCP and 26 with no stones at ERCP). Adverse event rates were similar in both groups. Specificity ranged from 27% to 91% using adult guidelines, but a sensitivity of only 20% to 69%. The were no significant differences between the 2 groups using preprocedure transabdominal US (P = 1.0). Significant differences between groups were identified using either the total or conjugated bilirubin (P = 0.02). There was also a significant difference between the stone and no-stone groups when conjugated bilirubin was dichotomized to > 2 mg/dL (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Abdominal imaging and laboratory indices may be used to predict pediatric choledocholithiasis with varying sensitivity and specificity. Pediatric-specific guidelines may allow for improved stone prediction compared with existing adult recommendations.

### Systematic review of endoscopic ultrasonography versus endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for suspected choledocholithiasis [^11339vNU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has emerged as an accurate diagnostic alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of all randomized controlled trials of EUS-guided ERCP versus ERCP alone in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The search for eligible studies was carried out using the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Science Citation Index electronic databases. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.

Results

Four trials containing 213 patients randomized to EUS-guided ERCP and 210 to ERCP alone were selected. In the EUS-guided ERCP group, ERCP was avoided in 143 patients (67.1 per cent) when EUS did not detect choledocholithiasis. The use of EUS significantly reduced the risk of overall complications (relative risk 0.35 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.20 to 0.62); P < 0.001) and post-ERCP acute pancreatitis (relative risk 0.21 (95 per cent c.i. 0.06 to 0.83); P = 0.030).

Conclusion

By performing EUS first, ERCP may be safely avoided in two-thirds of patients with common bile duct stones. Application of EUS in the selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP significantly reduces the complication rate.

### Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for suspected choledocholithiasis: testing the current guidelines [^114dedtG]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines include an algorithm for predicting choledocholithiasis. Presence of any very strong predictor or both strong predictors confers a high (> 50%) probability of choledocholithiasis. Absence of predictors confers low risk (< 10%) of choledocholithiasis. Other combinations have an intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis.

Aim

Determine accuracy of the proposed algorithm in predicting choledocholithiasis.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of all endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies performed for suspected choledocholithiasis in 3 years in a Tertiary care hospital and a community hospital serviced by The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Division of Gastroenterology. Application of the guidelines, and comparing results to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography findings.

Results

A total of 1080 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies were performed; 521 for choledocholithiasis. Most patients were Hispanic and female. Univariate analysis: presence of any very strong predictor and both strong predictors had an OR for choledocholithiasis of 3.30 and 2.36 respectively. Multivariate analysis: odds of choledocholithiasis with any very strong predictor was 2.87, and both strong predictors 3.24. Choledocholithiasis was present in 71.5%, and 41% of patients with high, and intermediate risk respectively.

Conclusion

This study confirms the utility of clinical predictors for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. All of the very strong predictors and one of the strong predictors increased the odds of choledocholithiasis. Patients with high risk for choledocholithiasis had a probability of 79% of choledocholithiasis. Sensitivity and specificity of current predictors are too low to obviate the possible need of non-invasive tests to confirm or exclude choledocholithiasis in all risk groups.

Role of ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis — Most patients with gallstone pancreatitis will not benefit from ERCP, including early ERCP. In a multicenter trial of early ERCP, early (within 24 hours) ERCP was not found to decrease complications, including mortality, and urgent ERCP was indicated only for cholangitis or progressive cholestasis defined by a rise in bilirubin in the setting of severe or moderately severe AP (bilirubin > 3–5 mg/dL).

Gallstone pancreatitis — early ERCP: A cited meta-analysis "demonstrated that early ERCP does not decrease the mortality or adverse events of gallstone pancreatitis". The panel notes that "ERCP carries a risk of harm in addition to cost and inconvenience without clear benefit", and clarifies, "Our recommendation against early ERCP does not apply to patients with gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis". Trials referenced excluded patients with "a bilirubin < 5 mg/dL", and instituted ERCP for those with "an increase of bilirubin > 3 mg/dL". The page states these positions align with guidance that "also suggest against routine use of urgent ERCP for gallstone pancreatitis".

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113FgVY]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta-analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Findings

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines in 2019. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively.

Conclusion

ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low-risk patients, allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. All guidelines have limited specificity in identifying patients at high risk for CBDS and cannot reliably select patients for upfront ERCP.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: reduction of unnecessary ERCP by pre-procedural imaging and timing of ERCP [^112eF8io]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the procedure of choice to remove sludge/stones from the common bile duct (CBD). In a small but clinically important proportion of patients with suspected choledocholithiasis ERCP is negative. This is undesirable because of ERCP associated morbidity. We aimed to map the diagnostic pathway leading up to ERCP and evaluate ERCP outcome.

Methods

We established a prospective multicenter cohort of patients with suspected CBD stones. We assessed the determinants that were associated with CBD sludge or stone detection upon ERCP.

Results

We established a cohort of 707 patients with suspected CBD sludge or stones (62% female, median age 59 years). ERCP was negative for CBD sludge or stones in 155 patients (22%). Patients with positive ERCPs frequently had pre-procedural endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging (44% vs. 35%; P = 0.045). The likelihood of ERCP sludge and stones detection was higher when the time interval between EUS or MRCP and ERCP was less than 2 days (odds ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.25–4.44; P = 0.008; number needed to harm 7.7).

Conclusions

Even in the current era of society guidelines and use of advanced imaging CBD sludge or stones are absent in one out of five ERCPs performed for suspected CBD stones. The proportion of unnecessary ERCPs is lower in case of pre-procedural EUS or MRCP. A shorter time interval between EUS or MRCP increases the yield of ERCP for suspected CBD stones and should, therefore, preferably be performed within 2 days before ERCP.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^117HY3Qh]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Intermediate‑risk choledocholithiasis — randomized algorithm comparison found that 100 patients were randomized to EUS with ERCP for positive endosonography followed by cholecystectomy versus cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram followed by intraoperative or postoperative ERCP if positive; the latter strategy was associated with significantly decreased length of stay (5 [IQR, 5–8] versus 8 [IQR, 6–12] days). This was driven by a fairly low 21% prevalence of choledocholithiasis. All patient randomized to preprocedure EUS underwent the procedure, resulting in a median delay of 1.5 days (IQR, 1.5–3), and only one fifth of patients assigned to the latter strategy required a postcholecystectomy ERCP.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^115P1jr9]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — diagnostic pathway performance and the role of EUS/MRCP before ERCP: In practice the group performed MRCP for 90% of patients who underwent ERCP, and as a consequence, 97% of those who underwent ERCP were found to have stones in comparison with 72% to 80% of cohorts using only the clinical predictors recommended in the ASGE 2010 guidelines; multiple controlled tandem and RCTs have shown that EUS before ERCP decreases the requirement for ERCP, lowers adverse events rates, and is not associated with higher rates of subsequent biliary adverse events because of "missed stones".

### Indications, success, and adverse event rates of pediatric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LyHvJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advanced endoscopy, traditionally associated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), continues to evolve as new technology and techniques become available. Advanced endoscopists now have a variety of capabilities, including ERCP, balloon enteroscopy, Capsule Endoscopy, EUS and transabdominal ultrasonography (TUS) and deep small bowel enteroscopy. Pediatric indications differ from adults for ERCP while it is comparable in adolescents such as choledocholithiasis, liver-transplantation related disorders, and malignancy. In contrast, the main indication for ERCP in newborns was diagnostic workup of neonatal cholestasis and suspected pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Considering the rise in the incidence of ERCP in children, an increased risk of complications was also reported in this sub-population. A few authors have expressed their opinion that ERCP could be successfully carried out in children with a similar success rate as observed in adults provided, they are performed by an experienced endoscopist in children, but the evidence is inadequate. Considering the dearth of data, a systematic in-depth review and analysis of published literature is essential. We focus the discussion on advanced endoscopic methods that have already been developed and are more widely accepted in practice, but it is worth noting that there is an explosion of new endoscopic methods that continue to expand the frontiers of endoscopic treatment.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^115JQ71C]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — diagnostic and initial management for choledocholithiasis states that in patients with intermediate risk (10%-50%) of choledocholithiasis, we suggest either endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) given high specificity; consider factors including patient preference, local expertise, and availability. In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis, we recommend against urgent (< 48 hours) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In patients with large choledocholithiasis, we suggest performing large-balloon dilation after sphincterotomy rather than endoscopic sphincterotomy alone. For patients with large and difficult choledocholithiasis, we suggest intraductal therapy or conventional therapy with papillary dilation. This may be impacted by local expertise, cost, and patient and physician preferences.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^115REwkA]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis pre-test probability — clinical and imaging predictors are as follows: On abdominal ultrasound, visualization of a common bile duct stone carries approximately a 73% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Strong predictors include clinical evidence of acute cholangitis, a bilirubin greater than 1.7 mg/dL and a dilated common bile duct (CBD), and the presence of two or more of these factors has a pre-test probability of 50%-94% for choledocholithiasis (considered high). Patients without evidence of jaundice and a normal bile duct on ultrasound have a low probability of choledocholithiasis (< 5%), and patients that fall between these two spectrums are categorized as having an intermediate probability of choledocholithiasis. Meta-analyses have found an observed superiority in the sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as compared to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) due to better accuracy for small stones, and EUS-directed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been advocated as a cost-effective method since both EUS and ERCP could be performed in the same session; the algorithm presented in Fig. 1 may be helpful for managing patients with suspected choledocholithiasis dependent on their risk stratification.

### Renal ultrasonography… [^1167Kyq2]. Wikipedia (2017). Low credibility.

In the adult patient, a curved array transducer with center frequencies of 3–6 MHz is used, while the pediatric patient should be examined with a linear array transducer with higher center frequencies. Artifacts of the lowest ribs always shadow the upper poles of the kidneys. However, the whole kidney can be examined during either normal respiration or breath hold, as the kidney will follow the diaphragm and change position accordingly. Cortical thickness should be estimated from the base of the pyramid and is generally 7–10 mm. If the pyramids are difficult to differentiate, the parenchymal thickness can be measured instead and should be 15–20 mm. The echogenicity of the cortex decreases with age and is less echogenic than or equal to the liver and spleen at the same depth in individuals older than six months. In neonates and children up to six months of age, the cortex is more echogenic than the liver and spleen when compared at the same depth.

Doppler ultrasonography of the kidney is widely used, and the vessels are easily depicted by the color Doppler technique in order to evaluate perfusion. Applying spectral Doppler to the renal artery and selected interlobular arteries, peak systolic velocities, resistive index, and acceleration curves can be estimated. Complex cysts can have membranes dividing the fluid-filled center with internal echoes, calcifications or irregular thickened walls. The complex cyst can be further evaluated with Doppler US, and for Bosniak classification and follow-up of complex cysts, either contrast-enhanced ultrasound or contrast CT is used.

RCCs are typically isoechoic and peripherally located in the parenchyma, but can be both hypo- and hyper-echoic and are found centrally in medulla or sinus. The lesions can be multifocal and have cystic elements due to necrosis, calcifications and be multifocal. RCC is associated with von Hippel–Lindau disease, and with tuberous sclerosis, and US has been recommended as a tool for assessment and follow-up of renal masses in these patients. Some RCCs are hypovascular and not distinguishable with Doppler US. Therefore, renal tumors without a Doppler signal, which are not obvious simple cysts on US and CT, should be further investigated with CEUS, as CEUS is more sensitive than both Doppler US and CT for the detection of hypovascular tumors. The hydronephrosis is typically graded visually and can be divided into five categories going from a slight expansion of the renal pelvis to end-stage hydronephrosis with cortical thinning.

The evaluation of hydronephrosis can also include measures of calyces at the level of the neck in the longitudinal scan plane, of the dilated renal pelvis in the transverse scan plane and the cortical thickness, as explained previously. If the fluid in the dilated collecting system has echoes, pyonephrosis should be excluded by clinical exam, blood analysis and, in special cases, puncture or drainage. Hydronephrosis can also be caused by non-obstructive conditions, such as brisk diuresis in patients treated with diuretics, in pregnant women and in children with vesicoureteral reflux.

### Role of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the management of suspected choledocholithiasis [^115TZvVf]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are not precisely defined. With the increasing availability of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and several prospective studies proving the accuracy of this modality, it is important to select appropriate criteria for invasive testing when common bile duct (CBD) pathology is suspected.

Methods

We reviewed 200 consecutive ERCPs performed for jaundice, pancreatitis, noninvasive visualization of CBD stones, radiologic evidence of CBD dilatation, elevated liver function tests, or biliary colic. Diagnostic and therapeutic yields are determined for each indication and various combinations thereof.

Results

Of the 180 ERCPs performed for suspected choledocholithiasis, 97 (53.8%) were performed for multiple indications, whereas 83 (46.2%) were performed for only one indication. One hundred two patients (56.6%) had CBD pathology, whereas 78 explorations (43.4%) were negative. If multiple indications for ERCP were present, the diagnostic yield was 85.6%. When there was only one indication, the diagnostic yield decreased to 25.3%.

Conclusions

ERCP is an invasive procedure with significant morbidity that should be used selectively. MRCP may be a more appropriate initial evaluation of suspected CBD pathology in many patients.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: reduction of unnecessary ERCP by pre-procedural imaging and timing of ERCP [^115nVr4y]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and definitions

The primary endpoint was the proportion of ERCPs negative for sludge or stones in the CBD, irrespective of other ERCP findings (e.g. cholangiocarcinoma, papillary stenosis). The ERCP was considered positive upon clear photographic documentation of filling defect on cholangiography or when the endoscopist's report documented stones or any sludge. ERCP was considered negative in all other cases. Work-up toward ERCP was left at the discretion of the treating clinician. For this reason, we were able to assess the endpoint in a cohort of patients which reflects real-world practice work-up (whole cohort) and a subgroup of patients who have had a work-up as defined by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) 2019 guidelines. This subgroup included patients stratified to intermediate likelihood of CBD stones who underwent additional imaging and patients stratified to high likelihood of CBD stones who went straight to ERCP.

Each patient was retrospectively categorized in a low, intermediate, or high likelihood of CBD stones, according to the ASGE guideline for endoscopic management of CBD stones of 2010 and 2019 and the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline of 2019. Patients were considered to have a high likelihood for CBD stones according the ASGE 2019 guideline when they met one of the following criteria: CBD stone on abdominal US/cross-sectional imaging, clinical ascending cholangitis, or combination of total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL and dilated CBD on abdominal US/cross-sectional imaging. Intermediate likelihood for CBD stones when they met one of the following criteria: abnormal liver biochemical tests, age > 55 years or dilated CBD on abdominal US/cross-sectional imaging. All other patients were considered as having low likelihood for CBD stones. Clinical ascending cholangitis was defined according to the 2018 Tokyo Guideline. See Appendix Table S1, for details of ASGE and ESGE guideline criteria.

Secondary endpoints included the effects of pre-ERCP imaging on CBD sludge/stone visualization during ERCP, the timing (in days) of pre-ERCP imaging, and the ERCP-related complication rate in relation to presence of CBD stones. We used the Cotton criteria to describe ERCP-related complications (pancreatitis, cholangitis, bleeding, and perforation).

### Contemporary management of common bile duct stone: what you need to know [^117PaQzm]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nrvi1]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should include an assessment for possible choledocholithiasis (CBDS). Various diagnostic guidelines have been developed by expert bodies for this purpose, but uncertainties remain about their performance in wider practice.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta‐analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus for studies on adult populations published in English language between 2000 and August 2024. All studies pertaining to the performance of diagnostic guidelines developed or adopted by regional, national, or international professional bodies are considered, but we excluded diagnostic tools or scoring systems developed locally with limited scopes, such as those employed by a single institution or a group of related institutions. We extracted or derived performance measures in the forms of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative and performed meta‐analysis using a multilevel random effects model to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the reviewed guidelines and summarized their performance using summary ROC curves and AUCs. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the PROBAST risk of bias and applicability tool. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024581409).

Findings

Of 1892 records identified, 31 studies were eligible with data available, all of which had a low to moderate risk of overall bias. All studies focused on one or more of three international guidelines, namely the ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines in 2019. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73, respectively.

Conclusion

ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low‐risk patients, allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. All guidelines have limited specificity in identifying patients at high risk for CBDS and cannot reliably select patients for upfront ERCP.

Introduction

Choledocholithiasis, the occurrence of bile duct stones (BDS), is present in up to 15% of patients with gallstones. Approximately 10% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy will also have common BDS. The diagnosis of BDS requires a high degree of suspicion and is challenging because it cannot be made conclusively without invasive procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In 2010 the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) published guidelines to assist in risk stratifying patients being evaluated for choledocholithiasis (Table 1). The guidelines stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk categories based on clinical criteria, liver tests, and abdominal ultrasound (US). High risk is defined as the presence of any very strong predictor (BDS seen on US, clinical ascending cholangitis, and total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL) or the presence of both strong predictors (CBD dilated more than 6 mm and bilirubin 1.8–4 mg/dL) confers a high probability (> 50%) of BDS. In the low-risk category the probability of finding stones is < 10% while in the intermediate category (any other abnormal liver test, age > 55, clinical gallstone pancreatitis) the probability is 10–50%.

Table 1
Predictors of choledocholithiasis

The goal of these guidelines is to evaluate patients safely and efficiently in an evidence-based manner. While patient safety is paramount, it is also critical to evaluate these guidelines from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The goal of the algorithm was also to minimize the number of unnecessary endoscopic and radiologic procedures performed. According to Medicare, data spending on imaging has been the fastest growing segment of healthcare expenditures. Given the growing concern over deficits and the fact that entitlement spending is the largest driver of the national debt it is vital that these costs be controlled. Reigning in the costs of radiologic procedures will likely be an area of focus for policymakers especially since the number of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries is expected to rise rapidly in the coming years.

3.2 Performance of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE Guidelines

In ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines, patients are stratified into high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for CBDS based on various clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound criteria, as presented in Table 4. All three guidelines recommend ERCP or laparoscopic treatment for CBDS for patients stratified as high risk, MRCP or EUS for patients stratified as intermediate risk, and no additional workup prior to cholecystectomy for patients stratified as low risk. Given these similarities, we have applied identical strategies when performing the meta‐analysis of these guidelines by treating these three‐tiered stratification systems as predictive tools with two distinct thresholds, as detailed in the "Data Analysis" section above.

TABLE 4
Summary of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines.

Data for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are available from 21 studies with 12,047 patients, 17 studies with 9271 patients, and 8 studies with 5028 studies, respectively. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73 respectively, with their ROCs and summary ROCs as presented in Figure 2A–C. Test of similarity suggests the guidelines are dissimilar (p = 0.000001 for the overall comparison between three guidelines and p < 0.02 for all pairwise comparisons between guidelines). The jointly estimated ROC curves are presented in Figure 2D.

### Appropriate use of GI endoscopy [^115rMse5]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) — indications and limitations: ERCP is generally indicated in jaundiced patients suspected of having biliary obstruction; in patients without jaundice whose clinical and biochemical or imaging data suggest pancreatic duct or biliary tract disease; for evaluation of signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatic malignancy when results of direct imaging are equivocal or normal; for evaluation of pancreatitis of unknown etiology; for preoperative evaluation of chronic pancreatitis and/or pseudocyst; and for evaluation of the sphincter of Oddi by manometry, noting that empirical biliary sphincterotomy without sphincter of Oddi manometry is not recommended in patients with suspected type III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Indications also include endoscopic sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis, papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, to facilitate placement of biliary stents or dilation of biliary strictures, sump syndrome, choledochocele involving the major papilla, and ampullary carcinoma in patients who are not candidates for surgery, and to facilitate access to the pancreatic duct; further therapeutic uses include stent placement across benign or malignant strictures, fistulae, postoperative bile leak, or in high-risk patients with large unremovable common duct stones; dilation of ductal strictures; balloon dilation of the papilla; nasobiliary drain placement; pancreatic pseudocyst drainage in appropriate cases; tissue sampling from pancreatic or bile ducts; ampullectomy of adenomatous neoplasms of the major papilla; therapy of disorders of the biliary and pancreatic ducts; and facilitation of cholangioscopy and/or pancreatoscopy. ERCP is generally not indicated in evaluation of abdominal pain of obscure origin in the absence of objective findings that suggest biliary or pancreatic disease, for evaluation of suspected gallbladder disease without evidence of bile duct disease, or as further evaluation of proven pancreatic malignancy unless management will be altered; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and EUS are safe diagnostic procedures that can obviate the need for ERCP.

ASGE guideline — risk stratification to prompt ERCP specifies that in order to minimize the risk of diagnostic ERCP, we suggest the following HIGH-RISK criteria to directly prompt ERCP for suspected choledocholithiasis: (1) common bile duct (CBD) stone on ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging or (2) total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL AND dilated common bile duct on imaging (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ) or (3) ascending cholangitis. In patients with INTERMEDIATE-RISK criteria of abnormal liver tests or age > 55 years or dilated CBD on ultrasound, we suggest EUS, MRCP, laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), or laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound for further evaluation. For patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis without any of these risk factors, we suggest cholecystectomy without IOC.

ASGE guideline — Choledocholithiasis management recommendations include: In patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis we suggest either EUS or MRCP given high specificity; consider factors including patient preference, local expertise, and availability. In patients with gallstone pancreatitis without cholangitis or biliary obstruction/choledocholithiasis we recommend against urgent (< 48 hours) ERCP. In patients with large choledocholithiasis we suggest performing large balloon dilation after sphincterotomy rather than endoscopic sphincterotomy alone. For patients with large and difficult choledocholithiasis we suggest intraductal therapy or conventional therapy with papillary dilation; this may be impacted by local expertise, cost, patient and physician preferences.

Benign biliary tract disease — ERCP is particularly useful in the management of patients with biliary obstruction due to choledocholithiasis and other benign diseases of the biliary tract such as biliary strictures and postoperative biliary leaks, and successful endoscopic cholangiography with relief of biliary obstruction should be technically achievable in more than 90% of patients. Adjunctive cholangioscopy at the time of ERCP can be helpful in the management and treatment of choledocholithiasis and for assessing indeterminate strictures. ERCP with bile duct stenting and/or biliary sphincterotomy is the preferred treatment strategy for bile leaks.

Background

Prior studies have demonstrated that existing risk stratification guidelines for the evaluation of suspected choledocholithiasis lack accuracy, leading to the overutilization of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of published guidelines in predicting choledocholithiasis and to determine the impact of laboratory trends on diagnostic accuracy.

We identified patients with suspected choledocholithiasis hospitalized over a 5-year period (2009–2014) at a tertiary care academic medical center. Among eligible patients, we assessed the performance characteristics of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines predicting the presence of choledocholithiasis, confirmed by endoscopic ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiography, ERCP, or intra-operative cholangiography. We also evaluated whether a second set of liver function tests improved the accuracy of the guidelines.

Results

On presentation, 71 of the 173 eligible patients (41.4%) met ASGE high-probability criteria for choledocholithiasis. Of these, only 39 (54.9%) were found to have a choledocholithiasis on confirmatory testing. Conversely, of the 102 patients (58.6%) who were classified as low or intermediate probability, 32 (31.4%) had choledocholithiasis. Overall, the accuracy of the guidelines was 63% (sensitivity 54.9%; specificity 68.6%). Incorporating a second set of laboratory tests did not improve accuracy (62.7%), and a significant decline in liver function tests did not reliably predict spontaneous stone passage.

Conclusions

Existing guidelines performed suboptimally for predicting choledocholithiasis in our patient population, similar to other validation studies. These findings further underscore the importance of developing alternate risk stratification tools for choledocholithiasis, aiming to minimize unnecessary diagnostic ERCP.

### EUS versus MRCP to perform ERCP in patients with intermediate likelihood of choledocholithiasis: a randomised controlled trial [^114fHu7U]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

In patients with an intermediate likelihood of choledocholithiasis, European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to diagnose choledocholithiasis to make the indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) treatment; there is no randomised control trial to compare both in this setting.

Design

Patients with suspected choledocholithiasis satisfying ESGE guideline's intermediate likelihood were screened for this single-centre randomised controlled trial between November 2019 and May 2020. The enrolled patients were randomised to either EUS or MRCP. ERCP was performed in stone positive cases or if clinical suspicion persisted during follow-up. Negative cases underwent a further 6-month clinical follow-up. Main outcome was accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) of both tests to diagnose choledocholithiasis, with ERCP or follow-up as a gold standard.

Results

Of 266 patients, 224 patients (mean age: 46.77 ± 14.57 years; 50.9% female) were enrolled; overall prevalence of choledocholithiasis was 49.6%, with a higher frequency in the MRCP group (63/112 vs 46/112 for EUS). Both sensitivity of EUS and MRCP were similarly high (92%-98%), without significant differences between the two groups. The negative predictive value and likelihood ratio + were significantly higher in EUS arm (p < 0.05). The percentage of ERCPs either incorrectly halted back (false negatives: EUS: 2 vs MRCP: 5) or performed unnecessarily (false positives: EUS: 1 vs MRCP: 2) was low in both groups.

Conclusion

The performance parameters of both EUS and MRCP are comparable for detecting choledocholithiasis in the intermediate-risk group of choledocholithiasis and the choice of a test should be based on local expertise, availability of resources and patient preference.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^116xEiAL]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Each year choledocholithiasis results in biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and pancreatitis in a significant number of patients. The primary treatment, ERCP, is minimally invasive but associated with adverse events in 6% to 15%. This American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Standard of Practice (SOP) Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the endoscopic evaluation and treatment of choledocholithiasis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to rigorously review and synthesize the contemporary literature regarding the following topics: EUS versus MRCP for diagnosis, the role of early ERCP in gallstone pancreatitis, endoscopic papillary dilation after sphincterotomy versus sphincterotomy alone for large bile duct stones, and impact of ERCP-guided intraductal therapy for large and difficult choledocholithiasis. Comprehensive systematic reviews were also performed to assess the following: same-admission cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis, clinical predictors of choledocholithiasis, optimal timing of ERCP vis-à-vis cholecystectomy, management of Mirizzi syndrome and hepatolithiasis, and biliary stent therapy for choledocholithiasis. Core clinical questions were derived using an iterative process by the ASGE SOP Committee. This body developed all recommendations founded on the certainty of the evidence, balance of risks and harms, consideration of stakeholder preferences, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^114pP6iR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Pre-operative choledocholithiasis management — If choledocholithiasis is confirmed pre-operatively, options for clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before cholecystectomy or common bile duct exploration with cholecystectomy; ERCP is highly sensitive and specific and therapeutic to clear stones, with a success rate of approximately 80–90% for ductal clearance. Reasons for failure include large or impacted stones, duodenal diverticula, altered gastric or duodenal anatomy and intrahepatic stones, and risks include pancreatitis (1.3–6.7%), infection (0.6–5%), hemorrhage (0.3–2%), perforation (0.1–1%) and mortality (up to 1%). Following biliary clearance with ERCP, it is generally recommended to proceed with subsequent cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis which occurs in approximately 20% of patients. However, in patients with advanced comorbidities who are at significantly high risk for operative intervention, ERCP with sphincterotomy without further intervention can also be considered definitive therapy, as there has been no statistical difference in mortality.

Choledocholithiasis — management when biliary access cannot be obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgery includes that if pre-operative ERCP cannulation fails, "a pre-cut sphincterotomy can be considered", but this approach "has been associated… with an increased complication rate of 5–30%, which include perforation and post-ERCP pancreatitis". Additional access methods include the staged "rendez-vous" percutaneous transhepatic guidewire technique for duodenoscope cannulation and "endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage via choledochoduodenostomy", which "does require advanced endoscopic expertise". If choledocholithiasis is discovered intraoperatively and cannulation for stone extraction is unsuccessful, "a post-operative ERCP, further attempts via laparoscopic or open techniques or percutaneous biliary drainage can be pursued depending on local expertise and resource availability".

### Diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasonography in patients with intermediate or high likelihood of choledocholithiasis: a retrospective study from one university-based endoscopy center [^115uRB9S]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis is a common condition, which occurs in 10–20% of patients with cholelithiasis, 7–14% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomy, and 18–33% of patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. Management of patients with suspected choledocholithiasis requires confirmation of stones in the common bile duct (CBD).

Diagnosis of choledocholithiasis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, levels of serum markers of cholestasis, and imaging examination findings (transabdominal ultrasonography), but these factors are not highly sensitive or specific. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the gold standard method for diagnosis and treatment of choledocholithiasis. However, as indiscriminate use of ERCP increases the risk of procedure-related complications, ERCP is almost exclusively reserved for therapeutic purposes, and choledocholithiasis is usually diagnosed using non-invasive methods.

Choledocholithiasis — burden, costs, and ERCP risk: Among those with symptomatic cholelithiasis 10% to 20% have concomitant choledocholithiasis, and each episode of choledocholithiasis results in a cost of 9000 dollars; the economic impact exceeds 6.6 billion dollars, and choledocholithiasis is the leading cause of acute pancreatitis with 275,000 hospitalizations annually at a cost of 2.6 billion dollars. ERCP-guided treatment of bile duct stones has a significant risk (6%-15%) of major adverse events.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112t7JEZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

When the guidelines are used to identify individuals at high risk for CBDS for upfront ERCP, the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines are more specific with pooled specificities of 75% and 82%, respectively, compared to a specificity of 57% only with the ASGE 2010 guidelines. The lower specificities of ASGE guidelines probably reflect the inclusion of elevated bilirubin as a high‐risk criterion, when bilirubin in isolation had been found to be an unreliable predictor for CBDS on meta‐analysis. This is particularly relevant with ASGE 2010 guidelines, where a lesser degree of bilirubin elevation is considered high risk if the bile duct is also dilated. In use, the higher specificities of ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines translate to lower false positive rates of CBDS and therefore lower rates of nontherapeutic ERCP; however, this still amounts to 18% even with the most selective ESGE criteria, which comprise only of CBDS on ultrasound and acute cholangitis. In their meta‐analysis, Wang et al. found that CBDS on ultrasound is highly predictive for CBDS with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.6 and an average specificity of 94%, but acute cholangitis is much less predictive with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.3 and an average specificity of 89%. We hypothesize that the modest specificity of the guidelines is probably partly due to the inclusion of acute cholangitis as a criterion, which is variably and perhaps less objectively diagnosed on clinical grounds. In terms of sensitivities, all guidelines perform comparably but only modestly with pooled sensitivities of 62%–65%, resulting in over 30% of patients with CBDS misclassified as nonhigh risk. This is however of less clinical import because these individuals are likely to undergo further evaluation with MRCP or EUS with similar eventual outcomes, albeit at the price of additional costs and possible delays to definitive treatment.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to MRCP/EUS, BSG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain MRCP or EUS (depending on individual suitability, availability of the relevant test, local expertise, and patient acceptability) for identifying common bile duct stones in patients with an intermediate probability of disease.

### Guidelines on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^115NsHVC]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

The last 30 years have seen major developments in the management of gallstone-related disease, which in the United States alone costs over 6 billion dollars per annum to treat. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become a widely available and routine procedure, whilst open cholecystectomy has largely been replaced by a laparoscopic approach, which may or may not include laparoscopic exploration of the common bile duct (LCBDE). In addition, new imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance cholangiography (MR) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offer the opportunity to accurately visualise the biliary system without instrumentation of the ducts. As a consequence clinicians are now faced with a number of potentially valid options for managing patients with suspected CBDS. It is with this in mind that the following guidelines have been written.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: which test is best? [^111y9pBZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic cholelithiasis will affect approximately 10–15% of Americans in the next 5–10 years. It is estimated that at least 10–20% of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis will also have concurrent common bile duct stones. While the incidence of truly asymptomatic common bile duct stones is unknown, it is important to attempt to identify and stratify these patients to help guide their surgical management of both the gallbladder and the common bile duct. Common bile duct stones are one of the leading cause of acute pancreatitis in the US and also, when left untreated, can lead to cholangitis secondary to biliary obstruction and bacterial superinfection. These diagnoses increase patients morbidity as well as create a significant cost burden to our health care system.

Historically, patients with straightforward acute cholecystitis or biliary colic have been managed with minimally invasive cholecystectomy. Patients with clear evidence of acute cholangitis or biliary obstruction secondary to calculous disease require common bile duct drainage (either via ERCP or PTC depending on the situation), followed by cholecystectomy. There is, however, no general consensus on how to manage, or even how to identify, patients with intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis. Recognizing this, the American Society for Gastroenterology (ASGE) created a scoring system in 2010 (revised in 2019 to improve diagnostic accuracy) to help stratify these patients into low, intermediate, and high risk of choledocholithiasis and therefore help guide management. Low-risk patients should proceed to the operating room for cholecystectomy with or without intra-operative cholangiogram (IOC) at the surgeons discretion. High-risk patients should have planned common bile duct interrogation and clearance typically in the form of pre-operative or intra-operative ERCP. There is some evidence to support minimally invasive surgical common bile duct exploration in these ASGE high-risk patients though this still remains debated. There remains wide variability in the management of the intermediate-risk group. Some centers will plan to take most of these patients to the operating room for a cholecystectomy with a planned IOC. Others will defer definitive management to trend liver function tests. Others will obtain additional imaging to provide clarity prior to proceeding with invasive intervention. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are the two most commonly employed imaging techniques to help establish the diagnosis. Additionally, some patients will proceed to ERCP pre/intra/or post-operatively.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: reduction of unnecessary ERCP by pre-procedural imaging and timing of ERCP [^11227UAi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Common bile duct (CBD) stones are a commonly occurring gastroenterological condition, with an estimated yearly incidence of 45 per 100,000 in Western populations, increasing with age. CBD stones can lead to symptoms and complications, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, infection, and acute pancreatitis. Guidelines recommend removal of CBD stones with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Although ERCP is considered the gold standard for the treatment of CBD stones, the diagnostic role of this modality is limited by its invasive nature and safety issues, most notably the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (3.5–9.7%), cholangitis (0.5–3.0%), bleeding (0.3–9.6%), perforation (0.08–0.6%), and anesthesia-related adverse events (0.02%). Therefore it is important to curtail ERCP use to patients with the highest likelihood of CBD sludge or stones. The recommended diagnostic work-up consists of liver biochemistry and abdominal ultrasound (US) or cross-sectional imaging. In order to avoid unnecessary ERCPs, guidelines stratify patients with suspected CBD stones into three risk categories. Patients with a low likelihood (< 10%) of CBD stones are recommended for a prompt cholecystectomy without prior ERCP. Patients with a persistent clinical suspicion of CBD stones, but insufficient evidence of stones on abdominal US or cross-sectional imaging, are stratified with an intermediate likelihood (10–50%) of CBD stones. These patients are recommended to receive further imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), representing less-invasive and lower-risk alternatives for initial evaluation. For patients with a high likelihood (> 50%) it is advised to proceed directly to an ERCP procedure for stone clearance. However, even in patients with a high likelihood of CBD stones established after appropriate diagnostic work-up, 17–57% do not have stones or sludge on ERCP while being exposed to the risk of developing potential harmful complications.

We aimed to map the diagnostic pathway leading up to ERCP in current clinical practice and evaluate the ERCP outcome in a prospectively collected multicenter cohort of patients with suspected CBD stones.

Results

Cohort identification and characteristics

A total of 826 patients were enrolled in the original multicenter randomized trial. We excluded 119 patients (Fig. 1), because of an indication for ERCP other than (suspected) stones in the CBD (n = 68), procedure failure of ERCP (e.g. failed cannulation, ampulla not reached) (n = 46), and no performance of ERCP (n = 5). Finally, we included a total of 707 patients in the current study.

The median age of the patients was 59 years, and 436 (62%) patients were female (Table 1). The majority of the patients (92%) had biochemical tests examined prior to ERCP. Abdominal US was performed in 617 (87%) patients and CT in 90 (13%) patients. 338 (48%) patients suffered from acute cholangitis. According to the ASGE 2019 guideline, 20 patients were considered as low likelihood, 290 patients as intermediate likelihood, and 397 patients as high likelihood for choledocholithiasis. 485 patients (69%) received work-up as recommended by the ASGE 2019 guideline.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^113giJpF]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, more specifically with respect to therapeutic indications, choledocholithiasis, general indications, ASGE 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing pre- or postoperative ERCP or laparoscopic treatment, depending on local surgical and endoscopic expertise, in patients at high risk of choledocholithiasis or positive intraoperative cholangiogram.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116cT8D5]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

This systematic review has two main limitations. First, the included studies have drawn on different patient sources which can be broadly divided into three categories: (i) patients with acute biliary presentation identified via multiple records, (ii) patients who have undergone ERCP or EUS identified from endoscopic database, and (iii) patients with certain clinical diagnosis such as pancreatitis. It is conceivable that patients from different sources may have different underlying characteristics, with perhaps the most important example being possible higher pretest probabilities for CBDS when patients were drawn from the ERCP database. However, we argue that this is unlikely to affect the outcome of the meta‐analysis because sensitivity and specificity, the two measures we have focused on, are intrinsic to the guidelines and are prevalence‐invariant. Moreover, although there is between‐study heterogeneity particularly with respect to the ASGE 2010 guidelines, our sensitivity analysis suggests the impact is small in magnitude; for instance, in the worst case of ASGE 2010, its AUC has changed from 0.65 to 0.71 only after excluding outliers. Second, we have opted to test the guideline similarity using the likelihood ratio test because included studies are shared between the guidelines making the data dependent. Although this test has indicated that the guidelines are dissimilar, we would like to note that (i) likelihood testing is inherently anticonservative and may overstate the dissimilarities and (ii) the absolute differences in AUCs between the guidelines, even if they exist, are small and likely of little clinical import. For the above reasons, we assert that these limitations are unlikely to materially impact our key observations or the overall conclusions we draw from them.

In summary, the ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have comparable performance, with their key strength being the ability to rule out CBDS in low‐risk patients allowing these patients to proceed with cholecystectomy without additional workup. Both guidelines have only limited ability to identify patients at high risk for CBDS; therefore, using the guidelines to select patients for upfront ERCP is probably inappropriate. Both guidelines classify sizable proportions of patients as intermediate risk for whom management consensus is lacking and further research is required.

### Comparison of EUS and ERCP in the investigation with suspected biliary obstruction caused by choledocholithiasis: a randomized study [^113YrDKU]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

EUS may be used to reduce the need of diagnostic ERCP.

Objective

Our purpose was to investigate the benefits and safety of an EUS-guided versus an ERCP-guided approach in the management of suspected biliary obstructive diseases caused by choledocholithiasis, in whom a US study is not diagnostic.

Design

A randomized study.

Setting

A university medical unit.

Patients

Patients with clinical, biochemical, or radiologic suspicion of biliary obstruction.

Interventions

In the EUS group, therapeutic ERCP was performed at the same EUS session if a lesion was found. In the ERCP group, therapeutic treatment was carried out at the discretion of the endoscopist.

Main Outcome Measurements

The number of ERCPs avoided, procedure-related complications, and recurrent biliary symptoms on follow-up at 1 year.

Results

Thirty-three patients were randomized to EUS and 32 to ERCP. Three patients (9.4%) had failed ERCPs, whereas all EUS procedures were successful. Nine (27.3%) patients in the EUS group were found to have biliary lesions that were all treated by ERCP. In the ERCP group, 7 (22%) patients had biliary lesions detected that were treated in the same session. More patients had serious complications (bleeding, acute pancreatitis, and umbilical abscess) in the ERCP group. One patient in each group had recurrent biliary symptoms during follow-up. With EUS used as a triage tool, diagnostic ERCP and its related complications could be spared in 49 (75.4%) patients.

Conclusions

In patients suspected to have biliary obstructive disease, EUS is a safe and accurate test to select patients for therapeutic ERCP.

### Validation of choledocholithiasis predictors from the "2019 ASGE guideline for the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis" [^115kG5p8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Identifying patients likely to have CDL is an important clinical dilemma because endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), carries a 5–7% risk of adverse events. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic test performance of the 2010 and 2019 ASGE criteria used to help risk stratify patients with suspected CDL.

Methods

Consecutive patients evaluated for possible CDL from 2013 to 2019 were identified from surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic databases at a single academic center. Inclusion criteria included all patients who underwent ERCP and/or cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) for suspected CDL. We calculated the diagnostic test performance of criteria from both guidelines and compared their discrimination using the receiver operator curve. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify the strongest component predictors.

Results

1098 patients [age 57.9 ± 19.0 years, 62.8% (690) F] were included. 66.3% (728) were found to have CDL on ERCP and/or IOC. When using the 2019 guidelines, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy are 65.8, 78.9, 86.3, 54.1, and 70.4%, respectively. Using the 2010 guidelines, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy are 50.5, 78.9, 82.5, 44.8, and 60.1%, respectively. The AUC for high-risk criteria using the 2019 guidelines [0.726 (0.695, 0.758)] was greater than for the 2010 guidelines [0.647 (0.614, 0.681)]. The key difference providing the increased discrimination was the inclusion of stones on any imaging modality, which increased the sensitivity to 55.0% from 29.1%. Not including CDL on imaging or cholangitis, a dilated CBD was the strongest individual predictor of CDL on multivariate analysis (OR 3.70, CI 2.80, 4.89).

Conclusion

Compared to 2010, the 2019 high-risk criterion improves diagnostic test performance, but still performs suboptimally. Less invasive tests, such as EUS or MRCP, should be considered in patients with suspected CDL prior to ERCP.

### Choledocholithiasis: new approach to an old problem [^117MjTz1]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The old problem of diagnosis and treatment of choledocholithiasis is analyzed in light of recent developments in the field of radiology and surgery. The traditional indications for common bile duct (CBD) exploration resulted in a large number of unnecessary manipulations of the bile ducts. The same is now true of the widespread use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging cholangiography, which can clearly demonstrate CBD calculi by means of a noninvasive, complication-free technology, we should abandon the old indications for CBD exploration and be more conservative regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition. In an era of minimally invasive surgery we are seeing a significant reduction in the number of patients with choledocholithiasis.

### Predicting the likelihood of a persistent bile duct stone in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis: accuracy of existing guidelines and the impact of laboratory trends [^1153Dvqn]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines aim to stratify the likelihood of choledocholithiasis to guide the use of ERCP versus a lower-risk diagnostic study such as EUS, MRCP, or intraoperative cholangiography.

Objective

To assess the performance of existing guidelines in predicting choledocholithiasis and to determine whether trends in laboratory parameters improve diagnostic accuracy.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary-care hospital.

Patients

Hospitalized patients presenting with suspected choledocholithiasis over a 6-year period.

Interventions

Assessment of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines, its component variables, and laboratory trends in predicting choledocholithiasis.

Main Outcome Measurements

The presence of choledocholithiasis confirmed by EUS, MRCP, or ERCP.

Results

A total of 179 (35.9%) of the 498 eligible patients met ASGE high-probability criteria for choledocholithiasis on initial presentation. Of those, 99 patients (56.3%) had a stone/sludge on subsequent confirmatory test. Of patients not meeting high-probability criteria on presentation, 111 (34.8%) had a stone/sludge. The overall accuracy of the guidelines in detecting choledocholithiasis was 62.1% (47.4% sensitivity, 73% specificity) based on data available at presentation. The accuracy was unchanged when incorporating the second set of liver chemistries obtained after admission (63.2%), suggesting that laboratory trends do not improve performance.

Limitations

Retrospective study, inconsistent timing of the second set of biochemical markers.

Conclusion

In our cohort of patients, existing choledocholithiasis guidelines lacked diagnostic accuracy, likely resulting in overuse of ERCP. Incorporation of laboratory trends did not improve performance. Additional research focused on risk stratification is necessary to meet the goal of eliminating unnecessary diagnostic ERCP.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: which test is best? [^111T1o6w]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of data obtained in a prospective, observational study from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Retained Common Bile Duct Stone Study group. Patients admitted to 12 centers from 2016 to 2019 with suspected choledocholithiasis or acute biliary pancreatitis undergoing same admission cholecystectomy were included in the database. The data were deidentified of all protected health information. Patient demographics were collected including age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities. Admission vital signs and labs (complete blood count, liver function tests, and lipase) and results of transabdominal ultrasound were recorded. As part of this multi-center trial, all 12 participating institutions submitted their own data to our central database on patients admitted from 2016 to 2019 with suspected or confirmed choledocholithiasis or those undergoing cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis. Each institution received their own IRB approval and self-collected and reported data in a prospective and observational manner. Data were entered as case report forms into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) which is a secure Web-based software platform that meets Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance standards. Data entries were audited and validated on an ongoing basis by the lead researcher. Any discrepancies or missing data fields were relayed back to the primary institutions for further clarifications. To our knowledge, participating centers reported all cases that met the inclusion criteria during the time frame. From these admission characteristics, patients were stratified into ASGE low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the 2019 guidelines. Patients who were ASGE intermediate risk were included in the analysis. All of the 521 intermediate patients either underwent ERCP, MRCP, IOC, or EUS for diagnosis. Patients who were ASGE low and high risk were excluded. No diagnostic or therapeutic interventions were performed to the purposes of this or any other study. Subsequent pre-op imaging findings including CT scan, MRCP, and EUS were noted as well as the subsequent patient management with pre-, intra-, or post-operative ERCP, cholecystectomy alone, cholecystectomy with IOC, or CBDE. These patients were also followed for their post-operative outcomes to identify any retained common duct stones. Results from MRCP, IOC, and EUS were compared to the gold standard of the presence of stones at the time of ERCP or CBDE. Analysis of the testing characteristics sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and predictive values (positive (PPV) and negative (NPV)) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for MRCP, EUS, and IOC based on definitive identification of CBD stones.

### Suspected common bile duct stones: which test is best? [^115KRUv5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

736 patients were included in the initial dataset. 521 met the 2019 ASGE intermediate risk of choledocholithiasis criteria. 208/521 (39.9%) underwent pre-op MRCP, 44/521 (8.4%) underwent pre-op EUS, and 238/521 (45.7%) underwent IOC. 195/521(37.4%) of the intermediate-risk patients underwent pre-operative ERCP. 4 underwent intra-operative ERCP (one of whom had already underwent pre-op ERCP), and 73 underwent post-operative ERCP.

The diagnostic accuracies of MRCP, EUS, and IOC as well as their 95% CI are reported in Tables 1 and 2. MRCP had the lowest sensitivity of all three groups with 68.2%, specificity of 83.7%, PPV of 74.4%, and NPV of 79.2%.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kJknF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review, we have identified 6 diagnostic guidelines predicting CBDS in patients with acute biliary presentation. Of these, there is sufficient data in the literature for the meta‐analysis of the original ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines. All three guidelines stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk categories for CBDS, and are similar in their management recommendations.

When the guidelines are used to distinguish patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, both iterations of ASGE guidelines have excellent pooled sensitivities of 95%–97% for CBDS, while that of the ESGE guidelines is lower at 84%. The observed difference may reflect the inclusion of patients older than 55 as intermediate risk in both ASGE but not the ESGE guidelines, even though age was found to be a nonspecific and minimally predictive criterion in a meta‐analysis of predictor performance by Wang et al. These high sensitivities can be utilized to advantage clinically, because a low‐risk classification can reliably rule out most CBDS and allow low‐risk individuals to proceed to cholecystectomy without additional investigations. At this diagnostic threshold, all guidelines have poor specificities for CBDS from 7% to 15% only, resulting in many patients classified as at least intermediate risk thus prompting for additional investigations.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^113YJeSY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Choledocholithiasis — intraoperative imaging, decision-making, and contraindications: Laparoscopic intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) has an approximate sensitivity of 75–100% and a specificity of 76–100%, and both IOC and laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) allow evaluation of biliary anatomy to aid in determining the optimal approach for biliary clearance. When choledocholithiasis is confirmed intraoperatively, a decision should be made between common bile duct exploration at the time of cholecystectomy and post-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which is dependent on local availability of surgical and endoscopic expertise. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is contraindicated in the absence of common bile duct pathology, in patients with hemodynamic instability, or when a hostile porta hepatis is encountered intraoperatively.

### EUS: a meta-analysis of test performance in suspected choledocholithiasis [^117NVuCi]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

EUS has been proposed as a less invasive means of diagnosing choledocholithiasis and may eliminate the need for ERCP and its associated risks. The literature pertaining to EUS for the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis reports widely varying sensitivities and specificities.

Objective

To more precisely estimate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in suspected choledocholithiasis.

Design

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were used to identify prospective cohort studies in which the results of EUS were compared with the results of an acceptable criterion standard, including ERCP, intraoperative cholangiography, or surgical exploration. Two independent reviewers extracted standardized data and assessed trial quality. A random effects model was used to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed. All predefined potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression.

Patients

A total of 2673 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were reported in 27 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

Results

EUS had a high overall pooled sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96), a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.96), and an area under the curve of 0.98. Three variables appeared to yield a higher DOR: a higher disease prevalence, an adequate time interval between index test and criterion standards, and the presence of verification bias.

Limitations

Misclassification of patients by imperfect criterion standards could potentially underestimate the performance of an EUS.

Conclusions

An EUS is a noninvasive test, with excellent overall sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing choledocholithiasis. An EUS should, therefore, be used to select patients for a therapeutic ERCP to minimize the risk of complications associated with unnecessary diagnostic ERCP.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qFW5H]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Acute biliary disease is a common surgical problem. Choledocholithiasis, the presence of gallstone in common bile duct (CBDS), complicates 5%–20% of these presentations, potentially leading to increased morbidity and increased treatment complexity. CBDS can be identified with high accuracy with either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) prior to definitive treatment with cholecystectomy or during cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), but neither is routinely employed: In this case of ERCP, this is because it carries a risk of potentially serious adverse events such as pancreatitis and is usually performed on patients with high pretest probability. In the case of IOC, factors precluding its routine use include increased operation time, increased cost, and radiation exposure for both patients and staff. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are alternative modalities for diagnosing CBDS, with comparable diagnostic performance but without the issues associated with ERCP or IOC. Yet, these modalities are resource‐intensive, have limited availability, and may result in increased length of stay and additional financial costs.

Optimal management of acute biliary disease should incorporate an assessment for CBDS risk to select patients at elevated CBDS risk for these additional investigations (ERCP, IOC, MRCP, or EUS) while allowing patients at low risk to forego them safely. Over the years, various diagnostic guidelines have been proposed for this purpose, including those by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). However, these guidelines are based on opinions from the expert panel drawing on low to moderate quality evidence only and are developed with their specific locality in mind. Uncertainties remain as to how these guidelines perform in wider, worldwide practice, and which of these, if any, represents the most performant strategy for stratifying CBDS risk.

The goal of this systematic review is to examine and compare the diagnostic performance of various published guidelines in the evaluation of CBDS.

### Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis… [^1117ikJ9]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis is an application of computed tomography and is a sensitive method for diagnosis of abdominal diseases. It is used frequently to determine stage of cancer and to follow progress. It is also a useful test to investigate acute abdominal pain. Renal stones, appendicitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and bowel obstruction are conditions that are readily diagnosed and assessed with CT. CT is also the first line for detecting solid organ injury after trauma. For example, in the abdomen and pelvis, there are several indications for non-contrast imaging. These include: evaluation of renal calculi; assessment for gross intra-abdominal hemorrhage; and post-endostent volume measurements.

In addition, non-contrast images are often obtained in conjunction with contrast enhanced images in evaluating potential renal transplant donors and in the evaluation of the pancreas. Portal venous phase The most common technique is to perform portal venous phase imaging in the abdomen and pelvis. This results in near optimal contrast opacification of the majority of the solid abdominal organs and it is used for a wide variety of indications: nonspecific abdominal pain; hernia; infection; masses; and in most follow-up examinations. As a general rule, this single phase is adequate unless there is a specific clinical indication that has been shown to benefit from other phases.
- FIGURE 2.

Contrast enhanced CT demonstrating parenchymal enhancement of the intra-abdominal organs in the portal venous phase. Early arterial phase CT angiography is highly effective for evaluation of the arterial system, and has largely replaced conventional angiography due to the lower risk profile and ability to survey the entire abdomen. Images are acquired after a rapid bolus of intravenous contrast material during the arterial phase when the concentration of contrast material in the arterial system is high. Images are usually acquired using narrow collimation and can be retrospectively reconstructed using dedicated 3-dimensional workstations and software. CTA is commonly used in the head and chest in the evaluation of pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, vascular malformations, dissection, bleeding and ischemia.

Indications for early arterial phase imaging include: evaluation of aneurysms or dissections, hepatic, splanchnic or renal arterial anatomy, and arterial imaging in liver or kidney transplantation. Late arterial phase The late arterial phase is timed to correspond to the peak concentration of contrast material in highly vascular tumors and is performed approximately 20–35 seconds after the injection of intravenous contrast. Early arterial phase imaging is predominantly utilized for angiography and will be discussed separately. Late arterial phase imaging is almost always performed in conjunction with other phases to allow more complete characterization of any identified abnormalities. The primary indication for a late arterial phase is for the evaluation of hypervascular tumors of the liver such as hepatocellular carcinoma or hypervascular metastases.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rxoB9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines have similar performances and limitations with only minor differences in how they balance between sensitivity and specificity. Both perform better than ASGE 2010 guidelines, but neither is clearly superior with similar AUCs. In clinical practice, we believe the main value of the guidelines lies in their ability to rule out CBDS. For example, patients without any ASGE 2019 criteria (i.e. abnormal liver function, CBD > 6 mm, age > 55) have very low rate of CBDS and can proceed to cholecystectomy without additional workup. On the other hand, the guidelines have only modest specificity when used to identify patients at high risk for CBDS. Although the guidelines can help limit ERCP to a smaller group of patients if used as intended, the nontherapeutic ERCP rate is still arguably too high resulting in an undesirable number of nontherapeutic ERCP with its attending risks of ERCP‐related complications such as pancreatitis or perforation. A more refined strategy is therefore indicated.

With all guidelines, a substantial proportion of patients are expected to fall into the intermediate risk category, but there remains a debate on how these patients are best managed. Although much research effort has previously focused on comparing MRCP and EUS in this patient group, both ASGE and ESGE expert panels have deemed the evidence to be of low to moderate quality only, citing a lack of data on cost‐effectiveness and other logistical considerations. To optimize the management of these patients, further research in these deficient areas is required. Moreover, alternative imaging techniques such as abbreviated MRCP or novel tools such as machine learning have potentials to become disruptors to or even possible replacement for existing treatment paradigms, with additional avenues for improvement. For instance, Steinway et al. have demonstrated superior AUC with machine learning when compared to ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines in a proof‐of‐concept study.

### Comparing diagnostic accuracy of current practice guidelines in predicting choledocholithiasis: outcomes from a large healthcare system comprising both academic and community settings [^117ACib7]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) 2010 guidelines for suspected choledocholithiasis were recently updated by proposing more specific criteria for selection of high-risk patients to undergo direct ERCP while advocating the use of additional imaging studies for intermediate- and low-risk individuals. We aim to compare the performance and diagnostic accuracy of 2019 versus 2010 ASGE criteria for suspected choledocholithiasis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of a prospectively maintained database (2013–2019) of over 10,000 ERCPs performed by 70 gastroenterologists in our 14-hospital system. We randomly selected 744 ERCPs in which the primary indication was suspected choledocholithiasis. Patients with a history of cholecystectomy or prior sphincterotomy were excluded. The same patient cohort was assigned as low, intermediate, or high risk according to the 2010 and 2019 guideline criteria. Overall accuracy of both guidelines was compared against the presence of stones and/or sludge on ERCP.

Results

Of 744 patients who underwent ERCP, 544 patients (73.1%) had definite stones during ERCP and 696 patients (93.5%) had stones and/or sludge during ERCP. When classified according to the 2019 guidelines, fewer patients were high risk (274/744, 36.8%) compared with 2010 guidelines (449/744, 60.4%; P < .001). Within the high-risk group per both guidelines, definitive stone was found during ERCP more frequently in the 2019 guideline cohort (226/274, 82.5%) compared with the 2010 guideline cohort (342/449, 76.2%; P < .001). In our patient cohort, overall specificity of the 2010 guideline was 46.5%, which improved to 76.0% as per 2019 guideline criteria (P < .001). However, no significant change was noted for either positive predictive value or negative predictive value between 2019 and 2010 guidelines.

Conclusions

The 2019 ASGE guidelines are more specific for detection of choledocholithiasis during ERCP when compared with the 2010 guidelines. However, a large number of patients are categorized as intermediate risk per 2019 guidelines and will require an additional confirmatory imaging study.

### Is endoscopic treatment beneficial in patients with clinically suspicious of common bile duct stones but no obvious filling defects during the ERCP examination? [^112eFSdG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

In 2010, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) established a general rule for the evaluation of likelihood of choledocholithiasis, in which; Patients were divided into "high probability (risk of CBDS > 50%)", "intermediate probability (risk of CBDS: 10 ~ 50%)", and "low probability (risk of CBDS < 10%)" groups. In addition, the author also pointed-out the management algorithm for patients with symptomatic choledocholithiasis. However, sometimes, no obvious filling defects inside CBD could be found by cholangiogram (ERC, Fig. 1), even prior images, such as trans-abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, had demonstrated the evidence of CBDS. Regarding the possible complications, further the treatment procedures, such as endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and/or papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) in this situation is worthy consideration. The aim of this retrospective study was to estimate the positive rate of CBDS in patients with negative filling defects from ERC, and the factors for possible CBDS prediction, as well as the treatment-related complications (safety concern).

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^111bYwUZ]. Gut (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to ERCP, BSG 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that tolerability and likelihood of therapeutic success are higher in selected patients when ERCP is performed with propofol sedation or general anesthesia. Ensure that hospitals managing patients with common bile duct stones have ready and prompt access to anesthesia-supported ERCP, either as an on-site service or provided by another ERCP unit as part of a clinical network.
