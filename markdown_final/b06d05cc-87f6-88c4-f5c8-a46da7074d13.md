## Question

A 54-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath, fever, and cough. He recently returned from a trip to Arizona. On examination, he is tachypneic and hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen. Chest imaging reveals diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Laboratory testing confirms the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis. He is admitted to the intensive care unit due to significant impairment of gas exchange. The infectious diseases team is consulted for management recommendations.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended initial antifungal therapy for this patient, and what should be done after clinical improvement? Please justify your answer based on the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended initial antifungal therapy for a 54-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, diffuse pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, and respiratory failure, and what to do after clinical improvement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and severity classification. Then, I should verify which guideline statements directly address diffuse/severe pulmonary disease and ICU-level illness. Next, I will extract the specific initial therapy and dosing, including lipid versus deoxycholate formulations. After that, I need to determine the transition strategy and duration once the patient improves. Finally, I should consider special considerations like diabetes as a risk factor and reconcile any apparent discrepancies between IDSA and ATS guidance, anchoring to the most authoritative sources for severe disease.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and severity. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with hypoxemia and ICU admission for gas-exchange impairment meet criteria for severe, diffuse pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, which is distinct from focal or mild disease and warrants aggressive therapy rather than observation or oral azole monotherapy alone at onset [^6ceafe5c] [^58f1a187].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline anchors. The ATS 2011 statement explicitly addresses diffuse pulmonary coccidioidomycosis with significant impairment of gas exchange and recommends liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day or amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day until clinical improvement, followed by fluconazole 400 mg/day or itraconazole 400 mg/day for at least 1 year, which directly matches this patient's presentation and ICU status [^6ceafe5c].

> I should confirm the initial therapy details. For severe diffuse pulmonary disease, amphotericin B is preferred initially because it achieves a faster clinical response than azoles; lipid formulations are often favored for better tolerability, with liposomal amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg/day or deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day as acceptable options, and some experts combine amphotericin with a triazole during induction and continue the triazole after stabilization, though the core recommendation is amphotericin until improvement is evident [^c421cdcc] [^32783b02] [^15320f75].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral therapy up front. I initially thought fluconazole 400–800 mg daily might suffice given diabetes as a risk factor, but that would be appropriate for extensive pulmonary involvement in a stable patient, not for diffuse disease with respiratory failure; I need to correct that and adhere to amphotericin-based induction for ICU-level illness, then de-escalate to an azole after stabilization [^58f1a187] [^6ceafe5c].

> Next, I should review the transition plan. After clinical improvement and stabilization, I should switch to an oral triazole, typically fluconazole 400 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily, and continue for at least 12 months; in immunocompromised hosts or those with ongoing risk, longer courses and even indefinite suppression may be considered, though for this patient without stated immunosuppression beyond diabetes, a minimum of 1 year is reasonable with reassessment thereafter [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc].

> I need to ensure I address diabetes as a risk factor. IDSA recommends initiating antifungal therapy in patients with extensive pulmonary involvement or concurrent diabetes, which supports treating this patient aggressively; however, it does not specify amphotericin for diabetes alone, so the ICU-level severity and diffuse pattern are what drive the amphotericin-first strategy here rather than diabetes per se [^58f1a187] [^5f9854ef].

> Let me consider duration and monitoring. The ATS explicitly advises at least 1 year of azole therapy after improvement, and many clinicians extend beyond 1 year in those with diabetes or if radiographic or clinical abnormalities persist; I should confirm serologic and radiographic stabilization before discontinuation and plan longitudinal follow-up given relapse risk in chronic pulmonary disease [^6ceafe5c] [^27e25b34].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: initiate liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV daily (or amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily if lipid is unavailable) and continue until clear clinical improvement in oxygenation and symptoms, then transition to fluconazole 400 mg orally daily (or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily) for a minimum of 12 months, with reassessment of symptoms, serology, and chest imaging before stopping therapy [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc].

---

For a 54-year-old man with diffuse pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and respiratory failure, **start liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV daily** [^6ceafe5c] until clinical improvement, then switch to fluconazole 400 mg orally daily [^c421cdcc] for at least 12 months [^468905b0]. Diabetes increases the risk of severe disease [^notfound], so **prolonged therapy and close follow-up are essential** [^27e25b34].

---

## Initial antifungal therapy

- **Liposomal amphotericin B**: 5 mg/kg IV daily [^6ceafe5c] is the preferred initial therapy for severe diffuse pulmonary coccidioidomycosis with respiratory failure [^c421cdcc].

- **Alternative**: If liposomal amphotericin B is unavailable, use amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc].

- **Duration**: Continue until clinical improvement (typically 1–2 weeks), then transition to oral therapy [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc].

---

## Transition to oral therapy after clinical improvement

After clinical improvement, **transition to fluconazole 400 mg orally daily** [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc] and continue for at least 12 months [^468905b0]. Alternative: Itraconazole 200 mg orally twice daily is an option if fluconazole is not tolerated or is ineffective [^6ceafe5c] [^c421cdcc].

---

## Special considerations in diabetic patients

Diabetes increases the risk of severe and disseminated coccidioidomycosis [^notfound]; therefore, **prolonged antifungal therapy and close monitoring are recommended** [^27e25b34]. Maintain strict glycemic control to support immune function and reduce complications [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Regular assessment of symptoms, oxygenation, and radiographic improvement [^39ec37ce].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic liver function tests during azole therapy [^notfound].

- **Duration**: Total antifungal therapy should be at least 12 months, with individualized adjustments based on clinical response and immune status [^468905b0].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Phase** | **Recommended therapy** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial therapy | Liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV daily | Until clinical improvement (1–2 weeks) |
| Transition therapy | Fluconazole 400 mg orally daily | At least 12 months |
| Alternative | Itraconazole 200 mg orally twice daily | At least 12 months |

---

The recommended approach is to start **liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV daily** [^6ceafe5c] until clinical improvement, then switch to fluconazole 400 mg orally daily [^c421cdcc] for at least 12 months [^468905b0], with close monitoring given the patient's diabetes and severe disease.

### Treatment for early, uncomplicated coccidioidomycosis: what is success? [^0fe1f578]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis remains challenging. Such infections produce a variety of signs, symptoms, and serologic responses that cause morbidity in patients and concern in treating clinicians for the possibility of extrapulmonary dissemination. Illness may be due to ongoing fungal growth that produces acute inflammatory responses, resulting in tissue damage and necrosis, and for this, administering an antifungal drug may be of benefit. In contrast, convalescence may be prolonged by other immunologic reactions to infection, even after fungal replication has been arrested, and in those situations, antifungal therapy is unlikely to yield clinical improvement. In this presentation, we discuss what findings are clinical indicators of fungal growth and what other sequelae are not. Understanding these differences provides a rational management strategy for deciding when to continue, discontinue, or reinstitute antifungal treatments.

Antifungal treatment options—uncomplicated coccidioidal pneumonia: For early uncomplicated coccidioidal infection, the usual adult fluconazole dose is 400 mg daily, and some experts would recommend 800 mg daily. Many experts would recommend a treatment duration ranging from 3 to 6 months or longer, and treatment can be discontinued when signs, symptoms, and inflammatory markers have resolved and serologies and radiographs have stabilized; complete serological resolution is not necessary to discontinue medications. Whether or not antifungal therapy is initiated, all patients will benefit from other elements of a management plan, and no clinical studies exist to guide the optimal dose or duration for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.

Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis—azole therapy and amphotericin B (AmB): In a randomized double-blinded comparison of fluconazole 400 mg daily to itraconazole 200 mg twice daily, the clinical response after 8 months of treatment was approximately 55%, and response rates between the 2 regimens for chronic pulmonary infections were comparable. Some experts recommend higher doses of fluconazole; however, there is no evidence that higher doses are more effective. Treatment courses should be continued for at least 1 year and, in some cases, longer, but symptoms recur in approximately 30% of patients upon discontinuation. Because AmB is administered intravenously and is often accompanied by significant side effects, we recommend that AmB be reserved for patients who do not respond to azoles or in patients whose illness is so severe that it requires management in an intensive care unit.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Infectious Diseases Society of America considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is a systemic infection endemic to parts of the southwestern United States and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. Residence in and recent travel to these areas are critical elements for the accurate recognition of patients who develop this infection. In this practice guideline, we have organized our recommendations to address actionable questions concerning the entire spectrum of clinical syndromes. These can range from initial pulmonary infection, which eventually resolves whether or not antifungal therapy is administered, to a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Additional recommendations address management of coccidioidomycosis occurring for special at-risk populations. Finally, preemptive management strategies are outlined in certain at-risk populations and after unintentional laboratory exposure.

Coccidioidomycosis in children with HIV—Liposomal amphotericin B is the treatment of choice with similar efficacy and fewer adverse events. After the patient is stabilized, therapy with an azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) can be substituted and continued to complete a 1-year course of antifungal therapy. Chronic suppressive therapy (secondary prophylaxis) with fluconazole or itraconazole is routinely recommended following initial induction therapy for disseminated disease. Therapy with amphotericin B results in a more rapid clinical response in severe, non-meningitic disease.

Treating coccidioidomycosis—severe pulmonary or extrapulmonary infection (except meningitis): Preferred therapy is amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily (AII) or lipid formulation amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg IV daily (AIII), particularly for those with underlying renal dysfunction (BIII). Use until clinical improvement, then switch to triazole therapy with fluconazole 400 mg PO daily or itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily (BIII). Some specialists recommend combining amphotericin B deoxycholate or lipid formulation amphotericin B with a triazole (fluconazole or itraconazole 400 mg daily) as initial therapy and continue the triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (CIII).

### Coccidioidomycosis [^575540ad]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Coccidioides immitis and C posadasii are pathogenic dimorphic fungi responsible for causing coccidioidomycosis in the Southwestern United States and Central and South America. Antifungal therapy is beneficial and entails careful periodic assessment with therapies ranging from none or short courses of therapy to prolonged antifungal therapy. Factors that influence the decision to treat are the duration or severity of infection, radiographic findings, anticomplementary titers, presence of underlying immunosuppression, and comorbidities. Cure for disseminated infection is infrequent with current treatment regimens. This review summarizes the management guidelines for various disease manifestations and reviews data on challenging cases with newer agents.

Primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis—natural history and comparative observational outcomes: In a survey of endemic-area clinicians, among 354 patients with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, 325 (92%) recovered without complication and 1 had fatal CM; at that time, no effective antifungal treatment was available. In an observational Veterans Administration study of early infection, treated (n = 54) vs untreated (n = 51) fluconazole cohorts had similar time to at least 50% symptom improvement (95 days vs 98 days; P = .899), and none of the 50 untreated patients had progressive, recurrent, or disseminated infection, whereas among the 54 treated patients, 8 had documented recurrence of pulmonary symptoms or extrapulmonary complications after treatment discontinuation, with 1 meningitis occurring 2 years after discontinuation. In another prospective observational study of otherwise healthy adults with mild to moderate disease, 20 of 36 (56%) received antifungal treatment and 16 of 36 (44%) received no antifungal treatment, and the treated group did not reach primary (50% drop in symptom score) or secondary endpoints faster than the untreated group. No randomized trials exist to assess whether antifungal treatment shortens early uncomplicated illness or prevents later complications, and the optimal dose or duration of such treatment has not been established.

Coccidioidomycosis—initial therapy for severe or disseminated disease indicates that amphotericin B is the preferred initial therapy for patients who have diffuse pulmonary involvement or are severely ill with extrathoracic disseminated disease (AII). Most experience has been with the deoxycholate formulation, using an initial dose of 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) daily. Lipid formulations should be considered as an equivalent initial therapy, particularly if there is underlying renal dysfunction (AIII), and an initial daily dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg is appropriate.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^3937c850]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis treatment—For severe illness with respiratory compromise due to diffuse pulmonary or disseminated non-meningitic disease, liposomal amphotericin B preparation at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight IV once daily can be increased to as much as 10 mg/kg body weight IV once daily for life-threatening infections; amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.5–1.0 mg/kg body weight IV once daily is also listed, until clinical improvement. After stabilization, therapy with an azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) can be substituted and continued to complete a 1-year course of antifungal therapy. If unable to use amphotericin B, fluconazole 12 mg/kg body weight (maximum 800–1,200 mg) per dose IV or by mouth once daily is provided, and treatment is continued for a total of 1 year followed by secondary prophylaxis. Surgical debridement of bone, joint, and/or excision of cavitary lung lesions may be helpful. Itraconazole is the preferred azole for treatment of bone infections, with fluconazole as an alternative agent. Some experts initiate an azole during amphotericin B therapy, whereas others defer until after amphotericin B is stopped. For treatment failure, can consider voriconazole, isavuconazole, caspofungin, or posaconazole (or combinations), with experience limited in children and options to be discussed with an expert. Chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole or itraconazole is routinely recommended following initial induction therapy for disseminated disease, and therapy with amphotericin B results in a more rapid clinical response in severe, nonmeningeal disease.

Lipid formulations are likely to be as effective as the deoxycholate formulation and should be favored initial therapy, particularly in patients with underlying renal dysfunction (AIII), using a daily dose of amphotericin B of 3 to 5 mg/kg IV, and therapy should continue until clinical improvement is observed and then be changed to an oral triazole antifungal (BIII).

### Coccidioidomycosis [^cb0b9bcd]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the dimorphic pathogenic fungi Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadassi, is endemic to the southwestern United states and Central and South America. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis continues to increase. Coccidioidomycosis is typically a self-limiting influenza-like respiratory illness; however, it can lead to disseminated disease outside of the lungs. Not all nondisseminated cases require therapy, but antifungal therapy is typically beneficial requiring treatment ranging from months to lifelong. Clinical factors related to treatment decisions include severity of symptoms, radiography, coccidioidomycosis serologic results, and concurrent medical problems including immunosuppression. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment options.

Asymptomatic coccidioidal cavity management—We recommend against the use of antifungal therapy for patients with an asymptomatic cavity (strong, low). Coccidioidal pneumonia can leave a thin-walled cavity as a residual in 5% of cases; in a patient who is asymptomatic and not immunosuppressed, periodic follow-up observation is recommended, and usually, periodic plain radiographs of the chest are adequate for monitoring; if cavities are very large or adjacent to the pleura, they may rupture, but this complication is surprisingly infrequent and antifungal treatment would not prevent this.

Continue until clinical improvement, then switch to an azole (fluconazole 400 mg PO daily or itraconazole 200 mg PO twice daily) (BIII). Therapy should be continued for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and should be continued in patients with HIV viremia or with CD4 count <250 cells/mm3 (BIII). As an alternative approach, some specialists will combine amphotericin B with a triazole (fluconazole or itraconazole, with itraconazole preferred for bone disease) as initial therapy and continue triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (CIII).

Background information about coccidioidomycosis—organism biology and early pulmonary infection are summarized as follows: Coccidioides species are dimorphic fungi that cause coccidioidomycosis, growing in the environment as mycelia that produce single-cell arthroconidia and, after mammalian infection, transforming into spherules that revert back to mycelial growth if cultured. Virtually all coccidioidal infections are initiated by inhalation of an arthroconidium, and the most common initial syndrome is that of a respiratory illness.

### Coccidioidomycosis in persons infected with HIV type 1 [^305baad8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a recognized opportunistic infection among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Early in the HIV epidemic, most cases presented as overwhelming diffuse pulmonary disease with a high mortality rate. Although these cases are still seen, patients without significant immunodeficiency frequently present with a community-acquired pneumonia syndrome. Diagnosis can be established by cytological staining, culture, or serologic testing. All patients with HIV infection and symptomatic coccidioidomycosis should be treated with antifungal therapy. Severe cases frequently require a combination of therapy with amphotericin B and a triazole antifungal. Therapy for at least 1 year is recommended, but for patients with a focal pulmonary infection and peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts of >250 cells/microL, it may be reasonable to stop therapy after this time. Other manifestations of coccidioidomycosis require prolonged therapy, and life-long treatment is recommended for persons with meningitis.

Coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV—primary prevention, treatment thresholds, and monitoring: Antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal-endemic regions (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count <250 cells/μL (strong, moderate), and therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains <250 cells/μL (strong, low). For patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥250 cells/μL, clinical management should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), whereas outside coccidioidal-endemic regions serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low).

### Coccidioidomycosis [^7c1ca791]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The difficulties in managing this potentially horrific disease, with its myriad manifestations, are immense, because host factors dramatically impact outcome. Coccidioidomycosis should warrant great respect among clinicians, because, even with dramatic improvements in therapies, outcomes remain poor. Although there have been outstanding successes with these new therapies, tragic losses after years of immense patient suffering still occur. Coccidioidomycosis is a geographically restricted fungus but is one that inflicts tremendous suffering on affected patients. In addition, because of travel and the influx of susceptible hosts, dramatic increases in patients at risk for infection are seen throughout the southwest United States. The extended-spectrum azoles, such as posaconazole and voriconazole, may prove to be more efficacious in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis than prior agents, including amphotericin B, fluconazole, and itraconazole. Additional resources are needed to conduct randomised, controlled clinical trials for the treatment of this disease.

Coccidioidal meningitis (CM)—management of failure of initial therapy recommends that in patients who clinically fail initial fluconazole therapy, higher doses are a first option (strong, moderate); alternative options are to change to another orally administered azole or to initiate intrathecal AmB therapy (strong, moderate). A combination of clinical, CSF, and potential radiographic parameters obtained on a regular basis should be used to define treatment success and failure, with CSF parameters the most important variable. If low-dose fluconazole (400 mg orally daily) was the original option, increasing to 800–1200 mg daily should be considered, and the Mycosis Study Group defined response as a decrease in baseline score by 40% without relapse while treatment was continued.

### Characteristics of patients with mild to moderate primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis [^60010ffa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment decisions were determined by the treating physicians, and whether a patient received antifungal therapy before enrollment was recorded (medication name, dose, frequency, duration). After patients were enrolled, physician investigators determined the need to initiate or continue antifungal medication on a case-by-case basis. Patients were assigned to the treatment group if at any time before enrollment through study completion they received any antifungal treatment.

The medical care for coccidioidomycosis was provided by physician investigators and conducted in a standardized fashion. The initial evaluation included a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serologic testing for HIV, pregnancy testing, and serologic testing for coccidioidomycosis (by enzyme immunoassay, immunodiffusion, and complement fixation); collection of microbiological specimens, if applicable (mostly sputum for fungal culture); and analysis of chest radiographs. Patients were evaluated clinically, serologically, and radiographically (chest) at enrollment and at 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis special issues and adjunctive measures—Surgical debridement of bone, joint, and/or excision of cavitary lung lesions may be helpful. Itraconazole is the preferred azole for treatment of bone infections. Some experts initiate an azole during amphotericin B therapy; others defer initiation of the azole until after amphotericin B is stopped. For treatment failure, clinicians can consider voriconazole, caspofungin, or posaconazole (or combinations), noting limited experience and lack of definitive pediatric dosages. Chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole or itraconazole is routinely recommended following initial induction therapy for disseminated disease and is continued lifelong for meningeal disease. Therapy with amphotericin results in a more rapid clinical response in severe, non-meningeal disease.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis—recommendations for neonates and breastfeeding: We recommend against coccidioidal serologic tests for infants during the first 3 months of life, and positive tests should be interpreted with caution during the first year of life (strong, moderate). Empiric therapy with fluconazole at 6–12 mg/kg daily is recommended for infants suspected of coccidioidomycosis and should continue until the diagnosis has been ruled out (strong, low). Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers on azole antifungals other than fluconazole (strong, moderate).

Allogeneic HSCT recipients with coccidioidomycosis—survival and suppression observations: Among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients, only 7 of 15 published cases survived initial treatment. One patient received a cumulative 1 g amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate and, with no further suppressive treatment, had no relapse, whereas 4 of 5 survivors in a series of 11 HSCT recipients received long-term suppressive antifungal treatment and none of the 5 relapsed; it is also the uncontrolled observation of one author that transplant recipients with severe disease not responding to antifungals alone may benefit from reduction (without complete withdrawal) of immunosuppression.

Coccidioidomycosis in HIV—therapy after immune reconstitution: In HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV RNA on potent antiretroviral (ARV) therapy who have a CD4 ≥250/mm3, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in the general population (AII). For patients who meet the above criteria with focal pulmonary disease, treatment with triazole antifungal should continue for a minimum of 6 months (AII). For patients with diffuse pulmonary disease and those with extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and for patients with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 <250/mm3, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII).

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis—HIV infection management recommendations state that antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal endemic regions (strong, moderate), and that antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count <250 cells/μL (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains <250 cells/μL (strong, low), whereas for patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥250 cells/μL, clinical management of coccidioidomycosis should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), but outside coccidioidal-endemic regions, serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low), and initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be delayed because of the concern about coccidioidal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (strong, low). All the above recommendations are based on the assumption that the patient has been prescribed potent ART, which is strongly encouraged.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis. Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations.

3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms. 27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit.

Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. METHYLXANTHINES Methylxanthines act on lung tissue through two mechanisms: as a nonselective PDE-4 inhibitor or a bronchodilator. Because of a low therapeutic ratio, low toxicity thresholds, and significant interactions with other commonly used medications, methylxanthines are not generally recommended. 3, 29. ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Oral corticosteroids have a high adverse effect profile and are used primarily as an adjunctive treatment for acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or those seen in the emergency department. They are not recommended for routine use in the daily management of COPD. 3, 4, 20 Oral corticosteroids do not reduce symptoms, exacerbations, or hospitalizations but increase adverse effects with an NNH of 6.

Introduction—approximate annual burden and trends in the United States: of the estimated 150 000 infections that occur annually, 50 000 likely produce an illness warranting medical attention, 10 000–20 000 are diagnosed and reported, 2000–3000 produce pulmonary sequelae, 600–1000 disseminate hematogenously, and 160 result in death; from 1998 to 2011, cases reported from endemic states have risen 10-fold; in patients with specific gene mutations that alter immunologic responses, the risk of disseminated infection can be as high as 75%, a striking increase from what would ordinarily be approximately a 1% risk.

### Successful treatment of a critically ill patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, using adjunctive interferon-gamma [^d0f58f92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conventional antifungal therapy was not successful for a critically ill patient who had been hospitalized for 137 days in the intensive care unit with disseminated Coccidioides immitis infection and respiratory failure. The addition of interferon- gamma to the therapeutic regimen resulted in improvement and discharge from the hospital. Adjunctive interferon- gamma used in the successful treatment of severe coccidioidomycosis has not been reported previously.

Symptomatic cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia—indications for surgical resection (Recommendation 9): We recommend that surgical options be explored when the cavities are persistently symptomatic despite antifungal treatment. We recommend that surgical options be considered when cavities have been present for more than 2 years and if symptoms recur whenever antifungal treatment is stopped (strong, very low). Early literature indicates that approximately half of coccidioidal cavities close within 2 years of the initial infection, so it is therefore recommended that surgical resection be avoided for this period; after a cavity has been documented to be present for >2 years, surgical options seem more appropriate with persistent or recurrent symptoms, often when cavities are large, near the pleural surface, and cause pleuritic pain, chronic symptomatic infection, or frequent or severe hemoptysis.
