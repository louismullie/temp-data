Hpv vaccine guidlines

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about HPV vaccine guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline authorities and their hierarchy. Then, I should verify routine vaccination ages and dosing schedules. Next, I will examine catch-up recommendations through age 26 and the rationale for harmonization. After that, I need to evaluate the shared clinical decision-making framework for ages 27–45 and why the ACS does not endorse it. I will then review special populations, including immunocompromised patients and those with HIV. Finally, I should confirm product-specific considerations, implementation strategies, and how vaccination interacts with cervical cancer screening, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative sources and their hierarchy so I don't anchor on a single organization. ACIP/CDC sets national immunization policy, the American Cancer Society adapts and sometimes qualifies ACIP guidance, and ACOG translates recommendations for obstetrician–gynecologists; professional societies like ASCO and specialty groups (e.g. ASCRS, NCCN) align with ACIP/CDC while adding disease-specific context, so I should integrate these layers rather than rely on any one in isolation [^dbc9f0d9] [^b3a076c1] [^cd759357] [^d5e144da].

> I need to verify routine vaccination ages and dosing. Routine HPV vaccination is recommended at age 11–12 years, but vaccination can start at age 9 years; a 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months is sufficient if the series is initiated before the 15th birthday, whereas a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months is indicated for those who start at age 15 or older or who are immunocompromised, and I should double-check that this applies regardless of prior doses if the series is interrupted, which it does [^dbc9f0d9] [^68e71260] [^16aff043].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about catch-up; I should confirm the age range and whether it is truly universal. ACIP harmonized catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, replacing prior sex-specific differences, and this harmonization is reflected in CDC summaries and ACOG guidance; importantly, effectiveness wanes with age and exposure, so counseling about diminished benefit in the early 20s is appropriate [^dbc9f0d9] [^fda9e25a] [^cd759357].

> Next, I should review the controversial 27–45 year space. ACIP recommends shared clinical decision-making for some adults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, acknowledging low population benefit and the need to individualize based on risk of new exposure; however, the ACS explicitly does not endorse this approach due to low effectiveness, minimal cancer prevention potential, and lack of clear criteria for selecting beneficiaries, so I need to present both positions transparently and guide clinicians to prioritize younger ages and high-risk individuals if considering vaccination in this range [^dbc9f0d9] [^b3a076c1] [^292844bd].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for diminished benefit with age so I don't overstate it. Vaccine effectiveness is highest before HPV exposure, which typically occurs soon after sexual debut; by adulthood, most have been exposed to at least some vaccine types, so the incremental benefit is small at the population level, and modeling suggests extending vaccination through age 45 prevents only a tiny fraction of additional cancers compared with stopping at 26, reinforcing the focus on adolescents and young adults [^d67b6386] [^292844bd].

> I will now examine special populations and immunocompromised patients. For persons with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, routine vaccination through age 26 is recommended, and a 3-dose schedule is indicated regardless of age at initiation; I initially thought vaccination was not recommended beyond 26 in this group, but wait, I should correct that — current CDC/ACIP guidance supports vaccination through 26 for all, with shared decision-making for 27–45 only, and HIV-specific guidance aligns with this approach, emphasizing early vaccination when feasible [^dbc9f0d9] [^453f3deb].

> Let me consider product-specific issues so I don't miss practical points. Only the 9-valent HPV vaccine is available in the U.S. since 2016, covering types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; prevaccination HPV testing is not recommended, and if a patient previously received 2vHPV or 4vHPV, completing the series with 9vHPV is reasonable though not required, which I should confirm as consistent with ACIP transitions [^453f3deb] [^231dfb46] [^e05aefaa].

> Next, I should review implementation strategies because uptake remains suboptimal. Strong clinician recommendation, same-day administration with other adolescent vaccines, and system-level prompts improve initiation and completion; behavioral and informational interventions can double initiation and increase completion, and starting at age 9–10 years can improve series completion by age 13, which is why many systems encourage earlier starts [^b5918f1f] [^2fceb789] [^97e5cac6].

> I need to ensure I address screening interactions so clinicians don't assume vaccination replaces cytology. Vaccinated individuals should continue routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not cover all oncogenic types and does not treat existing infections; moreover, as vaccinated cohorts mature, screening algorithms may evolve, but current guidelines still apply uniformly to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals pending further evidence [^b6a7bbda] [^04441383] [^28ad40c0].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or lactating; I should double-check that. HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, so defer until after pregnancy; however, routine pregnancy testing before vaccination is not required, and lactating patients can receive the vaccine safely, which I should explicitly state to avoid unnecessary delays [^04ec0160] [^1836f553].

> Let me synthesize a clinically actionable summary so nothing critical is lost. Routine HPV vaccination at 11–12 years, allow initiation at 9 years, use a 2-dose schedule if started before age 15, otherwise use a 3-dose schedule; catch-up through age 26 for all who are not up to date; for ages 27–45, consider only via shared decision-making in those likely to benefit from new exposure risk, recognizing the ACS does not endorse routine use in this group; prioritize immunocompromised patients through 26 and use a 3-dose schedule when indicated; continue cervical screening regardless of vaccination status; and employ strong recommendation and early initiation strategies to optimize uptake and cancer prevention impact [^dbc9f0d9] [^b3a076c1] [^68e71260] [^b6a7bbda].

HPV vaccination is **routinely recommended at age 11–12 years** [^dbc9f0d9], but can start at age 9 [^62ccc2a4]. Catch-up vaccination is advised through age 26 for all who are not adequately vaccinated [^fda9e25a]. For adults aged 27–45, **shared clinical decision-making** is recommended, given lower effectiveness and limited benefit [^ca7b9075] [^292844bd]. The 9-valent vaccine is the only HPV vaccine available in the U.S. and is given as a 2-dose series if started before age 15, or a 3-dose series if started at age 15 or older or if immunocompromised [^453f3deb] [^68e71260]. Vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, but is safe during lactation; prevaccination testing is not required, and vaccinated individuals should still undergo routine cervical cancer screening [^04ec0160] [^231dfb46] [^b6a7bbda].

---

## Routine vaccination schedule

- **Routine age**: 11–12 years [^dbc9f0d9], but can start at 9 years [^62ccc2a4].
- **Dosing**: 2-dose schedule at 0 and 6–12 months if started before age 15; 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months if started at age 15 or older or if immunocompromised [^68e71260] [^16aff043].
- **Catch-up**: through age 26 for all who are not adequately vaccinated [^fda9e25a].

---

## Vaccine formulations

The **9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV)** is the only formulation available in the U.S. and covers HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 [^453f3deb]. It provides broader protection than earlier formulations, targeting approximately 90% of HPV-related cancers [^f572aa2d].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Recommended through age 26; 3-dose schedule regardless of age at initiation [^17933071] [^68e71260].
- **Pregnancy**: Vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy; no routine pregnancy testing before vaccination [^04ec0160] [^1836f553].
- **Lactation**: Vaccination is safe during lactation [^04ec0160].
- **Prevaccination testing**: Not recommended (e.g. Pap or HPV testing) [^231dfb46].

---

## Adults aged 27–45 years

Shared clinical decision-making is recommended for adults aged 27–45 who are not adequately vaccinated, given **lower effectiveness and limited benefit** [^ca7b9075] [^292844bd]. Individual risk assessment should consider sexual history, prior HPV exposure, and potential benefit from preventing new infections [^ca7b9075].

---

## Impact of HPV vaccination

HPV vaccination has significantly reduced the prevalence of vaccine-type HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical precancers in the U.S. and globally [^68394738] [^b5918f1f]. Continued vaccination efforts are essential to achieve the **WHO goal of cervical cancer elimination** [^68394738].

---

## Integration with cervical cancer screening

Vaccinated individuals should continue routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not cover all HPV types and does not treat existing infections [^b6a7bbda] [^d35501b8]. Screening guidelines remain unchanged for vaccinated individuals [^b6a7bbda].

---

HPV vaccination is a **critical public health intervention** with proven effectiveness in preventing HPV-related diseases. Current guidelines emphasize early adolescent vaccination, catch-up through age 26, and shared decision-making for older adults, with ongoing screening to maximize cancer prevention.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^35a4ea33]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^7055adfc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination guideline update: American cancer society guideline endorsement [^10fdc023]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

### American cancer society guideline for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine use to prevent cervical cancer and its precursors [^14d20237]. CA (2007). Low credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) has developed guidelines for the use of the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for the prevention of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. These recommendations are based on a formal review of the available evidence. They address the use of prophylactic HPV vaccines, including who should be vaccinated and at what age, as well as a summary of policy and implementation issues. Implications for screening are also discussed.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ongoing challenges and future directions [^baff7fd8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^292844bd]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — adults older than 26 years: ACIP indicates that catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years; instead, shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years. The ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27 through 45 years because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selecting individuals who might benefit. Supporting context notes that HPV vaccination is most effective in early adolescence, with effectiveness decreasing dramatically by age 18 years and minimal benefit noted by age 20 or 21 years, and that compared with vaccination through age 26 years, extending to adults through age 45 years was estimated to prevent only an additional 0.5% cases of cancer, 0.4% cases of cervical precancer, and 0.3% cases of genital warts over the next 100 years.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^fdebec26]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening — The combination of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening has the potential to prevent tens of thousands of cancers caused by HPV each year in this country and to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem in the coming decades. It is important that all individuals with a cervix, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated, get screened according to current guidelines. Vaccination of all children between ages 9 and 12 years will prevent > 90% of the cervical, oropharyngeal, anal, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers that are caused by HPV and, combined with screening and the treatment of cervical precancers, can lead to the first elimination of a cancer in history.

Guideline adaptability and HPV vaccination context — guidelines must allow updates to incorporate new test methods as validated and to adjust for decreasing CIN3+ risks as more vaccinated patients reach screening age. At the 2019 consensus conference, HPV vaccination levels in the United States population currently ages 25 or older were deemed too low to incorporate vaccination into recommendations, but as more vaccinated patients reach the age of 25 years and additional data emerge, new data can be added while the Clinical Action Threshold relative ranking remains the same.

IV. Necessity of Continued Incremental Revision of Guidelines

As practice evolves, underlying rates of precancer will change. Human papillomavirus vaccination will drive down rates of infection and subsequent pre-cancer, and HPV testing, which detects more disease at the initial screen, results in lower rates of precancer in subsequent screening rounds. This in turn affects the accuracy of any given test (both in terms of positive and negative predictive value), and thus, appropriate recommendations or guidelines and priorities will likewise need to be updated. To complicate implementation, rates of HPV vaccination and access to screening, in particular HPV testing, vary widely in different parts of the United States and the world.

So what is the role of a guideline? Guidelines are intended to standardize care using the best available evidence supplemented by expert opinion to decrease rates of disease and improve the health of populations. To be successful, guidelines must be implementable and useful to patients and providers in a wide variety of clinical and programmatic settings that may have varied resources and priorities. Testing and treatment options also need to be culturally and emotionally acceptable to patients. Thus, to be effective, guidelines must be evidence based but also flexible, and they must reflect the roles of access, acceptability, availability, and cost of different testing and management options. Furthermore, for screening guidelines to have the maximum impact at preventing cancer, they must incorporate easy and straightforward recommendations for management of abnormalities and include other best practices such as primary vaccination. Not only does "one size" not fit all in this age of personalized medicine, but also as care evolves with new scientific advances, "evidence" is also likely to evolve and guidelines developed now will need to be constantly re-evaluated to reflect new rates of precancer, vaccine uptake and HPV infection rates, as well as additional molecular testing options. Even guidelines that may now seem aspirational will need frequent reassessment to ensure they are working as hoped, that cancer is being prevented and that yet new and better approaches have not been developed.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

Global HPV Vaccination Activities

Global HPV Vaccination Policies and Guidelines

Since 2005, CDC has provided technical support to WHO and its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in the development and revision of HPV vaccine policies and guidelines. CDC participated in WHO technical work groups providing expertise for the development of the first WHO position paper and recommendations for HPV vaccination that were released in 2009. CDC also assisted in the development of the 2010 WHO report focused on evaluating HPV vaccine coverage and providing guidance for HPV vaccine impact monitoring. In addition, CDC participated in a series of WHO meetings during 2013–2015 that were focused on revising guidelines for future HPV vaccine trials, including guidance on trial design and clinical endpoints for evaluation of new prophylactic HPV vaccines. As further data became available from vaccine trials, CDC provided ongoing consultation to WHO headquarters and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) when deliberations were under way for reduced-dose vaccination schedules and consideration of vaccination for boys. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of CDC has provided ongoing opportunities for policy makers from other countries to attend and learn from US deliberations on vaccine policy.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — catch-up through age 26 years: ACIP states that catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. The ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. The document notes that before the June 2019 ACIP update, recommendations for men ages 22 to 26 years differed from those for women, and that catch-up vaccination recommendations are now harmonized for all persons through age 26 years.

ACIP routine HPV vaccination ages and ACS qualifying statement with rationale indicate that ACIP recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and that vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years, and ACS states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates and encourages providers to start the series at age 9 or 10 years. The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

### Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination-updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^68e71260]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

Methods

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available at. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged > 26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted 10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### The impact of human papillomavirus vaccination on cervical cancer prevention efforts [^367ea2d7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review concepts, information, obstacles, and approaches to cervical cancer screening and prevention as vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 is adopted.

Methods

Expert forum, conducted September 12–13, 2008, hosted by the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, including 56 experts in cervical cancer and titled Future Strategies of Cervical Cancer Prevention: What Do We Need to Do Now to Prepare?

Results

The current approach to cervical cancer screening in the U.S. is limited by its opportunistic nature. If given to women before exposure, a vaccine against HPV 16,18 can decrease cervical cancer risk by up to 70%. The impact on abnormal cytology and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) will be less but still substantial. As the prevalence of high-grade CIN falls, fewer women with positive screening tests will have truly preinvasive disease. To minimize harm from false positive tests in women who are at low risk for cancer because of early vaccination, later initiation of and longer intervals between screenings are ideal. However, the vaccine is less effective when administered after first intercourse, and delivering and documenting HPV vaccination to girls at optimal ages may prove difficult.

Conclusions

Until population-based data on the performance of cytology, HPV testing, and alternate screening or triage interventions become available, modifying current screening guidelines is premature. Current recommendations to initiate screening as late as age 21 and to screen less often than annually are appropriate for young women known to have been vaccinated before first intercourse.

CURRENT GUIDELINES FOR HPV VACCINATION

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) recommends following current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for HPV vaccination. These guidelines state that routine HPV vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 11 to 12 years but may start at age 9. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for individuals through age 26 who were not previously vaccinated. Individuals aged between 27 and 45 years can be offered the vaccine using shared clinical decision making between providers and previously unvaccinated patients who are most likely to benefit. There are no current age-based recommendations for HPV vaccination for individuals aged older than 45 years; the vaccine is not Food and Drug Administration-approved in this age range. The HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy, but is safe for use during lactation. In addition to these CDC guidelines, ASCCP issued a statement in February 2020 recommending HPV vaccination for medical professionals who are routinely exposed to the virus through their occupation.

### Cervical cancer screening for individuals at average risk: 2020 guideline update from the American cancer society [^04441383]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake and screening context — The initial uptake of the HPV vaccine was slow in the United States after FDA approval in 2006, but current enhanced dissemination efforts have resulted in steadily increasing levels of vaccination and population coverage at the recommended ages of 11 to 12 years. On the basis of the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, 39.9% of adults aged 18 to 26 years reported having received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine (53.6% of women). The most recent report from the National Immunization Survey-Teen of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years showed that coverage with one or more doses of HPV vaccine in 2018 among females and males was 68.1%, and 51.1% were up to date based on HPV vaccine recommendations. Cytology-based screening is much less efficient in vaccinated populations, as abnormal cytology disproportionately identifies minor abnormalities resulting from HPV types that are associated with lower cancer risk. There is emerging evidence on screening outcomes from other countries with higher vaccine uptake, and some preliminary data from the United States that show significant declines in cervical abnormalities in vaccinated populations, and which point to the likelihood that future recommendations for cervical cancer screening will need to incorporate HPV vaccination status.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f4cb7a8a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d1fbcb81]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

From October 2013 to February 2015, the ACIP HPV Vaccine Work Group reviewed clinical trial data assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 9vHPV, modeling data on cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, and data on burden of type-specific HPV-associated disease in the United States. Summaries of reviewed evidence and Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP before recommendations were proposed. Recommendations were approved by ACIP in February 2015. Evidence supporting 9vHPV use was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation (for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — early initiation between ages 9 and 12 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended starting the series between ages 9 and 12 years. Evidence is emerging that series completion and acceptance may be higher when vaccination is initiated at age 9 or 10 years compared with age 11 or 12 years; in a primary care network, initiation by age 11 years increased from 4.6% to 60.8% within 18 months. In a large population-based cohort, 97.5% of children who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 or 10 years completed the series by age 13.5 years compared with 78.0% when initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted ACIP guidance and states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, and that health care providers are encouraged to start offering the series at age 9 or 10 years.

### HPV vaccination against cervical cancer in women above 25 years of age: key considerations and current perspectives [^92648b75]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Vaccination of young women (15–25 years of age) against human papillomavirus (HPV) has been shown to be very efficacious in preventing the development of moderate or severe cervical precancerous lesions associated with HPV-16 or -18. As the highest rates of new infections with high-risk (i.e., oncogenic) HPV types occur in the first years following sexual debut, most existing guidelines and recommendations advise on vaccinating young girls. We consider oncogenic HPV infection and the risk of developing cervical cancer in women over 25 years of age and whether they would also benefit from vaccination against HPV.

Methods

We reviewed all available literature on oncogenic HPV infection and the risk of developing cervical cancer in women over 25 years of age.

Results

HPV vaccination is likely to be beneficial to sexually active women due to their continuous risk of acquiring new HPV infections and of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. Clinical trial data show that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is safe and immunogenic in women up to the age of 55 years, whilst preliminary data with the quadrivalent vaccine demonstrated evidence of safety, immunogenicity and high-level efficacy in women 24 to 45 years of age. HPV vaccination in women over 25 years of age is already approved in several countries, and these women are individually seeking advice on vaccination from healthcare professionals. The predicted reduction in cost benefit of vaccination with increasing age, however, is likely to limit the implementation of routine vaccination beyond the late 20s.

Conclusion

The priority of routine vaccination programmes must be to target girls and young women, with catch-up programmes that extend to age 25/26 when resources allow. For sexually active women over the age of 25, HPV vaccination can be considered on an individual basis, as most will have the potential to benefit from vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d67b6386]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at 11–12 years, but it may be given from the age of 9 years. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch‑up period (ages 13–26 years) regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation if they were not vaccinated at 11–12 years. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Gaps and opportunities to improve prevention of human papillomavirus-related cancers [^4d3f46b0]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary Prevention through HPV Vaccination

HPV vaccination has been available in the United States since 2006 and is currently the most effective method of preventing infection. The latest nonavalent vaccine targets seven of the high-risk types detected in ∼90% of HPV-related cancers (Table 1). While vaccine-type HPV infection rates in both women and men have decreased since the initial introduction of the vaccine, vaccine implementation in the United States remains relatively low and inconsistent across genders, ages, regions, and racial and ethnic subgroups. Current guidelines recommend vaccinations for everyone through age 26, yet, in 2020, only 58.6% of adolescents were up-to-date on their HPV vaccination, despite CDC's recent reiteration of its previous guidelines recommending girls and boys ages 11 and 12 receive the vaccine.

The clinical and cost effectiveness of the nonavalent HPV vaccine as a public health tool has helped mitigate the barriers of individual patient costs and insurance coverage toward reaching national vaccine uptake goals. Federal assistance programs like Vaccines for Children have also been instrumental in improving access and reducing socioeconomic disparities seen for vaccinations against HPV, as it has for other vaccines such as diphtheria–tetanus–acellular pertussis and measles–mumps–rubella. Health departments charged with managing local program implementation should collaborate with recognized leaders of professional and community organizations to build public awareness and educate their constituents about vaccine safety and access. Altogether, they can combine efforts to ensure that health care providers, such as primary care physicians and pediatricians, are registered to participate in such programs, especially in underserved areas. Barring systemic challenges of costs and access, individuals must still choose to receive the HPV vaccine as a preventive measure for their health.

Human papillomavirus (HPV)–vaccinated women — modeled cost-effectiveness shows that for women who have received all 3 doses of an HPV vaccine before the onset of sexual activity, delaying first screening to age 25 years and using a more frequent interval (1 to 2 years) is predicted to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding $500 000 per QALY; however, current recommendations are to continue screening vaccinated women using the same strategies as those for unvaccinated women given the lack of observed data.

### Optimal cervical cancer screening in women vaccinated against human papillomavirus [^cb2c08b9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current US cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate recommendations based on a woman's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status. Changes to cervical cancer screening policies in HPV-vaccinated women should be evaluated.

Methods

We utilized an individual-based mathematical model of HPV and cervical cancer in US women to project the health benefits, costs, and harms associated with screening strategies in women vaccinated with the bivalent, quadrivalent, or nonavalent vaccine. Strategies varied by the primary screening test, including cytology, HPV, and combined cytology and HPV "cotesting"; age of screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between routine screens. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Results

Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, optimal screening strategies involved either cytology or HPV testing alone every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with exceedingly high cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only primary HPV testing was efficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years ($127 010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was optimal. Importantly, current US guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.

Conclusions

This model-based analysis suggests screening can be modified to start at later ages, occur at decreased frequency, and involve primary HPV testing in HPV-vaccinated women, providing more health benefit at lower harms and costs than current screening guidelines.

### Global impact and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose human papillomavirus vaccination schedules: a comparative modelling analysis [^2f7dcd07]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among women globally with an estimated 570,000 new cases and 311,000 deaths in 2018, with the majority of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Persistent infection with high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary precursor of cervical cancer.

Primary prevention of cervical cancer is available with four highly efficacious prophylactic vaccines — two 2-valent, one 4-valent, one 9-valent — that are currently licensed for protection against HPV infection. All protect against the two most carcinogenic HPV types, 16 and 18, which are responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases globally. Some additionally protect against HPV types 6 and 11, which do not cause cancer but are responsible for most cases of anogenital warts, and against other high-risk types such as HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 (either directly or through cross-protection), which have been linked to a further 20% of cervical cancer cases.

Multiple analyses including the global Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and Economics (PRIME) model developed in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) have found HPV vaccination to be cost-effective in almost all countries. The HPV vaccines were initially administered as a three-dose regimen over 6 months. In 2014, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed the evidence for dose reduction and recommended a two-dose regimen for individuals below 15 years of age. With the availability of vaccines and screening tests that allow detection of both high-risk HPV types and neoplasias that are precursors to cervical cancer, the secretary general of WHO has called for global elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, i.e. achieving the measurable global targets set by WHO. Current WHO guidelines recommend that all countries vaccinate females aged 9–14 years against HPV.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^ce044182]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^ca7b9075]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

### ASCCP committee opinion: adjuvant human papillomavirus vaccine for patients undergoing treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [^0f3570e4]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Individuals treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) are at long-term risk of persistent or recurrent disease despite treatment. This committee opinion aims to summarize and provide evidence-based recommendations for adjuvant human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on available, published literature.

Methods

A task force from the ASCCP Practice Committee reviewed current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and previously published literature about the role of adjuvant HPV vaccination in previously unvaccinated individuals undergoing treatment for CIN2+ and other HPV-related diseases.

Results

Current CDC guidelines recommend routine or catch-up HPV vaccination for individuals aged 9 to 26 years, and shared decision making regarding vaccination for individuals aged 27 to 45 years. Multiple published studies suggest a possible benefit for adjuvant HPV vaccination in previously unvaccinated individuals undergoing treatment for CIN2+.

Conclusions

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommends adherence to current CDC recommendations for vaccination of individuals aged 9 to 26 years and consideration of the possible benefit of adjuvant HPV vaccination during shared decision making for previously unvaccinated individuals aged 27 to 45 years who are undergoing treatment for CIN2+.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^b2c3bf31]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. † Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^c8b1e324]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — routine and catch-up guidance emphasizes early adolescent initiation and strong clinician recommendation. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for girls and boys at the target age of 11–12 years (but it may be given from the age of 9 years) as part of the adolescent immunization platform, and obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years) if not vaccinated at 11–12 years. Unvaccinated women age 26 years and younger should receive the HPV vaccine series regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should strongly recommend HPV vaccination, should educate parents in their decision making for daughters and sons, and are encouraged to stock and administer HPV vaccines when feasible. HPV vaccines are characterized as among the most effective available, with data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when given before exposure to that HPV type.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections affecting both men and women worldwide. The development of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant pharmaceutical innovation with potential to reduce HPV-related morbidity. However, barriers to the universal use and acceptability of the HPV vaccines continue to exist in both economically privileged and disadvantaged countries. It may be decades before the impact of preventive vaccines on HPV-related diseases caused by the considerable burden of HPV infections will be seen. Collaborative efforts must continue to promote vaccine implementation.

### Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^d35501b8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on June 8, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of HPV and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use for vaccination among females aged 9–26 years in the United States. Genital HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States; an estimated 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although the majority of infections cause no clinical symptoms and are self-limited, persistent infection with oncogenic types can cause cervical cancer in women. HPV infection also is the cause of genital warts and is associated with other anogenital cancers. Cervical cancer rates have decreased in the United States because of widespread use of Papanicolaou testing, which can detect precancerous lesions of the cervix before they develop into cancer; nevertheless, during 2007, an estimated 11,100 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 3,700 women will die from cervical cancer. In certain countries where cervical cancer screening is not routine, cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. The licensed HPV vaccine is composed of the HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein in yeast using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLP) that resemble HPV virions. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a mixture of four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 combined with an aluminum adjuvant. Clinical trials indicate that the vaccine has high efficacy in preventing persistent HPV infection, cervical cancer precursor lesions, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursor lesions, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 among females who have not already been infected with the respective HPV type. No evidence exists of protection against disease caused by HPV types with which females are infected at the time of vaccination. However, females infected with one or more vaccine HPV types before vaccination would be protected against disease caused by the other vaccine HPV types. The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, and the recommended schedule is a 3-dose series with the second and third doses administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The recommended age for vaccination of females is 11–12 years. Vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for females aged 13–26 years who have not been previously vaccinated. Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical cancer screening, and vaccinated females should have cervical cancer screening as recommended.

### HPV update: vaccination, screening, and associated disease [^7c54f4fe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the causative agent in cervical cancer, and is associated with numerous other genital cancers, including vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer. Primary prevention with HPV vaccination is safe and efficacious, and a recently approved HPV vaccine will provide even more extensive protection against several oncogenic HPV strains. Screening strategies for HPV are rapidly evolving, reflecting the essential role that HPV infection plays in cervical cancer. This article highlights new evidence regarding the efficacy of the recently approved 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine and the use of primary high-risk HPV testing in cervical cancer screening. We consider the utility of urinary HPV testing in routine clinical practice and review current guidelines regarding anal HPV screening.

Adults (27–45 years) — the HPV vaccine is licensed in the United States for women and men through age 45 years. Although administration is safe in patients aged 27–45 and can prevent new infections in women not previously exposed, most women in this age range will already have been exposed to HPV, and the overall public health benefit in women aged 27–45 years is markedly diminished compared with use in the target age range. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Anal carcinoma, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^d5e144da]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — prevention and recommendations: A 9-valent HPV vaccine protecting against HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58 is available, and targeting the additional strains over the quadrivalent vaccine is predicted to prevent an additional 464 cases of anal cancer annually. Compared with the quadrivalent vaccine, the 9-valent vaccine was noninferior for antibody response to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18, and its calculated efficacy was 96.7% (95% CI, 80.9–99.8) for prevention of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal disease related to these strains, with sustained efficacy and immunogenicity aiding prevention of HPV incidence after 10 years post-vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine use of the 9-valent vaccine in children aged 11 and 12 years and catch-up vaccination through 26 years of age for those not previously vaccinated; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded use to individuals aged 27 through 45 years, and in 2019 the ACIP voted to recommend vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making for individuals in this age range who are not adequately vaccinated.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^cdff8250]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine interventions in the U.S.: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5918f1f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Despite current recommendations, human papillomavirus vaccine uptake remains low. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of interventions targeting human papillomavirus vaccine initiation and completion among children, adolescents, and young adults aged 9–26 years.

Evidence Acquisition

Three electronic databases (CINAHL, OVID, and Web of Science) were searched for articles published in English peer-reviewed journals between January 2006 and January 2017 of U.S. studies that evaluated intervention strategies and reported post-intervention human papillomavirus vaccine initiation or completion rates among individuals aged 9–26 years. Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted. Data were collected in 2016 and analyzed in 2017.

Evidence Synthesis

Reviewers screened 983 unique titles and abstracts, read 241 full-text articles, and extracted data from 30 articles meeting the inclusion criteria (12 behavioral, ten environmental, four informational, and four combination strategies). Published EQUATOR (Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research) guidelines were used to assess study quality. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. The meta-analyses included 17 RCTs and quasi-experiments involving 68,623 children, adolescents, and young adults. The pooled relative incidence estimates were 1.84 (95% CI = 1.36, 2.48) for human papillomavirus vaccine initiation and 1.50 (95% CI = 1.23, 1.83) for completion. Behavioral and informational interventions doubled human papillomavirus vaccine initiation (relative incidence estimate = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.36, 3.06 and relative incidence estimate = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.27, 2.91, respectively). Behavioral interventions increased completion by 68% (relative incidence estimate = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.25, 2.27).

Conclusions

Evidence supports behavioral interventions for increasing human papillomavirus vaccine initiation and completion. Future studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of interventions in reaching diverse populations and reducing missed opportunities for human papillomavirus vaccination.

### Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975–2009, featuring the burden and trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers and HPV vaccination coverage levels [^77a002b7]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Research on HPV vaccines is ongoing in several areas. There is interest in evaluating the efficacy of less than three doses, and further data may be available on these schedules in the future. In addition, second-generation vaccines that target additional HPV types are being developed. Current data suggest good duration of protection afforded by the currently approved bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, and ongoing studies will provide further data. Monitoring of vaccine safety is part of routine activities of the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC, and current data are reassuring. A recent evaluation of quadrivalent HPV vaccine after the administration of more than 600,000 doses in girls and women found no statistically significant increased rate of prespecified adverse events. Safety monitoring of HPV vaccines will continue to investigate potential rare outcomes.

Early detection of cervical and noncervical cancers associated with HPV infection also deserves brief comment. For cervical cancers, the ACS and multiple clinical organizations, as well as the US Preventive Services Task Force, have recently issued updated age-specific guidelines for cytologic and HPV testing for the early detection of cervical cancer. These guidelines addressed critical issues about the harms of unnecessary procedures and treatments associated with transient HPV infections and associated cervical lesions, which regress without medical intervention. In addition, as HPV vaccination coverage levels increase, cervical cancer screening recommendations may need to be modified. The efficacy of anal Pap testing to reduce mortality from HPV-associated anal cancer is unknown, and no national guidelines exist for anal cytology among men or women with or without HIV infection, although one study found it to be both clinically and cost effective to conduct such testing among HIV-positive gay and bisexual men.

As incidence rates for some HPV-associated cancers continue to rise, these cases will contribute to the overall growing number of cancers associated with population aging and expansion, requiring additional resources for medical research and treatment. Continued monitoring of incidence and mortality trends for all cancers is warranted to inform cancer prevention and control policies and programs.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^453f3deb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HPV vaccine — product availability and timing: HPV vaccination prevents HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV. Although HPV vaccine is most effective in people with few or no sex partners prior to vaccination, HPV vaccination in people with multiple lifetime sex partners can still prevent HPV infection from subtypes they have not been exposed to yet. Three U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved HPV vaccines are licensed: bivalent, quadrivalent, and 9-valent; currently, only the 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV, protective against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) is available in the United States. Routine HPV vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years.

Regarding preventative measures for anogenital warts, more specifically with respect to HPV vaccination, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer HPV vaccination in adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years), regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation, if they were not vaccinated at the target age of 11–12 years.

Background

HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection, with HPV acquisition generally occurring soon after first sexual activity. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic. Persistent infections with high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types can lead to development of cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers, usually after several decades. Most new HPV infections occur in adolescents and young adults. Although most sexually active adults have been exposed to HPV, new infections can occur with a new sex partner.

Three prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the United States: 9-valent (9vHPV, Gardasil 9, Merck), quadrivalent (4vHPV, Gardasil, Merck), and bivalent (2vHPV, Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline). As of late 2016, only 9vHPV is distributed in the United States. The majority of HPV-associated cancers are caused by HPV 16 or 18, types targeted by all three vaccines. In addition, 4vHPV and 9vHPV target HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts. 9vHPV also protects against five additional high-risk types: HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

In October 2018, using results from 4vHPV clinical trials in women aged 24 through 45 years, and bridging immunogenicity and safety data in women and men, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the approved age range for 9vHPV use from 9 through 26 years to 9 through 45 years in women and men. In June 2019, after reviewing evidence related to HPV vaccination of adults, ACIP updated recommendations for catch-up vaccination and for vaccination of adults older than the recommended catch-up age.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — HIV-specific age recommendation and approval status — states that HPV vaccination is recommended for males and females with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection aged 13 through 26 years (AIII). Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years, and women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV.

### Committee opinion no. 467: human papillomavirus vaccination [^740eaf70]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved both a bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that HPV vaccination routinely be given to girls when they are 11 years or 12 years old. The vaccine can be given to individuals as young as 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended in females aged 13 years through 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many girls in the initial vaccination target group, they are critical to the catch-up vaccination period. Both HPV vaccines are most effective if given before any exposure to HPV infection (ie, before sexual activity). However, sexually active girls and women can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in females aged 13 years through 26 years. Vaccination with either HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. It can be provided to women who are breastfeeding. The need for booster vaccination has not been established but appears unnecessary. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss with their patients the benefits and limitations of the HPV vaccine and the need for routine cervical cytology screening for those aged 21 years and older.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine administration trends among commercially insured US adults aged 27–45 years before and after advisory committee on immunization practices recommendation change, 2007–2020 [^586f46ac]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, oropharyngeal, anal, penile, vaginal, and vulvar cancers and is associated with approximately 45 000 new cancer diagnoses annually in the US. Although cervical cancer incidence has been declining since the introduction of cervical cancer screening, other types of HPV-associated cancer currently do not have validated screening programs. Additionally, recent studies report that oropharyngeal cancer and anal cancer incidence rates are increasing by nearly 3% annually in the US.

The HPV vaccine is an effective prevention against HPV-associated cancers, especially when administered before exposure to HPV types covered in the HPV vaccine. Therefore, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends HPV vaccination for those aged 9 to 26 years (since 2006 for women and 2011 for men). The ACIP guideline currently recommends routine vaccination for those ages 11 to 12 years and catch-up vaccination through age 26 years. In October 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the approved age range for the use of the 9-valent HPV vaccine to ages 27 to 45 years in both women and men. The ACIP recommended patient-clinician shared decision-making for HPV vaccination in this newly approved age group in June 2019.

Individual differences in previous exposure to HPV and clinical characteristics affect the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in this older age group. In fact, though it is reported that HPV vaccination beyond 26 years old is not cost-effective at the population level at current prices, evidence supports vaccine efficacy in previously unexposed older populations. Therefore, some of these individuals may feel the need to get vaccinated for protection against HPV. Patient-clinician shared decision-making based on the guideline update may also have changed HPV vaccine administration in this age group, as evidence shows shared decision-making improves vaccination in general. Moreover, most commercial insurances cover vaccination for those recommended by the ACIP; thus, there may be an expected trend change in the HPV vaccination rate in this age group after the FDA approval and the ACIP recommendation update.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^70036f55]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine efficacy — HPV vaccines are among the most effective vaccines worldwide, with unequivocal data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when administered to women who have not been exposed to that particular type of HPV, and the HPV vaccine significantly reduces anogenital cancer and genital warts in women and in men and may decrease the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer. In the United States, the prevalence of vaccine-type HPV infection decreased 71% among women aged 14–19 years between 2006 and 2014, and countries with high HPV vaccine coverage have had a marked reduction in genital warts. The 9-valent HPV vaccine protects against more than 99% of HPV disease related to genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 and up to 96.7% for HPV disease related to genotypes 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, including prevention of cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal disease; the HPV vaccine is a prophylactic vaccine used to prevent disease, and current data does not support its use as a therapeutic vaccine.

The current updated recommendation for age-expanded HPV vaccination provides an opportunity to prevent cancers in those who are at risk of new HPV infection and were not adequately vaccinated. Proper shared decision-making that allows health care professionals to discuss HPV vaccination with individuals who are most likely to benefit is key to maximizing the cancer prevention effects. This process is particularly needed to decide who should be prioritized because the universal vaccination is not cost-effective in this age group and there is a limited vaccine supply. Effective shared decision-making for selective age-expanded HPV vaccination most likely involves a conversation about the patient's sexual history. However, according to a study in 2020, 65% of primary care visits did not involve sexual history taking. The sexual history taking based on the validated model, despite being recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only comprised 1% of the visits. In 2020, the US Preventive Services Task Force updated its guideline on behavioral counseling interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections. To successfully implement this guideline, it is crucial for health care professionals to initiate a conversation about the patient's sexual history. In addition, it is necessary that the health care professionals recognize the diversity of gender identities and sexual orientations for more effective sexual history takingand shared decision-making in HPV vaccination. Although this US Preventive Services Task Force guideline is not exclusively for HPV vaccination in older adults, it could provide an opportunity to identify those who might benefit from the age-expanded HPV vaccination.

In recognizing the challenges from the health care professionals' side to identify the population that would most likely benefit from the age-expanded catch-up vaccination, it is equally important that patients initiate the shared decision-making. The literature indicates the patients' awareness of age expansion, belief in vaccine effectiveness, and perceived benefit of HPV vaccination were associated with the likelihood of asking their clinicians about the HPV vaccination in this age group. Due to the information asymmetry between clinician and patient regarding patients' sexual history and other related clinical factors, patient-initiated shared decision-making might be meaningful in age-expanded HPV vaccination. However, previous nationally representative studies found that US adults aged 27 to 45 years had a low level of awareness and knowledge about HPV-related information. For patient-initiated conversation about HPV vaccination, disseminating information about the recommendation update and vaccine benefits is instrumental in reaching more people who likely will benefit from vaccination.

Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination, and HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously, and vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years, and for these recommendations ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males, whereas bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females.

### Long-term cervical cancer prevention strategies across the globe [^d80f5b26]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Worldwide, there are several approaches for the prevention of cervical cancer, and in the near future it is likely that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and HPV-based screening will be complementary strategies. In the US, professional guidelines on HPV screening recommend a co-testing approach utilizing HPV DNA testing and cytology in women aged ≥ 30 years. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that HPV testing is more sensitive than cytology, suggesting that HPV DNA testing may be more useful as the sole primary screening modality, especially for newly implemented programs. HPV vaccination programs targeted at young girls have been widely implemented in several affluent countries, and currently available data confirm the long-term efficacy of the VLP-based vaccines against HPV-related disease over periods of up to 8 years. If these HPV vaccines continue to demonstrate sustained and durable efficacy, less frequent screening may become a reality, but screening will continue to play an important role in providing protection for disease caused by types not included in these vaccines. However, a significant HPV vaccination-induced reduction in cervical cancer burden is not likely to be realized for at least 10 to 15 years.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^783980ac]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^a7ab3d9f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During its February 2015 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) (Gardasil 9, Merck and Co, Inc.) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination. HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously. Vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV is a noninfectious, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Similar to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), 9vHPV contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs. In addition, 9vHPV contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs. 9vHPV was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 2014, for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years. For these recommendations, ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males. Bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females. This report summarizes evidence considered by ACIP in recommending 9vHPV as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for vaccination and provides recommendations for vaccine use.

Conclusions

This cohort study found statistically significant increases in HPV vaccine administration in adults aged 27 to 45 years after the FDA approval of use and the ACIP recommendation update. For maximizing the cancer prevention benefit in this age group, effective patient-clinician shared decision-making is crucial. Future studies are needed to address the difficulties surrounding identifying those who will most likely benefit from the vaccine and the unsureness of what to emphasize during shared decision-making. Developing effective decision aids would be the key to successfully implementing this updated ACIP guideline.
