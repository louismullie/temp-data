## Question

Meclizine dosing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about meclizine dosing, indications, contraindications, special populations, and a practical decision algorithm for use, with transparent self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the on-label indications and standard adult dosing from FDA SPL sources. Then, I should verify common off-label uses and the quality of evidence. Next, I will consider condition-specific nuances such as motion sickness, undifferentiated vertigo, and especially BPPV where guidelines may restrict use. After that, I need to check safety, anticholinergic burden, cognition, organ impairment, and high-risk groups like older adults and pregnancy. Finally, I will synthesize a dosing and monitoring plan, and I should double-check any areas where my wording might overstate guideline positions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications and dosing ranges. Meclizine is labeled in adults for prevention and symptomatic relief of motion sickness, and for symptomatic relief of vertigo, with typical dosing of 25–50 mg PO given 30–60 minutes before travel for prevention, 25–50 mg PO daily for treatment of motion sickness, and 25–100 mg PO daily in divided doses for vertigo, consistent with FDA SPL language and product descriptions, so those will anchor my baseline recommendations [^115Dnfwn] [^114ZY7mN] [^115ieKcW] [^111NdtXZ] [^111Vxzwu].

> I need to check off-label but documented regimens and the strength of evidence. For Ménière's disease, SPL provides 12.5–25 mg PO TID as a symptomatic vertigo regimen, but I should caution that evidence for systemic pharmacotherapy improving long-term vertigo outcomes in Ménière's is of very low certainty in recent Cochrane analyses, so symptomatic use should be time-limited and diagnosis-specific. For nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, an SPL source lists 25 mg PO QID; however, use is off-label and demands individualized risk–benefit discussion given limited direct teratogenicity data in the cited materials, so I should confirm shared decision-making before recommending this path [^113XhgEb] [^116s6VDn] [^111JnGVq].

> Next, I will examine motion sickness pathophysiology and preferred agents to prevent over-sedation. Motion sickness arises from vestibular–visual–proprioceptive conflict, and although first-generation antihistamines like meclizine are effective, if the patient must remain alert, scopolamine is favored by guideline recommendations; Cochrane reviews and the AAFP guidance underpin scopolamine's role while acknowledging antihistamines' efficacy and sedation trade-offs, so I should tailor to context and warn about cognitive slowing if antihistamines are selected [^1137RXQN] [^114za4sF] [^115X7uR5] [^116XGmwz] [^112NG9hk].

> Let me consider undifferentiated peripheral vertigo management pragmatically. SPL allows titration across 25–100 mg per day in divided doses for symptomatic relief, and a small ED trial suggests meclizine 25 mg and diazepam 5 mg have similar short-term efficacy, while a broader meta-analysis raises uncertainty around the magnitude and durability of benefit from antihistamines and benzodiazepines beyond acute windows, so I should reserve vestibular suppressants for acute crises, re-evaluate within days, and proceed to diagnosis-specific therapy or vestibular rehab thereafter [^115ieKcW] [^113FCgSF].

> Now, on BPPV I initially thought, "critical contraindication — DO NOT USE vestibular suppressants", but wait, let me verify the exact wording in guidelines because "contraindicated" may be too strong. The AAO-HNSF 2017 BPPV guideline states not to routinely use vestibular suppressants; canalith repositioning maneuvers are preferred and superior in RCT syntheses, with a 2023 meta-analysis showing CRMs improve symptom resolution compared with vestibular suppressants, while practice patterns still show frequent meclizine prescribing, which I should explicitly discourage except perhaps for short-lived severe nausea during maneuvers with caution. So I should correct my earlier overstatement: the guidance is "not routinely use", not an absolute contraindication, and priority remains accurate diagnosis and CRM delivery [^113tBP8i] [^1119ZDtn] [^116vfEaJ] [^117Aj76S] [^112GeX7G].

> I should confirm key safety parameters given meclizine's anticholinergic profile. Warnings include anticholinergic effects and somnolence necessitating caution in asthma, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and tasks requiring alertness such as driving; CYP2D6 phenotype may alter exposure, and common adverse effects include blurred vision, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, somnolence, and vomiting, with experimental data showing decrements in working memory and increased sleepiness, so I must counsel and consider alternatives when cognition is critical [^11779AgT] [^111cp4i3] [^111A9LZR].

> Hold on, I should verify organ-specific cautions, since dose adjustment is not precisely defined but risk may be higher. SPL advises caution in any chronic liver disease and across a wide range of renal impairment, which means I should start at the low end of dosing, extend intervals if needed, and monitor tolerability closely in hepatic or renal dysfunction rather than assume standard schedules are safe [^112BaG39] [^111ouHZy].

> Next, I will examine high-risk populations, especially older adults, where fall and cognitive risks escalate. Observational analyses of older adults with dizziness show vestibular suppressant use, including meclizine and benzodiazepines, associates with increased falls within 60 days, with hazard ratios around 3.3 after adjustment, and a large claims study likewise links meclizine prescriptions to injurious falls, so I should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time or avoid entirely in fall-prone patients and favor nonpharmacologic care; general geriatric dosing principles also support "start low, go slow" and careful monitoring [^113r4nZ9] [^112jr4FH] [^111i59ub].

> I need to check pregnancy considerations again before proposing any regimen. While 25 mg PO QID is listed in SPL for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, it remains off-label here, so use should follow obstetric consultation, stepwise nonpharmacologic strategies first, and careful risk–benefit discussion documenting maternal symptom severity and prior responses to safer first-line options where applicable [^111JnGVq].

> Let me review duration of therapy to avoid delaying vestibular compensation. Prolonged daily use of vestibular suppressants can delay central compensation and foster dependence, reinforcing the principle of lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period with planned de-escalation as acute vertigo abates and pivoting to vestibular rehabilitation rather than chronic suppressants for persistent imbalance [^114kcocw].

> I will now synthesize a condition-specific dosing approach while staying vigilant about sedation, cognition, and falls. For motion sickness prevention, give meclizine 25–50 mg PO 30–60 minutes pre-travel, acknowledging scopolamine may be preferred if wakefulness must be preserved; for symptomatic treatment of motion sickness during travel, 25–50 mg PO daily as needed is reasonable for limited durations; for undifferentiated peripheral vertigo, begin at 25 mg PO and titrate up to divided doses within a 25–100 mg/day ceiling based on short-term response, with re-evaluation in days, while for Ménière's-related vertigo symptomatic flares, 12.5–25 mg PO TID can be used cautiously with time limits and ongoing disease-specific management; for BPPV, avoid routine meclizine and prioritize canalith repositioning, reserving a single pre-maneuver dose only if severe nausea jeopardizes care and with explicit warnings, all while starting lower and going slower in older adults or those with hepatic or renal impairment [^115Dnfwn] [^114ZY7mN] [^115ieKcW] [^113XhgEb] [^114za4sF] [^113tBP8i] [^116vfEaJ] [^112BaG39] [^111ouHZy].

> But wait, I should double-check monitoring and counseling elements to ensure safe implementation. I need to counsel on sedation and anticholinergic effects, advise against driving or hazardous tasks until individual response is known, screen older adults for fall risk before prescribing, reconcile medications to minimize cumulative anticholinergic burden, consider CYP2D6 interactions, reassess within 1–2 weeks to taper and discontinue if possible, and prefer nonpharmacologic strategies such as vestibular rehabilitation and CRMs where indicated, aligning choices with guideline-concordant care [^11779AgT] [^113r4nZ9] [^112GeX7G] [^115X7uR5] [^114za4sF].

Meclizine dosing is **indication-specific**: 25–50 mg orally 30–60 minutes before travel [^115Dnfwn] for motion sickness prevention (repeat every 24 hours as needed [^114ZY7mN]); **25–100 mg/day in divided doses for vertigo** [^115ieKcW] [^116RAx4B]; and **12.5–25 mg three times daily for Ménière's disease** [^113XhgEb]. For nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, use **25 mg every 6 hours** [^111JnGVq]. Use the **lowest effective dose**, especially in older adults [^113r4nZ9], and avoid routine use in BPPV [^113tBP8i] [^1119ZDtn]. Monitor for sedation and anticholinergic effects [^11779AgT]; use caution in hepatic [^112BaG39] or renal impairment [^111ouHZy].

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^116PFmJJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Balance disorders pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment due to the scarcity of specific diagnostic tests, the variety of related disorders, and the limited number of known effective interventions. Our team conducted a scoping and prioritization process involving stakeholders to identify which topics in this field require new or updated systematic reviews. Vestibular migraine emerged as one of the highest priority topics during this process, alongside persistent postural-perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease.

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work and over 70% describing the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe. Currently, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition. Thus, up-to-date, reliable evidence syntheses are essential to aid patients and healthcare professionals in evaluating the benefits and harms of various interventions used for this condition.

### Cesamet [^114MYMLA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

During controlled clinical trials of Cesamet, virtually all patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. The most commonly encountered adverse events were drowsiness, vertigo, dry mouth, euphoria (feeling "high"), ataxia, headache, and concentration difficulties.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of any drug are difficult to obtain. Estimates are influenced by factors such as drug dose, detection technique, setting, and physician judgments, among others. Consequently, the tables presented below indicate the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cesamet under relatively similar conditions of use. These figures cannot predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in usual medical practice, where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those in the clinical trials. Furthermore, these incidence figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products because each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions.

It is important to emphasize that these tabulations do not reflect the relative severity and/or clinical importance of the adverse events. A better perspective on the serious adverse events associated with the use of Cesamet is provided in the warnings and precautions sections.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^117BUCcf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed for the prophylaxis of this condition to help reduce the frequency of attacks. These treatments are predominantly based on those used for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine. These studies compared beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin, or hormonal modification with either placebo or other effective interventions.

### Mysoline [^112ZydSm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

**Adverse reactions**: The most frequently occurring early side effects are ataxia and vertigo. These tend to disappear with continued therapy, or with reduction of initial dosage. Occasionally, the following have been reported: nausea, anorexia, vomiting, fatigue, hyperirritability, emotional disturbances, sexual impotency, diplopia, nystagmus, drowsiness, and morbilliform skin eruptions. Granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and red-cell hypoplasia and aplasia have been reported rarely. These and, occasionally, other persistent or severe side effects may necessitate withdrawal of the drug. Megaloblastic anemia may occur as a rare idiosyncrasy to Mysoline and to other anticonvulsants. The anemia responds to folic acid without the necessity of discontinuing medication.

### Vestibular dysfunction in migraine: effects of associated vertigo and motion sickness [^112Cp8G4]. Journal of neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The mechanisms of vestibular migraine and motion sickness remain unknown. The aims of this study were to determine interictal vestibular dysfunction in migraineurs according to associated dizziness/vertigo and motion sickness, and to find out whether impaired uvulonodular inhibition over the vestibular system underlies the vestibular symptoms and signs by measuring tilt suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). One hundred and thirty-one patients with migraine [65 with vestibular migraine (MV), 41 with migrainous dizziness (MD), and 25 with migraine only (MO)] and 50 normal controls underwent evaluation of vestibular function. Motion sickness was assessed using the motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire (MSSQ) and subjective scale. Compared with normal controls and MO group, patients with MV/MD showed increased VOR time constant (TC) and greater suppression of the post-rotatory nystagmus with forward head tilt. The mean MSSQ score and subjective scale were highest in MV group, followed by MD, MO, and controls (p = 0.002, p < 0.001). Multiple linear regression model analyses revealed that motion sickness is an independent factor of TC prolongation (p = 0.024). Twenty-eight (21.4%) patients with migraine also showed perverted head shaking nystagmus and 12 (9.2%) had positional nystagmus. In view of the increased tilt suppression of the VOR, we speculate that dysfunction of the nodulus/uvula may not account for the prolonged TCs in MD/MV. Instead, innate hypersensitivity of the vestibular system may be an underlying mechanism of motion sickness and increased TC i

### Stimulation of the semicircular canals via the rotary chair as a means to test pharmacologic countermeasures for space motion sickness [^115wiRqx]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

Space motion sickness is currently treated pharmacologically with the empiric use of the H1 antihistamine promethazine, but use of this intervention is limited by the side effect of significant sedation. This creates a dilemma, as full cognition is particularly important during the same conditions likely to exacerbate the symptoms of space motion sickness. Using overstimulation of the semicircular canals with a rotary chair as a paradigm for space motion sickness, we evaluated four medications commonly used for the treatment of terrestrial motion sickness and vertigo for their efficacy in alleviating the simulated symptoms of space motion sickness.

- **Study design**: Randomized, prospective, double-blind study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Healthy male and female volunteers, 18 years of age or older, without a history of neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and with no known allergies or any previous adverse reactions to the drugs used.

- **Interventions**: Lorazepam 1 mg, meclizine 25 mg, promethazine 25 mg, scopolamine 0.4 mg, or placebo.

- **Main outcome measure**: The ability of each treatment to control the nausea and vomiting associated with our paradigm for space motion sickness was evaluated by measuring time of rotation pre- and posttreatment and time of symptom onset pre- and posttreatment.

- **Results**: Only scopolamine effected a mean change in duration of rotation that reached statistical significance when compared with placebo (p < 0.008), with a greater than 40% increase in rotation time. Results with promethazine were not statistically significant.

### Evaluation of the effects of anti-motion sickness drugs on subjective sleepiness and cognitive performance of healthy males [^111A9LZR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical and cognitive side effects of baclofen (10 mg), meclizine (25 mg), dimenhydrinate (40 mg) plus cinnarizine (25 mg), and promethazine (25 mg) plus d-amphetamine (10 mg). The study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeated measures design and was conducted on healthy male volunteers. The psychomotor vigilance test, the Sternberg working memory task, the implicit memory test, and the automated Operation Span (Ospan) task were performed. The degree of sleepiness was determined by the Stanford, the Karolinska, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scales. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) evaluated mood states, and adverse effects were reported on a 22-item questionnaire.

Letter recalls and time for solving mathematical problems recorded during the Ospan task were impaired by baclofen and dimenhydrinate-cinnarizine, respectively, suggesting an influence of these drugs on working memory. Significant side effects for baclofen included sleepiness, tiredness, blurred vision, concentration problems, and dizziness, whereas dimenhydrinate-cinnarizine was associated with sleepiness and blurred vision. Meclizine decreased accuracy on the Sternberg working memory task and appeared to affect short-term memory, with increased sleepiness reported as a side effect. Promethazine plus d-amphetamine did not affect any of the tested cognitive functions; however, many side effects such as sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, insomnia, and tremors were reported. The results indicate that meclizine and dimenhydrinate combined with cinnarizine were the primary substances impacting these cognitive domains.

### Prochlorperazine [^112cJ4Zk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Dosage and administration - adults

For children's dosage and administration, see below. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.

Elderly patients: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.

- **To control severe nausea and vomiting**: Adjust dosage to the response of the individual. Begin with the lowest recommended dosage.
	- **Oral dosage - tablets**: Usually one 5 mg or 10 mg tablet 3 or 4 times daily. Daily dosages above 40 mg should be used only in resistant cases.

- **In adult psychiatric disorders**: Adjust dosage according to the response of the individual and the severity of the condition. Begin with the lowest recommended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within a day or two, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement is seen.
	- **Oral dosage**: Non-psychotic anxiety — usual dosage is 5 mg 3 or 4 times daily. Do not administer in doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks.

### Pharmacological interventions for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^115CAXvB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic balance disorder characterized by subjective unsteadiness or dizziness that worsens when standing up, moving around, and in the presence of rich visual stimulation. Although the disorder was only defined in 2017, descriptions of individuals with the characteristic symptoms have been reported in the medical literature for many years. The term itself has been used since at least 2013. In the past, individuals with these, or very similar, symptoms have been diagnosed with a variety of disorders, such as phobic postural vertigo, space-motion discomfort, visual vertigo, or chronic subjective dizziness. PPPD includes the core features of many of these disorders.

Criteria for diagnosis were established by expert consensus in 2017 and are based on symptoms alone. The presence of each of the following five features is required to make the diagnosis:

- **Symptoms**: Dizziness, unsteadiness, or non-spinning vertigo present on most days for at least three months.
- **Exacerbating factors**: Symptoms are exacerbated by an upright posture, motion, or exposure to complex visual stimuli.
- **Triggers**: The disorder is triggered by an episode of unsteadiness, dizziness, or vertigo caused by another balance disorder, a neurological or medical disorder, or psychological distress.
- **Distress**: Symptoms must cause considerable distress to the sufferer.
- **Exclusion of alternative diagnoses**: Symptoms should not be better accounted for by an alternative diagnosis.

As the diagnostic criteria were only recently established, accurate estimates of the condition's prevalence are still lacking.

### Motion sickness diagnostic criteria: Consensus document of the classification committee of the Bárány Society [^1137RXQN]. Journal of Vestibular Research (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on motion sickness:

- **Definition**: Motion sickness is a common condition that results from an adverse physiologic response to real or perceived motion stimuli, typically involving low-frequency vertical, lateral, angular, or rotary motion, occurring during travel by sea, land, air, or immersion in virtual reality.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of motion sickness involves a conflict between expected and actual interactions among vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs. When vestibular signals about motion and changes in position are inconsistent with visual or proprioceptive inputs, a mismatch can occur, triggering the autonomic nervous system and activating the vomiting center in the brainstem.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of motion sickness in school-age children and young adults is estimated at 35–43% and 25%, respectively. Seasickness is the most frequent and notable form of motion sickness.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for motion sickness include individual susceptibility, which can vary greatly among people, and certain conditions or factors such as age (children and young adults are more susceptible), gender (women are more susceptible than men), and certain medications that can affect the vestibular system. Additionally, the type and intensity of motion can also influence the likelihood of experiencing motion sickness.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of motion sickness typically begins with a feeling of unease, followed by cold sweats and dizziness, progressing to nausea and, in severe cases.

### Motion sickness in migraine and vestibular disorders [^1151feBW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

There is an overall increase in motion sickness susceptibility of patients with vestibular migraine (VM), but this is not different from migraine. This contrasts with findings of previous studies that have shown higher susceptibility scores in questionnaires in VM than in migraine in general. Unlike any previous study, the questionnaire data from our study are supported by the experimental data. Some individuals with VM reported reductions in susceptibility, suggesting some heterogeneity in the underlying pathomechanism, which could also explain some observed differences between ours and previous studies.

In conclusion, bilateral vestibular failure (BVF) reduces motion sickness susceptibility, and this can be regarded as a beneficial effect of this disorder, but a unilateral lesion is insufficient to trigger such a reduction. VM and migraine similarly enhance motion sickness susceptibility profiles.

### Systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease [^116s6VDn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

For the improvement in vertigo outcome, we included any data reported as a dichotomous (binary) outcome, classifying participants as having improved or not improved.

- **Global score**: No studies considered improvement in vertigo using a global score, which included frequency, duration, and severity of vertigo.

- **Vertigo frequency**:

	- **3 to 12 months**: The evidence was of very low certainty at a longer duration of follow-up (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.32; 1 study; 62 participants; Analysis 1.1; very low-certainty evidence). We considered whether changing the outcome to "complete or substantial improvement" would impact the estimated effect. As before, we had a single study for this analysis, and the evidence was still of very low certainty (RR 1.37, 95% CI…).

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^114ZUjHa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	- Adjust the dosage according to the individual and the severity of their condition, noting that the milligram for milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Gradually increase dosage in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, reduce dosage gradually to the lowest effective maintenance level after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period. Increase parenteral dosage only if hypotension has not occurred. Before using intramuscularly, see important notes on injection.

- **Elderly patients**:

	- In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Tailor the dosage to the individual, carefully monitor the response, and adjust the dosage accordingly. Increase the dosage more gradually in elderly patients.

- **Psychotic disorders**:

	- Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue the optimum dosage for 2 weeks, then gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. A daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g. 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).

Among adults who present with dizziness, there is a critical need to identify and deimplement low-value and guideline-discordant care to mitigate the risk of falls over time. Meclizine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, is the most used antiemetic vestibular suppressant in the US.

The objective of the study was to determine the factors associated with meclizine use and subsequent falls among patients aged 18 to 64 years, as well as those aged 65 years or older with dizziness.

This cohort study assessed US commercial and Medicare Advantage claims among 805,454 adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with new diagnoses of dizziness between 2006 and 2015. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to February 2025. The exposure was defined as the prescription of meclizine within 30 days of a new dizziness diagnosis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main outcome measure was falls resulting in medical evaluation. Fall outcomes were attributed to meclizine use if they occurred within 60 days of a meclizine prescription. Associations of falls and meclizine with presentation setting, diagnoses, and sociodemographic characteristics were estimated with multivariable analyses.

- **Results**: Of 805,454 individuals with dizziness (502,055 women [62%]; median age, 52 years [range, 18–87 years]), 8% received a meclizine prescription. Among those prescribed meclizine, 5,792 (9% overall; 10% [2,189/21,700] aged 18–64 years and 9% [3,603/40,138] aged ≥ 65 years) experienced an injurious fall. When adjusting for sociodemographics and clinical factors, a filled meclizine prescription was associated with subsequent falls.

### Diazepam and meclizine are equally effective in the treatment of vertigo: An emergency department randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113FCgSF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Vertigo is a debilitating disease that is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Diazepam and meclizine are oral medications that are commonly used to alleviate symptoms.

- **Objectives**: We sought to determine whether meclizine or diazepam is superior in the treatment of patients with peripheral vertigo in the ED.

- **Methods**: We performed a double-blind clinical trial at a suburban, teaching ED. We randomized a convenience sample of adult patients with acute peripheral vertigo (APV) to diazepam 5 mg or meclizine 25 mg orally. Demographic and historical features were recorded on a standardized data form. Patients recorded their initial level (t0) of vertigo on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and after 30 min (t30) and 60 min (t60). The primary outcome parameter was the mean change in VAS score from t0 to t60. Differences between groups and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Our a priori power calculation estimated that a sample size of 20 patients in each group was required to have an 80% power to detect a difference of 20 mm between treatment groups.

- **Results**: There were 20 patients in the diazepam group and 20 in the meclizine group. The two groups were similar with respect to patient demographics and presenting signs and symptoms. At t60, the mean improvements in the diazepam and meclizine groups were 36 and 40, respectively (difference -4; 95% confidence interval -20 to 12; p = 0.60).

- **Conclusion**: We found no difference between oral diazepam and oral meclizine for the treatment of ED patients with acute peripheral vertigo.

### Clinical practice guideline: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^1119ZDtn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of dizziness and vertigo, specifically in relation to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the AAO-HNSF 2017 guidelines recommend not to use vestibular suppressant medications, such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines, routinely in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

### Efficacy of benzodiazepines or antihistamines for patients with acute vertigo: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RAx4B]. JAMA Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Acute vertigo can be disabling. Antihistamines and benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed as "vestibular suppressants", but their efficacy is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of antihistamines and benzodiazepines in treating acute vertigo from any underlying cause.

Data were sourced from the PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, covering inception to January 14, 2019, without language restrictions. Bibliographies of the included studies and relevant reviews were also screened.

The study selection included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamine or benzodiazepine use with another comparator, placebo, or no intervention for patients whose acute vertigo lasted two weeks or less. Studies involving healthy volunteers, prophylactic treatment, or induced vertigo were excluded, as were studies comparing two medications from the same class.

Data extraction and synthesis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were extracted and assessed for risk of bias by two authors independently for each study and pooled using a random-effects model.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The predefined primary outcome was the change in 10- or 100-point vertigo or dizziness visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 2 hours after treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in nausea VAS scores at 2 hours, use of rescue medication at 2 hours, and improvement or resolution of vertigo at 1 week or 1 month.

Results from 27 trials were analyzed in the systematic review.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^114WD9Ms]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed.

A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used at the time of a vestibular migraine attack to help reduce the severity or resolve the symptoms. These are predominantly based on treatments in use for headache migraine, under the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions used to relieve acute attacks of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine, comparing triptans, ergot alkaloids, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, gepants (CGRP receptor antagonists), magnesium, paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^116zyYkQ]. Age and Ageing (2025). High credibility.

Other barriers:

- **Complications**: Nausea, vomiting, and a sense of imbalance are common side effects, occurring in 13.8% of patients post-BPPV treatment and lasting up to 24 hours. Canal conversion, the movement of otoconia typically from the posterior into the horizontal canal, occurs in 6% of cases, leading to additional symptoms and requiring further maneuvers. An otolithic (or postural) crisis is a sudden and severe sensation of imbalance at the end of a repositioning maneuver. It occurs in up to 10% of maneuvers to treat posterior canal BPPV as a result of the otoconia passing from the canal into the utricle. Despite this, 95% of patients report they would elect to have treatment again if BPPV recurred.

- **Solution**: Discuss the patient's concerns, informing them of the short-lived side effects, the risks of declining treatment, and the benefits of accepting treatment. Outline any plans to manage side effects should they occur. Consider rescheduling the appointment if they would prefer to have someone with them for reassurance, and, if possible, offer treatment in their home if they prefer. If there is anxiety around nausea and vomiting, an antiemetic can be administered before the maneuver. Provide reassurance that there is time to rest and lie still after the treatment. Familiarize the patient with the movements involved by demonstration. Often, patients have assumptions about the test being physically taxing or risky, and by understanding the condition, their fears can be addressed. To prevent falls during an otolithic crisis, the clinician(s) should support the patient.

### Older adults with vestibular disorders and hip fractures have high rates of meclizine use [^117Aj76S]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Low credibility.

To examine the risk factors for hip fracture in patients with vestibular disorders and the association between antihistamine use and hip fracture in these patients, a retrospective case series with chart review was conducted at a tertiary academic medical center.

A retrospective review of adult patients with hip fracture was performed based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code S72, from January 2013 to December 2019. These patients had previously been diagnosed with a vestibular disorder based on ICD-10 codes H81–83, A88.1, and R42.

A total of 201 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average age at the time of hip fracture was 78.8 years, and the majority were female (64.7%). Most patients were diagnosed with nonspecific dizziness (60.2%) or vertigo (23.9%). Those with a peripheral vestibular disorder included benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in 13.4% and Ménière's disease in 2.5%. Overall, meclizine was prescribed to 38.3% of patients, including 29.9% before hip fracture. Among patients with BPPV, 66.7% were prescribed meclizine. Patients were seen for vestibular symptoms 0.67 ± 2.51 years before hip fracture, and 98 patients (48.8%) presented with vestibular concerns within 1 year prior.

Patients with vestibular disorders who sustain a ground-level fall resulting in hip fracture represent a vulnerable population of predominantly older adults with multiple comorbidities. These patients were frequently diagnosed with dizziness or vertigo rather than more specific conditions.

### Meprobamate [^111rjF24]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Use of meprobamate requires careful monitoring due to its potential for drug dependence. Physical dependence, psychological dependence, and abuse have been observed. Chronic intoxication typically involves ingestion of doses greater than recommended and is characterized by symptoms such as ataxia, slurred speech, and vertigo. Therefore, it is crucial to supervise the dosage and quantities prescribed and to avoid prolonged administration. This is especially important for individuals with a known propensity for excessive drug intake, including alcoholics.

Sudden withdrawal from prolonged and excessive use of meprobamate can lead to the recurrence of pre-existing symptoms, like anxiety, anorexia, and insomnia. It can also result in withdrawal reactions such as vomiting, ataxia, tremors, muscle twitching, confusional states, hallucinosis, and, rarely, convulsive seizures. These seizures are more probable in individuals with central nervous system damage or pre-existing or latent convulsive disorders. Withdrawal symptoms typically begin within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation and usually resolve within the next 12 to 48 hours.

If excessive dosages have been used for an extended period, it is advisable to reduce the dosage gradually over one to two weeks rather than stopping abruptly. Alternatively, a long-acting barbiturate may be substituted and then gradually withdrawn.

- **Potentially hazardous tasks**: Patients should be cautioned that meprobamate may impair mental and/or physical abilities necessary for performing potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving or operating machinery.

### Visual vertigo and motion sickness is different between persistent postural-perceptual dizziness and vestibular migraine [^117R7Eui]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Low credibility.

Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) and vestibular migraine (VM) share symptoms of visual vertigo and motion sickness that can be confusing for clinicians to distinguish. We compare the severity of these symptoms and dynamic subjective visual vertical (dSVV) in these two common vestibular conditions.

- **Method**: Twenty-nine patients with PPPD, 37 with VM, and 29 controls were surveyed for subjective symptoms using the visual vertigo analogue scale (VVAS) and motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire during childhood (MSA) and the past 10 years (MSB). dSVV is a measure of visual dependence that measures perception of verticality against a rotating background (5 deg./s).

- **Results**: VVAS revealed contextual differences for dizziness between those with PPPD and VM. Ratings of visual vertigo were most severe in PPPD, less in VM, and mild in controls (VVAS PPPD 27.1, VM 11.2, control 4.6, p < 0.001). MSA was more severe in VM than in PPPD or control (12.8 vs. 7.6 vs. 8.5, p = 0.01). MSB was more severe in VM than controls (MSB score 12.9 vs. 8.1, p = 0.009) but was not different than PPPD (MSB score 10.0, p = 0.10). dSVV alignment was similar among the three groups (p = 0.83). Both VM and PPPD groups had greater simulator sickness than controls after completing the dSVV.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with PPPD report more visual vertigo than those with VM, but a history of motion sickness as a child is more common in VM. Additionally, the environmental context that induces visual vertigo is different between PPPD and VM.

### Vestibular migraine: The most frequent entity of episodic vertigo [^116SRFZQ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Flunarizine was tested for the treatment of migraine without aura and the treatment of vertigo in two large open-label post-marketing studies. In both conditions, flunarizine showed considerable efficacy compared to propranolol for migraine headache or betahistine for vertigo. However, both studies did not specifically include patients with vestibular migraine (VM), and thus the efficacy of flunarizine for this condition remains unproven.

The only randomized controlled trial at one tertiary academic center compared the effects of flunarizine in 48 VM patients over 12 weeks with those receiving 16 mg betahistine and vestibular exercises. The flunarizine treatment decreased the frequency of vertiginous episodes (p = 0.010), and the severity of vertigo improved (p = 0.046). However, the frequency and severity of headache were not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Side effects of flunarizine were weight gain and somnolence.

A retrospective chart study evaluated the effects of flunarizine and propranolol in another 61 patients with VM. Flunarizine patients (n = 30) showed a 68% responder rate for VM symptoms (p < 0.001), while patients on propranolol (n = 31) had an improvement rate of 73% (p < 0.001).

### Scopolamine (hyoscine) for preventing and treating motion sickness [^114kTDoP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Motion sickness, the discomfort experienced when perceived motion disturbs the organs of balance, may include symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweats, hypersalivation, hyperventilation, and headaches. The control and prevention of these symptoms have included pharmacological, behavioral, and complementary therapies. Although scopolamine (hyoscine) has been used in the treatment and prevention of motion sickness for decades, there have been no systematic reviews of its effectiveness.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioral and complementary therapy, or two or more of the above therapies in combination for motion sickness in persons (both adults and children) without known vestibular, visual, or central nervous system pathology.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (OVID, 1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (1974 to May 2007), CINAHL (OVID, 1982 to May 2007), and reference lists of retrieved studies were searched for relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied. The date of the last search was May 2007.

- **Selection criteria**: All parallel-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on scopolamine versus no therapy, placebo, other drugs, behavioral and complementary therapy, or two or more of the above therapies in combination were included. Outcomes relating to the prevention of onset or treatment of clinically-defined motion sickness were considered relevant.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^114kcocw]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale for pharmacotherapy of vertigo, dizziness, and ocular motor disorders impairing vision: The prerequisites for successful pharmacological treatment of vertigo, dizziness, ocular motor disorders, and pathological nystagmus are the "4 D's": correct diagnosis, correct drug, appropriate dosage, and sufficient duration.

- **Correct diagnosis**: In most patients, this can be easily made based on the patient history and clinical examination without laboratory investigations.
- **Correct drug**: Only a few have been proven effective in controlled trials.
- **Appropriate dosage**: Often the initial dose is too low or too high, rendering the treatment ineffective or not well tolerated.
- **Sufficient duration**: Drugs are often given either for too long, such as antivertiginous agents (e.g. dimenhydrinate), which delay central compensation and may cause drug dependence, or not long enough, as in Ménière's disease or vestibular migraine, which require long-term treatment.

Depending on their etiology, vestibular disorders can be treated with drugs, physical therapy, psychotherapeutic measures, or, rarely, surgery. Before commencing treatment, the patient should be informed that the prognosis is generally good for two reasons: (a) Vertigo often takes a favorable natural course since peripheral vestibular function improves or central vestibular compensation of the vestibular tone imbalance takes place; and (b) most forms can be successfully treated, mainly with drugs or physiotherapy. Several drugs are now available for the specific treatment.

### Pharmacological interventions for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^116rVJsd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

We planned to assess outcomes at the following time points: 3 to 12 months. The exception was for adverse event data, for which we planned to use the longest time period of follow-up.

We searched the COMET database for existing core outcome sets of relevance to PPPD and vertigo but were unable to find any published core outcome sets. Therefore, we conducted a survey of individuals with experience in, or an interest in, balance disorders to help identify outcomes that should be prioritized. This online survey, conducted with the support of the Ménière's Society and the Migraine Trust, included 324 participants who provided information regarding priority outcomes. The review author team used the results of this survey to inform the choice of outcome measures in this review.

We planned to analyze the following outcomes in the review but did not use them as a basis for including or excluding studies.

- **Primary outcomes**:
	- **Improvement in vestibular symptoms**: Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self-report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a rating scale.
	- **Change in vestibular symptoms**: Measured as a continuous outcome to identify the extent of change in vestibular symptoms.
	- **Serious adverse events**: Including any event that caused death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious event.

### Vertigo and motion sickness. Part II: Pharmacologic treatment [^111RQgEF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Vertigo is a sensation of movement when no movement is actually occurring. It is often accompanied by visceral autonomic symptoms, including pallor, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting. Vertigo is similar to motion sickness in that both may be caused by vestibular stimulation that does not match an internal model of expected environmental stimuli. Indeed, a functioning vestibular system is necessary for the perception of motion sickness. For this reason, many of the same drugs are used to treat both conditions. The investigation of drugs that treat motion sickness helps to discover medications that may treat vertigo caused by disease of the vestibular system. In this article, we discuss the pharmacologic agents that are now available for the treatment of vertigo and those agents that are still under study.

### Vestibular suppressants for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116vfEaJ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of acute dizziness. Medication use for its treatment remains common despite guideline recommendations against their use.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vestibular suppressants in patients with BPPV compared to placebo, no treatment, or canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRMs).

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until March 25, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antihistamines, phenothiazines, anticholinergics, and/or benzodiazepines to placebo, no treatment, or a CRM.

- **Results**: Five RCTs, enrolling 296 patients, were included in the quantitative analysis. We found that vestibular suppressants may have no effect on symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up (14–31 days in four studies) when evaluated as a continuous outcome (standardized mean difference -0.03 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.53 to 0.47). Conversely, CRMs may improve symptom resolution at the point of longest follow-up as a dichotomous outcome when compared to vestibular suppressants (relative risk [RR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78). Vestibular suppressants had an uncertain effect on symptom resolution within 24 hours (mean difference [MD] 5 points, 95% CI -16.92 to 26.94), repeat emergency department (ED)/clinic visits (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.15), patient satisfaction (MD 0 points, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.02), and quality of life (MD -1.2 points, 95% CI -2.96 to 0.56).

### Chlorpromazine hydrochloride [^113zwGLn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Adjust the dosage to the individual and the severity of their condition, recognizing that the milligram-for-milligram potency relationship among all dosage forms has not been precisely established clinically. It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period. The 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use in severe neuropsychiatric conditions.

- **Elderly patients**: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.

- **Psychotic disorders**: Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum dosage for two weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. A daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g. 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients).

- **Hospitalized patients**:

	- **Acute schizophrenic or manic states**: It is recommended that initial treatment be with chlorpromazine hydrochloride injection until the patient is controlled.

### Motion sickness in migraine and vestibular disorders [^116SfrLL]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

At every minute during rotation, participants rated nausea on a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 indicated no symptoms, 2 indicated initial symptoms but no nausea, 3 indicated mild nausea, and 4 indicated moderate nausea. Rotation continued until participants reached a Sickness Rating (SR) of 4 or a maximum of 20 minutes. To quantify recovery, SRs were also obtained at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after the motion endpoint.

Individual motion sickness susceptibility was reported before rotation using the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire, short form (MSSQ-Short). Briefly, participants were asked to report retrospectively the frequency of experiencing nausea on various forms of transport or motion. Participants in the VN, BVF, and VM groups also scored themselves after the onset of vestibular disease.

Figure 1A shows the mean Sickness Rating scores against time during rotation for all five groups (p < 0.001, analysis of variance). Participants who did not reach an SR of 4 were allocated values of 20 minutes for analysis. All patients with BVF tolerated motion for 20 minutes with no scores of SR 4 reported. Additionally, 38% of patients with BVF remained at an SR of 1 (no nausea) for the entire test duration, with no participant in any other group demonstrating this effect.

### Electrocortical therapy for motion sickness [^113yvLnd]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Given a sufficiently provocative stimulus, almost everyone can be made motion sick, with approximately one-third experiencing significant symptoms on long bus trips, on ships, or in light aircraft. Countermeasures are either behavioral or pharmacologic. Behavioral measures include habituation/desensitization treatment protocols as well as positioning the head in alignment with the direction of the gravito-inertial force and maintaining a stable horizontal reference frame. Pharmacologic measures, including antimuscarinics, H1 antihistamines, and sympathomimetics, all detrimentally impact cognitive function, rendering them inappropriate for occupational use. All therapies are only partially effective.

Since a functioning vestibular system is critical to the development of motion sickness, we proposed that suppressing vestibular activity could increase tolerance to nauseogenic motion stimuli. We previously showed that application of transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), specifically unipolar cathodal stimulation over the left parietal cortex, results in suppression of the vestibular system. Herein, we assessed whether such suppression of vestibular activity using tDCS in normal controls may alleviate motion sickness.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. It targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting where an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. It is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by enhancing the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and promoting the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel recommended against radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

### Vestibular testing abnormalities in individuals with motion sickness [^116KNoR7]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to compare the results of vestibular testing in individuals with motion sickness to a group of control subjects.

Studying motion sickness is difficult because no animal model has been developed, and symptoms rarely occur outside motion environments. Tests that can be performed in normal laboratory settings, which help to identify individuals with motion sickness, may be valuable in characterizing this disorder.

Twenty active duty military individuals with well-documented motion sickness were tested. The test battery included sinusoidal rotational chair testing to calculate vestibulo-ocular reflex function, step-velocity testing to calculate vestibular time constants, and posturography testing to assess vestibulo-spinal reflex status. The results of this test battery were compared with a set of age- and sex-matched controls without motion sickness.

Vestibular test abnormalities were demonstrated in individuals with motion sickness. Vestibulo-spinal reflex function on posturography was normal in the control group but abnormal in 70% of the individuals with motion sickness. In addition, 5% of the control group demonstrated a minimal shortening of the absolute time constant, whereas 60% of the individuals with motion sickness had abnormal absolute time constants.

A significant percentage of individuals with motion sickness demonstrate abnormalities in their time constant or vestibulo-spinal reflex function. These abnormalities can be detected using standard, land-based vestibular tests.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^111Z5n8e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews, we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process involving stakeholders. Vestibular migraine was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process, along with persistent postural‐perceptual dizziness and Ménière's disease.

The impact of vestibular migraine is considerable, with 40% of sufferers reporting sickness from work and over 70% reporting the impact of their symptoms on daily activities as either moderate or severe. At present, there are no national or international guidelines to inform the management of this condition; therefore, up‐to‐date, reliable evidence syntheses are required to help patients and healthcare professionals determine the benefits and harms of different interventions used for the condition.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^112G18Ug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. The unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed for prophylaxis of this condition to help reduce the frequency of these attacks. These treatments are predominantly based on those used for headache migraines, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine. These trials compared beta‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene‐related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin, or hormonal modification.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute attacks of vestibular migraine [^112bN1CN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Both studies also considered an improvement in headache using the same four-point scale as was used for vertigo.

- **At up to 2 hours**: The risk ratio for improvement in headache at up to two hours with triptans was 0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.96; 2 studies; 248 events; 124 participants; I² = 0%; Analysis 1.2; very low-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using a fixed-effect model caused very little change in this estimate (see Table 3).

- **At 2 to 12 hours**: No results were reported at this duration of follow-up.

- **At > 12 to 72 hours**: The risk ratio for improvement in headache at 24 hours with triptans was 1.16 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.37; 1 study; 171 events; 114 participants; Analysis 1.2; very low-certainty evidence). This analysis only included events in which participants did not take additional medication over the 24-hour follow-up period.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 years and older with dizziness in the United States [^117Es2YL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Vestibular suppressant use was defined as the first occurrence of a prescription within 30 days of a new dizziness diagnosis. A list of National Drug Codes (NDC) of medications used to define vestibular suppressant use based on major therapeutic drug classes of anti-emetics, including the antihistamine meclizine, motion sickness medications, and anti-anxiety drugs, including benzodiazepines, was referenced. Cohort characteristics were compared using the crude odds ratios (ORs) for categorical variables. Dizziness diagnoses were categorized into six groups as defined previously.

We assessed the distribution of suppressants by diagnosis type. Falls were defined using an established fall identification algorithm, which comprised E-codes (external site of injury codes for accidental falls) plus diagnosis codes for fractures, dislocations, sprains, intracranial injuries, and contusions, as described previously. The timeframe for capturing falls was within 12 months of dizziness diagnosis, with the outcome being the timing of the first vestibular suppressant prescription on potential fall risk.

All individuals included in the cohort had continuous insurance enrollment for at least one year following dizziness diagnosis and were alive for at least one year after this diagnosis. We created two fall risk models with individual therapeutic classes as well as a model with a combined suppressant use category. Cox proportional hazard modeling was employed to assess the ti

### Mecamylamine hydrochloride [^112uv1gD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Therapy is usually started with one 2.5 mg tablet of Mecamylamine HCl twice a day. This initial dosage should be modified by increments of one 2.5 mg tablet at intervals of not less than 2 days until the desired blood pressure response occurs (the criterion being a dosage just under that which causes signs of mild postural hypotension).

The average total daily dosage of Mecamylamine HCl is 25 mg, usually in three divided doses. However, as little as 2.5 mg daily may be sufficient to control hypertension in some patients. A range of two to four or even more doses may be required in severe cases when smooth control is difficult to obtain. In severe or urgent cases, larger increments at smaller intervals may be needed. Partial tolerance may develop in certain patients, requiring an increase in the daily dosage of Mecamylamine HCl.

Administration of Mecamylamine HCl after meals may cause a more gradual absorption and smoother control of excessively high blood pressure. The timing of doses in relation to meals should be consistent. Since the blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs is increased in the early morning, the larger dose should be given at noontime and perhaps in the evening. The morning dose, as a rule, should be relatively small and in some instances may even be omitted.

The initial regulation of dosage should be determined by blood pressure readings in the erect position at the time of maximal effect of the drug, as well as by other signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.

### Update on the pharmacotherapy of cerebellar and central vestibular disorders [^111Tv7Bo]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In this overview, the pharmacological treatment of central vestibular vertigo, cerebellar disorders, and the most common forms of central nystagmus are presented. These disorders are usually associated with vertigo and dizziness, which are among the most frequent symptoms with which patients present to primary care physicians, with a 30% lifetime prevalence. The general prerequisites for successful treatment of dizziness and nystagmus are a correct diagnosis, the correct drug, an appropriate dosage, and a sufficient duration of treatment. Vertigo and dizziness due to central vestibular disorders are often associated with nystagmus, which causes blurred vision and impaired visual acuity due to oscillopsia. Depending on the underlying etiology, additional cerebellar and brain stem signs may occur. In recent years, progress has been made in the symptomatic treatment of cerebellar disorders such as episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) as well as downbeat nystagmus (DBN), particularly due to the use of aminopyridines.

Non-randomized and non-placebo-controlled clinical trials on the treatment of different forms of dizziness and nystagmus are not state-of-the-art and have considerable deficits. Thus, there is a strong need for multicenter, placebo-controlled trials for vestibular and ocular motor disorders. The ongoing trials in the field are also described, and perspectives for future therapeutic interventions are discussed.

### No effects of anti-motion sickness drugs on vestibular evoked myogenic potentials outcome parameters [^116oWqMR]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of meclizine (50 mg), baclofen (10 mg), cinnarizine (20 mg) + dimenhydrinate (40 mg), and promethazine (25 mg) + dextro-amphetamine (5 mg) on the parameters of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test.

- **Study design**: Double-blind placebo-controlled prospective randomized trial.

- **Setting**: University hospital.

- **Subjects**: Twenty-four (first block: baclofen versus placebo) and 20 healthy male subjects (second block: meclizine, cinnarizine + dimenhydrinate, and promethazine + dextro-amphetamine versus placebo).

- **Interventions**: VEMP test.

- **Main outcome measures**: Threshold, p13 and n23 latencies, p13-n23 latency difference, p13-n23 peak-to-peak amplitude, mean rectified voltage of the sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction, and the corrected amplitude.

Results indicated no clinically significant pharmacologic effects on the VEMP outcome parameters. However, there was a statistically significant left-right asymmetry after the intake of the combination promethazine + d-amphetamine for the parameters p13 and latency difference.

The conclusion suggests that the absence of clinically significant effects can be explained by the predominant presence of the target receptors for the applied drugs in the medial vestibular nucleus, which receives the lowest grade of saccular projections. It is also hypothesized that the VEMP methodology and techniques in general may not allow determination of pharmacologic effects in a healthy group of subjects due to a too small discriminative power. The left-right asymmetry might be explained by a depressive action of the drug.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^114pdbwb]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

In Europe, betahistine is often used, primarily based on a study by Meyer and more recent meta-analyses. Betahistine functions as an H1-agonist and H3-antagonist. It enhances labyrinthine microcirculation by acting on the precapillary sphincters of the stria vascularis. Evidence suggests it reduces the production and increases the absorption of endolymph.

In an open trial of betahistine dihydrochloride in 112 patients with Ménière's disease, it was found that high-dose (48 mg tid) and long-term treatment (12 months) were more effective than low-dose (16–24 mg tid) and short-term treatment. These findings form the basis for an ongoing prospective, randomized, double-masked dose-finding study comparing placebo with 16 mg tid and 48 mg tid of betahistine dihydrochloride.

- **Effects of betahistine dihydrochloride**: The study indicates upon low dosage (16 or 24 mg tid, represented by filled square, dotted line) versus high dosage (48 mg tid, represented by filled diamond, solid line), the frequency of vertigo attacks in 112 Ménière's disease patients. The mean number of attacks per month (± SEM) during the 3 months preceding treatment (month 0) is compared to the number per month during therapy (months 3, 6, 9, 12). After 12 months, the mean (median) number of attacks dropped from 7.6 (4.5) to 4.4 (2.0) (p < 0.0001) in the low-dosage group, and from 8.8 (5.5) to 1.0 (0.0) (p < 0.0001) in the high-dosage group. The number of attacks after 12 months was significantly lower in the high-dosage group compared to the low-dosage group (p 12M = 0.0002).

In summary, the pharmacological treatment of betahistine shows promising results in reducing vertigo attacks in patients with Ménière's disease, particularly with higher doses and extended treatment durations.

### Prevention and treatment of motion sickness [^111y2ooY]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Motion sickness is a common syndrome that occurs upon exposure to certain types of motion. It is thought to be caused by a conflict between the vestibular, visual, and other proprioceptive systems. Nausea is the hallmark symptom, often preceded by stomach awareness, malaise, drowsiness, and irritability. Early self-diagnosis should be emphasized. Patients should be counseled about both behavioral and pharmacologic strategies to prevent motion sickness before traveling.

Patients need to learn to identify situations that might lead to motion sickness. They should minimize the amount of unpleasant motion by avoiding difficult conditions while traveling or positioning themselves in the most stable part of the vehicle. Slow, intermittent exposure to the motion can reduce symptoms. Other behavioral strategies include watching the true visual horizon, steering the vehicle, tilting their head into turns, or lying down with their eyes closed. Additionally, patients should attempt to reduce other sources of physical, mental, and emotional discomfort.

Scopolamine is a first-line medication for the prevention of motion sickness; it should be administered transdermally several hours before anticipated motion exposure. First-generation antihistamines, although sedating, are also effective. However, nonsedating antihistamines, ondansetron, and ginger root are not effective in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness.

### Both migraine and motion sickness may be due to low brain levels of serotonin [^116d53Ca]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Scientists believe that low levels of a brain chemical called serotonin may make people susceptible to developing migraine headaches. Many people with migraines also have a problem with motion sickness, but it is not clear why this might be. We know that many drugs used to treat motion sickness increase brain levels of serotonin, an important brain chemical. It is possible that low brain levels of serotonin may also be responsible for motion sickness. In this issue of Neurology, Drummond reports on a study that evaluated whether low brain levels of serotonin trigger motion sickness in people with and without migraines. More information about migraines can be found on the next page.

### Cross-coupling vestibular stimulation: Motion sickness and the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex [^114X4Spy]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Motion sickness is associated with a variety of autonomic symptoms, presumably due to the proximity or functional interconnectivity between the autonomic centers in the brainstem and the vestibular system. A direct influence of the vestibular system on cardiovascular variables, defined as the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex, has been reported previously. Our aim was to investigate the sudomotor components of the autonomic responses associated with motion sickness during passive cross-coupling stimulation ("roll while rotating").

Healthy subjects (n = 17) were rotated at 40°/s around an earth-vertical yaw axis alone and in combination with sinusoidal roll oscillations (0.2 Hz). Motion sickness was assessed verbally every minute using a 1–10 scale, while recording DC and AC skin conductance levels (SCL) from the forehead. Yaw rotation alone provoked neither motion sickness nor variations of forehead sweating. Yet during cross-coupling stimulation all subjects reported motion sickness. Higher motion sickness scores (> 5) were associated with significantly higher amplitudes of AC-SCL events compared to the lower scores (0.22 ± 0.01 vs. 0.11 ± 0.01 µS, respectively). Frequency domain analysis of the AC-SCL events revealed a peak at 0.2 Hz, coinciding with the frequency of the chair rolls. The total power of AC-SCL signals did not match the trend of motion sickness scores across conditions.

We conclude that: (1) although SCL is related to motion sickness, it does not follow the perceived sickness closely; (2) the discrepancy between SCL and motion sickness and the rhythmic AC-SCL events…

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^1159YCbY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Data synthesis - **Meta-analysis of numerical data**: Where possible and appropriate (if participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes were sufficiently similar in the studies identified), we conducted a quantitative synthesis of results. All meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 2020. It was anticipated that the underlying effect of the intervention might vary between studies due to differences in participants, settings, and the interventions used for each study. Therefore, a random-effects method was planned for the meta-analysis. However, as the only outcomes suitable for meta-analysis had few events, the fixed effect Peto odds ratio was used for analysis. We explored whether a random-effects model substantially altered the effect estimates (see Sensitivity analysis).

For dichotomous data, treatment differences were analyzed as a risk ratio (RR) calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel methods (or using a Peto odds ratio, as described above). No meta-analysis for continuous data was conducted in this review.

Improvement in vertigo symptoms may be assessed using various methods, which consider different aspects of vertigo. These include:

- Frequency of vertigo episodes
- Duration of vertigo episodes
- Severity/intensity of vertigo episodes
- A composite measure of all these aspects, assessed with a global score, such as "how troublesome are your vertigo symptoms?", rated on an ordinal scale.

For the outcomes "improvement in vertigo" and "change in vertigo", we prioritized outcome.

### Vestibular suppressant utilization and subsequent falls among patients 65 years and older with dizziness in the United States [^112jr4FH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Low credibility.

Falls pose a significant public health threat to older adults. Due to potential fall risk, guidelines recommend against the routine prescription of several medications commonly used for vestibular suppression, including meclizine and benzodiazepines.

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vestibular suppressant utilization among patients with dizziness aged 65 years and older and subsequent falls. A retrospective longitudinal database of US commercial insurance and Medicare beneficiaries was used to study medical claims data from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2015. Of 190,348 individuals aged 65 years or older who presented with dizziness, 60,658 (32%) filled a vestibular suppressant prescription (27% anti-emetics, 73% anxiolytics), of which 20,448 were women (34%) within a month after their dizziness diagnosis. Of those individuals using suppressants, 8% experienced a fall resulting in a medical encounter within 60 days of filling the prescription. After adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbidity, individuals with dizziness who received vestibular suppressants were more likely to experience recorded fall incidents (hazard ratio (HR) 3.33, confidence interval (CI) 1.93–5.72, p < 0.0001) than those who did not receive vestibular suppressants.

Although vestibular suppressants may provide immediate relief from symptoms during an acute vestibular crisis, their use is incongruent with guideline-concordant care for most vestibular diagnoses and is also potentially counterproductive and injurious.

### Antihistamines for motion sickness [^116XGmwz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Motion sickness is a syndrome that occurs as a result of passive body movement in response to actual motion, or the illusion of motion when exposed to virtual and moving visual environments. The most common symptoms are nausea and vomiting. Antihistamines have been used in the management of motion sickness for decades; however, studies have shown conflicting results regarding their efficacy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of antihistamines in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 7 December 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in susceptible adults and children in whom motion sickness was induced under natural conditions such as air, sea, and land transportation. We also included studies in which motion sickness was induced under experimental conditions (analysed separately). Antihistamines were included regardless of class, route, or dosage and compared to no treatment, placebo, or any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1) the proportion of susceptible participants who did not experience any motion sickness symptoms; 2) the proportion of susceptible participants who experienced a reduction or resolution of symptoms.
