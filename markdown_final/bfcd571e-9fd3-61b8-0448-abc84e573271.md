## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with unstable angina receiving medical treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with unstable angina who are receiving medical treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is acute management versus chronic secondary prevention. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline sources for aspirin dosing in unstable angina. Next, I will examine randomized trials that inform dose selection, especially around bleeding risk. After that, I should confirm whether dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated and, if so, for how long. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and note any exceptions or special situations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Unstable angina is a non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in which patients may be managed medically without immediate revascularization, so the question spans both acute-phase antithrombotic therapy and the transition to long-term secondary prevention, and I need to ensure I'm not conflating primary prevention guidance with secondary prevention here [^dabe79ad].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The ACCP 9th edition gives a Grade 1A recommendation for daily oral aspirin 75–100 mg in patients with NSTE-ACS, which includes unstable angina, and this aligns with the principle that low-dose aspirin achieves platelet COX-1 inhibition with a better bleeding profile than higher doses, so 75–100 mg daily is the backbone for secondary prevention in this setting [^f9191aa4] [^e43b54c6].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response and bleeding data that underpin that 75–100 mg choice. Multiple analyses show no added ischemic benefit with higher aspirin doses and a clear increase in bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, with doses above 200 mg/day; the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration and subsequent overviews consistently support 75–150 mg as the effective range, with 75–100 mg favored for long-term therapy to minimize bleeding, and this is reinforced by contemporary summaries of the evidence base [^0686b048] [^e43b54c6] [^b5ba2181].

> Hold on, I should verify whether dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated in medically managed unstable angina. The CURE trial demonstrated that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke in ACS, including medically managed patients, at the cost of more major bleeding; thus, DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel is reasonable for 3–12 months in medically managed NSTE-ACS, after which single antiplatelet therapy is preferred, and I need to ensure I state the loading dose correctly as 300 mg for clopidogrel in ACS [^368de8c4] [^b59208ba].

> I should double-check the aspirin dose within DAPT. In CURE, patients received aspirin 75–325 mg daily, and subgroup analyses suggested the efficacy of clopidogrel was consistent across aspirin dose strata, but bleeding rose with higher aspirin doses; taken together, most contemporary guidance operationalizes aspirin at 75–100 mg daily when used with a P2Y12 inhibitor to mitigate bleeding, and this is reflected in ACCP recommendations for NSTE-ACS [^ff6fdb9b] [^f9191aa4].

> Let me consider the long-term maintenance phase after the first year. Once the acute-phase risk period passes, single antiplatelet therapy is recommended, with aspirin 75–100 mg daily as first-line or clopidogrel 75 mg daily if aspirin is not tolerated, and I should confirm that this indefinite single antiplatelet strategy applies to established CAD, which it does in ACCP and is echoed in modern chronic coronary disease guidance [^ec8e3867] [^d2e7a157].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a higher aspirin dose for added platelet inhibition? I need to ensure I counter that with the randomized data. The CURRENT-OASIS 7 factorial trial found no difference in ischemic outcomes between higher-dose and lower-dose aspirin in ACS, whereas bleeding signals trended unfavorably with higher doses, reinforcing that 75–100 mg is the sweet spot for efficacy and safety in this population [^87a21b81] [^d8dff220].

> I should also confirm special situations. If the patient has a true aspirin allergy, clopidogrel monotherapy is a reasonable alternative, and if there is a need for oral anticoagulation for another indication, the antiplatelet regimen should be individualized to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, often favoring single antiplatelet therapy or even anticoagulation alone depending on the scenario, but that is beyond the scope of a simple dosing answer and requires case-by-case judgment [^f9191aa4] [^e8eef82b].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable recommendation is as follows: for adults with unstable angina managed medically, use aspirin 75–100 mg orally once daily indefinitely for secondary prevention, and during the first 3–12 months consider dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 75–100 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily after a 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose, then de-escalate to aspirin monotherapy thereafter if no contraindications persist, with dose adjustments only for bleeding risk, aspirin intolerance, or competing antithrombotic needs [^f9191aa4] [^368de8c4] [^b59208ba].

---

For adults with unstable angina receiving medical therapy, the recommended aspirin dose is **75–100 mg daily** [^f9191aa4] for long-term secondary prevention [^ec8e3867], as it balances efficacy and bleeding risk [^e43b54c6]. Higher doses (≥ 200 mg/day) do not improve efficacy and increase bleeding [^ff6fdb9b] [^26cae4f7]. If dual antiplatelet therapy is used, continue aspirin 75–100 mg daily with clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 12 months [^38014eca], then revert to aspirin monotherapy [^e8eef82b].

---

## Recommended aspirin dosage

- **Standard dose**: 75–100 mg orally once daily [^f9191aa4] [^e43b54c6].
- **Rationale**: Low-dose aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2 and platelet aggregation [^d2cca3ba]; doses ≥ 200 mg/day do not improve efficacy and increase bleeding [^ff6fdb9b] [^26cae4f7].
- **Clinical evidence**: The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration and ACCP 9th edition guidelines support 75–150 mg/day for secondary prevention, with 75–100 mg/day optimal for unstable angina [^0686b048] [^e43b54c6].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low-dose aspirin

- **CURE trial**: In 12,562 ACS patients (including medically managed), clopidogrel plus aspirin reduced cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 20% vs aspirin alone; major bleeding was higher, but aspirin dose 75–100 mg minimized bleeding without loss of efficacy [^368de8c4] [^ff6fdb9b].
- **CURRENT-OASIS 7**: In 25,086 ACS patients, high-dose aspirin (300–325 mg) was not superior to low-dose (75–100 mg) for ischemic outcomes and had similar major bleeding, supporting low-dose aspirin [^87a21b81] [^d8dff220].
- **Meta-analyses**: Low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg) reduces serious vascular events by ~20% in high-risk patients, including those with unstable angina, with favorable benefit–bleed balance [^0686b048] [^c248cfa8].

## Risks and benefits of aspirin therapy

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduces cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke [^0686b048] | Increases gastrointestinal bleeding [^ff6fdb9b] |
| Low cost and wide availability | Increases hemorrhagic stroke risk [^249365c0] |
| Well-established safety profile at low doses | Bleeding risk rises with higher doses [^ff6fdb9b] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: For 12 months after ACS, aspirin 75–100 mg/day plus clopidogrel 75 mg/day is recommended [^38014eca]; then revert to aspirin monotherapy [^e8eef82b].
- **Bleeding risk**: Use proton pump inhibition for high GI bleeding risk; avoid aspirin in patients with active bleeding or high bleeding risk [^notfound].
- **Aspirin intolerance**: Clopidogrel 75 mg/day is an alternative [^a0a1e090].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended aspirin dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Unstable angina (medical therapy) | 75–100 mg daily | Indefinitely |
| Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) | 75–100 mg daily + clopidogrel 75 mg daily | 12 months |
| Aspirin intolerance | Clopidogrel 75 mg daily | Indefinitely |

---

The recommended aspirin dose for unstable angina managed medically is **75–100 mg daily** [^f9191aa4], with stronger ischemic benefit when combined with clopidogrel for 12 months [^368de8c4], followed by aspirin monotherapy [^e8eef82b]. Higher aspirin doses do not improve outcomes and increase bleeding [^ff6fdb9b] [^26cae4f7].

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^e55e8475]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have compared different aspirin doses among patients receiving P2Y12 inhibitors. The CURRENT‐OASIS (Clopidogrel and Aspirin Optimal Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent Events−Seventh Organization to Assess Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes) 7 was a large trial that randomized patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI to high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin and high‐ versus low‐dose clopidogrel in a 2×2 factorial design. Overall, there was no difference between high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin with regard to the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke or major bleeding at 30 days. Although there was a nominally significant interaction between high‐dose aspirin with double‐dose clopidogrel in the CURRENT‐OASIS 7 trial, the P value for interaction did not meet the prespecified trial threshold of 0.01, suggesting that the interaction may have been attributable to chance. Similarly, in a secondary analysis of the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events) trial, Peters et al found that the relative efficacy of clopidogrel versus placebo in preventing ischemic events was consistent between patients receiving low‐dose (< 100 mg), medium‐dose (100–199 mg), and high‐dose (≥ 200 mg) aspirin, but the risk of bleeding increased with higher dose of aspirin. However, both of these studies included patients with acute coronary syndrome, and aspirin dose was not randomized in the CURE trial. Moreover, follow‐up in the CURRENT‐OASIS 7 trial was limited at 30 days.

In contrast, our study includes a broader population of stable patients with ASCVD who were randomized to low‐ versus high‐dose aspirin therapy. Although we found that the risk of MACEs was higher in patients receiving P2Y12 inhibitor at baseline, we found no signal in favor of either high‐ or low‐dose aspirin in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. The overall negative findings of our study are also consistent with emerging data from randomized controlled trials that have found that, compared with dual‐antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, discontinuation of aspirin after 1 to 3 months, followed by monotherapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, does not increase the risk of ischemic events but reduces the risk of bleeding complications. These trials question the continued need for aspirin among patients who have undergone PCI and may explain why we found no signal in favor of either dose of aspirin.

### Facts and controversies of aspirin and clopidogrel therapy [^bd2fb530]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Because of the central role of platelets in mediating ischemic events, antiplatelet agents are critical components of atherothrombosis prevention. Given their robust safety and efficacy profiles, aspirin and clopidogrel are consistently recommended by evidence-based treatment guidelines. Despite these recommendations, controversies surrounding the appropriate application of aspirin and clopidogrel remain. Questions of appropriate dosing, length of therapy, and use of combination therapy are most pressing, and considerable debate exists regarding the variability of response to antiplatelet therapy, including the definition, measurement, and clinical relevance of responsiveness. This review discusses the facts and controversies surrounding the use of aspirin and clopidogrel. Overall, despite the existing controversies, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or clopidogrel remains a proven and essential therapeutic tool for safe and effective management of atherothrombotic risk in specific clinical settings.

Objective

Many recommendations for aspirin in stable cardiovascular disease are based on analyses of all antiplatelet therapies at all dosages and in both stable and unstable patients. Our objective was to evaluate the benefit and risk of low-dose aspirin (50–325 mg/d) in patients with stable cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Secondary prevention trials of low-dose aspirin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease were identified by searches of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 2006. Six randomized trials were identified that enrolled patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 1), stable angina (n = 1), or stroke/transient ischemic attack (n = 4). A random effects model was used to combine results from individual trials.

Results

Six studies randomized 9853 patients. Aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 21% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.88), 26% reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI (95% CI, 0.60–0.91), 25% reduction in the risk of stroke (95% CI, 0.65–0.87), and 13% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.76–0.98). Patients treated with aspirin were significantly more likely to experience severe bleeding (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI, 1.4–3.4). Treatment of 1000 patients for an average of 33 months would prevent 33 cardiovascular events, 12 nonfatal MIs, 25 nonfatal strokes, and 14 deaths, and cause 9 major bleeding events. Among those with ischemic heart disease, aspirin was most effective at reducing the risk of nonfatal MI and all-cause mortality; however, among those with cerebrovascular disease, aspirin was most effective at reducing the risk of stroke.

Conclusion

In patients with stable cardiovascular disease, low-dose aspirin therapy reduces the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, and increases the risk of severe bleeding.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^4c5b8280]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

Primary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines and European Society for Cardiology (ESC) Guidance for the Diagnosis and Management of CVD during the COVID-19 pandemic do not include any recommendations regarding aspirin for the primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis during this pandemic. This role is controversial in literature before the COVID-19 era(table 1).

Table 1
Primary prevention of arterial atherothrombosis events in guidelines

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in collaboration with the Canadian Stroke Consortium does not recommend the use of aspirin for primary prevention in individuals without a history of symptomatic CVD as the harms of daily aspirin use could potentially outweigh the benefits.

Secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel and the ESC recommend that patients who are receiving antiplatelet therapies (eg, aspirin) or anticoagulant for underlying conditions should continue these medications if they receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 unless there are contraindications such as the excessive risk of bleeding or planned invasive surgical procedures. These underlying conditions are acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, previous MI or revascularisation, postpercutaneous coronary interventions, transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke. A recent retrospective cohort study revealed that prehospital aspirin use in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with established coronary artery disease was not associated with increased all-cause mortality.

Prevention of venous thromboembolic events during COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel does not recommend anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy for VTE prophylaxis or at therapeutic doses in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 unless there are other indications. These indications may be for arterial thrombosis prevention as mentioned above or for the prevention of VTE following total hip or knee replacementafter a risk assessment of postoperative VTE.

### A critical reappraisal of aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with ischemic heart disease [^e4d3dcd0]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin was established more than a quarter century ago as an evidence-based therapy to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease based on limited data by contemporary standards. Indeed it is unclear how regulatory agencies would define the optimal dose or duration of aspirin therapy if assessed in the current era. Subsequent clinical investigation has focused on the addition of antithrombotic agents on top of baseline aspirin therapy in the acute and chronic setting to reduce patient's risk of further ischemic events, at the cost of increased bleeding complications. The current armamentarium of potent and predictable antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents has ushered in a new era where clinicians and scientists are contemplating withdrawal of previously established agents to minimize bleeding risk while sustaining efficacy; indeed, subtraction may lead to the next advance in the treatment of acute and chronic ischemic vascular disease.

### Antiplatelet agents for the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis [^1e39c3e2]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical pharmacology of antiplatelet drugs has been reviewed previously by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Task force and by the 8th American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. Moreover, information on the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet drugs in the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis is provided by collaborative meta-analyses of 287 secondary prevention trials and 6 primary prevention trials. The present document intends to provide practicing physicians with an updated instrument to guide their choice of the most suitable antiplatelet strategy for the individual patient at risk, or with different clinical manifestations, of atherothrombosis.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^b2ea0e2a]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Effects of aspirin dose when used alone or in combination with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes: observations from the clopidogrel in unstable angina to prevent recurrent events (CURE) study [^ff6fdb9b]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

We studied the benefits and risks of adding clopidogrel to different doses of aspirin in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods and Results

In the Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial, 12 562 patients with ACS using aspirin, 75 to 325 mg daily, were randomized to clopidogrel or placebo for up to 1 year. In this analysis, patients were divided into the following 3 aspirin dose groups: ≤ 100 mg, 101 through 199 mg, and ≥ 200 mg. The combined incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was reduced by clopidogrel regardless of aspirin dose, as follows: ≤ 100 mg, 10.5% versus 8.6% (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.97]); 101 to 199 mg, 9.8% versus 9.5% (RR, 0.97 [95% CI 0.77 to 1.22]); and ≥ 200 mg, 13.6% versus 9.8% (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85]). The incidence of major bleeding increased with increasing aspirin dose both in the placebo group (1.9%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively; P = 0.0001) and the clopidogrel group (3.0%, 3.4%, and 4.9%, respectively; P = 0.0009); thus, the excess risk with clopidogrel was 1.1%, 1.2%, and 1.2%, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for major bleeding for the highest versus the lowest dose of aspirin was 1.9 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.72) in the placebo group, 1.6 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.23) in the clopidogrel group, and 1.7 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.20) in the combined group.

Conclusions

In patients with ACS, adding clopidogrel to aspirin is beneficial regardless of aspirin dose. Bleeding risks increase with increasing aspirin dose, with or without clopidogrel, without any increase in efficacy. Our findings suggest that the optimal daily dose of aspirin may be between 75 and 100 mg, with or without clopidogrel.

Aspirin for established vascular disease — effects and applicability: A meta-analysis of individual participant data from 16 randomized trials with 17,000 patients with established vascular disease (six trials of previous MI and 10 trials of previous transient ischemic attack [TIA] or stroke) found that in this high-risk population (8.2% yearly risk) aspirin significantly reduced total mortality, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke at the cost of increased nonfatal extracranial bleeding events, with the number of vascular events and total deaths prevented far greater than the number of bleeding events; similar antiplatelet effects were found in patients with a history of MI (12 trials) and in patients with a history of stable angina and CAD (seven trials).

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular disease [^94cdeabb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. However, protection with antiplatelet therapy in people with a high risk of cardiovascular disease is unsatisfactory in absolute terms. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for those at high risk and those with established cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To quantify the effects (both benefit and harm) of adding clopidogrel to standard long-term aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and those with established cardiovascular disease.

Search Strategy

CENTRAL (Issue 2 2006), MEDLINE (2002 to May 2006) and EMBASE (2002 to May 2006) were searched. Online registers of ongoing trials and reference lists from original articles and reviews were checked.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing long term (> 30 days) use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in patients with coronary disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease (with data for at least one of the outcomes) were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were collected on the following outcomes and analysed where appropriate: mortality (from myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular causes, all-causes), non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable angina, heart failure, revascularizations, major and minor bleeding, and all adverse events. Quantitative analysis of outcome was based on an intention-to-treat principle. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel).

Main Results

Two RCTs were found. Patients enrolled in the CHARISMA study were at high risk for cardiovascular events, either with or without an established cardiovascular disease. Patients enrolled in the CURE study had a recent non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. The use of clopidogrel plus aspirin, compared with placebo plus aspirin, was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; P < 0.01) and a higher risk of major bleeding (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.57; P < 0.01). Overall, we would expect 13 cardiovascular events to be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination, but 6 major bleeds would be caused. Treatment effects differed in the two trials: the CURE trial, confined to people with acute non-ST segment coronary syndromes, showed definite evidence of benefit from treatment. For every 1000 people treated for an average of 9 months, 23 events would be avoided and 10 major bleeds would be caused. In the CHARISMA trial that randomized people at high cardiovascular risk defined either in terms of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases or risk factors, the effects of treatment were less marked and were consistent with the play of chance. For every 1000 people treated for an average of 28 months, 5 cardiovascular events would be avoided and 3 major bleeds would be caused.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin is associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events compared with aspirin alone in patients with acute non-ST coronary syndrome. In patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease but not presenting acutely, there is only weak evidence of benefit and hazards of treatment almost match any benefit obtained.

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^94aa5e4d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prespecified subgroup analysis of a large, pragmatic, randomized, open‐label trial, we found no difference in the relative effectiveness and safety of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin in patients receiving treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor at baseline. Although aspirin dose switching and discontinuation occurred more often in the high‐dose aspirin group, this pattern was not different between the P2Y12 subgroups. Given the overall null findings, decisions about aspirin dosing should be individualized based on clinical factors and patient preference, regardless of P2Y12 inhibitor use.

Although participants receiving P2Y12 inhibitors were younger, history of prior MI, revascularization, and other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities were significantly higher in this subgroup. Use of P2Y12 inhibitors at baseline was associated with a 40% increased risk of the primary effectiveness end point, largely driven by a nearly 2‐fold increase in risk of MI. Although not statistically significant, risk of major bleeding was also numerically higher in the P2Y12 inhibitor group, which suggests that this group represented those at a higher risk for both MACEs and bleeding events. Despite these differences, we found no evidence that the relative effectiveness of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin differed in patients who were receiving concomitant P2Y12 inhibitor at randomization.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^743fc69c]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The apparent numerical difference in relative risk reductions observed in primary (typically, 10% to 12% reduction) and secondary (typically, 20% to 25% reduction) prevention trials is most likely explained by the much longer duration of the former (6.9 years) than the latter (2.5 years)and time-dependent loss of compliance with trial medication.

Strengths of the evidence for the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose aspirin are related to the number, sample size, and duration of placebo-controlled RCTs across the whole spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Potential limitations are represented by the time frame over which this evidence accumulated, prior to the development of coronary revascularization and other pharmacological preventive strategies (e.g. statins). Such improvements in treatment and prevention would be expected to reduce the baseline risk of serious vascular events and therefore the absolute benefits of aspirin addition. However, revascularization and statin therapy are unlikely to modify the relative risk reduction associated with aspirin use, if its benefits are additive to those of other strategies, as would be expected by their different mechanisms of action.

Aspirin dosing and bleeding risk in established coronary artery disease (CAD) indicate no added efficacy with higher doses and increased bleeding with very high doses. Across different daily doses of aspirin (50–1,500 mg vs 160–325 mg vs 75–150 mg vs < 75 mg), direct comparisons of high- vs low-dose aspirin found no significant differences, and uncertainty remains for aspirin < 75 mg versus ≥ 75 mg; indirect comparisons found no evidence that high doses (eg, ≥ 160 mg/d) are more effective than 75 to 160 mg. A 2007 systematic review identified eight prospective trials including nearly 10,000 patients taking aspirin 30 to 1,300 mg/d, in which a significant benefit of higher doses was not identified and, in most, the lowest event rates were seen in lower-dose groups. Regarding bleeding, a review including > 190,000 patients in 31 randomized controlled trials found aspirin > 200 mg associated with an ~30% increase in major bleeding compared with doses < 200 mg (P = 0.05), and nonmajor bleeding increased in patients receiving 100 to 200 mg of aspirin per day compared with < 100 mg/d; the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no difference in major extracranial bleed across < 75, 75–150, and 160–325 mg compared with placebo, and did not comment on > 325 mg. Taken together, these findings provide moderate-quality evidence to support the use of aspirin 75 to 100 mg/d for patients with established CAD.

### The clopidogrel in unstable angina to prevent recurrent events (CURE) trial programme; rationale, design and baseline characteristics including a meta-analysis of the effects of thienopyridines in vascular disease [^1a14ff42]. European Heart Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Other than aspirin, there are few oral antithrombotic treatments with proven efficacy in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In this report, we present the rationale, design and baseline characteristics of the Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischaemic Events (CURE) trial, which includes a meta-analysis of the effects of thienopyridines in patients with vascular disease.

Methods and Results

Combined data from randomized trials of thienopyrindines in patients with atherosclerotic disease demonstrated a 29% reduction in vascular events when compared with placebo/control (n = 2392) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58–0.86, P = 0.0006) and a 10% reduction in vascular events when compared with aspirin (n = 22 254) (OR 0.91, 95% Cl 0.84–0.99, P = 0.039). Similarly, randomized trials of aspirin plus thienopyridines in patients undergoing intracoronary stenting, demonstrated a marked benefit of aspirin plus ticlopidine in reducing death or myocardial infarction compared with aspirin alone (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11–0.49, P = 0.0001) or aspirin plus warfarin (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33–0.78, P = 0.002). Whether these benefits extend to the much larger population of patients with acute coronary syndrome is unknown. CURE is an international, randomized, double-blind trial, in which patients with acute coronary syndrome will be randomized to receive either a bolus dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) followed by 75 mg per day for 3–12 months, or matching placebo. Both groups will receive aspirin. The co-primary efficacy end-points of CURE are: (1) the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke; and (2) the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or refractory ischaemia. CURE will recruit approximately 12 500 patients with acute coronary syndrome (from 28 countries) and its power to detect moderate treatment benefits will be in the region of 80–90%, while maintaining an overall type I error (alpha) of 0.05. The baseline characteristics of the study population are consistent with at least a moderate risk group of patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Conclusions

Randomized trials of thienopyridines in patients with vascular disease demonstrate that thienopyridines are effective in reducing vascular events when compared with placebo/control or aspirin, as well as when used in combination with aspirin in patients undergoing intracoronary stent implantation. The CURE trial is a large international study to determine if acute and long-term treatment with the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^59d5dfd3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Antiplatelet drugs are the cornerstone of treatment in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce the risk of future ischemic events. However, there has been controversy about the optimal dose of aspirin for secondary prevention in ASCVD. The ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient‐Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long‐Term Effectiveness) was a phase 3 multicenter randomized controlled trial that compared low‐dose aspirin (81 mg) with high‐dose aspirin (325 mg) and found no overall difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) or bleeding. However, it remains unknown whether concomitant therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor modifies the effect of aspirin dose on future risk of cardiovascular events and major bleeding in a stable population of patients with ASCVD.

Dual‐antiplatelet therapy, which typically includes oral aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is commonly prescribed in patients after an acute coronary syndrome and those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as these patients are at a high risk of recurrent thrombotic events. By providing additional platelet inhibition, dual‐antiplatelet therapy mitigates the risk of stent thrombosis and reduces the risk of MACEs in such patients. However, the optimal dose of aspirin in patients also receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor remains unclear., Given their potent antiplatelet effects, P2Y12 inhibitors can provide substantial ischemic risk reduction but may lead to higher bleeding risk. Therefore, concomitant therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor may tip the balance in favor of low‐dose aspirin, especially with regard to reduction in bleeding risk. On the other hand, a need for P2Y12 inhibitor therapy may be representative of patients at increased risk of ischemic events (eg, recent myocardial infarction [MI]), who may benefit from higher‐dose aspirin for ischemic risk reduction. Prior studies of the relative effectiveness of aspirin dosing in patients also receiving P2Y12 inhibitors have been primarily conducted in patients who were discharged from a hospital with acute coronary syndrome. The relative effectiveness of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin in patients taking concomitant P2Y12 inhibitors with stable ASCVD remains less clear.

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis of the ADAPTABLE to address whether the relative effectiveness and safety of low‐ versus high‐dose aspirin differs in patients who were also receiving P2Y12 inhibitor at randomization.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy in unstable angina / non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention: is it time for a guideline update? [^b90c0aba]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Oral antiplatelet drugs are central in the management of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the mechanisms that confer the benefits of these agents also increase bleeding risk. Thus, the selection of appropriate pharmacotherapy requires close attention to the delicate balance between reducing the risk of ischemic events and minimizing bleeding risk. A critical review of the 2007 guidelines in these areas and new clinical data with currently available and soon-to-be-approved antiplatelet agents are presented.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular disease [^6b6e588a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for those at high risk and those with established cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To quantify the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to standard long-term aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and those with established cardiovascular disease.

Search Strategy

The searches have been updated: CENTRAL (Issue 3 2009), MEDLINE (2002 to September 2009) and EMBASE (2002 to September 2009).

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials comparing long term use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in patients with coronary disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable angina, heart failure, revascularizations, major and minor bleeding, and all adverse events were collected. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel).

Main Results

No new studies were identified from the updated searches. A total of two RCTs were found: the CHARISMA and the CURE study. The CURE study enrolled only patients with a recent non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. The use of clopidogrel plus aspirin, compared with placebo plus aspirin, was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; P < 0.01) and a higher risk of major bleeding (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.57; P < 0.01). Overall, we would expect 13 cardiovascular events to be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination, but 6 major bleeds would be caused. In the CURE trial, for every 1000 people treated, 23 events would be avoided and 10 major bleeds would be caused. In the CHARISMA trial, for every 1000 people treated, 5 cardiovascular events would be avoided and 3 major bleeds would be caused.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin is associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events and an increased risk of bleeding compared with aspirin alone. Only in patients with acute non-ST coronary syndrome benefits outweigh harms.

### Aspirin therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis [^4be90980]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

Optimal dose of aspirin — low-dose effectiveness: Placebo-controlled randomized trials have shown that aspirin is an effective antithrombotic agent when used long term in doses ranging between 50 and 100 mg/d, and there are data to suggest that it is effective in doses as low as 30 mg/d. At a dose of 75 mg/d, aspirin was shown to (1) reduce the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or death in patients with unstable angina or chronic stable angina, (2) reduce the risk of stroke or death in patients with transient cerebral ischemia, and (3) reduce the risk of stroke after carotid endarterectomy. In the European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS)-2, aspirin 25 mg bid reduced the risk of stroke and the composite outcome of stroke or death in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). In the European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythemia vera trial, aspirin (100 mg/d) was effective in preventing thrombotic complications in patients with polycythemia vera, even in the face of higher-than-normal platelet counts.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in persons with diabetes and multiple risk factors [^fe335bce]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Aspirin is still on the medication list of a new patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and no history of clinically evident cardiovascular (CV) disease. According to the National Health Interview Survey, about 29 million patients who do not have CV disease take aspirin daily for prevention — and 6.6 million do so without a health care provider recommendation. All of these patients endorse the aspirin use despite the announcement in August 2018 about two clinical trials that found aspirin offered few benefits for healthy adults and might even raise their risk of bleeding, namely the ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events)and the ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes). Notably, a large proportion of patients in both studies were taking statins and antihypertensive drugs, and only a small proportion were current smokers.

Research in context

These new studies push the pendulum away from aspirin prophylaxis for primary prevention. However, in our view, differences between benefits and harms are likely to be a razor thin, as balancing one adverse CV event against one bleeding event is not straightforward. For example, an episode of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is more lethal than a minimally symptomatic gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas some bleeding events, such as severe intracranial haemorrhages, are more lethal than some ischemic CV events, such as episodes of stable or unstable angina. Prospectively, we cannot predict which of those outcomes would apply to any given patient and to any given sex. The role of aspirin in primary prevention has, therefore, become increasingly uncertain and many important questions remain unsolved.

The first question is whether aspirin is reducing the incidence of STEMI, which is the most serious and catastrophic clinical manifestation of coronary heart disease (CHD). Relying on the generic outcome of "myocardial infarction" to ascertain a benefit from aspirin use might be challenging, as reduction in short-term case fatality rates for myocardial infarction in US appears to be driven by a decreased incidence of STEMI. Shifting the mode of initial presentations of CHD from STEMI to non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) or to stable angina, may reduce the overall patient risk and ultimately CV mortality.

This article discusses platelet active drugs as part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. New data on antiplatelet agents include the following: (1) the role of aspirin in primary prevention has been the subject of recommendations based on the assessment of cardiovascular risk; (2) an increasing number of reports suggest a substantial interindividual variability in the response to antiplatelet agents, and various phenomena of "resistance" to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and clopidogrel; (3) the benefit/risk profile of currently available glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists is substantially uncertain for patients with acute coronary syndromes who are not routinely scheduled for early revascularization; (4) there is an expanding role for the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in the long-term management of high-risk patients; and (5) the cardiovascular effects of selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been the subject of increasing attention.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^f6bbad4e]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs) are defined as a range of clinical presentations or syndromes that arise due to structural and/or functional alterations related to chronic diseases of the coronary arteries and/or microcirculation. While chronic coronary diseases are often stable for long periods, they are progressive and may suddenly develop into acute coronary syndromes.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of CCS have been updated based on changing epidemiology, diagnostic and risk prediction strategies, risk classification, and new evidence in the field for CCS, as well as medical therapy landscapes. One of the notable updates to the guidelines concerns the recommendation for low-dose aspirin in patients without prior myocardial infarction or revascularization but with evidence of significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This recommendation has been upgraded from class IIb in 2019 to class Ib in 2024.

The key pathological mechanism underlying most epicardial CAD is atherosclerosis, a complex process that develops over many years and even decades before stenosis. The degree of stenosis was traditionally used to assess an individual's cardiovascular (CV) risk and determine whether the patient requires preventive therapy. Obstructive coronary stenoses have typically been defined using visual thresholds of either 50% or 70% stenosis, and stenosis of ≥ 50% is usually an indication for secondary prevention level therapy.

However, increasing evidence demonstrates that both nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, detected by coronary computed tomography angiography, confer an increased long-term risk of major adverse CV events and mortality. In fact, atherosclerotic plaque burden, and not stenosis per se, appears to be the main predictor of CV events over a mid-term time horizon. Atherosclerotic plaque burden can be determined in a number of ways, including coronary computed tomography angiography, the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, and carotid ultrasound. Aspirin is of particular interest since in guidelines it generally remains in the "obstructive CAD" paradigm as opposed to the "plaque burden" paradigm. However, we believe that the quantification of plaque burden can help individualize the allocation of aspirin.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^b5ba2181]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone for the prevention of atherothrombotic events [^51891451]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study CHARISMA was published by Bhatt DL and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the CHARISMA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of combination of clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with high-risk for atherothrombotic events? In the CHARISMA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHARISMA study, the population was: 15603 patients (4644 female, 10959 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of oral antithrombotic medications or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on a long-term basis, recent acute coronary syndrome, or requirement of clopidogrel after revascularization procedure. In the CHARISMA study, the interventions were: n = 7802 clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75–162 mg/day) n = 7801 aspirin (aspirin 75–162 mg/day plus matching placebo). In the CHARISMA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (6.8% vs. 7.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). In the CHARISMA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalizations for ischemic events (16.7% vs. 17.9%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) No significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, in patients with multiple risk factors (6.6% vs. 5.5%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.59). In the CHARISMA study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in severe bleeding (1.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.09; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97–1.61). In the CHARISMA study, the conclusion was: in patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events, clopidogrel and aspirin were not superior to aspirin with respect to myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

Baseline risk estimation after ACS — Because baseline risks vary widely, control group risks are taken from Clopidogrel In Unstable Angina To Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) when aspirin is the control and from Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) when aspirin and clopidogrel constitute the control group; CURE and PLATO were selected because they were large, simple trials that used accepted definitions for both vascular and bleeding events and included a large proportion of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization/PCI, reflecting current practice in high-income countries.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^8ebb971d]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

### USPSTF recommends against initiating aspirin for… [^fa1d669c]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Should primary care clinicians recommend low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults 60 years or older. Bottom Line In this updated review, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The USPSTF recommends shared decision-making regarding the initiation of low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 40 to 59 years of age with a 10% or greater risk of CVD and without an increased risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include older age, history of peptic ulcer disease, alcoholism, liver disease, long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or steroid use, and anticoagulant therapy.

Synopsis The USPSTF found adequate evidence that low-dose aspirin used for the primary prevention of CVD reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events. There is no high-quality evidence, however, that low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality. Evidence remains uncertain for a benefit of reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. Potential harms include a significant risk of major bleeding events, with increasing risk proportional to increasing age. New recommendations include considering aspirin for high-risk individuals at 40 years of age instead of 50 and no longer recommending aspirin for primary prevention in adults 60 years or older. For patients already taking aspirin or choosing to start taking aspirin, the USPSTF recommends stopping aspirin at approximately 75 years of age.

The American Heart Association recommends shared decision-making regarding the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in high-risk adults 40 to 70 years of age who do not have an increased risk of bleeding. A previous Top 20 POEM found that there was no net cardiovascular benefit and no effect on cancer incidence or mortality in four of the most recent large trials performed in an era of better cardiovascular risk factor management and screening for colorectal cancer.

### Role of antiplatelet drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events [^76a42f10]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet drugs have an established place in the prevention of vascular events in a variety of clinical conditions, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Both European and American guidelines recommend the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with established coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic disease. In high-risk patients, such as those with post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and in patients with stable or unstable angina, peripheral arterial occlusive disease or atrial fibrillation, antiplatelet treatment may reduce the risk of a serious cardiovascular event by approximately 25%, including reduction of non-fatal myocardial infarction by 1/6, non-fatal stroke by 1/4 and cardiovascular death by 1/6. Some data indicate that antiplatelet drugs may also have a role in primary prevention. In people who are aged over 65 years, or have hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, obesity or familial history of myocardial infarction at young age, aspirin may reduce both cardiovascular deaths and total cardiovascular events. Aspirin has been studied and used most extensively. It may exert its beneficial effect not only by acting on platelets, but also by other mechanisms, such as preventing thromboxane A2 (TXA2)-induced vasoconstriction or reducing inflammation. Indeed, experimental data show that low-dose aspirin may suppress vascular inflammation and thereby increase the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. Moreover, in human studies, aspirin seems to be most effective in those with elevated C-reactive protein levels. Vascular events, however, do occur despite aspirin administration. This may be due to platelet activation by pathways not blocked by aspirin, intake of drugs that interfere with aspirin effect or aspirin resistance. In the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel vs. Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) study, long-term clopidogrel administered to patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease was more effective than aspirin in reducing the combined risk of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. In the setting of coronary stenting, a double regimen including aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel has proved more effective in the prevention of in-stent thrombosis than aspirin alone.

### Short-and long-term oral antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention [^c881f141]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Platelets play a central role in both the short- and long-term manifestations of atherothrombosis. In acute coronary syndrome (ACS), there is a steep rise in cardiovascular events early, followed by an incremental rise in cardiovascular events over the long term. This long-term event rate is related to persistent platelet activation and thrombin generation. There is therefore a need to optimize both short- and long-term oral antiplatelet and antithrombotic strategies. The benefits of aspirin therapy, when administered early and continued over the long term, were demonstrated in several early randomized trials. The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration found a 46% reduction in vascular events with antiplatelet therapy (mostly aspirin). However, despite treatment with aspirin and proven therapies, recurrent events remain high. The adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, inhibit the early steps of platelet activation, degranulation, and release of prothrombotic and inflammatory mediators, while also preventing activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. The Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial demonstrated the benefits of aspirin plus clopidogrel in reducing major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke reduced by 20%, p = 0.00009) in a broad range of patients with ACS when administered early and continued over the long term. The benefits emerge very rapidly after a 300 mg loading dose. For the large number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the CURE trial, there was a substantial risk reduction with clopidogrel pretreatment followed by long-term therapy (p < 0.002). This benefit was present, regardless of whether intervention was performed early or late. The significant benefits of aspirin and clopidogrel persist for the combined efficacy-safety end point of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or life-threatening bleeding when clopidogrel is started early, combined with aspirin and other standard therapies, and continued for up to one year.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^4d01b19a]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years ago, the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration published the first individual participant data (IPD) overview of 145 randomized trials of prolonged antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (vascular events) in various categories of patients. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was 'medium dose' (75–325 mg/day) aspirin, and the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration found no evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium-dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. At about the same time, I published a review article on aspirin as an antiplatelet drug that concluded 'The present recommendation of a single loading dose of 200 to 300 mg followed by a daily dose of 75 to 100 mg is based on findings that this dose is as clinically efficacious as higher doses and is safer than higher doses'. Moreover, I added 'the efficacy of a cheap drug such as aspirin in preventing one fifth to one third of all important cardiovascular events should not discourage the pharmaceutical industry from attempting to develop more effective antithrombotic drugs, since a sizable proportion of these events continue to occur despite currently available therapy'.

During the past 30 years, we have witnessed several developments in the antiplatelet field, including (i) a large number of trials exploring the role of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;(ii) several attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop antiplatelet drugs, more effective and safer than aspirin;(iii) a shift in emphasis from efficacy to safety leading to a strong opinion movement favouring aspirin-free antiplatelet regimens after percutaneous coronary intervention; and (iv) an IPD meta-analysis comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention of coronary events. Moreover, evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other digestive tract) cancer has strengthened, as recently reviewed.

The aim of this article is to revisit the role of aspirin in the prevention of atherothrombosis across the cardiovascular risk continuum, in view of developments in the antiplatelet field. The review will offer a clinical perspective on aspirin's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This will be followed by a detailed discussion of its clinical efficacy and safety (Graphical Abstract).

Current standard-of-care dual oral antiplatelet therapy: benefits and limitations

Aspirin in combination with the thienopyridine clopidogrel is currently available as standard-of-care oral, dual antiplatelet therapy for reducing ischaemic events in patients with atherothrombotic disease. Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor that inhibits platelet activation by blocking TXA 2 production, whereas clopidogrel prevents platelet activation by irreversibly inhibiting the major platelet ADP receptor P2Y 12 (Figure 1). Clinical trials have confirmed the therapeutic benefits of aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing thrombotic events in a broad range of patients with atherothrombotic diseases. The benefits of aspirin have been shown in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and primaryand secondary prevention of vascular events or death. The clinical efficacy of clopidogrel has been shown both as single antiplatelet therapy in high-risk patients with various manifestations of atherosclerotic disease, and in conjunction with aspirin in high-risk patients with ACS, including unstable angina, ST-segment elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (MI), and non-STE (NSTE) MI, or those undergoing PCI. – The third-generation thienopyridine prasugrel, with a faster onset of action than clopidogrel, demonstrated superior efficacy to clopidogrel in the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel (TRITON-TIMI 38) in patients with ACS undergoing PCI.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^42288971]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: For adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use should be an individual one; evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small, and persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit (C recommendation). For adults 60 years or older, the USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD (D recommendation). The target population is adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD who are not at increased risk for bleeding. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

### Identifying and reducing inappropriate aspirin use in primary care [^749194ad]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

The ARRIVE study was conducted in seven countries and assessed the efficacy of aspirin 100 mg daily in reducing the risk of major CV events for patients at moderate risk, defined as the presence of three or more cardiovascular risk factors in men aged 55 or older and women aged 60 or older. The authors found no significant difference in a composite endpoint of MI, stroke, CV death, unstable angina or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) but did find significantly more gastrointestinal bleeding events in the aspirin group. The ASCEND study evaluated patients with diabetes and included both high-risk and low-risk patient groups. Findings from the ASCEND study demonstrated a reduction in CV events but more frequent bleeding events. Lastly, the ASPREE study investigated the utility of aspirin in prolonging the lives of healthy community-dwelling older adults with no history of vascular disease. There was no difference in a composite endpoint of death, the onset of dementia and persistent physical disability, and the study was terminated early. Notably, this population had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, primarily cancer-related death. Though many types of cancer were observed, there was a higher rate of death from colorectal cancer.

In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released updated primary prevention guidelines recommending that providers carefully assess atherosclerotic CVD risk and weigh this against bleeding risk before prescribing aspirin for primary prevention. Furthermore, these guidelines explicitly recommend against low-dose aspirin use for adults aged 70 and older. Though not published at this pilot study initiation, the USPSTF published a draft recommendation in October 2021 encouraging providers to avoid initiating low-dose aspirin for primary CV prevention in patients 60 years and older. In April 2022, the USPSTF published its final recommendations. For adults 40–59 with an ASCVD risk of 10% or greater, aspirin use for primary prevention should be made on a case-by-case basis. For adults aged 60 years and older, aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention of CVD. Based on the supporting evidence used to generate these recommendations, the USPSTF also highlights that while the benefit of aspirin use is cumulative with time, the net benefit becomes smaller with age due to the increased risk of bleeding and suggests that it may be reasonable to discontinue aspirin at age 75 years or older. The Task Force does highlight the need for long-term data assessing the effects of low-dose aspirin on bleeding risk and colorectal cancer risk and mortality.

### What is the role for improved long-term antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention? [^78f18fe7]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary stent placement has replaced balloon angioplasty as the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) method of choice, primarily because of its lower restenosis rate. Compared with aspirin (ASA) monotherapy or ASA plus warfarin, the ticlopidine and ASA combination is superior in reducing thrombotic events after stenting. Clopidogrel plus ASA appears to be at least as effective as ticlopidine and ASA. Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors effectively prevent periprocedural thrombotic complications, but their short duration of action and parenteral dosing don't allow for long-term protection. This review aimed to answer how long after PCI with a stent patients are at risk for recurrent thrombotic events and what the optimal way to prevent them is.

Results

Classically, ASA has been prescribed indefinitely, whereas adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists have been discontinued after 2 to 4 weeks. However, the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial found that long-term dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and ASA was more effective than ASA alone in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those treated with PCI.

Conclusion

Results from additional ongoing studies are needed to clarify the role of long-term dual oral antiplatelet therapy in preventing ischemic events in patients who have undergone PCI.

The Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) study investigated the use of clopidogrel in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes. Clopidogrel treatment led to an impressive 20% relative risk reduction in the composite outcome measure of vascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Increased bleeding and greater requirements for blood transfusions were seen with clopidogrel. The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin represents a major advance in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes.

### The primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^f9191aa4]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

The following chapter devoted to antithrombotic therapy for chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al in this supplement, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) we recommend daily oral aspirin (75–100 mg) [Grade 1A]. For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend clopidogrel, 75 mg/d (Grade 1A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we suggest discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and those with stable CAD and patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we recommend daily aspirin (75–100 mg) as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). We recommend clopidogrel in combination with aspirin for patients experiencing ST-segment elevation (STE) and NSTE-ACS (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel as monotherapy (Grade 1A). For long-term treatment after PCI in patients who receive antithrombotic agents such as clopidogrel or warfarin, we recommend aspirin (75 to 100 mg/d) [Grade 1B]. For patients who undergo bare metal stent placement, we recommend the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1A). We recommend that patients receiving drug-eluting stents (DES) receive aspirin (325 mg/d for 3 months followed by 75–100 mg/d) and clopidogrel 75 mg/d for a minimum of 12 months (Grade 2B). For primary prevention in patients with moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75–100 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1A).

### Discontinuation of low dose aspirin and risk of myocardial infarction: case-control study in UK primary care [^6f162d9f]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Low dose regimens of the antiplatelet agent aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) are a standard treatment for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials has shown that low dose aspirin is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those who have had an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke and those who have stable or unstable angina, peripheral artery disease, or atrial fibrillation. Guidelines recommend long term use of low dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) as an effective antiplatelet regimen for patients with cardiovascular disease, unless contraindicated.

Despite the strong evidence supporting the protective effects of low dose aspirin, discontinuation rates of around 50% have been reported in patients who have been taking this medication for several years. It is therefore of concern that recent discontinuation has been linked to an increase in the risk of ischaemic events and death. Cessation of treatment with oral antiplatelet agents (including aspirin and thienopyridines) has been shown to be an independent predictor of an increase in mortality after acute coronary syndromes, and multivariate analysis has shown an increased risk of transient ischaemic attack in the four weeks after discontinuation of aspirin. Another study of a cohort of patients with acute coronary syndromes found that acute coronary syndrome events occurred on average 10 days after discontinuation of low dose aspirin. A systematic review of the literature to date showed that withdrawal of low dose aspirin is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

All the studies on this topic to date, however, have taken place in secondary care centres. We used a validated primary care database to evaluate the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and of death from coronary heart disease (both as separate end points and as a combined measure) after discontinuation of low dose aspirin in primary care patients taking it as secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^f8a0b028]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent publication by our writing group highlighted a novel category within the CV risk continuum — advanced subclinical atherosclerosis. These asymptomatic patients are at a high risk of CV events due to the presence of substantial underlying subclinical atherosclerosis as determined exclusively by their plaque burden. As such, they are best thought of as distinct from traditional primary prevention (where aspirin has a limited role) and secondary prevention (where aspirin is categorically recommended). For example, patients with CAC > 300 have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events equivalent to patients with known obstructive CAD, even without exploration for degree of coronary stenosis.

If patients with asymptomatic coronary stenosis of 50% are considered to have CCS and, therefore, benefit from low-dose aspirin, then should these recommendations also apply to those with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis who have been demonstrated to have similar event rates? We think the answer is yes. We believe that the concepts of advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and asymptomatic CCS overlap, and the recent guideline regarding the management of asymptomatic CCS with low-dose aspirin can be reasonably extended to advanced subclinical atherosclerosis when there are no bleeding risk factors (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Correlation Between Asymptomatic Chronic Coronary Syndrome, Advanced Subclinical Atherosclerosis, and Low-Dose Aspirin

ACS = acute coronary syndrome; ANOCA = angina with no obstructive CAD; CABG = coronary artery bypass graft; CAC = coronary artery calcium; CAD = coronary artery disease; CCS = chronic coronary syndrome; CCTA = coronary computed tomography angiography; CPS = carotid plaque ultrasound; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; INOCA = ischemia with no obstructive CAD; LV = left ventricular; PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention.

As it is almost never recommended to actively search for obstructive CAD in asymptomatic patients, we propose to consider patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis, determined by any proven method, as having CCS, even if the degree of coronary stenosis has not been evaluated. Moreover, since low-dose aspirin is associated with a risk of bleeding, we recommend weighing the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin therapy and prescribing low-dose aspirin only for patients aged < 70 years who are projected to obtain a clear net clinical benefit from preventive therapy. As such, patients with no detectable atherosclerosis should rarely if ever take aspirin.

### Epidemiological modelling of routine use of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke in those aged ≥ 70 [^c3a2f33f]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the routine use of low dose aspirin in people aged ≥ 70 without overt cardiovascular disease.

Design

Epidemiological modelling in a hypothetical population.

Setting

Reference populations of men and women in the year 2000 from the state of Victoria, Australia.

Subjects

10,000 men and 10,000 women aged 70–74 with no cardiovascular disease.

Main Outcome Measures

First ever myocardial infarction or unstable angina, ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and major gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Health adjusted years of life lived.

Results

The proportional benefit gained from the use of low dose aspirin by the prevention of myocardial infarctions (-389 in men, -321 in women) and ischaemic stroke (-19 in men and -35 in women) is offset by excess gastrointestinal (499 in men, 572 in women) and intracranial (76 in men, 54 in women) bleeding. The results in health adjusted years of life lived (which take into account length and quality of life) are equivocal for aspirin causing net harm or net benefit.

Conclusion

Epidemiological modelling suggests that any benefits of low dose aspirin on risk of cardiovascular disease in people aged ≥ 70 are offset by adverse events. These findings are tempered by wide confidence intervals, indicating that the overall outcome could be beneficial or adverse.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^c248cfa8]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Versus placebo

The clinical efficacy of aspirin as an antithrombotic agent has been evaluated in placebo-controlled RCTs addressing the whole spectrum of atherosclerosis, from apparently healthy, middle-aged, low-risk individuals to patients presenting with acute MI or acute ischaemic stroke. Moreover, aspirin trials have used variable follow-up, from as short as a few weeks to as long as 10 years.

In the Second International Study of Infarct Survival, once-daily dosing with low-dose aspirin (162.5 mg) started within 24 h of the onset of symptoms of a suspected MI produced highly significant reductions in 5 week vascular mortality (the primary endpoint) by 23%, non-fatal reinfarction by 49%, and non-fatal stroke by 46% in over 17 000 patients. Three smaller but longer-term (12 weeks to 2 years) placebo-controlled RCTs in ∼2600 patients with unstable coronary artery disease consistently showed that aspirin therapy (75 to 1300 mg daily) halved the probability of death or MI, independent of the aspirin dose. Two RCTs with a similar protocol, the International Stroke Trialand the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial, randomized approximately 40 000 patients within 48 h of the onset of symptoms of an acute ischaemic stroke to 2 to 4 weeks of daily aspirin therapy (300 and 160 mg, respectively) or placebo and showed more modest reductions in death or non-fatal stroke than reported in acute MI (Figure 6).

Figure 6

The figure is based on an analysis of data from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration. Reproduced from Patrono et al.with permission from the Massachusetts Medical Society

Based on a large number of placebo-controlled RCTs, long-term (2 to 3 year) aspirin therapy confers conclusive net benefit on the risk of subsequent MI, stroke, or vascular death among subjects at high risk of vascular complications (Figure 6). The proportional effects of long-term aspirin therapy on vascular events in these different clinical settings are rather homogeneous, ranging between 20% and 25% odds reduction based on an overview of all RCTs. The absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis in different categories of patients are detailed in Figure 6.

Stable CAD

Aspirin remains the cornerstone for secondary prevention of patients with stable CAD, irrespective of the management strategy. In a large meta-analysis including 16 secondary prevention trials and 17 000 high-risk patients, low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE (cardiovascular (CV) death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)) (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88), a 31% relative risk reduction in MI (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and a 22% relative risk reduction in ischaemic stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), at the expense of an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90) and major extracranial bleeding (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.76). Aspirin marginally reduced CV mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, p = 0.06), resulting in a 10% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, p = 0.02). At variance of the antiplatelet effects, the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin increase at higher doses. The optimal risk:benefit ratio appears to be achieved with an aspirin dosage of 75–150 mg daily.

### Pooled analysis of bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in clinical trials of time-constrained dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention [^bc391352]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Aspirin is established as the first‐choice antiplatelet medication for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease. 1, 2, 3 Because aspirin leads to incomplete antiplatelet inhibition, additional, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with an inhibitor of the platelet P2Y12 receptor is now evidence based. 2, 3 In patients with stable coronary artery disease or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), DAPT for 12 months is recommended in practice guidelines. 4 After discontinuation of DAPT, the options for long‐term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events include monotherapy with either aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor agent.

The CAPRIE (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) trial showed that in 19 185 patients with atherosclerotic disease, including 11 630 with myocardial infarction as the qualifying event, compared with aspirin monotherapy (325 mg per day), clopidogrel monotherapy (75 mg per day) for 1.91 years reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death by 8.7% (95% CI, 0.3–16.5; P = 0.043). 5 There was a treatment interaction by disease subgroup suggesting that the true benefit of clopidogrel was less certain in patients with myocardial infarction (7.4% [−5.2 to 18.6]). On the other hand, severe bleeding was more common with aspirin, notably severe gastrointestinal bleeding (2.66% versus 1.99%; P < 0.05). A meta‐analysis of 9 randomized trials of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy or aspirin for secondary prevention involving 42 108 patients found a borderline risk reduction conferred by P2Y12 inhibitor for myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66–0.99) but no evidence of a between‐group difference in the risks of bleeding or all‐cause mortality. 6 The ongoing ADAPTABLE trial aims to clarify the optimal dose of aspirin (81 or 325 mg, daily) for secondary prevention. 7 To date, no trial has compared aspirin monotherapy versus P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after initial treatment with dual‐antiplatelet therapy for 1/3 months after myocardial infarction.

### Effects of long-term, moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation in addition to aspirin in unstable angina. the organization to assess strategies for ischemic syndromes (OASIS) investigators [^716acae8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to evaluate whether oral anticoagulant (AC) therapy given for five months was superior to standard (control) therapy in patients with unstable angina receiving aspirin.

Background

The long-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) or death remains high in patients with unstable angina, despite the use of aspirin. Therefore, additional treatments are necessary.

Methods

Of the 10,141 patients entering the main trial, 3,712 were randomized 12 to 48 h later to receive oral AC therapy (n = 1,848) or standard therapy (n = 1,864).

Results

One-hundred forty patients (7.6%) suffered from cardiovascular death, MI or stroke while receiving oral AC, compared with 155 patients (8.3%) on standard therapy (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 1.14; p = 0.40). The rates of the primary outcomes plus refractory angina were 16.7% (n = 308) versus 17.5% (n = 327) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.11; p = 0.53). Countries were divided into good or poor compliers (based on the use of oral AC above or below 70% at 35 days), without knowledge of results by country. In good-complier countries, oral AC was discontinued in only 10.4% of patients at seven days and in 23.6% by five months, compared with 27.6% and 44.9%, respectively, in poor complier countries. There were significant reductions in the risks of both the primary (6.1% vs. 8.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95; p = 0.02) and secondary outcomes (11.9% vs. 16.5%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90; p = 0.005) with oral AC in the good-complier countries. There was little difference in the poor-complier countries (9.0% vs. 7.8% for the primary and 21.3% vs. 18.5% for the secondary outcomes, tests for interactions comparing the RRs for the primary and secondary outcomes were p < 0.02 and p = 0.002, respectively, between the two sets of countries). In the overall study, there was an excess of major bleeding (2.7% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.004), which was larger in the good-complier countries (RR 2.71) compared with the poor-complier countries (RR 1.58). There were also reductions in cardiac catheterization (RR 0.80; p = 0.004) and coronary revascularization procedures (RR 0.82; p = 0.06) in the good-complier countries, but not in the poor-complier countries (RR 0.98 and 1.06, respectively, p for interaction of 0.06 and 0.04, respectively).

Conclusions

Overall, oral AC led to a small, nonsignificant reduction in the risk of the primary and secondary outcomes. Stratifying the countries or centers by their rates of compliance to oral AC suggested that good compliance to oral AC could potentially lead to clinically important reductions in major ischemic cardiovascular events.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events [^f663ea3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.

Objectives

To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent.

Search Methods

We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I 2 ≥ 30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence). There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence). Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).

### Aspirin, clopidogrel, and ticagrelor in acute coronary syndromes [^e93bc0d2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Ticagrelor, an oral, direct, reversibly binding, P2Y₁₂ receptor antagonist, is approved for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS. In the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, ticagrelor was associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality compared with clopidogrel. A subanalysis of PLATO trial data identified a geographic region interaction (p = 0.045), indicating reduced efficacy of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in North American patients. This effect could be due to chance, but may be explained by an interaction of ticagrelor with high aspirin doses, which are commonly used in the United States. In patients taking low-dose maintenance aspirin, ticagrelor was more effective than clopidogrel in decreasing cardiovascular events regardless of the geographic region. A proposed hypothetical mechanism for the interaction between ticagrelor and higher aspirin dose is linked to the level of P2Y₁₂ inhibition and the potential prothrombotic effects of high-dose aspirin through the suppression of prostacyclin. A review of data regarding aspirin use for secondary prevention of events in ACS demonstrated that low aspirin doses (75 to 160 mg/day) are consistently favored for short- and long-term use because of the lack of a dose-response relationship between increasing aspirin dose and improved efficacy, and a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding with increasing aspirin dose. The use of low aspirin doses reflects good clinical practice and is encouraged in current guidelines.

Antiplatelet Therapy

Primary Prevention

Aspirin

Unlike secondary prevention, data regarding the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is equivocal. Most early data came from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, which evaluated 95 456 patients from 6 clinical trials. Treatment with aspirin was associated with a small reduction in serious vascular events but carried a small increase in the rates of major gastrointestinal and extracranial bleeding. More recently, other studies have called into question the value of aspirin in primary prevention. – Finding an appropriate balance between preventing vascular events and exposing individuals to an increased bleeding risk with aspirin therapy remains an area of active research.

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend the use of low‐dose aspirin for primary prevention, as listed in Table 3. Because guideline recommendations and data vary, –, treatment with aspirin should be individualized based on the patient's risk–benefit profile.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin (81 mg; 75–100 mg) to reduce atherosclerotic events in patients with chronic coronary disease without any indications for OAC therapy.

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^8bbdafcf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

There was a high rate of dose switching and treatment discontinuation in our study, which occurred more often in patients randomized to high‐dose aspirin compared with low‐dose aspirin. This may have been driven in part by the publication of the 2016 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association focused update on the duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease, while recruitment in ADAPTABLE was still ongoing. In this focused update, low‐dose aspirin received a class I recommendation for secondary prevention, especially in patients receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor. Although the guidelines acknowledged that the recommendation was based on moderate‐quality evidence from nonrandomized studies and that the ongoing ADAPTABLE will provide additional evidence on this question, the strong recommendation in favor of low‐dose aspirin may have contributed to a higher rate of dose switching and treatment discontinuation in patients randomized to high‐dose aspirin. However, the higher rate of dose switching and treatment discontinuation in patients receiving high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin was similar regardless of whether patients were also receiving treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor.

It is also important to highlight that ADAPTABLE was a large demonstration project for pragmatic randomized controlled trials within the Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Network. The trial used novel electronic methods to identify and recruit a large and diverse group of participants with ASCVD, streamlined informed consent and randomization, and leveraged data collected in the electronic health record, public and private insurance claims, and self‐reported data from patients for identifying clinical events. Although the pragmatic design enabled us to achieve efficiency, it also provided important lessons that have implications for future design of pragmatic trials. In particular, there was substantial crossover and dose switching, which likely occurred because of the shifting equipoise between low‐ versus high‐dose aspirin. However, it remains unknown whether closer follow‐up, similar to a traditional trial, would have avoided this.

### Advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and low-dose aspirin: guideline-based extension into asymptomatic chronic coronary syndromes [^1f414e71]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

To some, our recommendations may not seem new or may seem obvious. But for too long, guidelines have been arbitrarily placed into 2 distinct buckets — primary and secondary prevention. The CCS concept is consistent with our approach to coronary risk as a continuum, best expressed by the degree of atherosclerotic plaque (Figure 1). The concept of advanced subclinical atherosclerosis can remove some of the ambiguity around the appropriate use of aspirin, which has both benefits and harms and is probably best thought of as removed from the strict primary vs secondary prevention dichotomy.

In conclusion, the modern understanding of coronary risk has led to the merging of the concepts of advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and asymptomatic obstructive CAD. As such, we believe that advanced subclinical atherosclerosis is part of the asymptomatic CCS as described by the ESC guidelines. Therefore, the new ESC recommendations for the use of lifelong low-dose aspirin in patients with asymptomatic CCS but with evidence of CAD on imaging should probably apply to many or even most patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis. In fact, modeling studies suggest that the tipping point for net aspirin benefit is CAC > 100 or moderate plaque on carotid ultrasound (carotid plaque score of 2 or greater) in the absence of bleeding risk factors. Future prevention and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association CCS guidelines should consider these criteria for more specific and individualized aspirin use in practice.

### A pathophysiologic primary prevention review of aspirin administration to prevent cardiovascular thrombosis [^2d1aa675]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease is the leading metabolic cause of mortality in the United States. Among current therapies, low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce cardiovascular thrombosis. However, aspirin also causes major complications (hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding). The American Heart Association recommends that aspirin only be prescribed for "high-risk" individuals. No guidelines are available as to the duration of aspirin therapy.

Methods

A reasonable approach to aspirin administration is to determine the appropriateness of aspirin therapy based on the pathophysiology of coronary artery thrombosis. It suggests that the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score be used as the basis for determining "high risk". This score was shown to accurately predict future cardiovascular events. The greater the CAC score, the greater the extent of coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque and future cardiovascular risk.

Results

A CAC score > 400 places an individual at very-high 10-year risk for an atherosclerotic event. Since aggressive medical therapy initiates stabilization of unstable atherosclerotic plaques within 1 month and reversal within 2 years, this treatment significantly reduces the risk of the individual for a cardiovascular event. Thus, most individuals aged < 75 years with a CAC score of > 400 should receive aspirin therapy for a maximum of 2 years.

Conclusion

Utilization of a CAC score greatly simplifies the decision of whom to treat with aspirin and for what duration. Importantly, focusing on two factors (hemorrhage and plaque stabilization) is easily understood by both the physician and the patient.

Aspirin use — primary prevention of ASCVD: Low‑dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults 40 to 70 years of age who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding risk (COR IIb, LOE A). Low‑dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered on a routine basis for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults > 70 years of age (COR III: Harm, LOE B‑R). Low‑dose aspirin (75–100 mg orally daily) should not be administered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding (COR III: Harm, LOE C‑LD).

### Aspirin, warfarin, or the combination for secondary prevention of coronary events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and prior coronary artery bypass surgery [^0526661f]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and prior CABG are at high risk of a recurrent ischemic event despite aspirin therapy. This trial investigated the potential benefit of secondary prevention with warfarin.

Methods and Results

In a double-blind randomized trial, 135 patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, with prior CABG, and who were poor candidates for a revascularization procedure received therapy with aspirin and placebo+warfarin, warfarin and placebo+aspirin, or aspirin and warfarin for 12 months. Warfarin was titrated to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 2.5. The primary end point (death or myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization 1 year after randomization) occurred in 14.6% of the patients in the warfarin-alone group, in 11.5% of patients in the aspirin-alone group, and in 11.3% of patients randomized to the combination therapy (P = 0.76). Subgroup analyses by risk features provided no indications that warfarin alone or in combination with aspirin could be of benefit over aspirin alone. Bleeding was more frequent in the 2 groups of patients administered warfarin.

Conclusions

Moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation alone or combined with low-dose aspirin does not appear to be superior to low-dose aspirin in the prevention of recurrent ischemic events in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes and previous CABG.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy in cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease [^dabe79ad]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Atherothrombosis is a pathophysiologic process that results in clinical ischemic events affecting the cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial circulation. Antiplatelet agents, used alone or in combination, are effective in preventing recurrent vascular events among individuals with established vascular disease.

Objective

To summarize the current state of evidence regarding oral antiplatelet treatment in patients with cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and peripheral arterial disease.

Evidence Acquisition

Using the key terms acute coronary syndrome, atherothrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, MI, peripheral arterial disease, TIA, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, aspirin, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, and clopidogrel, we searched the MEDLINE database as well as the trial register of the Cochrane Groups to identify studies published from 1960 to August 2004. We manually searched journals and abstract booklets; scrutinized reference lists of trials and review articles; and reviewed meta-analyses, scientific statements, and guidelines from official societies.

Evidence Synthesis

Appropriate oral first-line antiplatelet therapy is aspirin for individuals with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; aspirin or clopidogrel for those with TIA or stroke, chronic stable angina, or peripheral arterial disease; and aspirin combined with clopidogrel for those with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. Aspirin combined with dipyridamole is a possible alternative for patients who experience a first episode of TIA or stroke in the absence of clinically apparent CAD. Although ticlopidine has been shown to be of benefit in various vascular conditions, its adverse-effect profile has limited its use.

Conclusions

Aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, aspirin combined with clopidogrel, and aspirin combined with dipyridamole are effective in preventing recurrent vascular events among various subgroups of patients with vascular disease. Current clinical trial evidence favors the use of aspirin or clopidogrel as first-line agents for the majority of patients with vascular disease. Clinical trials evaluating combination antiplatelet therapies will direct future practice.

Nevertheless, rates of life-threatening bleeding (2.1% vs 1.8%, p = 0.13), including fatal bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke, were similar between the two treatment groups.

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^08a141da]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background The ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient-Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long-Term Effectiveness) was a large, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial that found no difference between high- versus low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Whether concomitant P2Y12 inhibitor therapy modifies the effect of aspirin dose on clinical events remains unclear. Methods and Results Participants in ADAPTABLE were stratified according to baseline use of clopidogrel or prasugrel (P2Y12 group). The primary effectiveness end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and the primary safety end point was major bleeding requiring blood transfusions. We used multivariable Cox regression to compare the relative effectiveness and safety of aspirin dose within P2Y12 and non-P2Y12 groups. Of 13815 (91.6%) participants with available data, 3051 (22.1%) were receiving clopidogrel (2849 [93.4%]) or prasugrel (203 [6.7%]) at baseline. P2Y12 inhibitor use was associated with higher risk of the primary effectiveness end point (10.86% versus 6.31%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.22–1.62]) but was not associated with bleeding (0.95% versus 0.53%; adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.91–2.22]). We found no interaction in the relative effectiveness and safety of high- versus low-dose aspirin by P2Y12 inhibitor use. Overall, dose switching or discontinuation was more common in the high-dose compared with low-dose aspirin group, but the pattern was not modified by P2Y12 inhibitor use. Conclusions In this prespecified analysis of ADAPTABLE, we found that the relative effectiveness and safety of high- versus low-dose aspirin was not modified by baseline P2Y12 inhibitor use.

### Double-dose versus standard-dose clopidogrel and high-dose versus low-dose aspirin in individuals undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes (CURRENT-OASIS 7): a randomised factorial trial [^87a21b81]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel and aspirin are the most commonly used antiplatelet therapies for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We assessed the effect of various clopidogrel and aspirin regimens in prevention of major cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis in patients undergoing PCI.

Methods

The CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial was undertaken in 597 centres in 39 countries. 25,086 individuals with acute coronary syndromes and intended early PCI were randomly assigned to double-dose (600 mg on day 1, 150 mg on days 2–7, then 75 mg daily) versus standard-dose (300 mg on day 1 then 75 mg daily) clopidogrel, and high-dose (300–325 mg daily) versus low-dose (75–100 mg daily) aspirin. Randomisation was done with a 24 h computerised central automated voice response system. The clopidogrel dose comparison was double-blind and the aspirin dose comparison was open label with blinded assessment of outcomes. This prespecified analysis is of the 17,263 individuals who underwent PCI. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 30 days. Analyses were by intention to treat, adjusted for propensity to undergo PCI. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00335452.

Findings

8560 patients were assigned to double-dose and 8703 to standard-dose clopidogrel (8558 and 8702 completed 30-day follow-up, respectively), and 8624 to high-dose and 8639 to low-dose aspirin (8622 and 8638 completed 30-day follow-up, respectively). Compared with the standard dose, double-dose clopidogrel reduced the rate of the primary outcome (330 events [3·9%] vs 392 events [4·5%]; adjusted hazard ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·74–0·99, p = 0·039) and definite stent thrombosis (58 [0·7%] vs 111 [1·3%]; 0·54 [0·39–0·74], p = 0·0001). High-dose and low-dose aspirin did not differ for the primary outcome (356 [4·1%] vs 366 [4·2%]; 0·98, 0·84–1·13, p = 0·76). Major bleeding was more common with double-dose than with standard-dose clopidogrel (139 [1·6%] vs 99 [1·1%]; 1·41, 1·09–1·83, p = 0·009) and did not differ between high-dose and low-dose aspirin (128 [1·5%] vs 110 [1·3%]; 1·18, 0·92–1·53, p = 0·20).

Interpretation

In patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndromes, a 7-day double-dose clopidogrel regimen was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis compared with the standard dose. Efficacy and safety did not differ between high-dose and low-dose aspirin. A double-dose clopidogrel regimen can be considered for all patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with an early invasive strategy and intended early PCI.

### Clopidogrel does not suppress blood markers of coagulation activation in aspirin-treated patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^4b52daaa]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

The Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) Study demonstrated that clopidogrel plus aspirin was superior to aspirin alone for prevention of recurrent vascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of these two regimens on biochemical markers of platelet and coagulation activation.

Methods and Results

We studied 485 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who were randomized to clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily) or placebo for a period of 3–12 months. All patients also received aspirin (recommended dose 75–325 mg daily). Blood levels of P-selectin, prothrombin fragment F1.2, D-dimer, and von Willebrand factor were measured at baseline, day 7 (or hospital discharge), and at day 30 after randomization. Patients receiving clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone had similar baseline geometric mean plasma levels of P-selectin (50.2 vs 51.7 ng.ml(-1), P = 0.45), prothrombin fragment F1.2 (1.13 vs 1.12 nmol.l(-1), P = 0.94), D-dimer (467 vs 460 ng.ml(-1), P = 0.85), and von Willebrand factor levels (1.89 vs 1.85 U.ml(-1), P = 0.59) and there also were no significant differences at day 7, or day 30. However, compared with baseline, there was a significant rise in prothrombin fragment F1.2 at day 7 (from 1.12 to 1.39 nmol.l(-1), P < 0.0001) and day 30 (from 1.12 to 1.44 nmol.l(-1), P < 0.0001), and D-dimer at day 7 (from 464 to 539 nmol.l(-1), P < 0.0001) and day 30 (from 464 to 576 nmol.l(-1), P < 0.0001). The magnitude of this rise appeared to be greatest in patients who experienced the primary outcome, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or refractory ischaemia by the end of the study. P-selectin levels were not elevated at any time point but von Willebrand factor values were elevated at baseline and remained elevated at days 7 and 30.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that the clinical benefits of clopidogrel are not associated with a parallel reduction in markers of coagulation activation. Early suppression of coagulation markers most likely reflects the effects of heparin. The persistence of thrombin generation despite long-term clopidogrel and aspirin therapy suggests that even more intensive antithrombotic therapy may be required in these patients.

### The platelet in diabetes: focus on prevention of ischemic events [^2e593c8e]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Accelerated atherosclerosis and the increased risk of thrombotic vascular events in diabetes may result from dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperreactivity, an impaired fibrinolytic balance, and abnormal blood flow. There is also a correlation between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular (CV) events. The importance of platelets in the atherothrombotic process has led to investigation of using antiplatelet agents to reduce CV risk. A meta-analysis conducted by the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration demonstrated that aspirin reduced the risk of ischemic vascular events as a secondary prevention strategy in numerous high-risk groups, including patients with diabetes. Based on results from placebo-controlled randomized trials, the American Diabetes Association recommends low-dose enteric-coated aspirin as a primary prevention strategy for people with diabetes at high risk for CV events. Clopidogrel is recommended if aspirin allergy is present. There is occasionally a need for an alternative to aspirin or for additive antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin in low doses inhibits thromboxane production by platelets but has little to no effect on other sites of platelet reactivity. Agents such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel inhibit ADP-induced platelet activation, whereas the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa complex receptor antagonists block activity at the fibrinogen binding site on the platelet. These agents appear to be useful in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. A combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin was more effective than placebo plus standard therapy (including aspirin) in reducing a composite CV outcome in patients with unstable angina and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. In a meta-analysis of six trials in diabetic patients with ACSs, intravenous GpIIb-IIIa inhibitors reduced 30-day mortality when compared with control subjects. Results from controlled prospective clinical trials justify the use of enteric-coated low-dose aspirin (81–325 mg) as a primary or secondary prevention strategy in adult diabetic individuals (aged > 30 years) at high risk for CV events. Recent studies support the use of clopidogrel in addition to standard therapy, as well as the use of GpIIb-IIIa inhibitors in ACS patients.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e8eef82b]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on long-term administration of antithrombotic drugs designed for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including two new antiplatelet therapies.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

We present 23 recommendations for pertinent clinical questions. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) in patients aged > 50 years over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). For patients with established coronary artery disease, defined as patients 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome, with prior revascularization, coronary stenoses > 50% by coronary angiogram, and/or evidence for cardiac ischemia on diagnostic testing, we recommend long-term low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). For patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, we recommend for the first year dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor 90 mg bid, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, or prasugrel 10 mg/d over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, we recommend aspirin (75–325 mg/d) and clopidogrel for a minimum duration of 1 month (bare-metal stents) or 3 to 6 months (drug-eluting stents) (Grade 1A). We suggest continuing low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months for all stents (Grade 2C). Thereafter, we recommend single antiplatelet therapy over continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for patients with established coronary artery disease. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 1 year is warranted.

### Stroke and the statistics of the aspirin / clopidogrel secondary prevention trials [^a7a945af]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Four randomized trials have investigated the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin for secondary prevention of vascular outcomes in 54,949 patients. Here we argue that attempts to translate the results of these trials into clinical practice have proven frustrating because of the following statistical considerations: differences in study populations and study design make comparisons difficult (comparisons of 'apples and oranges'), incomplete factorial designs prevent proper contrasts (examining 'bits and pieces' of a larger picture), results concern widely different vascular diseases ('puzzling subgroups'), and negative results are easily misinterpreted.

Recent Findings

Between 1996 and 2004 three major randomized trials assessed combinations of aspirin and clopidogrel, finding: Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) in favor of clopidogrel alone versus aspirin alone, Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) in favor of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone, and Management of Atherothombosis with Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients (MATCH) in favor of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus clopidogrel alone. A recently completed fourth trial (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management and Avoidance; CHARISMA) was a 'negative study' comparing aspirin alone to aspirin plus clopidogrel.

Summary

Even after four large randomized trials we still do not know the optimal treatment for secondary prevention of stroke. We suggest that subsequent trials should focus on a particular vascular disease and test hypotheses that relate to a specific mechanism.

Methods

Because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this study, requests to access the data set from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to Dr Schuyler Jones at Duke University.

Study Design and Population

The details of the study design have been published previously. Briefly, ADAPTABLE was an open‐label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial that randomized 15 076 patients (40 clinical centers and 1 private health insurance plan) with established ASCVD to 81 versus 325 mg aspirin and compared the risk of MACEs (primary effectiveness end point) and major bleeding events (primary safety end point). Patients were eligible if they had a history of MI, coronary revascularization, coronary angiography demonstrating ≥ 75% stenosis of at least 1 epicardial coronary artery, or chronic coronary artery disease with a least 1 risk enrichment factor. Current treatment with clopidogrel or prasugrel was permitted, but ticagrelor was not permitted because of the black box warning on use of high‐dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor. Similarly, patients receiving oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) were also excluded. A computable phenotype query was executed at each site to identify patients eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants were invited to participate in the study using a combination of low‐touch (eg, letters, emails, and telephone calls) and high‐touch (eg, during in‐person visits) approaches. All patients provided electronic informed consent, and the institutional review boards at all participating centers approved the study.

Aspirin Trials

Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

In clinical trials of subjects with TIA due to fibrin platelet emboli or ischemic stroke, aspirin has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of the combined endpoint of stroke or death and the combined endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death by about 13 to18%.

Prevention of Recurrent MI and Unstable Angina Pectoris

These indications are supported by the results of six large, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials of predominantly male post-MI subjects and one randomized placebo-controlled study of men with unstable angina pectoris. Aspirin therapy in MI subjects was associated with a significant reduction (about 20%) in the risk of the combined endpoint of subsequent death and/or nonfatal reinfarction in these patients. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the event rate was reduced to 5% from the 10% rate in the placebo group.

Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris

In a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial designed to assess the role of aspirin for prevention of MI in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, aspirin significantly reduced the primary combined endpoint of nonfatal MI, fatal MI, and sudden death by 34%. The secondary endpoint for vascular events (first occurrence of MI, stroke, or vascular death) was also significantly reduced (32%).

Revascularization Procedures

Most patients who undergo coronary artery revascularization procedures have already had symptomatic coronary artery disease for which aspirin is indicated. Similarly, patients with lesions of the carotid bifurcation sufficient to require carotid endarterectomy are likely to have had a precedent event. Aspirin is recommended for patients who undergo revascularization procedures if there is a preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated.

### Collaborative meta-analysis of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy for prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in high risk patients [^0686b048]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of antiplatelet therapy among patients at high risk of occlusive vascular events.

Design

Collaborative meta-analyses (systematic overviews).

Inclusion Criteria

Randomised trials of an antiplatelet regimen versus control or of one antiplatelet regimen versus another in high risk patients (with acute or previous vascular disease or some other predisposing condition) from which results were available before September 1997. Trials had to use a method of randomisation that precluded prior knowledge of the next treatment to be allocated and comparisons had to be unconfounded-that is, have study groups that differed only in terms of antiplatelet regimen.

Studies Reviewed

287 studies involving 135 000 patients in comparisons of antiplatelet therapy versus control and 77 000 in comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens.

Main Outcome Measure

"Serious vascular event": non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death.

Results

Overall, among these high risk patients, allocation to antiplatelet therapy reduced the combined outcome of any serious vascular event by about one quarter; non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one third, non-fatal stroke by one quarter, and vascular mortality by one sixth (with no apparent adverse effect on other deaths). Absolute reductions in the risk of having a serious vascular event were 36 (SE 5) per 1000 treated for two years among patients with previous myocardial infarction; 38 (5) per 1000 patients treated for one month among patients with acute myocardial infarction; 36 (6) per 1000 treated for two years among those with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack; 9 (3) per 1000 treated for three weeks among those with acute stroke; and 22 (3) per 1000 treated for two years among other high risk patients (with separately significant results for those with stable angina (P = 0.0005), peripheral arterial disease (P = 0.004), and atrial fibrillation (P = 0.01)). In each of these high risk categories, the absolute benefits substantially outweighed the absolute risks of major extracranial bleeding. Aspirin was the most widely studied antiplatelet drug, with doses of 75–150 mg daily at least as effective as higher daily doses. The effects of doses lower than 75 mg daily were less certain. Clopidogrel reduced serious vascular events by 10% (4%) compared with aspirin, which was similar to the 12% (7%) reduction observed with its analogue ticlopidine. Addition of dipyridamole to aspirin produced no significant further reduction in vascular events compared with aspirin alone. Among patients at high risk of immediate coronary occlusion, short term addition of an intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist to aspirin prevented a further 20 (4) vascular events per 1000 (P < 0.0001) but caused 23 major (but rarely fatal) extracranial bleeds per 1000.

Conclusions

Aspirin (or another oral antiplatelet drug) is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those with an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, unstable or stable angina, previous myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebral ischaemia, peripheral arterial disease, or atrial fibrillation. Low dose aspirin (75–150 mg daily) is an effective antiplatelet regimen for long term use, but in acute settings an initial loading dose of at least 150 mg aspirin may be required. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefits in some clinical circumstances, but more research into this strategy is needed.

### Age and aspirin dosing in secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^b0e86a30]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The antiplatelet agent aspirin is recommended in secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in most patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). It exerts its antithrombotic effect by inhibiting the platelet COX (cyclooxygenase)‐1 enzyme, thereby increasing the risk of bleeding and of gastric mucosal toxicity. In the ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient‐Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long‐Term Effectiveness) randomized trial, daily aspirin doses of 81 mg or 325 mg were associated with similar risks of ischemic events in patients with established ASCVD and with a similar safety profile in terms of bleeding. However, adherence to the 325 mg dose was lower.

Increasing age is associated with a higher risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal toxicity with antiplatelet therapy, and has been identified as a criterion to define high bleeding risk in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). On the other hand, the risk of atherothrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with established ASCVD is proportional to age. Because increasing age is concurrently associated with heightened risks of ischemic and bleeding events, understanding whether the aspirin dose optimizing net clinical benefits (ischemic and bleeding risks) in secondary prevention is influenced by age would have important clinical implications. Indeed, if the balance between ischemic risk reduction and bleeding risk augmentation with different doses of aspirin varies according to age, tailoring aspirin dose based on age could improve outcomes. Moreover, aspirin bioavailability may vary according to age because age‐related physiological changes can increase (lower hepatic blood flow, delayed gastric emptying) or decrease (increase in gastric pH) drug concentration.,

Polypharmacy, a risk factor for nonadherence, is widely prevalent in the aging population, but the effect of age on adherence is inconsistent in the literature., The importance of appropriate drug adherence on clinical outcomes has been determined in multiple disease states, including in ASCVD. However, the interplay between age, adherence to different aspirin doses in secondary prevention of ASCVD, and clinical outcomes has not been explored before.

The objectives of this study are to determine the impact of daily doses of aspirin 81 mg versus 325 mg on clinical outcomes according to age and to explore the interplay between age and adherence to aspirin in patients with established ASCVD.

### Non-inferiority trials in cardiology: what clinicians need to know [^bd776c32]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Superiority trials

Traditionally, investigators aim to demonstrate a new treatment is better than standard treatment or placebo in clinical trials. There have been landmark trials evaluating treatment of a wide range of conditions. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) trialdemonstrated that warfarin was more effective than placebo in stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trialshowed that accelerated tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) offered survival benefits over standard-dose TPA and streptokinase in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trialdemonstrated the superiority of clopidogrel and aspirin over aspirin alone in non-STEMI. More recently, Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trialshowed that evolocumab was better than placebo in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular diseases.

The null hypothesis in superiority trials is that the new treatment is not better than standard treatment/placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that the new treatment is better than standard treatment/placebo. If results of the trial are statistically significant, the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis accepted. If the results are not statistically significant, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trialhypothesised that aspirin plus clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in prevention of atherothrombotic events in stable cardiovascular disease. The trial showed a relative risk of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, p = 0.22). Therefore, the null hypothesis could not be rejected and the conclusion was aspirin and clopidogrel combination was not more effective than aspirin monotherapy.

### Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes: efficacy and limitations of current treatment strategies and future directions [^9027fb84]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The current American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management of unstable angina and NSTEMI recommend the addition of clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose and 75 mg/day maintenance dose) to aspirin in patients presenting with unstable angina and NSTEMI. Recently, the use of clopidogrel in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and endorsed by the current ACC/AHA guidelines on the management of STEMI patients. In acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, guidelines state that clopidogrel should be used regardless of the treatment strategy adopted (invasive or noninvasive) and should, ideally, be continued for up to 1 year. The prognostic implications of compliance with adjunctive clopidogrel therapy are underscored by a rebound increase in death and myocardial infarctions following its withdrawal. This phenomenon is particularly apparent in diabetic patients and may be attributed to a more marked increase in platelet reactivity in these patients following clopidogrel withdrawal.

In contrast to the clear benefit seen with dual antiplatelet therapy across the spectrum of patients with ACS, including those undergoing PCI, the results of the Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance (CHARISMA) trial showed that in high-risk but nonacute patients (n = 15,603) with clinically evident cardiovascular disease (n = 12,153) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (n = 3,284), treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin was not significantly more effective than that with aspirin alone in reducing the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (6.8 vs. 7.3%, respectively; P = 0.22). Although a subgroup analysis in a higher-risk group (n = 9,478) with prior myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or symptomatic PAD ("CAPRIE-like" population) showed a 17% relative risk reduction (P = 0.01) with dual antiplatelet therapy, the opposite findings were observed in patients in the lower-risk cohort who were enrolled in the study based on the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors in which an increase in mortality was observed. Importantly, a large number of patients enrolled in this latter subgroup had diabetes, as diabetes diagnosis represented one of the key inclusion criteria. Therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel should not be advocated in the primary prevention setting for diabetic individuals.

### Dose comparisons of clopidogrel and aspirin in acute coronary syndromes [^d8dff220]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Clopidogrel and aspirin are widely used for patients with acute coronary syndromes and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, evidence-based guidelines for dosing have not been established for either agent.

Methods

We randomly assigned, in a 2-by-2 factorial design, 25,086 patients with an acute coronary syndrome who were referred for an invasive strategy to either double-dose clopidogrel (a 600-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 150 mg daily for 6 days and 75 mg daily thereafter) or standard-dose clopidogrel (a 300-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily thereafter) and either higher-dose aspirin (300 to 325 mg daily) or lower-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg daily). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 30 days.

Results

The primary outcome occurred in 4.2% of patients assigned to double-dose clopidogrel as compared with 4.4% assigned to standard-dose clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.30). Major bleeding occurred in 2.5% of patients in the double-dose group and in 2.0% in the standard-dose group (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.46; P = 0.01). Double-dose clopidogrel was associated with a significant reduction in the secondary outcome of stent thrombosis among the 17,263 patients who underwent PCI (1.6% vs. 2.3%; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P = 0.001). There was no significant difference between higher-dose and lower-dose aspirin with respect to the primary outcome (4.2% vs. 4.4%; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.09; P = 0.61) or major bleeding (2.3% vs. 2.3%; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.17; P = 0.90).

Conclusions

In patients with an acute coronary syndrome who were referred for an invasive strategy, there was no significant difference between a 7-day, double-dose clopidogrel regimen and the standard-dose regimen, or between higher-dose aspirin and lower-dose aspirin, with respect to the primary outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
