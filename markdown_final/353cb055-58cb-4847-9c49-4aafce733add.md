## Question

Provide an assessment, differential diagnosis, and plan for: Patient intake — "I feel fine, but the cold I had three weeks ago is stuck in my chest. Any time I exert myself, I cough terribly. For example, just a few minutes ago I did heavy squats and puked from coughing so much. It's been constant like this. I've had to cut 7–8 workouts short because of the coughing and gagging. No fever, feel fine, sleeping well".
-Onset/duration: URI 2.5–3 weeks ago; recovered fine.
-Characteristics: Anything that raises HR triggers coughing; starts gagging and has vomited a few times.
-Associated symptoms: Denies fever, chills, body aches, nasal congestion, purulent discharge, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, ear/eye symptoms. No coughing at night or productive cough.
-Aggravating/relieving factors: Exercise
-Treatments tried: None.
-Prior episodes: Prone to colds lingering in chest
-Sick contacts/recent travel: Household with recent URI

Prescribed albuterol inhaler

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to provide an assessment, differential diagnosis, and plan for a patient with a post-viral, exertion-triggered cough, and to evaluate whether the prescribed albuterol inhaler is appropriate as part of a comprehensive management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the clinical presentation aligns with asthma phenotypes such as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and cough-variant asthma. Then, I should verify objective diagnostic criteria and testing pathways. Next, I will evaluate treatment choices against guideline recommendations, including reliever and controller strategies. Finally, I will consider nonpharmacologic measures, patient education, follow-up, and red flags that would prompt alternative workup or urgent care, all while checking for internal consistency and correcting any overstatements in the initial trace as needed.

> Let me first confirm the salient clinical features and whether they fit an asthma spectrum disorder. The cough began 2.5–3 weeks after a viral URI, is triggered exclusively by exertion that raises heart rate, is severe enough to cause gagging and vomiting, and does not disturb sleep, with no fever, purulent sputum, or other infectious signs, which makes ongoing infection unlikely and raises suspicion for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or cough-variant asthma precipitated by a viral illness, a classic trigger pattern recognized by GINA for variable respiratory symptoms that often appear or worsen with viral infections and exercise triggers [^115ppn5R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the differential diagnosis systematically to avoid anchoring. The leading considerations are exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and cough-variant asthma given the exertional specificity and post-viral onset, but post-infectious cough without airway hyperresponsiveness remains possible early in the course, while UACS and GERD are less likely from the history though GERD can present with cough; however, GINA cautions against routine GERD screening in uncontrolled asthma absent suggestive features, and AAFP emphasizes prioritizing asthma, UACS, NAEB, and GERD as common chronic cough causes in a structured evaluation, so I should weigh these while planning objective testing rather than empirically treating for GERD here [^116SRwRS] [^116q3BMN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially phrased exercise as a pathognomonic trigger, but I should correct that because exercise is a classic, not pathognomonic, precipitant of asthma symptoms; other conditions, including vocal cord dysfunction and cardiac disease, can also be exercise-limited, so I need to ensure objective confirmation of variable expiratory airflow limitation to substantiate an asthma diagnosis before labeling it definitively [^115ppn5R].

> I will now examine the diagnostic criteria and necessary tests so that I do not over-rely on symptom patterns. Per GINA 2025, diagnosis requires typical variable respiratory symptoms plus documented excessive variability in lung function, such as a positive bronchodilator response on spirometry, significant peak flow variability over two weeks, a positive bronchial challenge, or improvement after a trial of ICS; pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry is the first step, and if normal but suspicion remains high, exercise challenge or methacholine testing can confirm EIB or airway hyperresponsiveness, with short-term PEF monitoring adding supportive evidence of variability, all of which I should arrange promptly to close the diagnostic loop [^115ppn5R].

> Wait, let me verify whether the current prescription aligns with guideline-based initial management. Using a short-acting beta-agonist before exercise is appropriate for EIB, and GINA also supports as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol used before exercise as an alternative approach that provides both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory action; given frequent exertional episodes affecting multiple workouts, relying on SABA alone risks under-treating underlying airway inflammation and would argue for adding anti-inflammatory therapy if objective testing supports asthma or if clinical suspicion remains high while awaiting testing, to reduce future risk and symptom burden [^1152GLxv] [^111uL1KG].

> Hold on, I should confirm the controller options and guardrails, because choosing the wrong long-acting strategy can be unsafe. For patients with exercise-related symptoms occurring more than occasionally, low-dose ICS–formoterol used as needed and before exercise, or daily low-dose ICS, are recommended strategies; LABA monotherapy should be avoided in asthma due to increased risk of serious asthma-related events, reinforcing that any LABA component must be paired with ICS when used for asthma management, which is consistent with safety communications in LABA-containing products not indicated for asthma monotherapy [^1152GLxv] [^117WDmMX] [^111yaacZ].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic measures that reduce EIB risk, because medication alone may not fully control exertional cough. GINA recommends a structured warm-up to exploit the refractory period, attention to environmental conditions like avoiding cold, dry air exposure, and general encouragement of regular physical activity given its benefits for symptoms, quality of life, and fitness in asthma; these steps, combined with pre-exercise pharmacologic prophylaxis, can meaningfully mitigate exercise-triggered episodes while maintaining participation in desired activities [^1152GLxv] [^112UddXG].

> I need to ensure patient education and follow-up are comprehensive, because poor technique or lack of an action plan often undermines outcomes. I should confirm and document correct inhaler technique, provide a written asthma action plan outlining pre-exercise dosing, recognition of breakthrough symptoms, and steps for escalation, and schedule reassessment within 2–6 weeks to review symptom control, reliever use, spirometry results, and the need for step-up or step-down therapy as recommended in the initial and ongoing assessment framework from GINA 2025 [^112WXZFZ].

> But wait, what if the clinical course deviates or red flags emerge; I should double-check contingencies. If the patient develops hemoptysis, weight loss, persistent fever, severe nocturnal symptoms, or fails to respond to appropriate bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy, I should broaden the workup to include chest imaging and evaluation for alternative cardiopulmonary causes of cough per chronic cough and acute cough differentials, including consideration of inducible laryngeal obstruction, bronchiectasis, or other less common etiologies, while tailoring urgency to acuity and severity of symptoms [^116q3BMN] [^114quYjx].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency before concluding. The post-viral timing, exertional specificity, and severity profile strongly suggest exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or cough-variant asthma, but I must anchor the diagnosis with objective evidence via spirometry and, if needed, bronchoprovocation; SABA pre-exercise is reasonable immediately, yet frequent symptoms justify moving toward anti-inflammatory reliever or controller therapy per GINA, alongside warm-up strategies, technique verification, an action plan, and time-bound follow-up to assess response and adjust therapy safely and effectively [^115ppn5R] [^1152GLxv] [^111uL1KG] [^112WXZFZ].

The most likely diagnosis is **post-viral cough-variant asthma** (CVA) given exertion-triggered cough with gag/vomiting, no nocturnal or productive cough, and no systemic symptoms [^115ppn5R]. The top differentials are exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) [^1152GLxv], upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), and GERD [^116q3BMN]. Initial workup should include **spirometry with bronchodilator response** [^115ppn5R], FeNO, and a trial of inhaled corticosteroids; if spirometry is normal, consider methacholine challenge [^115ppn5R]. Start ICS [^115ppn5R], use albuterol before exercise [^1152GLxv], and **reassess in 2–4 weeks**; if no improvement, broaden evaluation to include chest imaging and ENT/GI referral [^116q3BMN].

## Recommended diagnostic workup

- **Spirometry with bronchodilator response**: Assess for reversible airflow obstruction consistent with asthma/CVA [^115ppn5R].
- **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Evaluate eosinophilic airway inflammation supporting asthma/CVA [^112WXZFZ].
- **Methacholine challenge test**: If spirometry is normal, assess airway hyperresponsiveness [^115ppn5R].
- **Chest X-ray**: Rule out structural lung disease if symptoms persist or worsen [^116q3BMN].
- **ENT evaluation**: Consider if UACS suspected [^116q3BMN].
- **Gastroenterology evaluation**: Consider if GERD suspected [^116SRwRS].

---

## Initial management plan

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: Initiate daily ICS for suspected CVA [^115ppn5R].
- **Albuterol inhaler**: Use 2 puffs 15 minutes before exercise to prevent EIB symptoms [^1152GLxv].
- **Patient education**: Teach inhaler technique, adherence, and symptom monitoring [^112WXZFZ].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess in 2–4 weeks to evaluate response and adjust therapy.

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate evaluation

- **Hemoptysis**: Coughing up blood.
- **Severe dyspnea**: Difficulty breathing.
- **Chest pain**: Persistent or severe [^116q3BMN].
- **Fever**: Temperature > 38°C (100.4°F).
- **Weight loss**: Unintentional.
- **Night sweats**: Persistent.

---

## Patient counseling and education

Explain that the cough most likely reflects **post-viral cough-variant asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction**, and set expectations for a short-term response. Emphasize **strict adherence to daily inhaled corticosteroids** and pre-exercise albuterol use, and encourage tracking triggers and responses to therapy [^111uL1KG]. Advise avoiding airway irritants and maintaining hydration, and reinforce the need for **follow-up** to ensure control and adjust treatment [^112WXZFZ].

---

## Follow-up plan

Arrange short-term follow-up in **2–4 weeks** to reassess symptoms and lung function. Continue long-term reassessment every 3–6 months or as needed. If there is no improvement, escalate care with **specialist referral** and advanced diagnostics [^115ppn5R].

---

The patient's exertion-triggered cough following a recent URI most likely reflects **post-viral cough-variant asthma** or EIB [^1152GLxv]. Initial evaluation with spirometry, FeNO, and a therapeutic ICS trial is appropriate; if spirometry is normal, proceed to methacholine challenge. Start ICS, use albuterol before exercise, and reassess in 2–4 weeks; if symptoms persist, expand the workup and consider specialist referral [^112WXZFZ] [^116q3BMN].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1152GLxv]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, particularly in patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend counseling patients about the prevention of breakthrough exercise-induced bronchoconstriction through the following measures:

- **Pre-exercise warm-up**: Engage in a warm-up routine before exercise to reduce the risk of bronchoconstriction.

- **Medication use**:
	- Short-acting β-agonists or ICS-short-acting β-agonists should be used before exercise.
	- Low-dose ICS-formoterol can be administered before exercise.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115ppn5R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients (aged 6–11 years) based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: Symptoms occur variably over time and vary in intensity. Symptoms are often worse at night or on waking and can be triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, and cold air. They may worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive) and often appear or worsen with viral infections.

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: Positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow), excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over two weeks, increase in lung function after four weeks of ICS-containing treatment, positive bronchial challenge test, or excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### An update of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of leprosy: A narrative review [^114V24gv]. Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on leprosy:

- **Definition**: Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes.
- **Pathophysiology**: Mycobacterium leprae, a non-spore-forming AFB, primarily invades via the respiratory route through the nasal mucosa, though other transmission routes may also occur. It thrives in cooler regions of the body, particularly the skin, with a preference for macrophages, keratinocytes, and Schwann cells. Armadillos may serve as a zoonotic reservoir.
- **Epidemiology**: Leprosy was globally eliminated as a public health problem in 2000, defined by a prevalence of < 1 case per 10,000 people. However, new cases continue to emerge, requiring ongoing surveillance and management efforts.

- **Clinical manifestations**: Leprosy is characterized by a diverse array of clinical manifestations, primarily involving skin lesions and peripheral nerve damage. The skin lesions vary in appearance and may range from hypopigmented macules to diffuse plaques. Peripheral nerve involvement leads to sensory and motor dysfunction, presenting as numbness, muscle weakness, or paralysis.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of leprosy is primarily clinical, supported by laboratory tests such as slit-skin smears and skin biopsies. The identification of acid-fast bacilli in skin smears or histopathological evidence of granulomas with or without bacilli is definitive for diagnosis.

- **Treatment**: Effective treatment for leprosy involves multidrug therapy (MDT) recommended by the World Health Organization, which typically includes a combination of dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine. MDT is effective in curing the disease, preventing transmission, and reducing the burden.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11247AmX]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly concerning the management of exacerbations in a primary care setting, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following.

- **Brief focused history**: Elicit a history including the timing of onset and cause (if known) of the present exacerbation, severity of asthma symptoms such as those limiting exercise or disturbing sleep, any symptoms of anaphylaxis, risk factors for asthma-related death, and details of all reliever and maintenance medications. This should include doses, prescribed devices, adherence patterns, any recent dose changes, and response to therapy.

- **Physical examination**: Conduct a relevant physical examination focusing on signs of exacerbation severity and vital signs such as level of consciousness, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, ability to complete sentences, use of accessory muscles, and wheezing. Check for complicating factors like anaphylaxis, pneumonia, or pneumothorax, and signs of alternative conditions explaining acute breathlessness, such as cardiac failure, inducible laryngeal obstruction, inhaled foreign body, or pulmonary embolism (PE).

- **Objective measurements**: Use pulse oximetry to check saturation levels and measure peak expiratory flow in patients older than 5 years. Prompt initiation of therapy should be concurrent with these evaluations for patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to primary care.

### Omvoh [^117QtbVZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during intravenous infusion, have been reported with OMVOH administration. Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, including mucocutaneous erythema and pruritus, were reported during induction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue OMVOH immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.

OMVOH may increase the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate treatment with OMVOH in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing OMVOH. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops or an infection is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer OMVOH until the infection resolves.

Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with OMVOH. Do not administer OMVOH to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering OMVOH. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OMVOH in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after OMVOH treatment.

### Xifaxan [^115bbYU9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms that cumulatively support the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome include abnormal stool frequency (for research purposes, "abnormal" may be defined as more than 3 bowel movements per day and less than 3 bowel movements per week), abnormal stool form (lumpy/hard or loose/watery stool), and abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete evacuation). Additionally, the passage of mucus and bloating or a feeling of abdominal distension are considered significant.

- **Trial 3 - Design**:
	- Trial 3 evaluated repeat treatment in adults with IBS-D meeting Rome III criteria for up to 46 weeks. A total of 2,579 patients were enrolled to receive open-label Xifaxan for 14 days. Of 2,438 evaluable patients, 1,074 (44%) responded to initial treatment and were evaluated over 22 weeks for continued response or recurrence of IBS symptoms. A total of 636 patients experienced symptom recurrence and were randomized into the double-blind phase of the study. These patients were assigned to receive Xifaxan 550 mg three times a day (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308) for two additional 14-day repeat treatment courses separated by 10 weeks.

The IBS-D population from the three studies had a mean age of 47 years (range: 18 to 88 years), of which approximately 11% of patients were ≥ 65 years old, 72% were female, and 88% were White.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can contract COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illnesses resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can occur and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. Gohibic is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Patterns of respiratory symptoms and asthma diagnosis in school-age children: Three birth cohorts [^1153rFT6]. Allergy (2025).

- **Limitations and strengths**: Our study has strengths and limitations. We acknowledge the complexity of the analyses and the subtle differences in question wording between cohorts. However, results were remarkably consistent across the cohorts. We could not ascertain the impact of cough, as there was a very high correlation between the response to the questions on cough with those on wheeze. While using cough questions in the clustering procedure might be tempting, the observed correlation between the two symptoms would lead to unstable clusters, and we opted to retain information on wheeze.

The names of the derived clusters and potential underlying mechanisms need to be interpreted with caution. For example, while C3 had the highest percentage of confirmed RSV bronchiolitis, this was nonetheless relatively low. However, other characteristics of this cluster, including the highest hospitalization and wheeze exacerbation rates in infancy, point towards the importance of early-life susceptibility to RSV infection. It is highly unlikely that the described clusters are underpinned by completely unique mechanisms, as children with RSV bronchiolitis were also present in other clusters. It is therefore possible that RSV has contributed to the development of asthma in other clusters as well, possibly in interaction with other pathways (e.g. T2 mechanisms).

We acknowledge the potential impact of asthma medication on the reported symptoms. We accounted for the possible confounding effects of medication use by integrating this information in our analysis.

### Exercise Recommendations and Practical Considerations for Asthma Management-An EAACI Position Paper [^115o6Xtt]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

FIGURE 1
Impact of exercise training on asthma‐related outcomes and extrapulmonary comorbidities (summary of evidence from recent RCTs).

FIGURE 2
Exercise‐induced bronchoconstriction contributing to exercise avoidance in pre‐existing asthma.

Whilst the importance of exercise and physical activity in the context of asthma management has previously been described, and endorsed in the GINA report, there remains limited guidance concerning the practicalities of exercise prescription. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) task force was therefore established to achieve three fundamental aims: first, to provide an up‐to‐date perspective concerning the role of exercise for asthma management (i.e. describe the disease modifying potential of exercise and associated impact on asthma‐related extrapulmonary comorbidities); second, to develop pragmatic recommendations to facilitate safe and effective exercise prescription; and third, to identify key unmet needs and provide focused direction for future research.

### Endogenous glucose production in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia estimated by oral D-[6,6–2H2]-glucose [^116SZoRr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The trial was conducted at the UMCG between October 2020 and July 2021. Patients with GSDIa and an equal number of age-, gender-, and BMI–matched healthy volunteers (HVs) were recruited at the UMCG.

- **Inclusion criteria**
- Age > 16 years
- Stable medical condition before the start of the test procedures for patients with GSDIa
- Confirmation of GSDIa with enzyme assay and/or G6PC1 variation analysis

- **Exclusion criteria included**
- Pregnancy
- Recent fever of 38.5 °C or higher in the week prior to the study visit
- For HVs, a confirmed diagnosis or history suggestive of diabetes mellitus
- First-degree family member with a confirmed diagnosis associated with fasting intolerance
- Symptoms or signs suggestive of fasting intolerance, metabolic instability, fever, or gastrointestinal complaints

Based on their G6PC1 genotype (or clinical features if the genotype was not available), patients with GSDIa were classified as "severe" (having two nonsense or active site variants or clinical ascertainment before the age of 2 years) or "attenuated" (having two missense variants not in the active site, or one nonsense or active site variant and one missense variant not in the active site, or clinical ascertainment after the age of 2 years). Variants were reported according to ClinVar, or based on published literature if a mutation was not published/deposited on ClinVar. Each participant was assigned a code which is not disclosed here.

### The effect of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation on clinical parameters and the deposition of inhalation products in patients with stable COPD [^111ife7h]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to their unchanged treatment plan, each subject received treatment with intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) "MODEL IPV-2 C" three times a week for four consecutive weeks. The exact settings of the pressure amplitude depended on the flow amplitude and impedance of the respiratory system. The patient was given 2 times 15 minutes of IPV with a 2-minute rest in between.

IPV is a technique in which small bursts of air with a high flow and frequency are added to spontaneous breathing. This causes the air pressure in the airways to oscillate between 5 and 35 cmH2O. These high-frequency pressure differences cause the airway walls to vibrate along with these oscillations. A constant pressure is maintained during the percussions of air in the lungs, while percussions of air are given. As a result, the airways are kept open during the percussions. This technique aims to loosen mucus and secretions in the lungs and mobilize them into the large airways to be coughed out.

The IPV treatment was personalized and adjusted to the patient's feedback and mucus movement. The initial pressure and flow were set to feel and see a chest wiggle and to feel the feedback of the percussion at the chest. The starting frequency was set at 260 cycles per minute. The patients were instructed to breathe at different breathing levels during the treatment according to the principles of autogenic drainage, although the treatment was not categorized as autogenic drainage. High frequencies were used to loosen mucus, whereas lower frequencies were used to suit the patient's needs.

### Airdou digihaler [^112k8D4F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Careful consideration is required when transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to inhaled corticosteroids. This is due to the risk of deaths from adrenal insufficiency, which have been reported in asthma patients during and after this transition. After systemic corticosteroids are withdrawn, recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function may take several months.

Patients previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) are particularly susceptible to adrenal insufficiency, especially when systemic corticosteroids have been nearly withdrawn. During the period of HPA suppression, exposure to trauma, surgery, infection (especially gastroenteritis), or severe electrolyte loss can trigger adrenal insufficiency. Although AirDuo Digihaler may help control asthma symptoms, it provides less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroids systemically and lacks the necessary mineralocorticoid activity to handle such emergencies.

- **Action during stress or severe asthmatic attacks**: During periods of stress or severe asthma attacks, patients who have withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and contact their physician for further instruction.

### Fyarro [^111vMvK6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Stomatitis**: Stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis, occurred in 79% of patients treated with FYARRO, including 18% Grade 3. Stomatitis was most often first reported within 8 weeks of treatment. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, resume at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue FYARRO [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Myelosuppression**: FYARRO can cause myelosuppression, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Anemia occurred in 68% of patients, with 6% experiencing Grade 3. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 35% of patients each. Obtain blood counts at baseline and every 2 months for the first year of treatment and every 3 months thereafter, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, resume at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue FYARRO [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Infections**: FYARRO can cause infections. Infections such as urinary tract infections (UTI), upper respiratory tract infections, and sinusitis occurred in 59% of patients. Grade 3 infections occurred in 12% of patients, including a single case each of a UTI, pneumonia, skin, and abdominal infections. Monitor patients for infections, including opportunistic infections. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, resume at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue FYARRO [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Hypokalemia**: FYARRO can cause hypokalemia, which occurred in 44% of patients.

### Ilumya [^112T25dS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Cases of angioedema and urticaria occurred in Ilumya-treated subjects during clinical trials. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Ilumya immediately and initiate appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Infections**: Ilumya may increase the risk of infection. Although infections were more common in the Ilumya group (23%), the difference in frequency between the Ilumya group and the placebo group (22%) was less than 1% during the placebo-controlled period. Subjects with active infections or a history of reinfections were not included in clinical trials. Upper respiratory infections occurred more frequently in the Ilumya group than in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- The rates of serious infections for both the Ilumya group and the placebo group were ≤ 0.3%. Treatment with Ilumya should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

	- In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing Ilumya. Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and consider discontinuation of Ilumya until the infection resolves [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Pretreatment evaluation for tuberculosis**: Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB).

### Ofev [^1133Pdgr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 4 [NCT02597933]). A total of 580 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ofev 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of which 576 patients were treated. Randomization was stratified by anti-topoisomerase antibody (ATA) status. Individual patients remained on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 52 weeks. The absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) at week 52 was a key secondary endpoint. Mortality over the whole trial was an additional secondary endpoint.

Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD based upon the 2013 American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc, with onset of disease (first non-Raynaud symptom) of less than 7 years and greater than or equal to 10% fibrosis on a chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan conducted within the previous 12 months. Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 40% of predicted and a DLCO 30–89% of predicted. Patients with relevant airways obstruction (i.e. pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.7) or previous or planned hematopoietic stem cell transplant were excluded from the trial.

### Tremfya [^115c6ED3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with post-market use of Tremfya, with some cases requiring hospitalization. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Tremfya and initiate appropriate therapy.

- **Infections**: Tremfya may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials involving subjects with plaque psoriasis, infections occurred in 23% of those in the Tremfya group, compared to 21% in the placebo group through 16 weeks of treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections occurred more frequently in the Tremfya group than in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The rate of serious infections for both the Tremfya group and the placebo group was ≤ 0.2%. A similar risk of infection was observed in placebo-controlled trials for subjects with psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Treatment with Tremfya should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits before prescribing Tremfya. Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or does not respond to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue Tremfya until the infection resolves.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112UddXG]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for asthma, and more specifically with respect to physical activity, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend encouraging patients with asthma to engage in regular physical activity. This is due to its general health benefits, which include improved symptoms and quality of life in those with moderate-to-severe asthma. Additionally, regular physical activity contributes to improved cardiopulmonary fitness and offers a small benefit for asthma control and lung function, particularly with activities such as swimming in young patients with asthma.

### AirDuo RespiClick [^113t4d4B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Improvements in lung function occurred within 15 minutes of the first dose. Compared with placebo, for AirDuo Respiclick 113 mcg/14 mcg and 232 mcg/14 mcg, the difference in least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in FEV1 was 0.160 L and 0.187 L, respectively. The unadjusted p-value was < 0.0001 for both doses compared with placebo. Maximum improvement in FEV1 generally occurred within 3 hours for both AirDuo Respiclick dose groups, and improvements were sustained over the 12 hours of testing at weeks 1 and 12. Following the initial dose, predose FEV1 relative to day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment, and the improvement was sustained over the 12 weeks of treatment in the trial. No diminution in the 12-hour bronchodilator effect was observed with either AirDuo Respiclick dose, as assessed by FEV1 following 12 weeks of therapy.

---

### Taltz [^114KPhfa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Infections**: Taltz may increase the risk of infections. In clinical trials involving adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the Taltz group exhibited a higher rate of infections compared to the placebo group (27% vs. 23%). Upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the Taltz group than in the placebo group. A similar increase in the risk of infections was observed in placebo-controlled trials among patients with pediatric psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, serious bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors, including Taltz. Patients treated with Taltz should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. In the event a patient develops a serious infection or does not respond to standard therapy, the patient should be closely monitored and Taltz should be discontinued until the infection resolves.

- **Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis**: Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Taltz. Do not administer Taltz to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering Taltz. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating Taltz in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving Taltz should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after therapy.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^111cmjUh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pentazocine is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Clinical considerations**: Infants exposed to pentazocine and naloxone through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets carefully.

### Striverdi Respimat [^117WDmMX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, which includes Patient Information and Instructions for Use.

- **Serious asthma-related events**: Inform patients that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), such as Striverdi Respimat, when used as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid), increase the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. Striverdi Respimat is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

- **Not for acute symptoms**: Striverdi Respimat is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, such as albuterol. The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient on how it should be used.

Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following:

- Worsening of symptoms
- Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
- Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
- Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician

Instruct patients not to stop therapy with Striverdi Respimat without physician or provider guidance, as symptoms may recur after discontinuation.

- **Do not use additional long-acting beta-agonists**: Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms.

### Public perspectives on healthcare professional-directed communication of hereditary genetic risks: a mixed-method systematic review [^1167VxDC]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Genetic testing has revolutionized the identification of individuals at increased risk for various hereditary conditions, enabling early intervention and preventive measures. However, effective cascade counseling and testing depend on successful intra-familial communication. This mixed-method systematic review aimed to explore the general population's perspectives and preferences regarding the communication of potential genetic risk information by healthcare professionals. This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (CRD42024532829).

A comprehensive search of six databases yielded 17,292 records. After removing duplicates and screening for relevance, nine studies were included in the final analysis, conducted across diverse Western countries using both qualitative and quantitative designs. Results indicated a preference for healthcare-mediated communication, particularly through formal methods such as letters, valued for their clarity and reliability. The role of family-mediated communication is nuanced, influenced by interpersonal relationship quality and the emotional burden of disclosing sensitive information. Ethical and legal considerations highlighted public support for overriding confidentiality in treatable conditions, while emphasizing respect for individual privacy and autonomy in untreatable conditions.

This review underscores the importance of understanding public preferences to develop tailored communication strategies.

### A 53-year-old man with recurrent cough, expectoration, and fever [^117KXoxT]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old man was admitted with complaints of recurrent cough, mucopurulent phlegm, and fever for 10 days. These symptoms started in his youth, and he had experienced three or more acute attacks per year in the past 3 years. Persistent nasal obstruction was noticed. When asked for symptoms, the patient denied heartburn, wheezing, aspiration, night sweats, and weight loss. The patient was married for 30 years and had a son. He had never used tobacco products or alcohol. A family history indicated that his parents were consanguineously married, and one of his sisters died of bronchiectasis coinfection.

### Physical well-being and burden of care in adults on modulator therapy: A mixed methods study of patient-reported experiences from the Well-ME survey [^117Y1HoZ]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread availability of modulator therapies and improved lung function in many people with cystic fibrosis (CF), physical symptoms may remain burdensome for some people with CF (PwCF). This study identifies the impact of ivacaftor (IVA) and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) on self-reported physical well-being and burden of care among adults with CF.

- **Methods**: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Well-ME Survey. Participants included adults with CF (age ≥ 18) who reported taking IVA or ETI. We used a mixed methods approach to identify self-reported health status, physical well-being, and experience of CF care while taking IVA or ETI.

- **Results**: Among 414 eligible respondents, overall health status was reported as very good/excellent by 59% (n = 243), good by 26% (n = 114), and poor/fair by 14% (n = 57). While the majority of respondents experienced improvements in respiratory symptoms, PwCF reporting poor/fair health were less likely to report improvement in overall physical health, fatigue, and ability to exercise compared to those with good or very good/excellent health, and less likely to report improvement in pain, sinus issues, and cough than those with very good/excellent health. PwCF reporting poor/fair health or good health were less likely to report improvements in gastrointestinal issues or experience reductions in CF medications or treatments compared to those reporting very good/excellent health.

- **Conclusions**: Despite improvements in respiratory symptoms, some adults with CF taking IVA or ETI report their health as poor/fair.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1133kK1g]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

The 2025 GOLD guidelines emphasize the importance of a detailed medical history for patients with known or suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This history should include:

- **Exposures**: Smoking; occupational exposures; environmental exposures, both household and outdoor.

- **Past medical history**: Early life events such as prematurity, low birth weight, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and passive smoking exposure during infancy. Other considerations include asthma, allergy, sinusitis, nasal polyps, respiratory infections in childhood, HIV, and tuberculosis.

- **Family history**: COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases.

- **Pattern of symptom development**: COPD typically develops in adulthood. Most patients become aware of increased breathlessness, more frequent or prolonged "winter colds", and social restrictions years before seeking medical help.

- **Exacerbations**: History of exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for respiratory disorders.

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, musculoskeletal disorders, anxiety and depression, and malignancies.

- **Impact on patient's life**: Limitation of activity, missed work, economic impact, effect on wellbeing, family routines, sexual activity, and feelings of depression or anxiety.

- **Social factors**: Availability of social and family support.

### Recurrent pediatric acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with drug and infective precipitants [^114QjvgJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

An 11-year-old Chinese girl with a history of exogenous obesity initially presented with a generalized pruritic rash for two days, preceded by four days of diarrhea and vomiting. On examination, disseminated non-follicular pinhead-sized pustules were observed over the trunk and limbs on a background of oedematous erythema, with no mucosal involvement. Investigations revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers, while renal and liver functions were normal. No infectious organism was isolated. Her drug history was unremarkable for new medications. She was clinically diagnosed with AGEP, triggered by gastroenteritis of possible viral origin, and was treated with mometasone furoate 0.1% lotion and emollients. She made an uneventful recovery with collarette desquamation within two weeks.

The patient experienced a second similar pustular eruption 11 months later over her face and trunk, one day after ingesting dimenhydrinate for motion sickness while on vacation. The rash resolved with the cessation of the drug without further intervention within seven days. A third episode occurred three months after the second, where she presented again with a similar cutaneous eruption over the face, neck, limbs, and trunk, preceded by rhinorrhea and fever for one week. Enterovirus/Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were isolated from a respiratory swab, and no new medication was ingested during this period. A fourth episode occurred five months later, again preceded by Enterovirus/Rhinovirus swab-positive upper respiratory tract symptoms for two weeks prior and the intake of diphenhydramine.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^112eGPW5]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory condition worldwide and a major source of economic and societal burden. For the most part, pharmacological intervention forms the mainstay of treatment, with the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommending symptom-driven low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol as the preferred first line, with a step-wise approach to maintenance treatment in those that continue to report high symptom burden. Whilst this strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of exacerbations when compared to short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) prescribed as mono-therapy, sub-optimal disease control remains a long-standing issue across all levels of asthma severity. Therefore, other therapies with proven efficacy need to be considered when implementing personalized asthma management.

In this respect, it is now apparent that engaging in regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise has the potential to modify disease via modulation of inflammatory and immune responses. It benefits a multitude of asthma-related outcomes and extrapulmonary comorbidities. However, despite a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of exercise for asthma management, it is typical for individuals with asthma to engage in lower levels of physical activity compared to healthy counterparts. The underpinning factors that contribute to physical inactivity in the general population are complex and multifaceted; however, for individuals with asthma, it is thought to relate, at least in part, to disease-specific barriers.

### Stiolto Respimat [^111yaacZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling, including the Patient Information and Instructions for Use.

- **Serious asthma-related events**: Inform patients that LABA, such as Stiolto Respimat, when used as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid), increases the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. Stiolto Respimat is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

- **Not for acute symptoms**: Stiolto Respimat is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms or exacerbations of COPD, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. The healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient on how it should be used.

Instruct patients to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: worsening of symptoms, decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists, need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists, or a significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician.

Instruct patients not to stop therapy with Stiolto Respimat without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.

- **Do not use additional long-acting beta-agonists**: Patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these products and use them only for the symptomatic relief of acute symptoms.

### Elevidys [^111AdjFt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients or caregivers that infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have occurred during and after ELEVIDYS infusion. Possible symptoms of infusion-related reactions are fast heart rate, fast breathing, swollen lips, shortness of breath, nostrils widening, hives, red and blotchy skin, itchy or inflamed lips, rash, vomiting, nausea, chills, and fever. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient experiences such a reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

ELEVIDYS can increase certain liver enzyme levels and cause acute serious liver injury. Patients will receive oral corticosteroid medication before and after infusion with ELEVIDYS. Weekly blood tests will be required to monitor liver enzyme levels for three months after treatment. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if the patient's skin and/or whites of the eyes appear yellowish or if the patient misses a dose of corticosteroid or vomits it up [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Immune-mediated myositis (an immune response affecting muscles) was observed in patients with a deletion mutation in the DMD gene that is contraindicated. Contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences any unexplained increased muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, including difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, or difficulty speaking, as these may be symptoms of myositis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) has been observed within days following ELEVIDYS infusion. Weekly monitoring of troponin-I for the first month after treatment is advised.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112WXZFZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, specifically in the initial assessment, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating symptom control, future risk of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients (aged 6–11 years) presenting with asthma:

- **Symptom control**: Assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks or longer.

- **Risk factors**: Identify any other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side effects.

- **Lung function**: Measure lung function at diagnosis/initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), but more often in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma.

- **Treatment step**: Document the patient's treatment step.

- **Inhaler technique**: Monitor inhaler technique, and assess adherence and side effects.

- **Asthma action plan**: Ensure that the patient has a written asthma action plan.

- **Patient attitudes and goals**: Inquire about the patient's attitudes and goals for their asthma and medications.

- **Multimorbidity assessment**: Evaluate multimorbidity that contributes to symptoms and poor quality of life, and sometimes to poor asthma control (such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety).

### Caverject [^115B8784]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Caverject was investigated in men with a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction due to psychogenic, vasculogenic, neurogenic, and/or mixed etiology in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2) and in one 6-month open-label study (Study 3). In clinical studies, over 80% of patients experienced an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse after intracavernosal injection of Caverject.

- **Study 1**: A total of 153 men with erectile dysfunction, with a mean age of 53 years (range 23–69 years), were enrolled. The study had three phases:
	- A 2.5-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover phase where each man received in-office injections of placebo or 2.5 mcg, 5 mcg, 7.5 mcg, or 10 mcg of Caverject.
	- A 2-week, open-label, in-office dose-titration phase to identify the optimum home-use dose, defined as a dose inducing an erection sufficient for intercourse and lasting ≤ 60 minutes.
	- A 4-week open-label, at-home phase.

In the double-blind placebo-controlled crossover phase, each dose of Caverject was significantly more effective than placebo by clinical evaluation ("full penile rigidity") and by RigiScan criteria (≥ 70% rigidity for at least 10 minutes); there was no response to placebo. The percentage of responders increased with increasing doses of Caverject. The overall response rates in the crossover and dose-titration phases were 76% (117/153) by clinical evaluation and 51% (78/152) by RigiScan criteria. Seventy-three percent of the injections in 102 men who used Caverject…

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pediatric cases presenting with possible pulmonary vasculitis following COVID-19 infection [^111KXKSz]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

A 14.3-year-old girl presented with complaints of intermittent fatigue, cough, chest distress, and chest pain. Two months prior, she experienced a COVID-19 infection, confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, which manifested as a mild upper respiratory infection. Approximately two weeks after recovering from COVID-19, she developed fatigue, chest distress, and a non-productive cough. A chest CT at that time showed minor evidence of infiltrates. The patient was treated for seven days at local hospitals with unknown medication, and her symptoms of cough and chest distress resolved.

Twenty days prior to this presentation, she experienced fatigue, cough, and chest distress once again, in addition to chest pain. Her medical history revealed atopic dermatitis. On examination, reddish maculopapular rashes with ulcerations and scabs were detected on her face and limbs. Routine blood and urine analyses were normal. Chest CT imaging revealed bilateral peripheral consolidations with "hole signs", as well as marked vascular wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and multiple filling defects of bilateral pulmonary artery branches. These findings suggested multiple pulmonary embolisms and vasculitis (Fig. 1 C and D). Two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab PCR and antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. The D-dimer level was normal (0.27 mg/L). Autoantibody tests revealed positive lupus anticoagulant, while ANA, ds-DNA, and ANCA were negative. The patient underwent a skin biopsy which showed evidence of vasculitic changes, including thickening and denaturation of vascular walls with infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils.

### Grafapex [^11153zRG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Inform patients of the increased risk of infections after treatment with Grafapex that may require antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment and hospitalization. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately in case of any new or worsening signs of infection, such as a cough, headache, diarrhea, or fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Seizures**: Inform patients that seizures may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Skin disorders**: Advise patients to clean "sweaty" skin parts such as the armpit, groin, genital area, and inframammary line with a disposable washcloth and clear water. Advise patients not to apply any cream to the skin on the days of chemotherapy, and clothing should not be too tight to let the skin "breathe" [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Secondary malignancies**: Inform patients of the possible risk of a second malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Advise females of reproductive potential about the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Grafapex and for 6 months following the last dose of Grafapex [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Grafapex and for 3 months after the last dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Klonopin [^115QZGq8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When used in patients with multiple types of seizure disorders, Klonopin may increase the incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may necessitate the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use of valproic acid and Klonopin may produce absence status.

In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often within three months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy.

Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy with Klonopin.

Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses, are known to occur when using benzodiazepines. Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued gradually. Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and the elderly.

Metabolites of Klonopin are excreted by the kidneys; therefore, caution should be exercised in administering the drug to patients with impaired renal function to avoid excess accumulation.

Klonopin may produce an increase in salivation, which should be considered before administering the drug.

### Using cardiorespiratory fitness assessment to identify pathophysiology in long COVID - Best practice approaches [^1126pVwv]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is well-established in clinical domains as an integrative measure of the body's physiological capability and capacity to transport and utilize oxygen during controlled bouts of physical exertion. Long COVID is associated with over 200 different symptoms and is estimated to affect approximately 150 million people worldwide. The most widely reported impact is reduced quality of life and functional status due to highly sensitive and cyclical symptoms that manifest and are augmented following exposure to physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive stimuli, commonly known as post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE), which prevents millions from engaging in routine daily activities.

Use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is commonplace in the assessment of integrated physiology; CPET will undoubtedly play an integral role in furthering the pathophysiology and mechanistic knowledge that will inform bespoke Long COVID treatment and management strategies. An inherent risk of previous attempts to utilize CPET protocols in patients with chronic disease is that these are compounded by PESE and have induced a worsening of symptoms for patients that can last for days or weeks. To effectively address this and meet the global need, the complex multi-system pathophysiology of Long COVID must be considered to ensure the design and implementation of research that is both safe for participants and capable of advancing mechanistic understanding.

### Uplizna [^116SpNQd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Assessments prior to the first dose of Uplizna involve several important screenings and precautions to ensure patient safety.

- **Hepatitis B virus screening**: Prior to initiating Uplizna, perform Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening. Uplizna is contraindicated in patients with active HBV confirmed by positive results for surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBV tests. For patients who are negative for HBsAg and positive for the HB core antibody (HBcAb+) or are carriers of HBV (HBsAg+), consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment with Uplizna [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Serum immunoglobulins**: Prior to initiating Uplizna, perform testing for quantitative serum immunoglobulins. For patients with low serum immunoglobulins, consult immunology experts before initiating treatment with Uplizna [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Tuberculosis screening**: Prior to initiating Uplizna, evaluate for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection. For patients with active tuberculosis or positive tuberculosis screening without a history of appropriate treatment, consult infectious disease experts before initiating treatment with Uplizna [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Vaccinations**: Because vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and after discontinuation until B-cell repletion, administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of Uplizna for live or live-attenuated vaccines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Developing effective strategies to optimize physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in the long Covid population- The need for caution and objective assessment [^1179mBrb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The Post Covid-19 Condition, commonly known as Long Covid, has been defined by the World Health Organization as occurring in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection. It usually manifests within three months from the onset of acute Covid-19 infection, with symptoms that last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid is associated with over two hundred recognized symptoms and affects tens of millions of people worldwide.

Widely reported reductions in quality of life (QoL) and functional status are caused by extremely sensitive and cyclical symptom profiles that are augmented following exposure to physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive stimuli. This manifestation prevents millions of people from engaging in routine activities of daily living (ADLs) and has important health and well-being, social, and economic impacts.

- **Post-exertional symptom exacerbation (PESE)**: Also known as post-exertional malaise, this is an exacerbation in the severity of fatigue and other symptoms following physical, emotional, orthostatic, and cognitive tasks. Typically, this occurs 24–72 hours after "over-exertion" and can persist for several days or even weeks. It is a hallmark symptom of Long Covid with a reported prevalence of 86%. The debilitating nature of PESE prevents patients from engaging in physical activity, which impacts functional status and QoL.

In this review, the authors present an update to the literature relating to PESE in Long Covid and make the case for evidence-based guidelines that support the design and implementation of effective strategies.

### The predictive role of social isolation in COVID-19 anxiety among older adults [^111DiXka]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

COVID-19, characterized by acute respiratory syndrome, is one of the most significant diseases that has emerged in the century and continues to persist. This acute respiratory illness has rapidly spread worldwide due to its high transmissibility, infecting all countries within less than four months. In response to this disease, the World Health Organization has issued several public health recommendations, governmental measures, social distancing guidelines, and restrictions. Although these restrictions help reduce the spread of infection, limiting participation in daily activities, physical exercise, and travel also has negative consequences. One of the vulnerable groups during this pandemic is the elderly.

Elderly individuals are more significantly affected by COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions, resulting in a higher risk of mortality than younger populations. Furthermore, older adults are at greater risk of psychological disorders due to reduced reserve capacity, the deterioration of bodily systems, multiple health issues, and diminished physical and financial independence compared to other adult age groups. Social isolation is one factor that generally has a high incidence in this age group. However, measures such as social distancing reduce social interactions and increase isolation among these individuals.

Social isolation is defined as the physical and social separation of individuals from one another, resulting in the breakdown of relationships, limited communication, withdrawal from social interactions, and a shrinking social circle.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^1168vufX]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Exercise is an important treatment for people with asthma and should be considered alongside pharmacological therapy when developing personalized asthma management plans. Despite this, there remains limited guidance concerning the practicalities of asthma‐specific exercise prescription. This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology task force was established to achieve three fundamental aims:

- **Provide an up‐to‐date perspective**: Concerning the role of exercise for asthma management, i.e. describe the disease-modifying potential of exercise and its associated impact on asthma‐related extrapulmonary comorbidities.
- **Develop pragmatic recommendations**: To facilitate safe and effective exercise prescription.
- **Identify key unmet needs**: Provide focused direction for future research.

The position paper is structured as a practically focused document, with recommendations formulated according to the best available scientific evidence and expert opinion. It emphasizes providing healthcare providers with pragmatic advice that can be implemented during routine asthma review.

### Comparing priority received by global health issues: a measurement framework applied to tuberculosis, malaria, diarrhoeal diseases and dengue fever [^111MFTt3]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

We then conducted a literature and database search to identify an exhaustive set of measurements for all six arenas. We performed open Google searches and explored potential databases using a combination of keywords applicable to potential indicators for each arena. For instance, in the international aid arena, we used terms such as DAH and global spending on health issues or diseases, among others. At this stage, we included numerical and narrative measures for existing and proposed arenas.

Second, we listed potential indicators for each measure and sources for capturing data and/or information against each indicator. This process provided us with a broader set of measurements, which may or may not apply to all health conditions, all arenas, and all country contexts. For example, in the international aid arena, we initially identified DAH, inclusion in aid priority strategies, availability of aid impact data, and availability of aid effectiveness studies as potential measures. We identified numerical indicators for the first two measures and narrative indicators for the last two measures, respectively. This included US dollars spent (for measuring DAH), the number of strategic aid documents pledging commitments to selected disease conditions (for inclusion in aid priority strategies), analytical insights from outcome/impact narratives related to the aid for a particular disease (for aid impact data), and the availability and quality of cost-effectiveness data linked to aid (for aid effectiveness measure).

### Fotivda [^114C7pX9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise females of reproductive potential about the potential risk to a fetus. Patients should inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)]. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Fotivda and for one month after the last dose. Similarly, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for one month post-treatment [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) and (8.3) and NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)].

Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Fotivda and for one month after the last dose [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.2)].

Fotivda can impair fertility; therefore, males and females of reproductive potential should be advised of this risk [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.3)].

Fotivda 0.89 mg capsule contains FD&C Yellow No.5 (tartrazine) as an imprint ink, which may cause allergic-type reactions, including bronchial asthma, in susceptible patients. The incidence of FD&C Yellow No.5 sensitivity is low overall but frequently seen in patients with aspirin hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)].

Advise patients that other adverse reactions with Fotivda treatment may include diarrhea, vomiting, dysphonia (hoarseness of voice), fatigue, asthenia, and stomatitis.

### The physiologic benefits of optimizing cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity - From the cell to systems level in a post-pandemic world [^115LCJcS]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is a leading cause of premature death and hospitalization, placing a significant strain on health services and economies around the world. Evidence from decades of empirical and observational research demonstrates clear associations between physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which can offset the risk of mortality and increase life expectancy and the quality of life in patients.

Whilst well documented, the narrative of increased CRF remained pertinent during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, where individuals with lower levels of CRF had more than double the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to those with moderate or high CRF. The need to better understand the mechanisms associated with COVID-19 and those that continue to be affected with persistent symptoms following infection (Long COVID), alongside CV health, is key if we are to effectively target the use of CRF and PA to improve the lives of those suffering its afflictions.

While there is a long way to go to optimize PA and CRF for improved health at a population level, particularly in a post-pandemic world, increasing the understanding using a cellular-to-systems approach hopes to provide further insight into the benefits of engaging in PA.

### Cannabis consumption and risk of asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143zTBR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Various possible mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the connection between cannabis use and the risk of asthma. First, the presence of irritants and toxic substances in cannabis smoke can cause direct damage to the respiratory epithelium, leading to increased airway reactivity and susceptibility to asthma. Second, cannabis may have immunomodulatory effects, potentially altering the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which could contribute to airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Furthermore, the co-use of tobacco and cannabis, a common pattern among users, could confound the observed associations, making it difficult to delineate the specific role of cannabis in respiratory health.

The link between cannabis use and the risk of asthma has been examined in multiple observational studies. However, the findings have been varied. Some research suggests that cannabis consumption is linked to a higher risk of asthma, while others have found no significant correlation. These mixed results emphasize the necessity for a more thorough evaluation to consolidate the existing evidence. Although there have been systematic reviews on various aspects of respiratory-related issues and cannabis use, none have specifically explored the association between cannabis use and greater odds of having asthma. As a result, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the precise nature of the relationship between cannabis use and asthma. With the growing prevalence of cannabis use and its potential impact on respiratory health, a systematic review and meta-analysis are essential.

### Exercise recommendations and practical considerations for asthma management-an EAACI position paper [^112vjYBW]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

In terms of exercise promotion, as a starting point, an assessment of activity status should be obtained. While questionnaires such as the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) provide a convenient and cost-effective method to quantify physical activity, there is concern regarding potential under- and overestimation when relying on patient self-reports alone. Due to the exponential rise in the availability and use of mobile technologies with built-in activity sensors capable of monitoring daily step counts, modern smartphones provide an opportunity to retrospectively review objective physical activity data during consultations, given appropriate consent is obtained.

Incorporating open-ended questions should be encouraged to understand barriers and facilitators to exercise engagement and physical capacity for leading an active lifestyle. For example, asking, "How do you feel about your activity status and/or ability to undertake exercise?" can help develop personalized recommendations to optimize enjoyment and promote long-term adherence. Implementing established behavior change strategies, such as goal setting, action planning, positive reinforcement, and motivational techniques, should also be utilized. This should be done alongside pragmatic advice to increase activities of daily living; for instance, using the stairs rather than the escalator at work to increase daily step count.

For those with limited experience of exercise training, it is important to provide reassurance that an increased perception of effort and mild discomfort are normal experiences in the initial phases of physical activity engagement.

### Airdou Respiclick [^112rZruV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy**: Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

	- **HPA suppression/adrenal insufficiency**: Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although AirDuo RespiClick may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity necessary for coping with these emergencies.

- **During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack**: Patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction.

Confirm Stage 2 type 1 diabetes by documenting at least two positive pancreatic islet cell autoantibodies and dysglycemia without overt hyperglycemia using an oral glucose tolerance test (if an oral glucose tolerance test is not available, an alternative method for diagnosing dysglycemia without overt hyperglycemia may be appropriate). Ensure the clinical history of the patient does not suggest type 2 diabetes.

- **Laboratory evaluation and vaccination prior to initiation**: Prior to initiating TZIELD, obtain a complete blood count and liver enzyme tests. Use of TZIELD is not recommended in patients with [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]:
	- Lymphocyte count less than 1,000 lymphocytes/mcL
	- Hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL
	- Platelet count less than 150,000 platelets/mcL

### Enspryng [^1136tXaV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Infections**: An increased risk of infections, including serious and potentially fatal infections, has been observed in patients treated with IL-6 receptor antagonists, including Enspryng. The most common infections reported in a randomized clinical trial of patients treated with Enspryng, who were not on other chronic immunosuppressant therapies (Study 1), and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (12%) and cellulitis (10%). The most common infections in patients who were on an additional immunosuppressant, and that occurred more often than in patients receiving placebo, were nasopharyngitis (31%), upper respiratory infection (19%), and pharyngitis (12%).

	- Delay Enspryng administration in patients with an active infection, including localized infections, until the infection is resolved.

- **Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation**: Risk of HBV reactivation has been observed with other immunosuppressant therapies. Patients with chronic HBV infection were excluded from clinical trials. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with Enspryng. Do not administer Enspryng to patients with active hepatitis. For patients who are chronic carriers of HBV [HBsAg+] or are negative for HBsAg and positive for HB core antibody [HBcAb+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment with Enspryng.

- **Tuberculosis**: Tuberculosis has occurred in patients treated with other interleukin-6 receptor antagonists. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection.

### Long-term pulmonary sequelae 5–14 years after protracted bacterial bronchitis in early childhood [^113VDZ5T]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). High credibility.

Cough is the most commonly reported symptom in children and adults and is the primary reason for consulting a healthcare provider. Chronic cough is defined as frequent coughing for more than 8 weeks in adults or more than 4 weeks in children. While chronic dry cough in childhood is often associated with asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) is the most common cause of chronic wet cough in children, accounting for almost all cases of chronic wet cough in preschool age. The burden of chronic cough is high for both children and their families. PBB, first described in 2006, is characterized by a wet cough that persists for at least 4 weeks without evidence of a specific cause and resolves after 2–4 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Some common pathogens involved are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. PBB is characterized by a neutrophilic inflammation of the airways and activation of the innate immune system, but the underlying mechanism of PBB is not well understood. PBB is thought to be a major cause of non-CF bronchiectasis, so early identification of children at risk is a high priority.

### Acute cough in outpatients: What causes it, how long does it last, and how severe is it for different viruses and bacteria [^114quYjx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, acute cough can be caused by:

- **Respiratory conditions**:

- **Obstructive and inflammatory conditions**: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, upper airway cough syndrome, bronchiectasis exacerbation, asthma exacerbation, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute interstitial pneumonia, pneumothorax
- **Infections**: Lower respiratory tract infections, COVID-19 infection, upper respiratory tract infections, lung abscess, tuberculosis, pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis
- **Other respiratory causes**: Aspiration pneumonitis, foreign body aspiration, pulmonary embolism, pertussis, inhalation injury, sarcoidosis, lung cancer, hypersensitivity pneumonitis

- **Gastrointestinal and cardiac conditions**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, acute decompensated heart failure

- **Allergic and immunological conditions**: Allergic rhinitis

Acute cough can also be caused by medications such as:

- **ACE inhibitors and related medications**: Lisinopril, enalapril, captopril
- **Analgesics and neurologic agents**: Gabapentin, fentanyl, fentanyl citrate, fentanyl ER
- **Other drugs**: Elotuzumab, cyclophosphamide
