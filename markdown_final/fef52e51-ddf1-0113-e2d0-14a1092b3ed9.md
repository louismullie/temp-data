## Question

A clinic administered the covid vaccine to 650 people. 80% of the people were adults. How many of the vaccinated people were children?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many children were vaccinated at a clinic where 650 total people were vaccinated and 80% were adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of vaccinated individuals. Then, I should verify the adult percentage and calculate the exact number of adults. Next, I will subtract the number of adults from the total to find the number of children. Finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any rounding or assumptions are needed before stating the answer.

> Let me first confirm the total and the adult proportion. The clinic vaccinated 650 people total, and 80% of them were adults, so I need to calculate 80% of 650 to get the adult count. Wait, let me verify the multiplication: 0.80 times 650 equals 520, so 520 adults were vaccinated.

> Next, I should review the subtraction to find the number of children. If 520 of the 650 vaccinated individuals are adults, then the remaining must be children. So, 650 minus 520 equals 130 children vaccinated. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the complement: 100% minus 80% is 20%, and 20% of 650 is indeed 130, which matches.

> I should double-check the logic and make sure no hidden assumptions are creeping in. The problem states that 80% were adults and asks for the number of children; it does not specify any other age categories, so the straightforward complement is appropriate here. I briefly wondered if there could be an "other" category, but nothing in the prompt suggests that, so the calculation stands as 130 children.

> Final answer: 130 children were vaccinated at the clinic.

---

The clinic vaccinated **130 children**. This is calculated by subtracting the number of adults (80% of 650 = 520) from the total vaccinated population: 650 − 520 = **130 children**.

---

## Calculation

- **Total vaccinated individuals**: 650
- **Percentage of adults**: 80%
- **Number of adults**: 80% of 650 = 0.80 × 650 = 520
- **Number of children**: Total vaccinated individuals − Number of adults = 650 − 520 = 130

---

Therefore, **130 children** were vaccinated at the clinic.

Impact of Vaccinating Preschool-Aged Children and Older Adults

Vaccinating both preschool-aged children and older adults averted more cases than vaccinating either population alone. For example, with a 50% vaccine efficacy, vaccinating both populations (55 people/2,500 population) averted a median of 35–123 cases, 88–304 missed productive days, and 3–11 ambulatory care visits compared with no vaccination (10%–80% vaccination coverage). As Figures 1C and 2C show, the combinations of vaccination cost and coverage that would be cost effective and cost saving fell between vaccinating either age group alone. With a 75% vaccine efficacy (10% coverage), vaccination was cost effective at ≤ $575 and cost saving at ≤ $450.

### An assessment of the vaccination of school-aged children in england against SARS-CoV-2 [^a56f40dc]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Children and young persons are known to have a high number of close interactions, often within the school environment, which can facilitate rapid spread of infection; yet for SARS-CoV-2, it is the elderly and vulnerable that suffer the greatest health burden. Vaccination, initially targeting the elderly and vulnerable before later expanding to the entire adult population, has been transformative in the control of SARS-CoV-2 in England. However, early concerns over adverse events and the lower risk associated with infection in younger individuals means that the expansion of the vaccine programme to those under 18 years of age needs to be rigorously and quantitatively assessed.

Methods

Here, using a bespoke mathematical model matched to case and hospital data for England, we consider the potential impact of vaccinating 12–17 and 5-11-year-olds. This analysis is reported from an early model (generated in June 2021) that formed part of the evidence base for the decisions in England, and a later model (from November 2021) that benefits from a richer understanding of vaccine efficacy, greater knowledge of the Delta variant wave and uses data on the rate of vaccine administration. For both models, we consider the population wide impact of childhood vaccination as well as the specific impact on the age groups targeted for vaccination.

Results

Projections from June suggested that an expansion of the vaccine programme to those 12–17 years old could generate substantial reductions in infection, hospital admission and deaths in the entire population, depending on population behaviour following the relaxation of control measures. The benefits within the 12-17-year-old cohort were less marked, saving between 660 and 1100 (95% PI (prediction interval) 280–2300) hospital admissions and between 22 and 38 (95% PI 9–91) deaths depending on assumed population behaviour. For the more recent model, the benefits within this age group are reduced, saving on average 630 (95% PI 300–1300) hospital admissions and 11 (95% PI 5–28) deaths for 80% vaccine uptake, while the benefits to the wider population represent a reduction of 8–10% in hospital admissions and deaths. The vaccination of 5-11-year-olds is projected to have a far smaller impact, in part due to the later roll-out of vaccines to this age group.

Conclusions

Vaccination of 12-170-year-olds and 5-11-year-olds is projected to generate a reduction in infection, hospital admission and deaths for both the age groups involved and the population in general. For any decision involving childhood vaccination, these benefits needs to be balanced against potential adverse events from the vaccine, the operational constraints on delivery and the potential for diverting resources from other public health campaigns.

### Global estimates of lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination during 2020–2024 [^3045688f]. JAMA Health Forum (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Estimating global lives and life-years saved is important to put into perspective the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, and lack crucial life-year calculations and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.

Objective

To calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 1, 2024.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study considered different strata of the worldwide population according to age, community-dwelling and long-term care residence status, pre-Omicron and Omicron periods, and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Exposures

Any COVID-19 vaccination in any schedule and number of doses.

Main Outcome Measure

Death.

Results

In the main analysis, more than 2.5 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were during the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years or older. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives were saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed a preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. An estimated 14.8 million life-years were saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). The sensitivity range was 7.4 to 23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76%) were among people 60 years or older, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults aged 20 through 29 years (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.

Conclusions and Relevance

Estimates in this study are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during the years 2020–2024. Most benefits in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of older persons, a minority of the global population.

### COVID-19 vaccines for children and adolescents in Africa: aligning our priorities to situational realities [^64a1767e]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

How do COVID-19 vaccination trends and vaccine approvals for children in Africa compare with other countries?

When COVID-19 vaccines were initially approved for use, countries almost exclusively prioritised vaccinating the adult population. More than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of countries have modified their vaccination programmes to include a wider range of non-adults. There are at least two reasons driving adjustments to vaccination strategies in many countries. First, accumulating evidence from vaccine trials supports the safe and effective use of COVID-19 vaccines in CA aged 2–17 years. As such, some regulatory agencies have begun to approve COVID-19 vaccines for dissemination in younger CA. For example, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was initially available under emergency use authorisation for individuals aged 16 years and older. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved this vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in children aged 12 years and older, which has since been expanded to include children from 5 to 11 years of age. Second, the extent of COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the adult population of some countries reached a threshold that authorities considered sufficient for expanding coverage to younger CA. For example, Spain has completed vaccinating the groups it prioritised first, especially people aged 80 years and above (100% fully vaccinated), and the country is currently vaccinating CA.

### Uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations amongst 3, 433, 483 children and young people: meta-analysis of UK prospective cohorts [^4d966f8e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

Our main outcomes were time to COVID-19 vaccinations under the primary vaccination schedule and the booster vaccination programme while accounting for competing events of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death. Individuals were followed up from the date of eligibility for their first primary dose, which was based on their age at entry into the cohort.

Population characteristics and covariates

Several factors have been shown to affect vaccine uptake in UK populations. To enable a comprehensive meta-analysis, we were limited to factors available to all four UK nations. Four factors were selected for investigation: age, sex, vaccination status of the adults in the household, and the number of people in the same household. The number of people in the household (household n) is a count of the number of individuals (both adults and children) living at the same address, with categories grouped as 2, 3, 4, and 5 +. The household vaccination status was classified as fully vaccinated if all adults in the same household had received their first vaccine, partially vaccinated if at least one, but not all the adults had received their first vaccine, and unvaccinated if no adults in the household had received their first vaccination.

Age was grouped according to the vaccine schedule groupings: 16–17, 12–15, and 5–11 years old and were defined at the start of eligibility for the following age range (e.g. if they turned 16 after the 16–17 rollout, but before the 12–15 vaccine rollout, they were included in the 16–17 age-group at the start of their eligibility). If this resolution of age data was unavailable, the age on a specified date was used.

We include an extended study period and additional covariates that have been shown to influence vaccine uptake in other studies –, including ethnicity, deprivation and urbanicity, in the form of a sensitivity analysis where possible, as these were not available for all regions.

### Should children be vaccinated against COVID-19? [^08b1039a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Whether all children under 12 years of age should be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains an ongoing debate. The relatively low risk posed by acute COVID-19 in children, and uncertainty about the relative harms from vaccination and disease mean that the balance of risk and benefit of vaccination in this age group is more complex. One of the key arguments for vaccinating healthy children is to protect them from long-term consequences. Other considerations include population-level factors, such as reducing community transmission, vaccine supply, cost, and the avoidance of quarantine, school closures and other lockdown measures. The emergence of new variants of concern necessitates continual re-evaluation of the risks and benefits. In this review, we do not argue for or against vaccinating children against COVID-19 but rather outline the points to consider and highlight the complexity of policy decisions on COVID-19 vaccination in this age group.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of vaccines to prevent seasonal influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ddc98f39]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Influenza is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that are transmitted efficiently from human to human. Globally, seasonal influenza affects 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children every yearand is responsible for 3–5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths every year. The continuing evolution of seasonal influenza viruses, which limits the ability of our immune system to fight effectively the infection, is associated with the recurrent burden of seasonal epidemics. The socioeconomic costs incurred by each influenza season are estimated at USD 87 billion per year.

Influenza vaccination is a pillar of public health and is focused on people at high risk of complications - pregnant women, children, the elderly and immunocompromised, and persons with chronic illnesses - as well as those who live with or care for persons at high risk. The World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination for all high-risk groups. The American Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all persons aged ≥ 6 months without contraindications receive routine annual vaccination with a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine. These recommendations do not favor any particular type of vaccine over others. They reflect the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), generally designed to test a vaccine against placebo but limiting the ability of single studies to inform immunization strategies on the most appropriate vaccine options.

Network meta-analyses (NMAs) can be applied to estimate comparative efficacy, summarize and interpret the available evidence, and identify the best vaccine types for different populations. To date, only one NMA on comparative efficacy of influenza vaccines among HIV-positive people has been published. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic review and NMA to inform influenza vaccination strategies by comparing the efficacy and safety of different types of seasonal influenza vaccines.

### Immune response after a single vaccination against 2009 influenza A H1N1 in USA: a preliminary report of two randomised controlled phase 2 trials [^2eb1eb11]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Data are needed from large clinical trials of paediatric, adult, and elderly people to find the appropriate antigen dose and vaccination schedule for the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. We therefore report preliminary safety and immunogenicity results after one injection of a licensed monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine in the USA.

Methods

We randomly assigned healthy children (aged 6–35 months and 3–9 years) and adults (18–64 years and ≥ 65 years) to vaccine containing per dose 7.5 microg (children and adults), 15 microg (children and adults), or 30 microg (adults only) haemagglutinin in two placebo-controlled, observer-masked, multicentre phase 2 studies done in the USA. Participants were allocated with an interactive voice-response system or computer-generated randomisation lists with opaque scratchable patches. Primary outcome was haemagglutination inhibition antibody response 21 days after the first of two planned vaccinations (interim analysis of studies in progress). Analyses were by full-analysis set. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00953524 and NCT00952419.

Findings

410 of 423 children and 724 of 750 adults given an active vaccine, and 50 of 51 children and 95 of 99 adults given placebo were assessed for immunogenicity on day 21. After active vaccination, 45 of 101 (45%; 95% CI 35–55) to 47 of 94 (50%; 40–61) infants aged 6–35 months, 75 of 109 (69%; 59–77) to 80 of 106 (75%; 66–83) 3-9-year-old children, 134 of 141 (95%; 90–98) to 144 of 144 (100%; 98–100) of 18-64-year-old adults, and 93 of 100 (93%; 86–96) to 93 of 98 (95%; 89–98) elderly adults were seroprotected (proportion with titres ≥ 1:40). No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. Injection-site and systemic reactions were reported by up to about 50% of every age and vaccine group, with no noticeable differences between vaccine and placebo groups.

Interpretation

One dose of vaccine was highly immunogenic in adults, suggesting that it afforded sufficient protection against this pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus. Two doses of vaccine will probably be needed in children younger than 9 years. Safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine were acceptable and similar to those of seasonal vaccine.

### Recommended schedules for routine immunization of children and adults [^81aaae4a]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Vaccine recommendations continue to evolve as a result of new vaccines, safety considerations, changing disease incidence (e.g., polio), and public health priorities. The pace of discovery is accelerating and advisory committees will need to respond accordingly. Each vaccine, new or old, will be required to earn its place in the routine immunization schedule on the basis of public health benefit or cost-benefit studies.

### Community mitigation guidelines to prevent pandemic influenza-United States, 2017 [^97a6864e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

H1N1 and children — Pandemic influenza epidemiology might differ from seasonal influenza, and during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic there was a substantial pediatric impact; an estimated 43–89 million people in the United States were infected with H1N1pdm09 virus during April 2009–April 2010, and approximately 12,000 people died, and over the course of the pandemic an estimated 86,000 children were hospitalized in the United States, which is 2–3 times the number admitted during a typical influenza season. On August 28, 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that children be placed higher on the priority list for receiving the monovalent H1N1 vaccine, which became available in October 2009. Children at risk commonly had underlying conditions, with approximately 60% of hospitalized children having one or more compared with 80% of hospitalized adults; severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 virus infection were most common among children and young adults rather than adults aged ≥ 65 years, and the number of deaths among children also was more than twice as high as during a regular influenza season.

### COVID-19 vaccine basics… [^7076a174]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness.
- Different COVID-19 vaccines may work in our bodies differently but all provide protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. Overview Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left with a supply of "memory" T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal signs the body is building immunity. mRNA vaccines To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines.

Instead, mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein — or even just a piece of a protein — that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This immune response, which produces antibodies, is what helps protect us from getting sick from that germ in the future. How mRNA COVID-19 vaccines work
- First, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle or upper thigh, depending on the age of who is getting vaccinated.
- After vaccination, the mRNA will enter the muscle cells. Once inside, they use the cells' machinery to produce a harmless piece of what is called the spike protein. The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After the protein piece is made, our cells break down the mRNA and remove it, leaving the body as waste.
- At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to help protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

The benefit is that people get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the potentially serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19. Any side effects from getting the vaccine are normal signs the body is building protection. Research for mRNA technology Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades.
- In fact, mRNA vaccines have been studied before for flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus.
- Beyond vaccines, cancer research has also used mRNA to trigger the immune system to target specific cancer cells. Protein subunit vaccines Protein subunit vaccines contain pieces of the virus that causes COVID-19. These virus pieces are the spike protein. The vaccine also contains another ingredient called an adjuvant that helps the immune system respond to that spike protein in the future.

Once the immune system knows how to respond to the spike protein, the immune system will be able to respond quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect you against COVID-19. How protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines work
- Protein subunit COVID-19 vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. After vaccination, nearby cells pick up these proteins.
- Next, our immune system recognizes that these proteins do not belong there. Another ingredient in the vaccine, the adjuvant, helps our immune system to produce antibodies and activate other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. This is what your body might do if you got sick with COVID-19.
- At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to help protect against future infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The benefit is that people get this protection from a vaccine, without ever having to risk the potentially serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.

COVID-19 Vaccine COVID 19-vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. Vaccination remains the safest strategy for avoiding hospitalizations, long-term health outcomes, and death. CDC recommends an updated COVID-19 vaccine for most adults ages 18 years and older. Parents of children ages 6 months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with a health care provider.

### Potential clinical and economic value of norovirus vaccination in the community setting [^70018ff4]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With norovirus vaccine candidates currently under development, now is the time to identify the vaccine characteristics and implementation thresholds at which vaccination becomes cost effective and cost saving in a community setting.

Methods

In 2020, a norovirus transmission, clinical, and economics computational simulation model representing different U.S. population segments was developed to simulate the spread of norovirus and the potential impact of vaccinating children aged < 5 years and older adults (aged ≥ 65 years).

Results

Compared with no vaccination, vaccinating preschool-aged children averted 8%-72% of symptomatic norovirus cases in a community, whereas vaccinating older adults averted 2%-29% of symptomatic cases (varying with vaccine efficacy [25%-75%] and vaccination coverage [10%-80%]). Vaccination with a 25% vaccine efficacy was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ≤ $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year) when vaccination cost ≤ $445 and cost saving at ≤ $370 when vaccinating preschool-aged children and ≤ $42 and ≤ $30, respectively, when vaccinating older adults. With a 50% vaccine efficacy, vaccination was cost effective when it cost ≤ $1,190 and cost saving at ≤ $930 when vaccinating preschool-aged children and ≤ $110 and ≤ $64, respectively, when vaccinating older adults. These cost thresholds (cost effective and cost saving, respectively) further increased with a 75% vaccine efficacy to ≤ $1,600 and ≤ $1,300 for preschool-aged children and ≤ $165 and ≤ $100 for older adults.

Conclusions

This study outlines thresholds at which a norovirus vaccine would be cost effective and cost saving in the community when vaccinating children aged < 5 years and older adults. Establishing these thresholds can help provide decision makers with targets to consider when developing and implementing a norovirus vaccine.

### Safety outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination and infection in 5.1 million children in england [^056cc4dd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The United Kingdom (UK) approved COVID-19 vaccination for all children aged 12 and over in September 2021. This was extended to 5–11-year-olds in April 2022 in a one-off programme offering a primary course of COVID-19 vaccination to children who were not in a vulnerable or high-risk group. Despite uptake being very high in adults, with over 80% receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of 11th May 2023, uptake has been lower in children, with 62% of 16–17-year-olds, 46% of 12–15-year-olds and 10% of 5–11-year-olds being vaccinated against COVID-19. In the UK, the vast majority of vaccinated children received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine, as the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised against using ChAdOX1 (AstraZeneca) in people under 40 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna/SpikeVax) in children under 18 during the time period that most children were vaccinated. Those aged 12 years and above were given a full dose of BNT162b2 vaccine (30 micrograms), and children aged 5–11 years were given a dose of 10 micrograms of BNT162b2 vaccine.

### Vaccination coverage among persons with asthma – United States, 2010–2011 influenza season [^564c9cdf]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

This report provides the first update of influenza vaccination coverage among the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population of persons with current asthma since ACIP recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months beginning with the 2010–11 influenza season. Vaccination coverage among persons with current asthma has increased from 36% during the 2005–06 influenza season †† to 50% during the 2010–11 season, with coverage increasing for all age groups.

What is already known on this topic?

Although persons with asthma historically have had higher influenza vaccination coverage than persons without asthma, coverage remains lower than Healthy People 2020 targets.

What is added by this report?

Analysis of 2010 and 2011 National Health Interview Survey data shows that influenza vaccine coverage during the 2010–11 season among persons with asthma was 50%, up from 36% during the 2005–06 season, but coverage across all age groups remained well below Healthy People 2020 targets of 80% for children aged 6 months–17 years and 90% for adults aged ≥ 18 years who are at high risk.

The survey participation rate was 14.4%, with a final sample of 1007 adults. Among these, 524 (51.4%) were women, 113 (18.1%) were aged 18 to 29 years, 375 (30.7%) were aged 60 years or older, 645 (62.6%) were White, and 170 (20.3%) reported fair or poor health (Table).

Table.
Public High-Priority Ratings for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine Allocation by Subpopulation

The Figure demonstrates respondents' high willingness to allocate vaccine preferentially to front-line medical workers (937 respondents [91.6%] rated them high priority), high-risk children (807 respondents [81.0%] rated them high priority), and high-risk older adults (799 respondents [80.6%] rated them high priority). Respondents also reported priority for middle-aged people with higher risk (745 respondents [75.2%] rated them high priority) and for essential (nonmedical) workers (743 respondents [72.0%] rated them high priority). Fewer respondents reported high priority for pregnant people (627 respondents [64.0%] rated them high priority). While respondents ranked people with moderate mortality risk the lowest, they were more likely to give higher priority to children (348 respondents [39.2%] rated them high priority) than adults (242 respondents [29.0%] rated them high priority). A total of 142 respondents (17.7%) ranked all 8 groups as high priority.

### Uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations amongst 3, 433, 483 children and young people: meta-analysis of UK prospective cohorts [^fa6d3ed4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Northern Ireland's results for 5–11 year-olds were excluded from the meta-analysis due to small numbers.

Compared to 16–17 year-olds, CYP aged 12–15 were 42% less likely to receive the first vaccine (aHR 0.58, 95%CI 0.43–0.77), and 90% less likely to receive the booster vaccine (aHR 0.10, 95%CI 0.06–0.19) having adjusted for sex, number of residents in the household and household vaccination status. However, there was insufficient evidence to detect a difference for second vaccine (aHR 0.72, 95%CI 0.40–1.28). CYP aged 5–11 years old were 90% less likely to receive first vaccine (aHR 0.10, 95%CI 0.06–0.19) and 46% less likely (aHR 0.54, 95%CI 0.37–0.80) to receive their second vaccine compared to 16–17 year-olds having adjusted for all other factors (Table 3). Males were 7% less likely (aHR 0.93, 95%CI 0.89–0.97) to receive their first vaccine compared to females and 5% less likely (aHR 0.95, 95%CI 0.92–0.99) to receive their second vaccine, having adjusted for all other factors. CYP in a household of two were 11% (aHR 0.89, 95%CI 0.80–0.94) and 7% (aHR 0.93, 95%CI 0.89–0.97) less likely to receive their first and second doses compared to households of three residents, respectively. Households with five or more residents showed no difference in uptake of their first vaccine compared to households of 3 residents but were 8% (aHR 0.92, 95%CI 0.87–0.96) and 20% (aHR 0.80, 95%CI 0.77–0.84) less likely to receive their second or booster dose, respectively. In contrast, CYP in a household of four people were more likely to receive their first (aHR 1.12, 95%CI 1.08–1.16) and second vaccine (aHR 1.06, 95%CI 1.04–1.08) compared to households of 3 residents.

### Adult vaccination [^ee0ea56a]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Adult vaccination rates are low in the United States, despite clear benefits for reducing morbidity and mortality. Vaccine science is evolving rapidly, and family physicians must maintain familiarity with the most recent guidelines. The recommended adult immunization schedule is updated annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All eligible patients should receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the current guidelines. Adults without contraindications should also receive an annual influenza vaccine. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for adults with specific risk factors. All pregnant patients, adults younger than 60 years, and those 60 years and older who have risk factors should receive a hepatitis B vaccine. A 15- or 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all patients who are 65 years and older. Patients who receive 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should receive a dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. Adults 19 to 64 years of age should receive a pneumococcal vaccination if they have medical risk factors. A single dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is recommended for adults without presumptive immunity, and additional doses are recommended for patients with HIV and postdelivery for pregnant patients who are not immune to rubella. A tetanus and diphtheria toxoids booster is recommended every 10 years. For pregnant patients and those in close contact with young infants, a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine should be administered. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended for all people through 26 years of age. Herpes zoster vaccine is indicated for all adults 50 years and older.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^8f02da76]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) waning — evidence summary relevant to children: Immunity after influenza vaccination can wane over time, with studies in adults suggesting that very early vaccination (July or August) might be associated with suboptimal immunity before season end and the CDC now discourages influenza vaccination in the summer months for most adults, though the data are less definitive in children. Multiseason analyses found VE declined by approximately 7% per month for influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B and by 6% to 11% per month for influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in individuals 9 years and older, with VE remaining greater than 0 for at least 5 to 6 months after vaccination; in children older than 2 years, odds of infection increased approximately 16% with each additional 28 days after vaccination. Another study across the 2011 to 2012 through the 2013 to 2014 influenza seasons showed 54% to 67% protection from 0 to 180 days after vaccination, while a single center study of 3595 children in 2017 to 2018 reported overall VE of 52% with no evidence of waning up to 183 days after vaccination (median, 81 [interquartile range, 52–111] days). Collectively, these studies support the current recommendation to immunize children as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available.

### Global landscape of COVID-19 vaccination programmes for older adults: a descriptive study [^f1dae293]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2024). High credibility.

Background

To minimise severe cases and deaths from COVID-19 among high-risk populations such as older adults (aged 60 years and older), it is crucial to monitor and update vaccination strategies. In this study, we aim to provide a global profile of the current COVID-19 vaccination programmes for older adults, including vaccination policies, coverage rates, and vaccine demand.

Methods

We used publicly available data on the COVID-19 vaccines used, vaccination schedules, indicated age groups, and age-specific country-level vaccine coverage, updated through to July 20, 2024. Data on vaccination policy were extracted from publicly available sources in the following priority: (1) official sources (ie, government websites, health department websites, and official reports); (2) resources integrated by institutions or organisations (ie, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Africa Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and COVAX); and (3) cross-validated news and media reports derived from government or health department sources. We estimated coverage gaps to achievement of two specific objectives: (1) immunising 100% of older adults with primary series and a booster dose, as per WHO's goal; and (2) surpassing WHO's goal by administering one extra booster dose to 80% of older adults or achieving 80% coverage of a 2023–24 series vaccine.

Findings

192 countries reported their use of COVID-19 vaccines for older people, of which 71 vaccine products have been used for older adults and 79 countries have deployed 22 vaccines containing components against variants of concern; 122 countries offered a second booster dose or a special booster dose, while others used only primary series or one booster dose. 96 countries prioritised older people for vaccination. Among countries with available data, the median proportion of individuals completing a primary series was 81% (IQR 58.3–92.0), for a first booster was 53% (14.1–81.7), for a second booster was 44.3% (13.5–69.7), and for a 2023–24 series vaccination was 23.6% (6.6–52.4), with large differences by region. Coverage of the second booster and the 2023–24 series was lower in individuals aged 60–70 years than in older age groups. To achieve the WHO target of 100% coverage for older populations with primary series and a booster dose, 1.01 doses per person are required, and to attain an 80% coverage for a second booster or 2023–24 series, surpassing WHO's goal, 1.43 doses per person are required.

Interpretation

Progress of COVID-19 vaccination programmes for older adults is uneven across countries, emphasising an ongoing challenge to achieve vaccine equity for this high-risk age group. Therefore, it is essential to establish robust and timely vaccination surveillance systems, especially to facilitate data-driven policies that promote COVID-19 vaccination campaigns worldwide.

### Childhood immunisation: what is the future? [^245c7fcc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Improved immunisation programmes and the development of new vaccines provide unprecedented opportunities to improve and sustain the health of our children. There are major challenges ahead in communicating the benefits of immunisation to all populations and in delivering vaccines to those in greatest need. In this review on immunisation, I have asked international opinion leaders to comment on the present and the future of immunisation to provide signposts for the narrative.

### Chickenpox [^b8748a21]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chickenpox is extremely contagious. Over 90% of unvaccinated people become infected, but infection occurs at different ages in different parts of the world - over 80% of people have been infected by the age of 10 years in the USA, the UK, and Japan, and by the age of 20–30 years in India, South East Asia, and the West Indies.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in healthy adults and children? What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in children exposed prenatally? What are the effects of interventions to prevent chickenpox in immunocompromised adults and children? What are the effects of treatments for chickenpox in healthy adults and children? What are the effects of treatments for chickenpox in immunocompromised adults and children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to March 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acyclovir, famciclovir, live attenuated vaccine, valaciclovir, varicella zoster immunoglobulin, and zoster immunoglobulin.

### New COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among adults, by vaccination status-new york, may 3-July 25, 2021 [^0b348923]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

By July 25, 2021, a total of 10,145,974 (65.6%) New York adults aged ≥ 18 years were fully vaccinated; 860,640 (5.6%) were partially vaccinated. Among fully vaccinated adults, 51.3% had received Pfizer-BioNTech, 39.9% had received Moderna, and 8.8% had received Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines. During May 3–July 25, a total of 9,664 new cases (1.31 per 100,000 person-days) occurred among fully vaccinated adults, compared with 42,507 (9.80 per 100,000 person-days) among unvaccinated adults (Table). Most (97.8%) new cases among fully vaccinated persons occurred ≥ 7 days after being classified fully vaccinated (median = 77 days; IQR = 49–103). During May 3–July 25, case rates among fully vaccinated persons were generally similar across age groups, as were case rates among unvaccinated persons, declining through the end of June before increasing in July (Figure 1). Weekly estimated VE against new laboratory-confirmed infection during May 3–July 25 for all age groups generally declined, going from 91.8% to 71.6% for persons aged 18–49 years, 92.9% to 78.0% for persons aged 50–64 years, and 90.5% to 80.0% for persons aged ≥ 65 years. During May 3–July 25, the overall, age-adjusted VE against infection declined from 91.8% to 75.0% (Figure 1) (Table).

### Considerations for vaccinating children against COVID-19 [^ba526df9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Given the very high prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 in LMICs, vaccination against COVID-19 is an important consideration in all age groups, including children. However, decisions should be made considering the direct benefits to the individual child, not broader benefits to the household, educational setting or community, particularly as the effectiveness against infection is transient. The WHO has recently emphasised that LMICs should prioritise providing COVID-19 booster doses to people at high risk, including pregnant women. Countries may then consider vaccinating adolescents followed by younger children, in accordance with the age-based risk-benefit of vaccination and in the context of other health priorities. Importantly, if COVID-19 vaccines are made available to children, the opportunity should be taken to increase coverage of routine childhood vaccines and opportunistically provide preventative healthcare and treatment at each encounter with the health system. This will help to address the indirect adverse effects of the pandemic on children.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^21c3d1ac]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Influenza vaccine timing — children and adolescents: "Influenza vaccine should be offered as soon as it becomes available, especially to children who require 2 doses, with the recommended dose(s) ideally received by the end of October", and "Influenza vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season". This timing "differs from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation that most adults, particularly those ≥ 65 years, not be immunized in July and August because of a concern about waning immunity".

### Estimated number of lives directly saved by COVID-19 vaccination programmes in the WHO European region from December, 2020, to March, 2023: a retrospective surveillance study [^42f77db2]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

By March, 2023, 54 countries, areas, and territories (hereafter CAT) in the WHO European Region had reported more than 2.2 million COVID-19-related deaths to the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Here, we estimated how many lives were directly saved by vaccinating adults in the WHO European Region from December, 2020, to March, 2023.

Methods

In this retrospective surveillance study, we estimated the number of lives directly saved by age group, vaccine dose, and circulating variant-of-concern (VOC) period, regionally and nationally, using weekly data on COVID-19 mortality and infection, COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and SARS-CoV-2 virus characterisations by lineage downloaded from The European Surveillance System on June 11, 2023, as well as vaccine effectiveness data from the literature. We included data for six age groups (25–49 years, 50–59 years, ≥ 60 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and ≥ 80 years). To be included in the analysis, CAT needed to have reported both COVID-19 vaccination and mortality data for at least one of the four older age groups. Only CAT that reported weekly data for both COVID-19 vaccination and mortality by age group for 90% of study weeks or more in the full study period were included. We calculated the percentage reduction in the number of expected and reported deaths.

Findings

Between December, 2020, and March, 2023, in 34 of 54 CAT included in the analysis, COVID-19 vaccines reduced deaths by 59% overall (CAT range 17–82%), representing approximately 1.6 million lives saved (range 1.5–1.7 million) in those aged 25 years or older: 96% of lives saved were aged 60 years or older and 52% were aged 80 years or older; first boosters saved 51% of lives, and 60% were saved during the Omicron period.

Interpretation

Over nearly 2.5 years, most lives saved by COVID-19 vaccination were in older adults by first booster dose and during the Omicron period, reinforcing the importance of up-to-date vaccination among the most at-risk individuals. Further modelling work should evaluate indirect effects of vaccination and public health and social measures.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2020–2021 [^07dd503a]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Influenza vaccination in children — vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization is supported across settings, with the United States New Vaccine Surveillance Network reporting 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34% to 71%) against any influenza-associated hospitalization among 1653 children, 68% (95% CI, 36% to 84%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, and 44% (95% CI, −1% to 69%) against B viruses; in Israel (children 6 months to 8 years; 2015 to 2017), fully vaccinated children had VE 53.9% (95% CI, 38.6% to 68.3%), partial vaccination was not effective (25.6%; 95% CI, −3% to 47%), and VE as high as 60% to 80% occurred when circulating and vaccine strains matched. In Australia in 2018, VE for preventing influenza hospitalization was 78.8% (95% CI, 66.9% to 86.4%). In the United Kingdom in 2018–2019, overall adjusted VE against influenza-confirmed hospitalization was 53% (95% CI, 33.3% to 66.8%), with 63.5% (95% CI, 34.4% to 79.7%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and no protection against influenza A(H3N2). A meta-analysis of 28 studies found VE 57.5% (95% CI, 54.8% to 65.5%) in children 6 months through 17 years, higher for A(H1N1)pdm09 (75.1%; 95% CI, 54.8% to 93.3%) and influenza B (50.9%; 95% CI, 41.7% to 59.9%) versus A(H3N2) (40.8%; 95% CI, 25.6% to 55.9%), with better protection when fully vaccinated (VE 61.8%; 95% CI, 54.4% to 69.1%) compared with partially vaccinated (VE 33.9%; 95% CI, 21.1% to 46.7%) and higher VE in children younger than 5 years (61.7%; 95% CI, 49.3% to 74.1%) than 6 to 17 years (54.4%; 95% CI, 35.1% to 63.6%). The CDC estimated during 2018–2019 that vaccination prevented 20% of projected A(H1N1)pdm09-associated hospitalizations among children 5 through 17 years and 43% among children 6 months through 4 years, and historically, up to 80% of influenza-associated pediatric deaths have occurred in unvaccinated children 6 months old and older.

### Vaccination strategy and challenges for consolidating successful containment of COVID-19 with population immunity in China [^42ad5c41]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

This sequencing is different from that recommended by the World Health Organization for countries with community transmission, in that people at the greatest risk of severe illness were not targeted immediately after healthcare workers. Having zero tolerance for local transmission effectively protects older adults, people with comorbidities, and children in the first, second, and third stages of the campaign. Vaccinating working age adults protects those who make society function and those who can more readily transmit the virus. After adults are vaccinated, children will be the only wholly susceptible population, and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants could cause severe illness in children. Three covid-19 inactivated vaccines are approved for children aged 3 years and older. Although a decision for children under 12 has not been made yet, they are certain to follow adults in China's vaccination campaign.

### Update on vaccination guidelines for older adults [^5460cc9e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Vaccination is a vital component of routine preventative health. Older adults can potentially benefit most from vaccines because they have greater susceptibility to disease and associated complications. The number of infections covered and the types of vaccines available has grown significantly in recent years. Although this represents tremendous progress, it can also result in confusion and missed opportunities to provided recommended vaccinations. This review summarizes the current guidelines for vaccination of older adults and highlights the latest innovations.

### COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among vaccinated and unvaccinated adults 18 years or older in 13 US States, January 2021 to April 2022 [^164619ee]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first year of vaccine availability in the US, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in unvaccinated adults were more than 10 times higher than in vaccinated persons, a salient finding when many eligible Americans remained unvaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines, including booster doses, are strongly associated with prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations, and vaccination is effective in averting serious clinical consequences. To reduce COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality, clinicians and public health practitioners should continue to promote COVID-19 vaccinations with all recommended doses for all eligible persons.

Influenza vaccine waning — Immunity after influenza vaccination can wane over time, and in a cohort of individuals ≥ 6 months the odds of laboratory-confirmed influenza increased 1.09 times every 28 days since vaccination; unlike older persons, individuals < 18 years had lower odds of influenza at subsequent intervals and waning protection was not observed. In children, a systematic review and meta-analysis including 3 studies found antibody levels remained elevated compared with prevaccination levels for 6 months after vaccination, and among vaccine-naive patients 6 to < 24 months of age vaccine effectiveness declined 9% per month in the first 4 months after immunization and then plateaued.

### Public perspectives on COVID-19 vaccine prioritization [^2d9f3b61]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

These 2 surveys involving nearly 5000 US adults reveal remarkable public consensus on controversial questions regarding COVID-19 vaccine allocation. Most respondents agreed that health care workers should be vaccinated first, followed by medically vulnerable people and nursing home residents and staff. The results suggest substantial community-mindedness, as more than 80% of respondents were also willing to wait in line behind teachers, grocery store workers, and people in Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Respondents prioritized these groups over healthy older adults. Respondents of color were likelier than White respondents to favor giving priority to younger individuals. The public's views generally comport with NASEM's and ACIP's vaccine distribution recommendations, although the public places lower priority on vaccinating healthy older adults. Five points with policy relevance bear emphasis.

### Technologies for assessing vaccine responses in the very young [^adfbf9cd]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Many vaccines are administered to young children in order to prevent infectious diseases early in life. At the same time, most of these vaccines are not developed specifically with the immune system of young children in mind and our understanding of how newborn immune systems differ from adult counterparts is incomplete. The main reason for this lack of understanding stems from the ethical and logistical difficulties in obtaining samples from young children as well as the challenges associated with the small volume samples available. Here I review some recent developments made in this field and discuss their implications for studying vaccine responses in young children and developing better vaccines, tailored to this important population of susceptible individuals in the future.

### Global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination: descriptive study [^c0ac9029]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Results

Global prospective

We start by evaluating the full scope of a universal vaccine programme that does not have priority groups. The global target population would be 7.8 billion people (fig 2). If young children (0–4 years) and school aged children and young people (5–19 years) were not initially prioritised or eligible for vaccination, the target population would be 5.2 billion people (95% confidence interval 5.1 to 5.2 billion; table 1).

Table 1
Estimates of target population sizes for covid-19 vaccination by goal of vaccination programme

Covid-19 = coronavirus disease 2019.

Data are presented as means (95% confidence intervals) by using bootstrap method.

By analysing and modelling national, regional, and country specific data on occupation, demography, and health conditions, we can parse out the total population in different priority groups based on three main vaccination objectives. If vaccines are preferentially allocated to priority workers to help maintain societal functions, the global target population is 258.3 million (95% confidence interval 241.7 to 279.7 million), including 40.7 million (15.8%) healthcare workers, 46.9 million (18.2%) police and military staff, and 170.7 million (66.1%; 95% confidence interval 154.1 to 192.1 million; 63.8% to 68.7%) people who maintain critical infrastructure and other important services. This figure represents 5.0% (95% confidence interval 4.7% to 5.4%) of the total population (table 1).

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2014 [^43cc5741]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Vaccines are recommended for adults on the basis of their age, prior vaccinations, health conditions, lifestyle, occupation, and travel. Reasons for current low levels of vaccination coverage for adult vaccines are multifactorial and include limited awareness among the public about vaccines for adults and gaps in incorporation of regular assessments of vaccine needs and vaccination into routine medical care. Updated standards for immunization of adults were approved by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in September 2013. These standards acknowledge the current low levels of vaccination coverage among adults and the role that all health-care providers, including those who do not offer all recommended adult vaccines in their practices, have in ensuring that their patients are up-to-date on recommended vaccines. NVAC recommends that providers assess vaccination needs for their patients at each visit, recommend needed vaccines, and then, ideally, offer the vaccine or, if the provider does not stock the needed vaccines, refer the patient to a provider who does vaccinate. Vaccinating providers should also ensure that patients and their referring health-care providers have documentation of the vaccination.

### Uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations amongst 3, 433, 483 children and young people: meta-analysis of UK prospective cohorts [^0bf8ace0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and young people (CYP) can lead to life-threatening COVID-19, transmission within households and schools, and the development of long COVID. Using linked health and administrative data, we investigated vaccine uptake among 3,433,483 CYP aged 5-17years across all UK nations between 4th August 2021 and 31st May 2022. We constructed national cohorts and undertook multi-state modelling and meta-analysis to identify associations between demographic variables and vaccine uptake. We found that uptake of the first COVID-19 vaccine among CYP was low across all four nations compared to other age groups and diminished with subsequent doses. Age and vaccination status of adults living in the same household were identified as important risk factors associated with vaccine uptake in CYP. For example, 5-11year-olds were less likely to receive their first vaccine compared to 16-17year-olds (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR]: 0.10 (95%CI: 0.06–0.19)), and CYP in unvaccinated households were less likely to receive their first vaccine compared to CYP in partially vaccinated households (aHR: 0.19, 95%CI 0.13–0.29).

Main

Multiple vaccines have been developed that offer protection against COVID-19 by generating immune responses against the spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. On 8 December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) started its national vaccination programme with the Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, first used outside a clinical trial on 4 January 2021. Both vaccines have been widely used in the UK.

Vaccines were initially administered to priority groups, including care home residents, people > 80 years old, healthcare workers and those clinically vulnerable (≥ 16 years), and then offered to the rest of the adult (≥ 18 years) population in decreasing age order. To maximize initial coverage, in early January 2021, the dosing interval was extended to 12 weeks for all vaccines, regardless of the licensed dosing schedule. Up until 6 April 2021, 31.7 million people (60.2% of the population aged ≥ 18 years) have been given a first dose, and 5.7 million people (10.8%) have received two vaccine doses.

### COVID-19 vaccine trials with children: ethics pointers [^7ab241ba]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Some ethics Q&A when implementing COVID-19 vaccine trials with children

Guidelines and normative documents on vaccine clinical trials with children in many countries and regions were written before the COVID-19 outbreak. The scale of the threat posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, however, cutting across borders, age groups, race, socioeconomic situation, gender and sexual orientation, is unprecedented. There is an urgent need to immunise as many people as possible and as quickly as possible. Yet, there is an equally important need to avoid exposing people to excessive risks, especially children. Moreover in some countries, as some vaccines are undergoing clinical trials involving children, other vaccines have already been approved for use among adults and some minors. In other countries, mostly LMICs, vaccines are yet to be made available even for vulnerable and adult populations. These differences and the impellent need to vaccinate populations generate novel ethical questions that were not at the fore prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some jurisdictions, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration, offer updated guidelines on COVID-19 clinical trials involving children. Many are yet to do so; thus, it is in this vein that as members of the Ethics Working Group of the COVID-19 Research Coalition we offer some ethical 'things to think about' as researchers and IRBs embark on or follow through with COVID-19 clinical trials involving children.

### Vaccines for COVID-19: where do we stand in 2021? [^14a8f491]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

As of July 2021, over 3 billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally, and there are now 19 COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in at least one country. Several of these have been shown to be highly effective both in clinical trials and real-world observational studies, some of which have included special populations of interest. A small number of countries have approved a COVID-19 vaccine for use in adolescents or children. These are laudable achievements, but the global vaccination effort has been challenged by inequitable distribution of vaccines predominantly to high income countries, with only 0.9% of people in low-income countries having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Addressing this inequity is of critical importance and will result in better control of SARS-CoV-2 globally. Other challenges include: the reduced protection from COVID-19 vaccines against some strains of SARS-CoV-2, necessitating the development of variant specific vaccines; and uncertainties around the duration of protection from vaccine-induced immunity.

### Global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination: descriptive study [^9877095e]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To provide global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) vaccination to inform country specific immunisation strategies on a global scale.

Design

Descriptive study.

Setting

194 member states of the World Health Organization.

Population

Target populations for covid-19 vaccination based on country specific characteristics and vaccine objectives (maintaining essential core societal services; reducing severe covid-19; reducing symptomatic infections and stopping virus transmission).

Main Outcome Measure

Size of target populations for covid-19 vaccination. Estimates use country specific data on population sizes stratified by occupation, age, risk factors for covid-19 severity, vaccine acceptance, and global vaccine production. These data were derived from a multipronged search of official websites, media sources, and academic journal articles.

Results

Target population sizes for covid-19 vaccination vary markedly by vaccination goal and geographical region. Differences in demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers lead to highly variable estimates of target populations at regional and country levels. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (63.0 million, 8.9%) and people with underlying conditions (265.9 million, 37.4%); these two categories are essential in maintaining societal functions and reducing severe covid-19, respectively. In contrast, South East Asia has the highest share of healthy adults (777.5 million, 58.9%), a key target for reducing community transmission. Vaccine hesitancy will probably impact future covid-19 vaccination programmes; based on a literature review, 68.4% (95% confidence interval 64.2% to 72.6%) of the global population is willing to receive covid-19 vaccination. Therefore, the adult population willing to be vaccinated is estimated at 3.7 billion (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 4.1 billion).

Conclusions

The distribution of target groups at country and regional levels highlights the importance of designing an equitable and efficient plan for vaccine prioritisation and allocation. Each country should evaluate different strategies and allocation schemes based on local epidemiology, underlying population health, projections of available vaccine doses, and preference for vaccination strategies that favour direct or indirect benefits.

Again considering the impact on the entire population of vaccinating this youngest age group (bottom row, Fig. 5) highlights that vaccination of 5–11-year-olds has a minimal effect on the rest of population, partly due to the late start of the vaccine campaign meaning older individuals are already protected by immunisation or infection.

### Effectiveness of a pay-it-forward intervention compared with user-paid vaccination to improve influenza vaccine uptake and community engagement among children and older adults in China: a quasi-experimental pragmatic trial [^6d742fa1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Results

In total, 184 children's caregivers and 182 older adults were approached at the three study sites (figure). 41 people declined to participate before being assigned a treatment group and 25 had received the influenza vaccine in the past year. In total, 150 people were enrolled in the standard-of-care group and 150 in the pay-it-forward group (table 1). All 300 responses were screened for completeness and were included in the final statistical analyses.

Figure
Trial profile

Table 1
Characteristics of recruited child caregivers and older adults (≥ 60 years)

55 (37%) of 150 people in the standard-of-care group (40 [53%] of 75 children and 15 [20%] of 75 older adults) and 111 (74%) of 150 in the pay-it-forward group (66 [88%] of 75 children and 45 [60%] of 75 older adults) received an influenza vaccine (appendix p 11). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) in table 2 suggest that people in the pay-it-forward group were more likely to receive the vaccine than people in the standard-of-care group among children (aOR 6.7 [95% CI 2.7–16.6]) and older adults (5.0 [2.3–10.8]).

Table 2
Multivariable logistic regression to compare influenza vaccine uptake rates between the standard-of-care and pay-it-forward groups

High proportions of participants reported being confident about vaccine safety (215 [75%] of 285; 15 [5%] of 300 participants were excluded as they had missing data for vaccine confidence variables), importance (224 [79%]), and effectiveness (210 [74%]). Compared with child caregivers and older adults in the standard-of-care group, people in the pay-it-forward group were more likely to be confident about influenza vaccine safety (83% vs 67%; aOR 2.2 [95% CI 1.2–3.9]), vaccine importance (88% vs 69%; 3.1 [1.6–5.9]), and vaccine effectiveness (85% vs 62%; 3.1 [1.7–5.7]; table 3). We observed no serious adverse events adverse events among all participants.

### Vaccines for older adults [^08b9305c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The proportion of the global population aged 65 and older is rapidly increasing. Infections in this age group, most recently with SARS-CoV-2, cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Major improvements have been made in vaccines for older people, either through the addition of novel adjuvants-as in the new recombinant zoster vaccine and an adjuvanted influenza vaccine-or by increasing antigen concentration, as in influenza vaccines. In this article we review improvements in immunization for the three most important vaccine preventable diseases of aging. The recombinant zoster vaccine has an efficacy of 90% that is minimally affected by the age of the person being vaccinated and persists for more than four years. Increasing antigen dose or inclusion of adjuvant has improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in older adults, although the relative effectiveness of the enhanced influenza vaccines and the durability of the immune response are the focus of ongoing clinical trials. Conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines have similar efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by vaccine serotypes in older adults. Their relative value varies by setting, depending on the prevalence of vaccine serotypes, largely related to conjugate vaccine coverage in children. Improved efficacy will increase public confidence and uptake of these vaccines. Co-administration of these vaccines is feasible and important for maximal uptake in older people. Development of new vaccine platforms has accelerated following the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, and will likely result in new vaccines against other pathogens in the future.

Influenza in children — vaccination timing and dosing are emphasized: immunize children 6 months and older per recommendations, especially those at high risk, and "Vaccination should occur by the end of October, if possible". For children who need 2 doses, start as soon as vaccine is available to allow a second dose " ≥ 4 weeks later, preferably by the end of October". A multiseason analysis found effectiveness "declined by ∼7% per month for H3N2 and influenza B and by 6% to 11% per month for H1N1pdm09 in individuals 9 years and older", yet "Vaccine effectiveness remained > 0 for at least 5 to 6 months after vaccination". Therefore, "the administration of the influenza vaccine should not be delayed to a later date", and "An early onset of the influenza season is another concern about delayed vaccination".

Effectiveness of influenza vaccination on hospitalization and mortality — across pediatric populations, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization is consistently demonstrated: in the US New Vaccine Surveillance Network 2015–2016, adjusted VE against any influenza-associated hospitalization was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36% to 71%), 68% (95% CI, 36% to 84%) against A(H1N1)pdm09, and 44% (95% CI, −19% to 66%); in Israel, fully vaccinated children 6 months to 8 years had VE 53.9% (95% CI, 38.6% to 68.3%) against hospitalization, whereas partial vaccination was not effective (25.6%; 95% CI, −30% to 47%), with VE as high as 60% to 80% when strains matched; in Australia in 2018, VE preventing influenza hospitalization was 78.8% (95% CI, 66.9% to 86.4%); and in the United Kingdom 2018–2019, overall adjusted VE against influenza-confirmed hospitalization was 53% (95% CI, 33.3% to 66.8%), with protection 63.5% (95% CI, 34.4% to 79.7%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and no protection against influenza A(H3N2). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies found VE 57.5% (95% CI, 54.8% to 65.5%), with higher strain-specific VE for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (75.1%; 95% CI, 54.8% to 93.3%) and influenza B (50.9%; 95% CI, 41.7% to 59.9%) than influenza A(H3N2) (40.8%; 95% CI, 25.6% to 55.9%); fully vaccinated children were better protected (VE 61.8%; 95% CI, 54.4% to 69.1%) than partially vaccinated (VE 33.91%; 95% CI, 21.1% to 46.7%), and VE was higher in children younger than 5 years (61.7%; 95% CI, 49.3% to 74.1%) than in those 6 to 17 years (54.4%; 95% CI, 35.1% to 73.6%). In the United States during 2018–2019, vaccination prevented 20% of projected hospitalizations associated with infection with the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.

### Routine vaccination coverage-worldwide, 2020 [^c6e7ce06]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, 2019 data were used for 35 countries that did not report 2020 data; however, these countries included < 5% of the 2020 global birth cohort. §§ Second, data quality limitations could have resulted in inaccurate estimations of administrative coverage. Third, sampling and recall bias could have affected survey-based estimates of coverage. Fourth, estimates for 2020 are not directly informed by survey data in all countries because of survey implementation disruptions. Finally, estimates do not include statistical uncertainty.

Action is urgently needed to address immunity gaps caused by pandemic-related disruptions in immunization delivery to prevent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks in countries with health systems already burdened by COVID-19. Reversing worrisome trends in some countries and extending previous gains in vaccination coverage beyond prepandemic levels will require targeted and context-specific approaches to eliminate barriers to vaccination, particularly in communities with large populations of zero-dose children. Defining country-specific strategies to identify missed children, minimize missed opportunities for vaccination, and implement catch-up vaccination is critical to lessen the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progress toward achieving global immunization goals.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^cd6839d4]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Influenza vaccine recommendations — AAP 2022–2023: The AAP recommends influenza vaccination of everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents, during the 2022–2023 influenza season. The AAP recommends any licensed influenza vaccine product appropriate for age and health status and does not prefer one product over another, including IIV or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV); providers may administer whichever product is appropriate and readily available, and an IIV or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) (if age-eligible) is the appropriate choice for some persons, including those who are immunocompromised. The number of influenza vaccine doses for children remains unchanged and depends on age at first dose and vaccination history; children 6 months through 8 years of age who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or who received only 1 dose before July 1, 2022, or whose vaccination status is unknown should receive 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart, doses given up to 4 days before the minimum suggested interval should be regarded as acceptable, and all other children should receive 1 dose this season. The total number of full doses appropriate for age should be administered; if a child is inadvertently vaccinated with a formulation only approved for older children or adults, the dose should be counted as valid; if a lower dose than recommended is inadvertently administered to a child 36 months or older (eg, 0.25 mL), an additional 0.25-mL dose should be administered to provide a full dose of 0.5 mL as soon as possible, and a 0.5 mL dose of any IIV should not be split into 2 separate 0.25-mL doses. When 2 doses are required in a season, the doses do not need to be the same brand, and a child may receive a combination of IIV and LAIV if appropriate for age and health status.

### Age-targeted tuberculosis vaccination in China and implications for vaccine development: a modelling study [^3d95b245]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis is the leading single-pathogen cause of death worldwide, and China has the third largest number of cases worldwide. New tools, such as new vaccines, are needed to meet WHO tuberculosis goals. Tuberculosis vaccine development strategies mostly target infants or adolescents, but given China's ageing epidemic, vaccinating older people might be important. We modelled the potential impact of new tuberculosis vaccines in China targeting adolescents (15–19 years) or older adults (60–64 years) with varying vaccine characteristics to inform strategic vaccine development.

Methods

A Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission model was calibrated to age-stratified demographic and epidemiological data from China. Varying scenarios of vaccine implementation (age targeting [adolescents or older adults] and coverage [30% or 70%]) and characteristics (efficacy [40%, 60%, or 80%], duration of protection [10 years or 20 years], and host infection status required for efficacy [pre-infection, post-infection in latency, post-infection in latency or recovered, or pre-infection and post-infection]) were assessed. Primary outcomes were tuberculosis incidence and mortality rate reduction in 2050 in each vaccine scenario compared with the baseline (no new vaccine) scenario and cumulative number needed to vaccinate (NNV) per case or death averted, 2025–50.

Findings

By 2050, results suggest that 74.5% (uncertainty interval [UI] 70.2–78.6) of incident tuberculosis cases in China would occur in people aged 65 years or older, and 75.1% (66.8–80.7) of all cases would be due to reactivation, rather than new infection. All vaccine profiles delivered to older adults had higher population-level impact (reduction of incidence and mortality rates) and lower NNV per case and per death averted than if delivered to adolescents. For an intermediate vaccine scenario of 60% efficacy, 10-year protection, and 70% coverage, the reduction of tuberculosis incidence rates with older adult vaccination was 1.9 times (UI 1.5–2.6) to 157.5 times (119.3–225.6) greater than with adolescent vaccination, and the NNV was 0.011 times (0.008–0.014) to 0.796 times (0.632–0.970) lower. Furthermore, with older adult vaccination, post-infection vaccines provided substantially greater mortality and incidence rate reductions than pre-infection vaccines.

Interpretation

Adolescent-targeted tuberculosis vaccines, the focus of many development plans, would have only a small impact in ageing, reactivation-driven epidemics such as those in China. Instead, an efficacious post-infection vaccine delivered to older adults will be crucial to maximise population-level impact in this setting and would provide an important contribution towards achieving WHO goals. Older adults should be included in tuberculosis vaccine clinical development and implementation planning.

High-risk pediatric influenza groups and vaccination — children and adolescents with certain underlying medical conditions have a high risk of complications from influenza, and while universal influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone starting at 6 months of age, emphasis should be placed in ensuring that people in high-risk groups and their household contacts and caregivers receive annual influenza vaccine; high-risk categories include children and adults with chronic pulmonary disease, hemodynamically significant cardiovascular disease, or renal, hepatic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders; immunosuppression attributable to any cause; neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions; conditions that compromise respiratory function or handling of secretions; women who are pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season; children and adolescents < 19 y receiving long-term aspirin therapy or salicylate-containing medications; American Indian/Alaska Native people; children and adults with extreme obesity (ie, BMI ≥ 40 for adults, and based on age for children); and residents of chronic care facilities and nursing homes.

### Best practice: childhood immunisations-current practice, common challenges and future considerations [^f9e14432]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccinations are a global public health success and prevent over 5 million deaths annually, worldwide. Unfortunately, over recent years, vaccine uptake has been declining in the UK, which has led to a re-emergence of vaccine-preventable diseases. This, in addition to planned changes in the childhood vaccination schedule and increasing medical complexity, means that childhood vaccinations can be a challenging and confusing area for many healthcare professionals looking after children. This review outlines the upcoming changes to the schedule and addresses common challenges for healthcare professionals when considering vaccine administration to children. These include vaccination in immunocompromised individuals, intercurrent illness, religious and dietary objections and unknown vaccination status. Parents may have concerns around vaccine safety that need to be considered, although this is beyond the scope of this article. We hope that this article will equip paediatric healthcare professionals with greater knowledge and confidence around childhood vaccinations in the UK and encourage an opportunistic approach to vaccination.

### Comparisons of pediatric and adult SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies up to 6 months after infection, vaccination, or hybrid immunity [^cbb8a9f5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Characterization of longitudinal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in children following infection and vaccination is needed to inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine policy decisions for children, which may differ from adults.

Methods

We enrolled individuals at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination for longitudinal serological testing and compared SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific IgG and neutralization activity in children and adults stratified by infection and vaccination status using enzyme-linked immunosorbent and virus neutralization assays.

Results

Between June 2020 and December 2022, we collected sera from 669 participants aged 40 days to 55 years, including 330 unvaccinated individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 180 vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals, and 159 vaccinated previously infected individuals. Half (n = 330, 49.3%) were children. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralization activity in children < 12 years old in response to infection persisted at higher levels than those of adults through at least 6 months (spike-specific IgG levels, 2.05 [95% CI: 1.4–3.1] times higher than adults; neutralizing activity, median 88.8 vs 75.2%, respectively, p = .04). In addition, all pediatric participants had significantly higher IgG levels compared with adults at 6 months following infection or vaccination, regardless of prior infection status. Vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG responses in previously infected individuals persisted at higher levels than those from infection alone at 6 months (median AUC, children 5–11 years old, 9115 vs 368; adolescents 3613 vs 475; adults 1956 vs 263, all p < .001).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate the robust and persistent immunologic response of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children and emphasize the benefit of vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Effectiveness of AS03 adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 vaccine: case-control evaluation based on sentinel surveillance system in Canada, autumn 2009 [^8ff5a2d2]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Canada delayed the administration of the 2009–10 seasonal influenza vaccine until pandemic vaccine became available. This prevented us from assessing its previous administration in response to pandemic H1N1 vaccine. Finally, despite a broad surveillance network, the number of vaccine failures identified in this study was small, a limitation difficult to overcome in the context of highly immunogenic vaccine. This precluded stratified analysis (such as age specific estimates of vaccine effectiveness) and may potentially limit the meaningfulness of extensive multivariable adjustment or sensitivity analysis. Given that more than 80% of our participants were under 50 years of age, our estimates of protection by vaccine cannot be reliably interpreted for older adults. Further evidence for effectiveness in older people is needed.

Conclusions

We report estimates of vaccine effectiveness suggesting very high protection conferred by a single dose of the monovalent AS03 adjuvanted pandemic vaccine most used in Canada during autumn 2009, with reference in particular to children and young adults. Although limited by a small number of vaccine failures, we interpret these findings to be consistent with indicators of immunogenicity showing very high vaccine induced antibody response and with virological characterisation suggesting an excellent match of vaccine to circulating virus. Our findings are relevant to the evaluation of pandemic vaccination efforts not only in Canada but also in other countries where adjuvanted vaccines were used. Our results may help to inform the further development of influenza vaccine options.

### Uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations amongst 3, 433, 483 children and young people: meta-analysis of UK prospective cohorts [^dc67fa92]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Cumulative incidence of vaccine uptake.

The estimated cumulative incidence and 95% confidence intervals for vaccine uptake in each country for each vaccine in (A) different age groups and (B) household vaccination status.

In Northern Ireland, males were less likely to receive their first (aHR 0.87, 95%CI 0.86, 0.88) and second (aHR 0.9, 95%CI 0.88–0.92) vaccination compared to females (Table 2, Fig. 2). However, there was insufficient evidence to detect a difference for booster dose (aHR 0.95, 95%CI 0.88–1.02). Similarly to England, 12–15 year-olds were less likely to receive the first (aHR 0.45, 95%CI 0.44–0.45) and second vaccination (aHR 0.3, 95%CI 0.29–0.31) compared to 16–17 year-olds (Table 2, Fig. 2). Uptake of the first vaccination was less likely for 5–11 year-olds (aHR 0.0013, 95%CI 0.0012–0.0014) compared to 16–17 year-olds, however, there was no difference in uptake of second vaccination (aHR 1.36, 95%CI 0.96–1.92). CYP in households of two were less likely to receive first (aHR 0.8, 95%CI 0.77–0.83) and second (aHR 0.87, 95%CI 0.82–0.92) vaccine compared to households of three. Households of four (aHR 1.17, 95%CI 1.14–1.19) and five or more (aHR 1.1, 95%CI 1.08–1.13) were more likely to receive the vaccine compared to households of three. CYP in unvaccinated households were 76% less likely (aHR 0.24, 95%CI 0.23–0.25) to receive the vaccine, and fully vaccinated households were twice as likely (aHR 2.33, 95%CI 2.29–2.37) to receive the first vaccine compared to partially vaccinated households (Table 2, Fig. 2).

Cost Effectiveness

COVID-19 vaccination is a cost-effective intervention, particularly in adults aged ≥ 65 years, among whom incidence is highest. For this age group, a dose of the vaccine is cost saving (at an assumed cost of $120 per dose). Among adults aged 50–64 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of updated COVID-19 vaccines was estimated to be $25,787 per quality-adjusted life year, with estimates in those aged ≥ 50 years robust to input changes across plausible ranges. For adults aged 18–49 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for updated COVID-19 vaccines was estimated to be $115,588 per quality-adjusted life year, although estimates in younger adults were more sensitive to changes in input, with higher VE or hospitalization rates increasing cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness estimates are not yet available for pediatric populations.

### COVID-19 vaccination coverage among adults-United States, December 14, 2020-may 22, 2021 [^1cd7cba1]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program launched on December 14, 2020. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination for specific groups of the U.S. population who were at highest risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death, including adults aged ≥ 75 years*; implementation varied by state, and eligibility was gradually expanded to persons aged ≥ 65 years beginning in January 2021. By April 19, 2021, eligibility was expanded to all adults aged ≥ 18 years nationwide. † To assess patterns of COVID-19 vaccination coverage among U.S. adults, CDC analyzed data submitted on vaccinations administered during December 14, 2020-May 22, 2021, by age, sex, and community-level characteristics. By May 22, 2021, 57.0% of persons aged ≥ 18 years had received ≥ 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; coverage was highest among persons aged ≥ 65 years (80.0%) and lowest among persons aged 18–29 years (38.3%). During the week beginning February 7, 2021, vaccination initiation among adults aged ≥ 65 years peaked at 8.2%, whereas weekly initiation among other age groups peaked later and at lower levels. During April 19-May 22, 2021, the period following expanded eligibility to all adults, weekly initiation remained < 4.0% and decreased for all age groups, including persons aged 18–29 years (3.6% to 1.9%) and 30–49 years (3.5% to 1.7%); based on the current rate of weekly initiation (as of May 22), younger persons will not reach the same levels of coverage as older persons by the end of August. Across all age groups, coverage (≥ 1 dose) was lower among men compared with women, except among adults aged ≥ 65 years, and lower among persons living in counties that were less urban, had higher social vulnerabilities, or had higher percentages of social determinants of poor health. Continued efforts to improve vaccination confidence and alleviate barriers to vaccination initiation, especially among adults aged 18–49 years, could improve vaccination coverage.

### Cost effectiveness of a shingles vaccine booster for currently vaccinated adults in the U.S [^21d769cc]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a single dose of the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in people aged ≥ 60 years. Because vaccine-induced protection decreases to zero after 10 years, many vaccinated people will soon be subject to an increased risk of the disease. The study objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of a herpes zoster vaccine booster and its optimal timing among immunocompetent adults first vaccinated at aged ≥ 60 years.

Methods

A Markov model was built to follow vaccinated individuals for a lifetime. From the societal perspective, costs and quality-adjusted life years were compared between no booster versus booster options. A booster was given any time between 1 and 20 years after the first dose, and for those who had the first dose at different ages: 60, 70, and 80 years. Because people entered the model already vaccinated, costs and side effects of the first dose were not included. The booster was assumed to have the same efficacy and waning rate as the initial vaccination. Model inputs were based on published literature. A cost effectiveness threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used. The analysis was conducted in 2016.

Results

Cost effectiveness of a booster varied by age and time since vaccination. The booster cost < $100,000/quality-adjusted life year if given > 5 years after the initial dose, but was most cost effective at around 10 years. The finding was robust to wide variations in model inputs.

Conclusions

Under current assumptions, a booster dose of herpes zoster vaccine would be cost effective for all vaccinated people 10 years after initial vaccination.

### Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy children [^a5b9aa37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The consequences of influenza in children and adults are mainly absenteeism from school and work. However, the risk of complications is greatest in children and people over 65 years of age. This is an update of a review published in 2011. Future updates of this review will be made only when new trials or vaccines become available. Observational data included in previous versions of the review have been retained for historical reasons but have not been updated because of their lack of influence on the review conclusions.

Objectives

To assess the effects (efficacy, effectiveness, and harm) of vaccines against influenza in healthy children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 12), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 31 December 2016), Embase (1974 to 31 December 2016), WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; 1 July 2017), and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 July 2017).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing influenza vaccines with placebo or no intervention in naturally occurring influenza in healthy children under 16 years. Previous versions of this review included 19 cohort and 11 case-control studies. We are no longer updating the searches for these study designs but have retained the observational studies for historical purposes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the key outcomes of influenza, influenza-like illness (ILI), complications (hospitalisation, ear infection), and adverse events. Due to variation in control group risks for influenza and ILI, absolute effects are reported as the median control group risk, and numbers needed to vaccinate (NNVs) are reported accordingly. For other outcomes aggregate control group risks are used.

Main Results

We included 41 clinical trials (> 200,000 children). Most of the studies were conducted in children over the age of two and compared live attenuated or inactivated vaccines with placebo or no vaccine. Studies were conducted over single influenza seasons in the USA, Western Europe, Russia, and Bangladesh between 1984 and 2013. Restricting analyses to studies at low risk of bias showed that influenza and otitis media were the only outcomes where the impact of bias was negligible. Variability in study design and reporting impeded meta-analysis of harms outcomes. Live attenuated vaccinesCompared with placebo or do nothing, live attenuated influenza vaccines probably reduce the risk of influenza infection in children aged 3 to 16 years from 18% to 4% (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.41; 7718 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and they may reduce ILI by a smaller degree, from 17% to 12% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80; 124,606 children; low-certainty evidence). Seven children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza, and 20 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one child experiencing an ILI. Acute otitis media is probably similar following vaccine or placebo during seasonal influenza, but this result comes from a single study with particularly high rates of acute otitis media (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01; moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient information available to determine the effect of vaccines on school absenteeism due to very low-certainty evidence from one study. Vaccinating children may lead to fewer parents taking time off work, although the CI includes no effect (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; low-certainty evidence). Data on the most serious consequences of influenza complications leading to hospitalisation were not available. Data from four studies measuring fever following vaccination varied considerably, from 0.16% to 15% in children who had live vaccines, while in the placebo groups the proportions ranged from 0.71% to 22% (very low-certainty evidence). Data on nausea were not reported. Inactivated vaccinesCompared with placebo or no vaccination, inactivated vaccines reduce the risk of influenza in children aged 2 to 16 years from 30% to 11% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.48; 1628 children; high-certainty evidence), and they probably reduce ILI from 28% to 20% (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.79; 19,044 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Five children would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza, and 12 children would need to be vaccinated to avoid one case of ILI. The risk of otitis media is probably similar between vaccinated children and unvaccinated children (31% versus 27%), although the CI does not exclude a meaningful increase in otitis media following vaccination (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.40; 884 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient information available to determine the effect of vaccines on school absenteeism due to very low-certainty evidence from one study. We identified no data on parental working time lost, hospitalisation, fever, or nausea. We found limited evidence on secondary cases, requirement for treatment of lower respiratory tract disease, and drug prescriptions. One brand of monovalent pandemic vaccine was associated with a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by the experience of an intense emotion (cataplexy) and a sleep disorder (narcolepsy) in children. Evidence of serious harms (such as febrile fits) was sparse.

Authors' Conclusions

In children aged between 3 and 16 years, live influenza vaccines probably reduce influenza (moderate-certainty evidence) and may reduce ILI (low-certainty evidence) over a single influenza season. In this population inactivated vaccines also reduce influenza (high-certainty evidence) and may reduce ILI (low-certainty evidence). For both vaccine types, the absolute reduction in influenza and ILI varied considerably across the study populations, making it difficult to predict how these findings translate to different settings. We found very few randomised controlled trials in children under two years of age. Adverse event data were not well described in the available studies. Standardised approaches to the definition, ascertainment, and reporting of adverse events are needed. Identification of all global cases of potential harms is beyond the scope of this review.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2018–2019 [^8d46befc]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Influenza vaccination in children — future directions, HCP vaccination, and research needs: For the 2018–2019 season, the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccines will be analyzed as they become available and reported by the CDC as it is each season. The manufacturer of LAIV4 reported that it will employ additional vaccine virus evaluation techniques in its selection of candidate vaccine viruses for inclusion in LAIV4 with the expectation that this will result in improved effectiveness of the formulation for the 2018–2019 season. Continued evaluation of the safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, especially for young children and pregnant women, is important, and complete analysis of quadrivalent vaccines is needed as the number of formulations of IIV4 increase. With limited data on the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) in hospitalized children or in children with comorbid conditions, prospective randomized clinical trials in this population are warranted. Immunizing all health care personnel (HCP), which is a crucial step in efforts to reduce health care–associated influenza infections, serves as an example to patients, and ongoing efforts should include broader implementation and evaluation of mandatory vaccination programs in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Further investigation into offering to immunize parents and adult child care providers in the pediatric office setting and how this practice will affect disease rates is needed; there is also a need for more systematic health services research on influenza vaccine uptake and refusal and for identification of methods to enhance uptake. Efforts should be made to create adequate outreach and infrastructure to facilitate the optimal distribution of vaccines so that more people are immunized, and pediatricians also might consider becoming more involved in pandemic preparedness and disaster planning efforts.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2025 [^5ee733d8]. AAO (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) risk and vaccine impact are described as follows: older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with certain comorbidities are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and from October 2023 to May 2024, rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19 were greatest in adults 75 years of age or older. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, with the 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 vaccines decreasing the risk of emergency department and urgent care visits by 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination; however, protection decreased over time, with little effect remaining 4 to 6 months after vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccines have been updated annually to address the currently circulating strains and waning immunity from prior vaccination and infection. For RSV, infants, young children, older adults, and people with immunocompromise are at risk for severe infection and hospitalization; approximately 100,000 to 150,000 adults 60 years of age or older are hospitalized for RSV annually in the United States; RSV is also the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis among children younger than 1 year of age; and other risk factors for severe RSV disease include medical comorbidities such as chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or hematologic disease.

Influenza vaccine — efficacy and immunogenicity in people with HIV are described from outbreak and randomized studies: Vaccination was most effective among those with a CD4 count > 100 cells/mm3 and HIV RNA < 30,000 copies/mL, and in a randomized placebo-controlled trial in South Africa among 506 people with HIV (349 on ARV treatment, 157 ARV naive), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) efficacy for culture- or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction–confirmed influenza illness was 75% (95% confidence interval, 9% to 96%). High-dose trivalent IIV (60 mcg of antigen per strain) versus standard-dose (15 mcg per strain) in 195 adults with HIV aged ≥ 18 years (10% with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) yielded higher seroprotection for influenza A (96% vs. 87%; P = 0.029) and influenza B (91% vs. 80%; P = 0.030), whereas in 41 children and young adults with HIV, high-dose trivalent IIV was no more immunogenic than the standard dose among recipients with HIV.

### Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy children [^ba1428f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In children and adults the consequences of influenza are mainly absences from school and work, however the risk of complications is greatest in children and people over 65 years old.

Objectives

To appraise all comparative studies evaluating the effects of influenza vaccines in healthy children; assess vaccine efficacy (prevention of confirmed influenza) and effectiveness (prevention of influenza-like illness) and document adverse events associated with receiving influenza vaccines.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005); OLD MEDLINE (1966 to 1969); MEDLINE (1969 to December 2004); EMBASE (1974 to December 2004); Biological Abstracts (1969 to December 2004); and Science Citation Index (1974 to December 2004). We wrote to vaccine manufacturers and a number of corresponding authors of studies in the review.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies of any influenza vaccine in healthy children under 16 years old.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Fifty-one studies involving 263,987 children were included. Seventeen papers were translated from Russian. Fourteen RCTs and 11 cohort studies were included in the analysis of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. From RCTs, live vaccines showed an efficacy of 79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 48% to 92%) and an effectiveness of 33% (95% CI 28% to 38%) in children older than two years compared with placebo or no intervention. Inactivated vaccines had a lower efficacy of 59% (95% CI 41% to 71%) than live vaccines but similar effectiveness: 36% (95% CI 24% to 46%). In children under two, the efficacy of inactivated vaccine was similar to placebo. Thirty-four reports containing safety outcomes were included, 22 including live vaccines, 8 inactivated vaccines and 4 both types. The most commonly presented short-term outcomes were temperature and local reactions. The variability in design of studies and presentation of data was such that meta-analysis of safety outcome data was not feasible.

Authors' Conclusions

Influenza vaccines are efficacious in children older than two years but little evidence is available for children under two. There was a marked difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. That no safety comparisons could be carried out emphasizes the need for standardisation of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies. It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years, given recent recommendations to vaccinate healthy children from six months old in the USA and Canada. If immunisation in children is to be recommended as public-health policy, large-scale studies assessing important outcomes and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required.

### Measuring routine childhood vaccination coverage in 204 countries and territories, 1980–2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2020, release 1 [^ccbe6906]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Measuring routine childhood vaccination is crucial to inform global vaccine policies and programme implementation, and to track progress towards targets set by the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Immunization Agenda 2030. Robust estimates of routine vaccine coverage are needed to identify past successes and persistent vulnerabilities. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020, Release 1, we did a systematic analysis of global, regional, and national vaccine coverage trends using a statistical framework, by vaccine and over time.

Methods

For this analysis we collated 55326 country-specific, cohort-specific, year-specific, vaccine-specific, and dose-specific observations of routine childhood vaccination coverage between 1980 and 2019. Using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, we produced location-specific and year-specific estimates of 11 routine childhood vaccine coverage indicators for 204 countries and territories from 1980 to 2019, adjusting for biases in country-reported data and reflecting reported stockouts and supply disruptions. We analysed global and regional trends in coverage and numbers of zero-dose children (defined as those who never received a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] vaccine dose), progress towards GVAP targets, and the relationship between vaccine coverage and sociodemographic development.

Findings

By 2019, global coverage of third-dose DTP (DTP3; 81.6% [95% uncertainty interval 80.4–82.7]) more than doubled from levels estimated in 1980 (39.9% [37.5–42.1]), as did global coverage of the first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1; from 38.5% [35.4–41.3] in 1980 to 83.6% [82.3–84.8] in 2019). Third-dose polio vaccine (Pol3) coverage also increased, from 42.6% (41.4–44.1) in 1980 to 79.8% (78.4–81.1) in 2019, and global coverage of newer vaccines increased rapidly between 2000 and 2019. The global number of zero-dose children fell by nearly 75% between 1980 and 2019, from 56.8 million (52.6–60.9) to 14.5 million (13.4–15.9). However, over the past decade, global vaccine coverage broadly plateaued; 94 countries and territories recorded decreasing DTP3 coverage since 2010. Only 11 countries and territories were estimated to have reached the national GVAP target of at least 90% coverage for all assessed vaccines in 2019.

Interpretation

After achieving large gains in childhood vaccine coverage worldwide, in much of the world this progress was stalled or reversed from 2010 to 2019. These findings underscore the importance of revisiting routine immunisation strategies and programmatic approaches, recentring service delivery around equity and underserved populations. Strengthening vaccine data and monitoring systems is crucial to these pursuits, now and through to 2030, to ensure that all children have access to, and can benefit from, lifesaving vaccines.

### Monitoring incidence of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, by vaccination status-13 U.S. jurisdictions, April 4-July 17, 2021 [^4f87bba6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Averaged weekly, age-standardized rates (events per 100,000 persons) were higher among persons not fully vaccinated than among fully vaccinated persons for reported cases (112.3 versus 10.1), hospitalizations (9.1 versus 0.7), and deaths (1.6 versus 0.1) during April 4–June 19, as well as during June 20–July 17 (89.1 versus 19.4; 7.0 versus 0.7; 1.1 versus 0.1, respectively). Higher hospitalization and death rates were observed in older age groups, regardless of vaccination status, resulting in a larger impact of age-standardization on overall incidence for these outcomes.

Within each age group, the percentage of vaccinated persons among cases, hospitalizations, and deaths increased with increasing vaccination coverage (Figure 1). As the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant surpassed 50%, the percentage of vaccinated persons among cases in each age group increased at rates corresponding to benchmarks for lower VE (i.e. from approximately 90% to < 80%). Increases in the percentages of vaccinated persons aged ≥ 65 years among COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths also appeared higher than expected. During June 20–July 17, age-standardized rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among persons not fully vaccinated increased weekly; among fully vaccinated persons, case rates increased, but rates of hospitalizations and deaths remained largely unchanged (Figure 2).

For many years, the UK seasonal influenza vaccination programme has been offered to people at higher risk from the complications of influenza infection, including those aged over 65 years and anyone aged over 6 months who is in a clinical risk group. 1 In 2012, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended extending seasonal influenza vaccination to children aged 2–16 years who are not in a clinical risk group. 2 In contrast to the vaccination programme for adults, which uses an injectable inactivated influenza vaccine, children are being offered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) that is administered intranasally. 2 Here, we consider the evidence for the use of the intranasal influenza vaccine for children who are not in a clinical risk group.

Infectious diarrhea — vaccination against rotavirus, typhoid, and cholera — includes the following recommendations and vaccine characteristics: Rotavirus vaccine should be administered to all infants without a known contraindication (strong, high), and two live, attenuated orally administered rotavirus vaccines are available in the United States, with a pentavalent vaccine given in a 3-dose schedule and a monovalent vaccine given in a 2-dose schedule; phase 3 trials demonstrated efficacy against any rotavirus infection of 74%–87% and against severe gastroenteritis of 85%–98%. For typhoid, two vaccines (oral and injectable) are licensed for use in the United States but are not recommended for most travelers; typhoid vaccination is recommended as an adjunct for travelers to areas with moderate to high risk for exposure to Salmonella Typhi and for close contacts and laboratory personnel (strong, high), with booster doses recommended for people who remain at risk (strong, high). Currently, there are 2 licensed vaccines in the United States for prevention of typhoid fever, each offering 50%–80% protection; Ty21a is licensed for immunocompetent people including children ≥ 6 years of age with a recommended boosting interval every 5 years, and the parenteral Vi-polysaccharide vaccine is licensed for children ≥ 2 years of age and adults with a boosting interval every 2 years. For cholera, a live attenuated cholera vaccine available as a single-dose oral vaccine in the United States is recommended for adults 18–64 years of age who travel to cholera-affected areas (strong, high).

### Estimated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in adults [^33263323]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Waning was apparent in this analysis, including some strata 179 to 299 days after vaccination in which point estimates were negative. VE can be measured in multiple ways but is essentially a comparison between rates or risk of disease in vaccinated vs unvaccinated (or less vaccinated) populations. Persons who did not receive 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine rollout, which corresponds to the earlier time since dose strata, compared with those who received a 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine. Because prior SARS-CoV-2 infection provides some protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, higher infection rates in the comparator population (ie, those without 2023–2024 vaccines) early in the study period may have temporarily provided them with higher infection-induced protection and reduced the measured VE with greater time since dose, resulting in negative VE estimates further from vaccination. Results in this analysis, which did not control for prior infection, suggest that the risk of COVID-19 among people who are more than 6 months from their 2023 to 2024 vaccination appears to be higher than unvaccinated people who may have had more recent prior infection. However, controlling for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection generally increases measured VE, lending further evidence that the measured VE in this analysis is likely an underestimate of vaccination's true protection. Lower VE in younger age groups, including negative VE, may be indicative of differences in who gets vaccinated or patterns of prior infection. Notably, none of the VE estimates against critical illness were negative, highlighting that updated COVID-19 vaccines continued to provide protection against the most severe outcomes and supporting COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2018–2019 [^d76fac1b]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of the 2017–2018 influenza season — pediatric burden and vaccination coverage indicate that influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated overall for the season through February 2018, with influenza B predominating from March 2018 onward, and the 2017–2018 season ranks as the third most severe since the 2003–2004 season and was the first to be classified as high severity for all age groups. The peak percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was the third highest recorded since the 1997–1998 season; hospitalization rates for children did not exceed those during the 2009 pandemic but surpassed rates in previous high-severity influenza A(H3N2)–predominated seasons. Excluding the 2009 pandemic, the 179 pediatric deaths reported through August 18, 2018 during the 2017–2018 season, approximately half in otherwise healthy children, are the highest reported since influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004. Historically, 80% to 85% of pediatric deaths have occurred in unvaccinated children 6 months and older; among pediatric deaths of children 6 months and older with known vaccination status, only 22% had received at least 1 dose of an influenza vaccine during the 2017–2018 season. In one case cohort analysis in the United States from 2010 to 2014, only 26% of case patients received a vaccine before illness onset compared with an average vaccination coverage of 48%.

### COVID-19 vaccine administration and coverage, children… [^96da41cb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance Children and Adults COVID-19 Vaccination Administration and Coverage COVID-19 vaccination coverage for children and adults is assessed through U. S. jurisdictions' Immunization Information Systems Resources data, submitted from jurisdictions to CDC monthly in aggregate by age group. COVID-19 vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of the updated 2024─25 COVID-19 vaccine since August 2024, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions may report data submitted by tribes; however, CDC is unable to report estimates by tribe. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination since August 2024. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions.

COVID-19 vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U. S. Census Bureau population estimates. Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from August 2024 through a given month. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U. S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U. S. states, some localities, and territories. Because IIS data are intended to capture all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors are not calculated. Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction.

Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey estimates for children and adults because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions. IIS coverage estimates reported on jurisdictions' dashboards may use different criteria for numerators and denominators and thus may differ from those reported on CDC's Weekly Flu Vaccination dashboard.

### Use of an additional updated 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine dose for adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2024 [^89151d24]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since June 2020, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has convened 39 public meetings to review data and consider recommendations related to the use of COVID-19 vaccines. On September 12, 2023, ACIP recommended that all persons aged ≥ 6 months receive updated (2023–2024 Formula) monovalent, XBB.1.5 component (updated) COVID-19 vaccination to protect against severe COVID-19–associated illness and death.

As of February 3, 2024, approximately 6.7 million COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and 1.1 million COVID-19–associated deaths had occurred in the United States. Although the overall risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death has decreased, severe illness related to COVID-19 continues to be a public health problem, especially among older adults. COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates remain higher among adults aged ≥ 65 years relative to rates among younger adults, adolescents, and children. During October 2023–January 2024, 67% of all COVID-19–associated hospitalizations were among persons aged ≥ 65 years. Further, COVID-19 death rates during January 1, 2023–January 31, 2024, were highest among adults aged ≥ 75 years, followed by adults aged 65–74 years. Whereas approximately 98%–99% of the U.S. population has measurable antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 from infection, vaccination, or both (hybrid immunity), adults aged ≥ 65 years are less likely to have immunity resulting from infection (including immunity from infection only or hybrid immunity), compared with adults aged 30–49 years and 50–64 years. In addition, immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the functioning of the immune system, results in a less complete immune response to novel antigens and a reduced ability to develop robust immunity after infections or vaccination. The pool of naive T-cells diminishes with age, and this insufficient naive T-cell pool affects the ability to generate neutralizing antibody responses and cytotoxic T-cells in response to SARS-CoV-2.

### Answering key questions about coronavirus vaccines… [^0d550a77]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The US government is investing in rapid development of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019, several relying on new technologies. 1 In the US, 4 vaccine candidates are in phase 3 studies with initial results expected soon. If studies succeed, 1 or more vaccines may become available within a few months. Clinicians are likely among the first to be offered COVID-19 vaccines and have a key role in helping patients make decisions about vaccination. 2 Providing evidence-based information will be particularly important in an environment of polarization and mistrust. This Viewpoint focuses on common questions patients are likely to ask about COVID-19 vaccines. The US Food and Drug Administration guidance set as an expectation for licensure that a COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated.
3.

In reviewing the results of a study it is important to know there is a margin of error in estimating the percentage of cases or complications prevented. For example, a study might report a reduction in disease from 100 cases in the placebo group to 50 in those vaccinated. This difference would meet the standard of 50%, but it will be important to explain to patients the uncertainty surrounding that value. While the study showed a 50% reduction in illness, the confidence interval for the efficacy estimate might be 30% to 80%, meaning efficacy may be as low as 30% or as high as 80%. It will also be important to understand whether a vaccine reduces not only mild but also more severe disease, as well as hospitalizations and deaths. However, studies may have insufficient numbers of patients with severe outcomes to definitively evaluate those end points.

Clinicians will want to know how safety was evaluated, including whether studies have been completed, as planned, with 15 000 or more people vaccinated and followed up for time periods sufficient to detect most safety issues. It is also important for vaccine developers to present all safety data, including from outside the US. More serious reactions, such as otherwise unexplained neurologic or inflammatory processes, would raise concerns. While patients need to understand that serious adverse events may occur coincidentally following receipt of a vaccine, these adverse events could be signals of a safety problem. Comparing rates of adverse events between vaccine and placebo recipients can help determine whether a signal is vaccine-related, but for small numbers of rare events it may be inconclusive. Patients should understand that rare adverse events may only be detected as a vaccine is widely used.

Patients will want assurance that the US has mobilized enhanced safety systems to monitor, evaluate, and communicate about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines after they are released.
4. COVID-19 is more common and severe among individuals often underrepresented in clinical trials, including older individuals, people with chronic illnesses, and persons in racial/ethnic minority populations. Different groups may not have the same responses to vaccination. When results become available, it will be important to evaluate the characteristics of people included in the trial and determine whether they are similar to patients seen in the practice setting. A given vaccine may be more appropriate for some patients than others, and knowing those differences will be important. Trials involving children and pregnant women will start once vaccine safety is demonstrated in others, making it unlikely vaccines will initially have FDA indications for these groups.
