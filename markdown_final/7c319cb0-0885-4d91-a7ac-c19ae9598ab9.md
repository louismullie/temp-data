## Question

Can air purifier prevent infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether air purifiers can prevent infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of HEPA filtration for airborne pathogens. Then, I should verify what high-quality randomized trials and observational studies show about clinical outcomes versus surrogate endpoints. Next, I will review mechanistic and modeling data to understand expected exposure reductions. After that, I need to check guideline positions and how they frame air purifiers within a hierarchy of controls. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, context-specific conclusion and outline practical recommendations with attention to limitations and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. HEPA filters are at least 99.97% efficient at capturing particles around 0.3 micrometers, which captures the size range of respiratory virus–laden aerosols, including SARS-CoV-2, so the mechanism is sound in principle [^113QVnS2]. Wait, let me verify the size distribution point: SARS-CoV-2 commonly appears in submicron and supermicron aerosols, and HEPA-class media demonstrate high removal of such aerosols in bench studies, supporting plausibility even if not proving clinical prevention by itself [^114XXk5Z].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality clinical evidence. A multicenter crossover RCT in residential aged-care facilities found that in-room HEPA-14 purifiers did not significantly reduce acute respiratory infections in the intention-to-treat analysis, though a per-protocol analysis suggested a possible signal. This means the best available trial is inconclusive overall and susceptible to adherence and dilution effects in real-world settings [^112iUg4o] [^113AwXfP]. Hold on, I should verify the school data: a large school-based randomized trial powered for asthma outcomes found no reduction in high viral exposure with HEPA purifiers, though there was a modest decrease in viral diversity; again, this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for infection prevention [^115rL5CG] [^114YG6Vh]. I need to check surgical site infection data too: a nationwide cluster-randomized crossover trial of plasma air purifiers in modern orthopedic ORs showed no reduction in a composite SSI marker, underscoring that adding air cleaning does not guarantee infection reduction when baseline ventilation is adequate [^116RuYqc].

> I will now examine mechanistic and modeling studies to understand expected exposure changes. Experimental and simulation work shows portable HEPA can markedly reduce airborne surrogate particles and, in some setups, reduce exposure to exhaled aerosols by roughly 65% when placed near the source, with even greater reductions when combined with universal masking, which aligns with the physics of filtration and dilution but remains a surrogate outcome [^115DdThe] [^114ggfkr]. Let me double-check the clearance-time modeling: with adequate air changes and favorable humidity, room air can be cleared of most infectious particles within minutes, but this assumes idealized conditions and does not directly translate to prevented infections in people [^114pRher] [^115iL2SP].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overinterpreting single studies. WHO's IPC guidance emphasizes ventilation and engineering controls within a hierarchy of controls but notes that the certainty of evidence for many air interventions, including portable air cleaners, is low and that IPC measures are typically implemented as bundles, making it hard to isolate effects of a single component like HEPA purifiers [^115KB5Nr] [^115p1az9]. The CDC's "cleaner air" guidance recommends portable HEPA as one of several strategies to reduce airborne viral concentrations, especially when ventilation is limited, but frames it as risk reduction rather than guaranteed infection prevention [^116RED5t]. IDSA guidance similarly stresses ventilation and filtration as part of aerosol mitigation but does not endorse standalone efficacy of portable purifiers for preventing transmission [^115CiF93].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should synthesize carefully. The biological rationale is strong, mechanistic studies show exposure reductions, but high-quality randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated reductions in clinical infections, and guideline bodies position air purifiers as adjuncts within broader IPC strategies rather than as stand-alone prevention tools. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that HEPA purifiers can reduce airborne viral concentrations and likely lower exposure, but current evidence is insufficient to claim they reliably prevent infection on their own in real-world settings [^113QVnS2] [^112iUg4o] [^116RED5t] [^115KB5Nr].

> Let me consider context and implementation, because effectiveness is setting-dependent. In poorly ventilated rooms with high occupancy or during aerosol-generating procedures, adding HEPA filtration may meaningfully reduce airborne viral load and could be particularly relevant when HVAC upgrades are infeasible, but benefits are smaller or uncertain in well-ventilated spaces with good baseline air changes and when other controls are robust [^114LjiNU] [^116RED5t]. I should confirm that device placement matters: locating purifiers near the aerosol source and ensuring adequate clean air delivery improves performance, and combining HEPA with masking yields additive exposure reductions in simulations, which is consistent with layered risk-reduction principles [^114ggfkr].

> But wait, what about limitations and potential harms? Noise, energy demands, filter maintenance, and possible effects on humidity or airflow patterns can impede consistent use or even inadvertently redistribute aerosols if devices are poorly positioned, so I need to ensure operational plans address these issues before expecting benefit [^112Lkp6y] [^11246t8Y]. I should double-check that some devices may generate ozone or other byproducts, and that filter loading can reduce efficacy if not maintained, reinforcing the need for standardized protocols and monitoring in any deployment [^11246t8Y] [^111JHVra].

> Next, I should review practical recommendations. Use HEPA purifiers as part of a layered approach that includes optimizing ventilation, maintaining 40–60% relative humidity when feasible, universal masking during outbreaks, distancing, and hand hygiene. Select appropriately sized units with adequate clean air delivery for the room, place them near likely aerosol sources, run them continuously during occupancy, and maintain filters per manufacturer guidance. In healthcare, prioritize HEPA for aerosol-generating procedures or in surge settings when airborne isolation capacity is limited, and pair with appropriate PPE rather than relying on air cleaning alone [^116RED5t] [^115iL2SP] [^114ggfkr] [^115E9LG5] [^114prNPq].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: air purifiers with HEPA filtration can reduce airborne viral concentrations and likely lower exposure risk, but high-quality evidence has not yet proven that they reliably prevent infection across diverse real-world settings. Therefore, they should be viewed as adjunctive engineering controls within a comprehensive IPC bundle, with expectations calibrated to ventilation quality, occupancy, procedures, and adherence to accompanying measures [^112iUg4o] [^115rL5CG] [^116RED5t] [^115KB5Nr].

Air purifiers can reduce airborne pathogens and may lower infection risk, but they **do not eliminate it** [^117ALaMq]. HEPA filters are effective at removing particles 0.1–1 µm, including respiratory viruses [^113QVnS2], and can reduce viral load in air [^113GEbxL]; however, **evidence for preventing human infection is limited and mixed** [^112iUg4o] [^114YG6Vh]. Air purifiers are best used as part of a layered strategy with ventilation, masking, and hand hygiene [^114ggfkr] [^116RED5t], and are not a substitute for these measures [^111troXs].

## Mechanisms of action of air purifiers

Air purifiers use **filtration**, **UVGI**, and **ionization** to reduce airborne pathogens:

- **HEPA filtration**: Removes particles ≥ 0.3 µm with ≥ 99.97% efficiency, including respiratory viruses [^113QVnS2].
- **UVGI**: Inactivates microorganisms via UV-C, but effectiveness depends on dose and exposure time [^113BQBzb].
- **Ionization**: Charges particles for easier capture, but efficacy and safety vary [^117ALaMq].

---

## Evidence on effectiveness in preventing infections

### Respiratory viral infections

- **HEPA filtration**: Reduces airborne viral particles, including SARS-CoV-2 [^113GEbxL], but clinical infection prevention evidence is limited [^117ALaMq].
- **RCT in aged care**: HEPA-14 purifiers did not significantly reduce ARIs in ITT analysis (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32–1.04) [^112iUg4o].
- **School study**: HEPA purifiers did not reduce high viral exposure but modestly decreased viral diversity; clinical significance unclear [^114YG6Vh] [^1116o9Gx].
- **Systematic review**: No consistent benefit of air treatment technologies on infection incidence; evidence quality is low [^117ALaMq].

---

### Surgical site infections

A **large RCT** found that plasma air purifiers in orthopedic ORs did not reduce SSI rates (9.2% vs 9.4%; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91–1.05) [^116RuYqc].

---

## Factors influencing effectiveness

Several factors **modulate** the impact of air purifiers on infection risk:

| **Factor** | **Influence on effectiveness** |
|-|-|
| Filter type and efficiency | HEPA filters are more effective than standard filters for viral particles [^113QVnS2] |
| Room size and ventilation | Larger rooms or poor ventilation reduce effectiveness [^115m5Ktn] |
| Occupancy and activity | Higher occupancy and aerosol-generating activities increase viral load, challenging purifiers [^116zkZBR] |
| Maintenance | Regular filter changes and maintenance are critical for performance [^116RED5t] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Evidence quality**: Many studies are small, short, or use surrogate outcomes; high-quality RCTs are limited [^117ALaMq] [^115p1az9].
- **Environmental variability**: Effectiveness varies with room size, ventilation, and occupancy [^11246t8Y] [^116FzbBU].
- **Maintenance**: Filters must be changed regularly; neglect reduces performance [^116RED5t] [^115iZUuk].
- **Cost and access**: HEPA units and upkeep can be prohibitive in some settings [^111B9Jz1].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **WHO**: Emphasizes ventilation and filtration as part of IPC bundles, not as standalone solutions [^115p1az9] [^115KB5Nr].
- **CDC**: Recommends HEPA purifiers to supplement ventilation, especially where airflow is limited [^116RED5t] [^114ggfkr].
- **IDSA**: Supports HEPA in healthcare settings for immunocompromised patients, alongside other controls [^114ocCAF].

---

## Practical implications and recommendations

- **Layered approach**: Use HEPA purifiers with ventilation, masking, and hand hygiene [^114ggfkr] [^116RED5t].
- **Proper use**: Size units to room volume, run continuously, and maintain filters [^116RED5t].
- **High-risk settings**: Consider HEPA in healthcare, schools, and crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation [^115E9LG5] [^116RED5t].
- **Limitations**: Purifiers do not replace standard IPC measures [^111troXs].

---

Air purifiers can reduce airborne pathogens and may lower infection risk, but **they do not eliminate it** [^117ALaMq]. They should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy, not as a sole intervention [^111troXs].

### Most relevant strategies for preventing surgical site infection after total hip arthroplasty: guideline recommendations and expert opinion [^111XVCDY]. American Journal of Infection Control (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous strategies are available to prevent surgical site infections in hip arthroplasty, but there is no consensus on which might be the best. This study examined infection prevention strategies currently recommended for patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.

Methods

Four clinical guidelines on infection prevention/orthopedics were reviewed. Infection control practitioners, infectious disease physicians, and orthopedic surgeons were consulted through structured interviews and an online survey. Strategies were classified as "highly important" if they were recommended by at least one guideline and ranked as significantly or critically important by ≥ 75% of the experts.

Results

The guideline review yielded 28 infection prevention measures, with 7 identified by experts as being highly important in this context: antibiotic prophylaxis, antiseptic skin preparation of patients, hand/forearm antisepsis by surgical staff, sterile gowns/surgical attire, ultraclean/laminar air operating theatres, antibiotic-impregnated cement, and surveillance. Controversial measures included antibiotic-impregnated cement and, considering recent literature, laminar air operating theatres.

Conclusions

Some of these measures may already be accepted as routine clinical practice, whereas others are controversial. Whether these practices should be continued for this patient group will be informed by modeling the cost-effectiveness of infection prevention strategies. This will allow predictions of long-term health and cost outcomes and thus inform decisions on how to best use scarce health care resources for infection control.

We aimed to examine 2 mechanistic questions regarding the effectiveness of personal PPE and air filtration to protect HCWs against virus aerosol: first, to quantify the degree of personal contamination with virus aerosol when wearing different types of masks (surgical, fit-test FAILED N95), and a fit-test PASSED N95 mask) in combination with face shield, gown, and disposable gloves; and second, to determine if the use of a portable HEPA filter enhances the benefit of PPE to protect the wearer against virus aerosol contamination.

### Interventions used to reduce infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals-a review [^111j8XAv]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for improved infectious aerosol concentrations through interventions that reduce the transmission of airborne infections. The aims of this review were to map the existing literature on interventions used to improve infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals and understand challenges in their implementation.

Methods

We reviewed peer-reviewed articles identified on three databases, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to July 2024. 6417 articles were identified, 160 were reviewed and 18 were included.

Findings

Results on aerosol concentration were discussed in terms of three categories: (1) filtration and inactivation of aerosol particles; (2) effect of airflow and ventilation on aerosol concentrations; and (3) improvements or reduction in health conditions. The most common device or method that was outlined by researchers was high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters which were able to reduce aerosol concentrations under investigation across the included literature. Some articles were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions in terms of improving health outcomes for patients.

Interpretation

The key finding is that infectious aerosol concentration improvement measures based on filtration, inactivation, improved air flow dynamics, and ventilation reduce the likelihood of nosocomial infections. However limitations of such approaches must be considered such as noise pollution and effects on ambient humidity. Whilst these efforts can contribute to improved air quality in hospitals, they should be considered with the other interacting factors such as microclimates, room dimensions and use of chemical products that effect air quality.

Funding

This study is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) (NIHR205439).

### Efficacy of portable air cleaners and masking for reducing indoor… [^114ggfkr]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Ventilation systems can be supplemented with portable high efficiency particulate air cleaners to reduce the number of airborne infectious particles. What is added by this report. A simulated infected meeting participant who was exhaling aerosols was placed in a room with two simulated uninfected participants and a simulated uninfected speaker. Using two HEPA air cleaners close to the aerosol source reduced the aerosol exposure of the uninfected participants and speaker by up to 65%. A combination of HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%. To investigate the effectiveness of portable HEPA air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to exhaled aerosol particles, the investigation team used respiratory simulators to mimic a person with COVID-19 and other, uninfected persons in a conference room.

The addition of two HEPA air cleaners that met the Environmental Protection Agency –recommended clean air delivery rate reduced overall exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles by up to 65% without universal masking. Without the HEPA air cleaners, universal masking reduced the combined mean aerosol concentration by 72%. The combination of the two HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced overall exposure by up to 90%. The HEPA air cleaners were most effective when they were close to the aerosol source. These findings suggest that portable HEPA air cleaners can reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in indoor environments, with greater reductions in exposure occurring when used in combination with universal masking. Discussion In this study, the use of HEPA air cleaners in a conference room significantly reduced the exposure of nearby participants and a speaker to airborne particles produced by a simulated infected participant.

The air cleaners were most effective when they were located in the center of the room close to the aerosol source. Moreover, the combination of HEPA air cleaners and universal masking was more effective than was either intervention alone. The use of masks without air cleaners reduced the aerosol exposure of the receivers by 72%, and the use of air cleaners without masks reduced the exposure by up to 65%. When used together, the HEPA air cleaners and masks reduced exposure to respiratory aerosols by up to 90%. These findings suggest that the use of portable HEPA air cleaners and universal masking can each reduce exposure to simulated SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in indoor environments, with larger reductions occurring when air cleaners and masking are used together.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^115CiF93]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 highlights that the short-range continuum of small respiratory particles, ranging from aerosols to droplets, are likely the major contributors of transmission, and states that the primary mechanism to reduce aerosol transmission is ventilation; higher levels of air exchanges and filtration are commonly required in U.S. healthcare settings, especially hospitals. It notes that although viral shedding decreases soon after symptom onset, many patients shed non-infectious viral RNA for prolonged periods, and that decay in viral load following symptom onset likely means that by the time patients are hospitalized with moderate, severe, or critical illness, the risks of transmission are reduced. The text explains that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, most notably the delta variant, and higher levels of transmission, create additional complexity, and that studies to determine a biological basis of transmission risk within healthcare settings continue to be needed to inform appropriate PPE recommendations; the role of PPE in prevention of transmission to patients also needs to be addressed. Finally, it emphasizes that any guidance on PPE would be remiss not to mention the critical role of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for HCP, stating that universal and required vaccination of HCP provides the most important level of protection and, when combined with appropriate PPE and other interventions, creates the safest possible environment for HCP providing care for patients with COVID-19.

### Summary of WHO infection prevention and control guideline for COVID-19: striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^115dkx62]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

WHO guideline development process

The guideline development process for this consolidated guideline followed WHO methodology, including conducting systematic reviews of evidence and the use of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence and determine the strength of recommendations.

To develop the guideline, WHO convened a Guideline Development Group (GDG), which reviewed Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome (PICO) questions, prioritised outcomes, interpreted the evidence and assessed evidence quality, formulated recommendations, and established key considerations on behalf of WHO. The GDG included experts in IPC, epidemiology, infectious diseases, microbiology, paediatrics, water, sanitation, and hygiene, engineering and aerobiology, and civil society representatives.

Thirty two research questions were identified and 17 systematic evidence reviews were commissioned. In addition, five qualitative evidence syntheses were performed to investigate contextual factors such as health and care workers' values and preferences related to personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning and disinfection, and physical barriers and distancing.

### Infection prevention and control guideline for cystic fibrosis: 2013 update [^1135ghjX]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Reprocessing of respiratory therapy equipment and nebulizers in cystic fibrosis — key requirements and recommendations include that processes for proper cleaning and sterilization or disinfection of reusable equipment are essential components of a program to prevent infections of people with CF, and Hospitals must follow these recommendations. Insights from equipment-associated infections emphasize that strict adherence to aseptic technique is important and that proper training of personnel responsible for reprocessing equipment is important, including demonstration of competency initially and then at least annually, as is consistent adherence to reprocessing guidelines. Single-dose medication vials are always preferred; if multi-dose medication vials must be used, the manufacturer's directions for handling, dispensing, and storing must be followed precisely to prevent contamination and the transmission of potential pathogens. Tap water may be used for cleaning nebulizers and other respiratory therapy equipment, but sterile water or water processed by filtration (filter size of less than or equal to 0.2 microns) must be used in the final rinse because tap water and distilled water may be contaminated with CF pathogens; sterile water or properly filtered water is recommended for filling respiratory therapy equipment reservoirs (eg, humidifiers), and sterile saline is recommended for sinus rinses. Equipment should be cleaned before disinfection or sterilization to ensure that the sterilization process is maximally effective, and air-drying equipment after it has been cleaned and disinfected is an essential step prior to storage because items that remain wet provide favorable conditions for bacterial growth.

### The effect of an air purifier on aerosol generation measurements during clinical motility testing [^114WuayH]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aerosol spread is key to interpret the risk of viral contamination during clinical procedures such as esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). Installing an air purifier seems a legitimate strategy, but this has recently been questioned.

Methods

Patients undergoing an HRM procedure at the Leuven University Hospital were included in this clinical study. All subjects had to wear a surgical mask which was only lowered beneath the nose during the placement and removal of the nasogastric catheter. The number of aerosol particles was measured by a Lasair ® II Particle Counter to obtain data about different particles sizes: 0.3; 0.5; 1.0; 3.0; 5.0; and 10.0 µm. Measurements were done immediately before the placement and the removal of the HRM catheter, and one and 5 min after. A portable air purifier with high-efficiency particle air filters was installed in the hospital room.

Key Results

Thirteen patients underwent a manometry examination. The amount of 0.3 µm-sized particles was unaffected during the whole procedure. The larger particle sizes (1.0; 3.0; 5.0; and 10.0 µm) decreased when the catheter was positioned, but not 0.5 µm. During the HRM measurements itself, these numbers decreased further. Yet, 1 min after catheter removal a significant elevation of particles was seen, which did not recover within 5 min.

Conclusions & Interferences

Based on this study, there is no evidence that filtration systems reduce aerosol particles properly during a clinical investigation.

### Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff [^114XzmN2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed.

Objectives

To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate.

Main Results

Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.

### Transmission risk of respiratory viruses in natural and mechanical ventilation environments: implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Africa [^112XXJ1w]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

In low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the WHO guidelines on the prevention of infection and control of the spread of pandemic promote natural ventilation as not only a suitable and affordable way to effectively control infection but one that may be as effective as the more-expensive alternative — mechanical ventilation. A systematic review of papers published between 1965 and 2005 showed that there was strong and sufficient evidence to support an association between ventilation rates and airflow patterns (both natural and mechanical) and the transmission and spread of diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, anthrax, influenza, smallpox and SARS-CoV-1.

However, the air-purifying benefit of natural ventilation is only as good as the quality of outdoor air. This is particularly significant in highly industrialised cities with significant air pollution. A prospective trial conducted among 1325 students noted that environments with an increased load of the particulate matter about 10 µm in size were associated with an increased incidence of respiratory infections. This has also been observed with the particulate matter under 2.5 µm size, which falls within the size range of droplet nuclei. These pollutants or particulate matter may cause inflammation of the airway providing an enabling environment for the successful transmission of viral infection. Thus, location-specific air quality may influence the infection prevention quality of natural ventilation.

Mechanical ventilation

Mechanical ventilation involves the use of machines to facilitate air exchange with the external environment as well as airflow within a room. There are several forms of mechanical ventilation including portable units, like fans, and standalone air conditioners or combined systems involving heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

Fans are useful appliances that regulate the temperature, humidity and airflow in a room. When used in residential and commercial settings, they can serve as affordable alternatives to some standalone air conditioners and HVAC systems. As such, they remain a popular fixture in residential spaces in LMICs. Despite these benefits, their use could be detrimental when the air contains aerosolised infectious particles or droplet nuclei as they can facilitate the circulation of these particles. A study showed that fans were able to nebulise a liquid suspension of soil contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus such that sterile Petri dishes placed in the vicinity of the fan grew S. aureus. This study confirms that air currents created by fans can circulate droplet nuclei containing viable microorganisms.

### Enclosure with augmented airflow to decrease risk of exposure to aerosolized pathogens including coronavirus during endotracheal intubation. can the reduction in aerosolized particles be quantified? [^112721NF]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has impacted hospital routines in recent weeks, recommendations to reduce healthcare worker infections are being developed.

Methods

We report preliminary experience with the efficacy of an enclosure with augmented airflow to decrease the risk of exposure to aerosolized pathogens during airway management including endotracheal intubation. A particle generator was used to test the efficacy of the reduction of aerosolized particles by measuring their concentration within the enclosure and in the environment.

Results

No reduction in the concentration of aerosolized particles was noted with the enclosure flap open, whether the interior suction was on or off. However, with the enclosure closed and no augmented airflow (suction off), the particle concentration decreased to 1.2% of baseline. The concentration decreased even further, to 0.8% of baseline with the enclosure closed with augmented airflow (suction on).

Discussion

Aerosolized particulate contamination in the operating room can be decreased using a clear plastic enclosure with minimal openings and augmented airflow. This may serve to decrease the exposure of healthcare providers to aerosolized pathogens.

### Efficacy of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) for source control of simulated respiratory aerosols [^113HZRbJ]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are a popular alternative to the use of filtering facepiece respirators for health care workers. Although PAPRs protect the wearer from aerosol particles, their ability to block infectious aerosol particles exhaled by the wearer from being released into the environment (called source control) is unclear.

Methods

The source control performance of 4 PAPRs with loose-fitting facepieces were tested using a manikin that exhales aerosol particles. The PAPRs were tested by themselves and in combination with a face-worn product intended to provide source control (either a surgical mask or an N95 filtering facepiece respirator).

Results

Two PAPR facepieces with filtration panels significantly reduced the release of exhaled aerosols into the environment, while 3 facepieces without such panels did not. Wearing a surgical mask or respirator under the facepiece significantly improved the source control performance.

Conclusions

Most PAPR facepieces do not block aerosols exhaled by the wearer. Facepieces designed to filter exhaled particles can prevent aerosols from being released into the environment. Wearing a surgical mask or a filtering facepiece respirator under the facepiece can also provide source control, but PAPRs are not typically certified for use with masks and respirators.

### IDSA guidelines on infection prevention in patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^112PahLP]. IDSA (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to personal protective equipment, aerosol-generating procedures, IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to advise using an respirator (N95 or N99 or powered air-purifying respirator) instead of a medical/surgical mask, as part of appropriate personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel performing aerosol-generating procedures on suspected or known COVID-19 patients. Appropriate personal protective equipment includes a mask or respirator, eye protection, gown and gloves.

### Effectiveness of filtering or decontaminating air to reduce or prevent respiratory infections: a systematic review [^117ALaMq]. Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Installation of technologies to remove or deactivate respiratory pathogens from indoor air is a plausible non-pharmaceutical infectious disease control strategy.

Objective

We undertook a systematic review of worldwide observational and experimental studies, published 1970–2022, to synthesise evidence about the effectiveness of suitable indoor air treatment technologies to prevent respiratory or gastrointestinal infections.

Methods

We searched for data about infection and symptom outcomes for persons who spent minimum 20 h/week in shared indoor spaces subjected to air treatment strategies hypothesised to change risk of respiratory or gastrointestinal infections or symptoms.

Results

Pooled data from 32 included studies suggested no net benefits of air treatment technologies for symptom severity or symptom presence, in absence of confirmed infection. Infection incidence was lower in three cohort studies for persons exposed to high efficiency particulate air filtration (RR 0.4, 95%CI 0.28–0.58, p < 0.001) and in one cohort study that combined ionisers with electrostatic nano filtration (RR 0.08, 95%CI 0.01–0.60, p = 0.01); other types of air treatment technologies and air treatment in other study designs were not strongly linked to fewer infections. The infection outcome data exhibited strong publication bias.

Conclusions

Although environmental and surface samples are reduced after air treatment by several air treatment strategies, especially germicidal lights and high efficiency particulate air filtration, robust evidence has yet to emerge that these technologies are effective at reducing respiratory or gastrointestinal infections in real world settings. Data from several randomised trials have yet to report and will be welcome to the evidence base.

### Reduction of contagion risks by SARS-cov-2 (COVID-19) in air-conditioned work environments [^116uWnv1]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus emergency obliged Italy's government to stop production and trade activities to limit the = risk of contagion. Italy will restart activities in a few days and some security measures will have to be taken to limit the risks of spreading the virus as much as possible.

Objective

This work summarizes the rules that are to be adopted for the reduction of the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection with particular regard to the air conditioning systems in working environments, the sources of risk, and possible risk reduction measures.

Results

Ducted air systems are of great importance, widespread, and often overlooked in risk assessment. Scientific evidence has shown that air conditioning systems can be both an infection risk reducer and, if misused, a multiplier of infection possibility.

Limitations

A narrative review with paucity of literature.

### 2024 year in review: fugitive aerosols-keeping the air clear for patients and staff [^112mU4df]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Although concerns about and precautions to prevent transmission of diseases through the air have existed since Hippocrates, renewed interest in risks and prevention strategies grew significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This altered respiratory care practice globally owing to concerns that some respiratory care procedures may generate or disperse aerosols that could spread pathogens. A paucity of evidence, as well as a lack of general consensus, existed at the pandemic onset to determine the associated risks of these procedures and best practices for mitigating those risks. This is a review of key peer-reviewed manuscripts from 2023 to 2024 discussing aerosol generation and dispersion from respiratory care procedures, as well as the mitigation of associated risks. A brief discussion of different forms of aerosols, and the risks associated with each, is also included.

### Interventions used to reduce infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals-a review [^117Y4zYy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to their clinical benefits, HEPA filters are easy to deploy and cost effective, despite this, they do little to improve the air flow in hospitals, but rather mitigate infection risk from PM. The authors that examined the efficacy of ventilation called for implementing air purifiers as natural or mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to prevent transmission. Based on these findings, and in relation to existing research it is recommended to include air purifiers within a formal air quality and management strategy.

Along with potential positive impacts from the ventilation and filtration approaches it is important to note any barriers in implementing the approaches such as noise pollution as was reported by Rao et al. and Otter et al. or adverse health events from using devices (e.g. the impact of UV radiation or the potential for free-standing devices to fall and cause injury). Very few of the studies discussed the potential adverse impacts of the devices on relative humidity, CO 2 or ozone generation as has been reported previously. Conway et al. didn't measure this but flagged that further research would be needed on the effect of HEPA filters on reducing ambient humidity. Butler et al. actually found that CO 2 levels and vapour pressure reduced in the presence of the ACU but couldn't attribute why this was and thought it may have been due to the unrecorded opening of windows and doors.

### Clearing the air: addressing air clearance times for infectious aerosols in healthcare facilities [^114pRher]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Using the traditional approach of air exchanges alone, a room with 15 air exchanges per hour would require 28 minutes to clear 99.9% of airborne particles. By targeting 95% air clearance and using a conservative reduction in viral activity of 30% at a relative humidity of between 40% to 60%, a room would be deemed safe for reoccupancy at 8 minutes. Moreover, procedure rooms in older hospitals with 10 air exchanges per hour would require furlough periods of only 12 minutes between patients versus 41 minutes according to previous recommendations. These modified times also approximate the duration required to prepare a postintervention patient for the recovery room, after which personnel would no longer require respiratory precautions in the absence of ongoing AGMPs.

The interaction between viruses and relative humidity is complex, and large knowledge gaps exist. Further research into the role of the built environment in management of bioaerosols in healthcare is required and will aid in the revision of national and international infection prevention guidelines. Until knowledge in this area is further advanced, we hope others will find this a rational and practical approach that balances healthcare worker and patient safety while preserving patient flow in areas where AGMPs are commonly performed.

### Portable air purifiers to mitigate the harms of wildfire smoke for people with asthma [^115iZUuk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, the program's cost-effectiveness was diminished to a greater proportion than might be expected in a scenario in which filters were operated during only days with poor air quality, even if these days are when wildfire smoke would be overrepresented. This can at least be partially explained by the model assumption that a reduction in non–wildfire smoke PM 2.5 would also benefit asthma to the same degree as a reduction in wildfire smoke PM 2.5. Wildfire smoke PM 2.5 plausibly has greater toxicity than PM 2.5 from other sources, suggesting that this alternative scenario may be more cost-effective than estimated.

This study raises relevant questions regarding the acceptability of this program from the patient perspective. How many of the eligible individuals with asthma would adopt it? Of those who do, would they operate their filters continuously, even during days without wildfire smoke, and bear the costs of replacing the filters to keep them operating optimally as assumed? Although empirical estimates of air filter effectiveness incorporate adherence to some extent, rates of adoption outside of research settings in which participants are not incentivized may be lower. A 2019 survey of Chinese households found that most that had air purifiers did not use them at all, and those that did operated them irregularly or at low settings. These are opportunities for future research.

The United Nations Environment Program urges governments to better manage and mitigate the risk of expanding wildfires to human health. Making portable air purifiers more accessible to vulnerable populations, including individuals with asthma, could be a cost-effective tool in this armamentarium. By creating a well-researched cost-effectiveness model that may be localized to other jurisdictions, the work of Adibi and colleagues has provided valuable information to advance this policy conversation worldwide.

### Ambient carbon dioxide concentration correlates with SARS-CoV-2 aerostability and infection risk [^116zkZBR]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The inhalation of respiratory aerosol containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as an important route of transmission in the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As for all respiratory viral infections, a sufficient viral dose must be delivered to the respiratory system of an uninfected individual for disease transmission to occur. For COVID-19, this equates to inhalation of a sufficient quantity of aerosolized/inhalable and infectious SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. The minimal infectious dose is a function of many parameters, such as mucosal immunity, prior infection, and immunization status. Regardless of the infectious dose required, the cumulative viral load of the air inhaled will necessarily correlate with the overall risk. Thus, understanding how environmental factors affect the aerosolized viral load over time will contribute to the assessment of the risk of transmission.

At their core, many of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission are centered on the removal of infectious aerosolized virus from a given space. The aerosolized viral load may be altered physically by lowering the number of virus-containing particles. For example, changing aerosol production rates (e.g. via lowering the volume of singing or talking), crowding/social distancing policies, mask wearing, and improved ventilationall reduce the total number of virus-containing aerosol droplets. The viral load within aerosol droplets may also be altered, so that the infectivity of the viral particles themselves is changed through processes such as UV germicidal irradiationor by adjustments to environmental conditions such as relative humidity (RH)or temperature. In addition to these intentional methods of disinfection, aerosolized viruses are known to lose their infectivity over time, although the precise mechanisms driving this loss remain the subject of much debate. A comprehensive understanding of all these processes/conditions, as well as the interconnections between them, is necessary to facilitate the development of more effective mitigation strategies.

### Air purifier intervention for respiratory viral exposure in elementary schools: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116FzbBU]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Viral infections cause substantial morbidity in children, and are a leading cause of school absenteeism. Schools, where children spend the majority of the day, are recognized as an important source of respiratory virus exposure. Environmental air sampling has been effective at detecting respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. However, comprehensive longitudinal assessments of viral exposures in schools are lacking, especially for noninfluenza respiratory viruses with pandemic potential. Quantifying viral exposure in bioaerosols is challenging due to low biomass, and limitations in detecting multiple targets. Multiplexed digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) offers precision and sensitivity, especially in low-biomass samples.

There is limited clinical evidence on effective measures to reduce indoor viral exposure. While high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are effective at reducing fine and coarse particulate matter (PM), their effectiveness against respiratory viruses transmitted via aerosols (< 5 μm) and droplets (> 5 μm) in clinical settings remains unclear due to factors such as occupancy, ventilation, indoor climate, and occupant-specific characteristics, such as age. In addition, while low-cost sensors exist for some indoor pollutants, none exists for detection of viruses. Some studies propose using carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a surrogate marker for viral exposure; however, most research on built-environment factors and viral exposures is model-based, lacking comprehensive epidemiologic evidence.

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of HEPA purifiers in schools, we aimed to evaluate whether portable HEPA purifiers were associated with reduced respiratory virus exposures in elementary school classrooms. Secondarily, we examined the risk factors for high viral exposure.

### Air purifier intervention for respiratory viral exposure in elementary schools: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115rL5CG]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

School-aged children are particularly vulnerable to respiratory viral infections, which can result in adverse health outcomes, impaired academic performance and diminished educational attainment due to school absenteeism, and substantial economic costs related to caregiver work absenteeism. Although we did not find that the HEPA purifier intervention was associated with changes in high viral exposure, this secondary analysis was of a clinical trial powered for a different end point. Beyond air filtration or improving ventilation, complementary strategies to reduce viral exposure may include maintaining relative humidity levels between 40% and 60%, which may also enhance comfort for both students and teachers.

Limitations

There are several limitations to our study. This secondary analysis used data from a trial that was originally powered for an asthma clinical end point; thus, the results require confirmation. Post hoc power analysis showed that we had insufficient power to detect small to modest reductions in the odds of high viral exposure. While measures were taken to prevent the HEPA cleaners from being turned off, we did not use sensors to monitor use, which may have altered the effectiveness of the intervention. We oversampled schools without central HVAC systems, which may limit generalizability, although these schools are most likely to benefit from HEPA purifier interventions due to low air-exchange rates from passive ventilation. This study was not powered to evaluate effect modification by other classroom characteristics affecting airflow. While we used a longitudinal study design, we sampled once per season rather than weekly given the enormous logistical challenges of performing large-scale school-based studies with exposure assessment. Postintervention samples were limited to winter, spring, and summer months, which limited our ability to study the full effectiveness of the intervention in the fall, when children return to school. While we assessed specific subtypes of certain viruses, such as influenza virus, due to feasibility we did not further characterize other viral clades, such as rhinovirus. Lastly, while we quantified viral load in air, we could not infer transmissibility.

### Possible role of aerosol transmission in a hospital outbreak of influenza [^112Lkp6y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

We examined the role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting.

Methods

We investigated a seasonal influenza A outbreak that occurred in our general medical ward (with open bay ward layout) in 2008. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected in real time during the outbreak. Spatiotemporal analysis was performed to estimate the infection risk among patients. Airflow measurements were conducted, and concentrations of hypothetical virus-laden aerosols at different ward locations were estimated using computational fluid dynamics modeling.

Results

Nine inpatients were infected with an identical strain of influenza A/H3N2 virus. With reference to the index patient's location, the attack rate was 20.0% and 22.2% in the "same" and "adjacent" bays, respectively, but 0% in the "distant" bay (P = 0.04). Temporally, the risk of being infected was highest on the day when noninvasive ventilation was used in the index patient; multivariate logistic regression revealed an odds ratio of 14.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–131.3; p = 0.015). A simultaneous, directional indoor airflow blown from the "same" bay toward the "adjacent" bay was found; it was inadvertently created by an unopposed air jet from a separate air purifier placed next to the index patient's bed. Computational fluid dynamics modeling revealed that the dispersal pattern of aerosols originated from the index patient coincided with the bed locations of affected patients.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a possible role of aerosol transmission of influenza in an acute ward setting. Source and engineering controls, such as avoiding aerosol generation and improving ventilation design, may warrant consideration to prevent nosocomial outbreaks.

### ASRA pain medicine consensus practice infection control guidelines for regional anesthesia and pain medicine [^111TXhL5]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Operating room environment — regional anesthesia and pain medicine statements and recommendations emphasize infection risk modifiers and mitigation strategies. Statements include that "The impact of laminar flow in the OR on risk of infection is uncertain" and "Increased OR traffic increases SSI risk", and note that "Operating room humidity levels influence bacterial growth rates, particularly in excess of 70% humidity", that "Low OR temperatures are associated with increased risk of infection if this contributes to perioperative patient hypothermia", and that "Increased procedure time has been shown to increase the risk of SSI". Ventilation requirements specify, "In operating rooms, the minimum air movement requirement is 15 total air changes per hour". Recommendations are: "Operating rooms should have HEPA filtration systems" (high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA]; Evidence: grade B); "Maintain OR humidity levels between 20% and 70% to decrease bacterial growth" (Evidence: grade B); "Avoid unnecessary delays that result in increased procedure duration to reduce the risk of SSI" (Evidence: grade A); and "Minimize OR traffic to reduce the risk of SSI" (Evidence: grade C).

### Behaviour of aerosols and their role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2; a scoping review [^112JaMoW]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Many studies propose natural ventilation as the most effective measure, that is keeping windows and doors open. According to Kohanski et al.with three outdoor air renewals per hour in an enclosed space, the risk of contagion is reduced by 95%. If this is not possible, artificial ventilation is the next option, which would depend on the use of air conditioning devices.

Evidence recommends placing the ventilation device on the ceiling, directed horizontally with respect to airflow, and just above the patient in a hospital with infected patients. Air recirculation would increase the permanence of aerosols in suspension, raising the risk of infection if there is a person infected in the enclosed space. Borro et al.recommend boosting clean air from the outside and avoiding recirculation, and if possible, the use of High Efficiency Particulate Arresting air‐purifying filters is recommended, as they remove the remains of the virus, thus preventing contagion. Infectious particles have been found in ventilators in the air grilles of rooms with Covid‐19 infected patients, suggesting that aerosols contaminated with the virus have been displaced by airflows and deposited in the ventilation duct. Air conditioning systems often use filters that reduce the concentration of aerosols, eliminating more than 95% of particles of sizes between 0.3 and 10 μm in diameter.

Although the reviewed studies identified that high temperatures delay the spread of the disease, there is controversy in determining the effect of relative humidity on the dissemination of the virus. On the one hand, authors affirm the enhancing effect of contagions when relative humidity is high. And, on the other, there are authors whose results disagree with this hypothesis. Recently, Morris et al. conducted a study with a mechanistic model which revealed that SARS‐Cov‐2 live longer at low temperatures and extreme conditions of relative humidity, estimating a virus half‐life 22 h longer at 10°C and 40% relative humidity than at 27°C and 65% relative humidity.

### Transmission risk of respiratory viruses in natural and mechanical ventilation environments: implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Africa [^114LjiNU]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Given the importance of adequate temperature control for the comfort of both patients and HCWs as well as the need for proper ventilation and filtration as an infection control strategy, we recommend a hybrid approach of using mechanical ventilation devices that are equipped with air-filtering capabilities to augment natural ventilation. Several models of this approach have been proven effective in IPCincluding: (1) an ordinary fan or HEPA fan can be used to exhaust air outside through a window.(2) A HEPA fan can be used to discharge room air into a return air system. (3) Portable UV filtering or germicidal unitscould be combined with air conditioners to ensure proper air disinfection. (4) The use of devices to create negative pressure around a patient in a room. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health developed the Ventilated Headboard (figure 1) to create negative pressure in the immediate vicinity of an infected patient to protect other patients and healthcare personnel from airborne infections. In addition, natural ventilation should be optimised with proper design to prevent summer overheating from external (weather conditions) and internal (overcrowding and lighting) sources.

Figure 1
Ventilated headboard. The ventilated headboard consists of lightweight, sturdy and adjustable aluminium framing with a retractable plastic canopy. It is fitted with a high-efficiency particulate air fan/filter unit for filtration (adapted from Mead).

There are currently little empiric data on the role of substandard ventilation in the transmission of respiratory viruses at homes and in the healthcare settings in LMICs. Moreover, HCWs in LMICs face other challenges that limit optimum infection control including shortage of good quality PPE, variable knowledge on the appropriate use and maintenance of PPE, rapidly evolving policies and lack of proper infrastructure. In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to conduct further operational research to develop robust evidence to support decision-making and planning by healthcare managers, clinicians and the wider population. Several research questions that could inform policy-makers include: (1) What are the rates of infection transmission in settings with suboptimal versus optimal ventilation? (2) Is the adoption of the hybrid approach effective in reducing the transmission of infections in LMICs? (3) What can be done to maintain thermal comfort in hospital units and makeshift tents without increasing the risk of the transmission of infection? The design of these research projects would benefit from multidisciplinary teams including architects, surveyors, engineers, IPC practitioners and clinicians.

### Indoor air as a vehicle for human pathogens: introduction, objectives, and expectation of outcome [^112mStas]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Airborne spread of pathogens can be rapid, widespread, and difficult to prevent. In this international workshop, a panel of 6 experts will expound on the following: (1) the potential for indoor air to spread a wide range of human pathogens, plus engineering controls to reduce the risk for exposure to airborne infectious agents; (2) the behavior of aerosolized infectious agents indoors and the use of emerging air decontamination technologies; (3) a survey of quantitative methods to recover infectious agents and their surrogates from indoor air with regard to survival and inactivation of airborne pathogens; (4) mathematical models to predict the movement of pathogens indoors and the use of such information to optimize the benefits of air decontamination technologies; and (5) synergy between different infectious agents, such as legionellae and fungi, in the built environment predisposing to possible transmission-related health impacts of aerosolized biofilm-based opportunistic pathogens. After the presentations, the panel will address a set of preformulated questions on selection criteria for surrogate microbes to study the survival and inactivation of airborne human pathogens, desirable features of technologies for microbial decontamination of indoor air, knowledge gaps, and research needs. It is anticipated that the deliberations of the workshop will provide the attendees with an update on the significance of indoor air as a vehicle for transmitting human pathogens with a brief on what is currently being done to mitigate the risks from airborne infectious agents.

### Microbial contamination of powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) used by healthcare staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: an in situ microbiological study [^113T4tuV]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) are an option for healthcare workers requiring respiratory protection during the current COVID-19 pandemic; they are shared between multiple people. PAPR hoods are intended for multiple uses by a single user and may pose an infection risk between wearers.

Methods

Internal components of PAPR hoods and corrugated air supply hoses were swabbed for evidence of bacterial, fungal, common respiratory viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) contamination.

Results

Twenty-five PAPR hoods were swabbed; 10 (40%) returned positive results. Bacterial growth was detected on six PAPR; five of the PAPR tested positive for fungal growth; all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory viruses.

Conclusions

Bacteria and fungi can remain on internal components of PAPR hoods and air supply hoses despite following recommended disinfection procedures. PAPR hoods have the potential to act as fomites, cross-infecting wearers, and patients. Current guidelines for disinfecting PAPR hoods may not be effective for use in high risk healthcare environments.

### The influence of high-efficiency particulate air filtration on mortality and fungal infection among highly immunosuppressed patients: a systematic review [^114oqRAo]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hematological malignancies who are treated with intensive chemotherapy or who receive bone marrow transplants are exposed to an increased risk of developing nosocomial fungal infections. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration with that of non-HEPA filtration in decreasing the rates of mortality and fungal infection among patients with diagnosed hematological malignancies and neutropenia or among patients with bone marrow transplants.

Methods

Articles identified in a Medline search, guidelines, and books, as well as the bibliographies of review articles, monographs, and the articles identified by Medline, were researched. Randomized trials and observational studies comparing HEPA filtration with conventional room ventilation were selected for inclusion in the present review.

Results

Sixteen trials (9 with death as an outcome and 10 with fungal infection as an outcome) that compared HEPA filtration with non-HEPA filtration were selected for meta-analyses. We discovered no significant advantages of HEPA filtration in the prevention of death among patients with hematological malignancies with severe neutropenia in randomized controlled trials (RCTs; relative risk [RR], 0.86 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65–1.14]) and in studies of a lower standard (non-RCTs; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.60–1.25]).

Conclusions

The placement in protected areas of patients with hematological malignancies with severe neutropenia or patients with bone marrow transplants appears to be beneficial, but no definitive conclusion could be drawn from the data available.

### Risk mitigation of shared room ventilation and filtration on SARS-CoV-2 transmission: a multicenter test-negative study [^113nbcDS]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter test-negative case-control study, improved ventilation was associated with reduced odds of infection of SARS-CoV-2 among patients exposed in a shared hospital room. For each additional ACH, we measured an estimated 12% lower odds of infection, while presence of any RMV carried approximately 50% lower odds. The effect size of the presence of a portable HEPA filtration units placed in shared rooms was similar; however, confidence intervals were wide, and this finding was not statistically significant.

The protective role of ventilation has been widely recognized for over two decades with international guidelines recommending optimization of engineering controls in healthcare environments. Despite this, few systematically designed studies assessed the quantitative effect of ventilation and/or filtration on transmission of respiratory viruses prior to 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple outbreak investigations and aerodynamic studies suggested that a lack of ventilation can facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and improved ventilation with or without filtration can improve clearance of environmental air samples. –

There are comparatively few studies that systematically quantified the impact of these engineering controls on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk especially after adjustment for confounding factors. A single-site case-control study of hospitalized roommates exposed to SARS-CoV-2 found no association between median ACH (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46–1.27), but was limited to a small sample size of 37 exposed roommates. More recently, a prospective study of resident contacts in congregate care facilities similarly found 10% lower risk in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with increased ACH in an adjusted analysis.

Our multicenter study undertook a systematic approach to quantifying the relative impact of ventilation and filtration in modulating the risk of transmission among hospitalized roommates. The unadjusted, adjusted, and sensitivity analyses all consistently revealed an estimated 12% lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for every additional ACH, which could significantly improve the safety of shared room environments, above and beyond other existing mitigation measures.

### Household air pollution interventions to improve health in low-and middle-income countries: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111B9Jz1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Household air pollution (HAP) in low- and middle-income countries — air filtration and housing design: No consensus was reached on using mechanical air filtration devices (air purifiers) to reduce HAP exposure, and there is no evidence that active air filtration devices are effective at addressing HAP from biomass fuel combustion. Implementation barriers include that current technologies require electricity with access and cost challenges. Poor housing has been linked to indoor air quality problems, and context-responsive, sustainable building design can help; examples include Swahili architecture, with the caveat that measures must minimize risks of vector-borne diseases such as malaria associated with some traditional building materials.

### Air purifier intervention for respiratory viral exposure in elementary schools: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1116o9Gx]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this secondary analysis of SICAS-2, respiratory viruses were detected in 98.5% of air samples. Although the HEPA purifier intervention was not associated with a decrease in respiratory viral exposure overall, it was associated with a modest decrease in viral diversity. To our knowledge, SICAS-2 was not only the first large-scale, longitudinal school-based study that comprehensively quantified bioaerosol levels of 19 common respiratory viruses but was also the first randomized clinical trial that assessed the association between HEPA purifiers and viral load in the air. By leveraging the novel use of multiplexed ddPCR for absolute quantification of viral load in air samples, we overcame the limitations of low detection rates seen in prior studies using quantitative PCR. Furthermore, we demonstrated that high viral exposure, which peaked during winter months — the height of respiratory infections for school-aged children — was associated with increased school absenteeism.

Most studies on the effectiveness of HEPA filtration for decreasing viral load in the air are model based. The few existing studies on HEPA purifier use are limited by small sample size and do not have robust abilities to quantify viral load. While we did not find an association between HEPA purifier use and high overall viral exposure, the intervention was associated with a 32.8% reduction in viral diversity. However, the clinical significance of these changes is not clear given that we did not find an association between viral diversity and school absenteeism.

In our exploratory analysis of modifiable environmental factors associated with viral exposures, we found that higher levels of coarse PM were associated with increased viral exposure, even with HEPA purifier use, suggesting that further PM reduction may enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. Schools with limited ventilation, such as those in this study, may benefit most from using HEPA purifiers as a cost-effective solution when more comprehensive HVAC upgrades remain cost prohibitive. Additionally, low relative humidity was associated with high viral exposure, even accounting for the winter season. Model-based studies on relative humidity suggest that lower relative humidity levels below 40% could lead to longer persistence in the air of certain viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, by promoting viral stability and suspension in aerosols. Low indoor humidity has also been shown to impair host defense against viral infection.

### High-efficiency particulate air filters in the era of COVID-19: function and efficacy [^111troXs]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Aerosol-generating procedures in the office represent a major concern for health care-associated infection of patients and health care providers by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet provided any recommendations for the use of portable air purifiers, air purifiers with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have been discussed as an adjunctive means for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in health care settings. This commentary discusses HEPA filter mechanisms of action, decontamination time based on efficiency and flow rate, theoretical application to SARS-CoV-2, and limitations. HEPA filter functionality and prior guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for SARS-CoV-1 suggest theoretical efficacy for HEPA filters to decontaminate airborne SARS-CoV-2, although direct studies for SARS-CoV-2 have not been performed. Any portable HEPA purifier utilization for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered an adjunctive infection control measure and undertaken with knowledge of HEPA filter functionality and limitations in mind.

### The removal of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other microbial bioaerosols by air filtration on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surge units [^113GEbxL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study represents the first report to our knowledge of removal of airborne SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital environment using combined air filtration and UV sterilization technology. Specifically, we provide evidence for the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a ward within airborne droplets of > 1 μM. Droplets of 1–4 μM are likely a key vehicle for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as they remain airborne for a prolonged period and can deposit in the distal airways. Recent data have shown that exertional respiratory activity, such as that seen in patients with COVID-19, increases the release of 1–4 μM respiratory aerosols, relative to conventionally defined "aerosol generating procedures" such as noninvasive respiratory support. Patients in ICU are commonly at a later stage of disease and may shed less virus as a result. These data are consistent with our observations, suggesting that aerosol precautions may be more important in conventional wards than in well-defined "aerosol risk areas".

The sampling and detection of airborne viruses poses several technological challenges, and there remains no agreed standard for their use or interpretation. However, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR (albeit at a high cycle threshold [CT] value), and the lack of detection during use of an air sterilization system, adds to a growing body of evidence implicating the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air of a ward managing patients with COVID-19 intimates that this is a key mechanism by which healthcare professionals could become infected. The removal of airborne viral particles and other pathogens may help reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired respiratory infections. This reduction may be by both decreasing the load of respirable particles and by removal of larger droplets that can facilitate fomite-associated spread. The clearance of bioaerosol was not restricted to SARS-CoV-2. Although the impact of air filtration on nosocomial infection is uncertain, the broad range of pathogens removed in this study suggests potential for benefit beyond SARS-CoV-2.

### Air purifiers and acute respiratory infections in residential aged care: a randomized clinical trial [^113CZbUR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, and adenovirus infections and pneumonia, pose a significant threat to the health of the global community. The outcomes of ARIs among older adults, particularly those in residential aged-care facilities (RACFs) or long-term care facilities, can be severe. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this and the critical need to better understand effective infection prevention and control strategies.

The successful prevention of ARIs requires a thorough understanding of pathogen transmission. Risks of inhalation transmission and subsequent infection are associated with several factors, including pathogen-containing aerosol emission and removal rates, exposure, cumulative dose, and the probability of infection. One component of a multimodal approach to reducing the risk of ARIs includes clean air, in which air purification may play a role. Even though there has been a rise in the use of portable air purification devices to prevent ARIs, the effectiveness of in-room air purification in RACFs for reducing the incidence of ARIs is unknown. We sought to investigate the effectiveness of portable in-room air purifiers with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter in reducing the incidence of ARIs among residents of RACFs.

### Air purifiers and acute respiratory infections in residential aged care: a randomized clinical trial [^11227TLs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Settings and Participants

The settings were RACFs. Five facilities were initially approached, with the first 3 agreeing to participate as study sites. Sites were eligible if they had over 50 beds, were accredited by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, and were located in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Engagement in the study was supported by a senior executive manager in the facilities. The size of these facilities ranged from 50 to 100 beds.

The participants were permanent residents in 1 of the 3 included RACFs in NSW, Australia. A purposive sampling approach based on the researchers' network was used to invite study sites. All permanent residents in the 3 facilities were invited to participate in the study. Individuals were invited through 1 of 3 methods: email, at the time of provision of written study information, or through discussions with a member of the research team. To be eligible, participants must have been a permanent resident in 1 of the 3 study sites, living in a private room, and not receiving palliative comfort care (trajectory C) at the time of study commencement. No age restrictions were applied. Prior to our study, none of the participating facilities or participants had any mode of existing air purification or filtration system in place. Residents in respite care and those who were under the care of the public guardian were excluded. Potential participants were followed up 3 days after the initial contact to determine whether they wished to consent.

Intervention

As part of the study, when the participants received the intervention, they had an air purifier containing a HEPA-14 filter (Rediair, GAMA Healthcare) placed in their room. Those receiving the control condition received an identical air purifier that did not contain a HEPA-14 filter. The placement of air purifiers was consistent with the government guideline at the time. Other zones, including shared or communal areas, were excluded. The size of participants' rooms was similar between and within facilities (average, 50 m 3), and all rooms had their own air conditioner. Air purifiers remained at the setting, providing a minimum of 8 air changes per hour. If required, the sleep function could be used at night to reduce lights and noise. This provided a minimum of 3 air changes per hour. Supplement 1 provides more information.

### Airborne aerosolized mouse cytomegalovirus from common otolaryngology procedures: implications for COVID-19 infection [^112Aq5cu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

A surgical mask requires Food and Drug Administration clearance and protects the wearer from larger particles, > 5 µm. A N95 mask is cleared by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Food and Drug Administration and will prevent aerosolized particles > 0.7 µm. Our results indicate that 99.9% of particle counts for all the procedures are < 0.7 µm. These results are consistent with others who reported that these particles can range from 10 nm to 1 µm. Mowbray et al searched the Cochrane Database, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase Classic, Embase, and metaRegister of Controlled Trials and found 5 of 20 studies showing that diathermy or laser can produce ultrafine particles that are respirable in size. A powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) may be a preferred option when performing some of these procedures in patients who are COVID-19 positive. A PAPR filters out contaminants in the air and uses a battery-operated blower to provide the user clean air through a tight-fitting respirator, hood, or helmet. It has a higher assigned protection factor than N95 or other air-purifying respirators, by a factor ≥ 25. An assigned protection factor is the ratio of pollutants outside the device (environment) to those inside the device (inhaled component).

### Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery [^115BCbqU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical face masks were originally developed to contain and filter droplets containing microorganisms expelled from the mouth and nasopharynx of healthcare workers during surgery, thereby providing protection for the patient. However, there are several ways in which surgical face masks could potentially contribute to contamination of the surgical wound, e.g. by incorrect wear or by leaking air from the side of the mask due to poor string tension.

Objectives

To determine whether the wearing of disposable surgical face masks by the surgical team during clean surgery reduces postoperative surgical wound infection.

Search Methods

In December 2015, for this seventh update, we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched the bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the use of disposable surgical masks with the use of no mask.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently.

Main Results

We included three trials, involving a total of 2106 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in infection rates between the masked and unmasked group in any of the trials. We identified no new trials for this latest update.

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited results it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by members of the surgical team has any impact on surgical wound infection rates for patients undergoing clean surgery.

### Summary of WHO infection prevention and control guideline for COVID-19: striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^115p1az9]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Research gaps

The guideline development process identified important gaps in the evidence including cost and resource considerations, effects of IPC interventions on equity and other social and cultural factors, and the need for high quality studies (including well conducted randomised controlled trials) evaluating the effectiveness of IPC interventions for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

IPC measures are often implemented as a package — for example, health and care workers wear PPE while maintaining a physical distance in a HCF with proper ventilation. This bundled approach poses difficulties when designing studies owing to the inappropriateness of decoupling these well established bundles to evaluate the effectiveness of individual measures. To help tackle these challenges, IPC research protocols, which include a multifactorial approach (eg, multi-arm and adaptative trial designs), should be pre-prepared as this would facilitate the timely implementation of studies at the onset of an outbreak of a novel or re-emerging pathogen. Such readiness will help facilitate quick data collection methods and rapidly produce findings to inform best IPC practice. Furthermore, differences in the common understanding of microbial transmission terminology and dynamics complicated evidence synthesis and recommendation development. In response, WHO has recently published a report entitled "global technical report on proposed terminology for pathogens that transmits through the air". However, further research is needed to understand the implications of this new terminology for preventive measures in clinical care settings.

### Ventilation FAQs frequently asked questions… [^113QVnS2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Air flow Some viral particles might travel from one space to another through a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. However, the risk for receiving an infectious dose will depend upon the specific disease as well as any filtration and air cleaning equipment used within the system. Yes, carbon dioxide monitoring can provide information on ventilation in a given space, which can be used to enhance protection against respiratory virus transmission. Strategies incorporating CO 2 monitors range in cost and complexity. However, greater cost and complexity does not always mean greater protection. Limited information exists regarding a direct link associating CO. While fans alone cannot make up for a lack of outdoor air, fans can be used to increase the effectiveness of open windows, as described in the list of ventilation mitigation strategies. Fans can also be used indoors to improve room air mixing.

Improved room air mixing helps distribute supplied clean air and dilute viral particle concentrations throughout the room, which reduces the likelihood of stagnant air pockets where viral concentrations can accumulate. As with all fan use during periods of high respiratory disease transmission, take care to minimize the potential to create air patterns that flow directly across one person onto another: Yes, filters with higher collection efficiencies can provide significant reductions in viral particle concentrations. Filters for use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are generally tested under procedures outlined in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 52. 2–2017-Method of Testing General Ventilation Air-Cleaning Devices for Removal Efficiency by Particle Size. This standard was developed by ASHRAE, a global society focused on building systems, indoor air quality, and sustainability in the built environment.

High-efficiency particulate air filters are even more efficient at filtering human-generated infectious particles than MERV 16 filters. However, outside of a few unique applications, HEPA filters are rarely used in central HVAC systems. and smaller than the MPPS. Thus, HEPA filters are no less than 99. 97% efficient at capturing human-generated viral particles. While these systems do not bring in outdoor dilution air, they are effective at cleaning air within spaces to reduce the concentration of airborne particulates, including particles associated with a respiratory virus. Thus, they give equivalent air exchanges without the need for conditioning outdoor air.

### Room ventilation and the risk of airborne infection transmission in 3 health care settings within a large teaching hospital [^112FVt8p]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Room ventilation is a key determinant of airborne disease transmission. Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission.

Methods

We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an emergency department negative-pressure isolation room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO2 as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk.

Results

Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0.1%-3.6%. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3.6% to 20.7%, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room.

Conclusion

Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of room ventilation for preventing airborne disease transmission.

### Interventions used to reduce infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals-a review [^116ZedBe]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this rapid evidence review was to identify interventions being used in hospitals in an attempt to improve aerosol concentrations through filtration, aerosol inactivation, air flow and ventilation. Overall, we found that ventilation involving the exchange of old air for fresh air needs to be improved to support the organic process of preventing airborne transmission. The included studies have primarily focused on how air filtration and ventilation have and could impact transmission of infectious airborne particles. Ventilation and filtration are each just one of the many approaches that can be used to improve air quality in medical settings and must not be considered siloed from other factors such as microclimates, room dimensions, use of chemical products etc. These actions must be part of an organic strategy aimed at continuous improvement of air quality.

The studies observed the impact of air filtration focussing on the removal of certain particles from the existing air. Filtration was the most commonly discussed intervention, and was shown to be effective in multiple studies. Butler et al. measured PM levels throughout a ward before and after activation of a HEPA/UV-C air-cleaning unit and found its activation to significantly reduce PM levels. Additionally, these levels were reduced throughout the ward, not solely near the device. Mousavi looked specifically at optimising the location of portable air purifying units and found that it is best placed near the patient's bed. Similarly, Conway Morris et al. detected COVID in the air before activating their HEPA/UV-C unit, but not once it was in use, Oberst also came to the same conclusion. All the findings suggest portable air filtration devices can improve patient and healthcare worker safety by reducing airborne transmission. This suggestion was supported by the finding that transplant patients treated in HEPA-filtered rooms experienced lower incidences of pneumonia than those in rooms without HEPA filtration. Three different devices led to improvements or reductions in health conditions, ventilator-assisted pneumonia decreased after the implementation of an eUVGI in a HVAC system, invasive aspergillosis incidences decreased after installing a HEPA filter, reductions in cases of pneumonia in wards that had HEPA filters, and decreases in non-invasive ventilation, nebuliser use and intubation after using a portable PECO air purifier, although these were not all statistically significant.

### The effectiveness of ultra-clean air operating theatres in the prevention of deep infection in joint arthroplasty surgery [^113eU1GD]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Deep infection was identified as a serious complication in the earliest days of total hip arthroplasty. It was identified that airborne contamination in conventional operating theatres was the major contributing factor. As progress was made in improving the engineering of operating theatres, airborne contamination was reduced. Detailed studies were carried out relating airborne contamination to deep infection rates. In a trial conducted by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC), it was found that the use of ultra-clean air (UCA) operating theatres was associated with a significant reduction in deep infection rates. Deep infection rates were further reduced by the use of a body exhaust system. The MRC trial also included a detailed microbiology study, which confirmed the relationship between airborne contamination and deep infection rates. Recent observational evidence from joint registries has shown that in contemporary practice, infection rates remain a problem, and may be getting worse. Registry observations have also called into question the value of "laminar flow" operating theatres. Observational evidence from joint registries provides very limited evidence on the efficacy of UCA operating theatres. Although there have been some changes in surgical practice in recent years, the conclusions of the MRC trial remain valid, and the use of UCA is essential in preventing deep infection. There is evidence that if UCA operating theatres are not used correctly, they may have poor microbiological performance. Current UCA operating theatres have limitations, and further research is required to update them and improve their microbiological performance in contemporary practice.

### Taking steps for cleaner air for respiratory virus prevention… [^116RED5t]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Respiratory viruses can spread in the air you breathe, especially in indoor and crowded spaces.
- Taking steps for cleaner air helps lower harmful germs or viruses in the air, reducing your chances of respiratory illness.
- It is a core prevention strategy recommended for everyone to lower your risk for respiratory illnesses. Recommendation As possible, take steps for cleaner air. This can mean bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Virus particles do not build up in the air outdoors as much as they do indoors. How it works Some germs spread in the air between people. This happens more easily in indoor, crowded spaces with poor airflow. To reduce the risk of exposure, it helps to improve air quality by increasing airflow, cleaning the air with air purifiers, or opting to gather outdoors. Steps you can take
- Bring as much fresh air into your home as possible by opening doors and windows and/or using exhaust fans.
- If your home has a central heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system that has a filter, set the fan to the "on" position instead of "auto" when you have visitors and use pleated filters. Change your filter every three months or according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Use a portable high-efficiency particulate air cleaner.
- As possible, move activities outdoors, where airflow is best. Steps organizations can take
- Ensure existing HVAC systems are providing at least the minimum outdoor air ventilation requirement in accordance with ventilation design codes. Applicable codes are based on the year of building construction or latest renovation and intended building occupancy.
- Aim for 5 or more air changes per hour of clean air.

This can be achieved through any combination of central ventilation system, natural ventilation, or additional devices that provide equivalent ACH to your existing ventilation.

### Metal-organic frameworks with photocatalytic bactericidal activity for integrated air cleaning [^113qq2zB]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Air is the most critical supply for vast majority of living species on the planet and the quality of which has direct effect on human health. Due to the insufficient air exchange and increased time people spent in confined spaces, such as home, schools, offices, vehicles, and hospitals, the air contaminants are of particular concern, especially in view of their threat to vulnerable groups like children, seniors, and patients –. Air purifiers and fresh air ventilators are widely used air freshening equipment to regulate indoor air quality and protect people from health hazards like particulate matter (PM), bioaerosols, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and so on. Most of these air cleaning devices are equipped with fibrous filters, which have the character of dense reticular meshwork and necessary thickness. Due to the physical barrier and adhesion effect, these filters show good capture efficiency for PM, meeting the high efficiency particulate air standard. But significant disadvantages exist for these commonly used fibrous filters, including high air resistance and limited inhibition ability against harmful microorganisms. In particular, they are only capable of partial retention of pathogens like bacteria, fungi, and virus onto the filter surface, instead of completely cleaning them out. Eventually with accumulated organic pollutants as nutrients, the filters become easy breeding ground for pathogenicity microorganism, which causes second airborne contamination. Meanwhile, the accumulation of organism may contribute to the reduction of ventilation volume and loss of filter life. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop integrated filtration materials, which can remove PM effectively as well as interrupt transmission of germs in air by killing them completely.

### Portable HEPA purifiers to eliminate airborne SARS-CoV-2: a systematic review [^115DdThe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Current epidemiologic predictions of COVID-19 suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies must be implemented long-term. In-office aerosol-generating procedures pose a risk to staff and patients while necessitating examination room shutdown to allow aerosol decontamination by indwelling ventilation. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers' effectiveness in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 from indoor environments.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Cochrane Databases, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease.

Review Methods

Data sources were systematically searched for original English-language published studies indexed up to January 14, 2021 per the following search strategy: ("HEPA" OR "High-efficiency" OR "High-efficiency particulate air" OR "Efficiency particulate" OR "Purifier" OR "Filter" OR "Cleaner" OR "Filtration") AND ("COVID" OR "COVID-19" OR "SARS-CoV-2" OR "Coronavirus"). Additional relevant studies were identified by searching the reference lists of included articles.

Results

Eleven published studies have evaluated the effectiveness of portable HEPA purifiers in eliminating airborne SARS-CoV-2 with relevantly sized surrogate particles. Ten studies evaluated aerosols and submicron particles similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 virions. In all studies, portable HEPA purifiers were able to significantly reduce airborne SARS-CoV-2-surrogate particles. The addition of portable HEPA purifiers augmented other decontamination strategies such as ventilation.

Conclusion

Experimental studies provide evidence for portable HEPA purifiers' potential to eliminate airborne SARS-CoV-2 and augment primary decontamination strategies such as ventilation. Based on filtration rates, additional air exchanges provided by portable HEPA purifiers may be calculated and room shutdown times potentially reduced after aerosol-generating procedures.

### Clearing the air: addressing air clearance times for infectious aerosols in healthcare facilities [^115iL2SP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Taking these factors into consideration, our team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and infection preventionists developed a pragmatic approach for estimating the time required to remove and/or inactivate aerosolized infectious particles. Figure 1 compares the air clearance times sufficient to remove 90%–99.9% of bioaerosols at varying air exchange rates from the aforementioned CDC table to modified times that reflect additional 30% (conservative estimate) and 50% (moderate estimate) reductions in infective particles to account for the effect of relative humidity between 40% and 60% This relative humidity is achievable in most interventional radiology suites, operating rooms, and many patient rooms. It is also consistent with the current ANSI/ASHRAE/ASHE Standard 17022008 recommendation for relative humidity in critical-care areas.

Fig. 1.
Comparison of times required to clear particulates: The effect of air exchanges alone versus air exchanges and a relative humidity of between 40% to 60%. The following formula was used to estimate air clearance times (in minutes) for set Percent Particulate Removal Efficiencies (PRE) with changing Air Exchange Rates per hour (ACH) and both conservative (−30%) and moderate (−50%) reduction factors (RF) to account for a relative humidity (RH) of between 40 and 60%:

The time required for a removal efficiency of 95% (conceptually in alignment with the particulate efficiency of a fit-test respirator) was established as a reasonable end point that balanced both patient and healthcare worker safety. The concept that a 95% removal efficiency was safe resonated with and was accepted by physicians based on 2 factors. First, despite technical differences between 95% removal efficiency and the 95% filtration efficiency of a N95-rated respirator, which applies to particles 0.3 µm or larger in diameter, it was felt that these would be equivalent by the time air clearance time had elapsed, due the fact that larger particles would settle quickly with gravity. Furthermore, any residual particles, regardless of size, would have a significantly decreased infectivity due to relative humidity. To further improve air clearance, there was commitment to minimize traffic and equipment in the suites to optimize air circulation and minimize cross transmission on surfaces. Although the incremental benefit of any one of these additional measures was unknown, it was felt that all would act to increase the margin of safety.

### Decontamination of indoor air to reduce the risk of airborne infections: studies on survival and inactivation of airborne pathogens using an aerobiology chamber [^113BQBzb]. American Journal of Infection Control (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although indoor air can spread many pathogens, information on the airborne survival and inactivation of such pathogens remains sparse.

Methods

Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were nebulized separately into an aerobiology chamber (24.0m 3). The chamber's relative humidity and air temperature were at 50% ± 5% and 20°C ± 2°C, respectively. The air was sampled with a slit-to-agar sampler. Between tests, filtered air purged the chamber of any residual airborne microbes.

Results

The challenge in the air varied between 4.2 log 10 colony forming units (CFU)/m 3 and 5.0 log 10 CFU/m 3, sufficient to show a ≥ 3 log 10 (≥ 99.9%) reduction in microbial viability in air over a given contact time by the technologies tested. The rates of biologic decay of S aureus and K pneumoniae were 0.0064 ± 0.00015 and 0.0244 ± 0.009 log 10 CFU/m 3 /min, respectively. Three commercial devices, with ultraviolet light and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filtration, met the product efficacy criterion in 45–210 minutes; these rates were statistically significant compared with the corresponding rates of biologic decay of the bacteria. One device was also tested with repeated challenges with aerosolized S aureus to simulate ongoing fluctuations in indoor air quality; it could reduce each such recontamination to an undetectable level in approximately 40 minutes.

Conclusions

The setup described is suitable for work with all major classes of pathogens and also complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines (2012) for testing air decontamination technologies.

### Interventions used to reduce infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals-a review [^115mbz2j]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for improved infectious aerosol concentrations through interventions that reduce the transmission of airborne infections. The aims of this review were to map the existing literature on interventions used to improve infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals and understand challenges in their implementation.

Methods

We reviewed peer-reviewed articles identified on three databases, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to July 2024. 6417 articles were identified, 160 were reviewed and 18 were included.

Findings

Results on aerosol concentration were discussed in terms of three categories: (1) filtration and inactivation of aerosol particles; (2) effect of airflow and ventilation on aerosol concentrations; and (3) improvements or reduction in health conditions. The most common device or method that was outlined by researchers was high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters which were able to reduce aerosol concentrations under investigation across the included literature. Some articles were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions in terms of improving health outcomes for patients.

Interpretation

The key finding is that infectious aerosol concentration improvement measures based on filtration, inactivation, improved air flow dynamics, and ventilation reduce the likelihood of nosocomial infections. However limitations of such approaches must be considered such as noise pollution and effects on ambient humidity. Whilst these efforts can contribute to improved air quality in hospitals, they should be considered with the other interacting factors such as microclimates, room dimensions and use of chemical products that effect air quality.

### PPE training and the effectiveness of universal masking in preventing exposures: the importance of the relationship between anesthesia and infection prevention [^11457Sjs]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Early in the pandemic, infection prevention (IP), in collaboration with our local anesthesia leadership, took the approach of ensuring all members of the Anesthesia Department understood the importance of universal masking, were individually trained on the use of the Controlled Air Purifier Respirator, as well the appropriate method for donning/doffing N95 respirators. Multiple providers in the department tested positive for COVID, resulting in the IP Department to conduct the routine contact tracing investigation. During the investigation, it was determined that all persons who met the CDC (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) contact exposure guidelines would undergo COVID testing, which consequently was 109 team members due to the exposure risk identified in the break room space. IP worked with the Anesthesia Preoperative Clinic to test all team members identified over a 3-day period (approximately 5–7 days postexposure). Out of the 109 team members who were tested postexposure, there were 0 conversions. The department attributes this to the consistency in personal protective equipment training, support and collaboration between anesthesia and IP which led to successful care for COVID patients with a limited provider infection rate.

Outstanding questions and need for further research

Many of the studies investigated the effect of interventions on simulated aerosols, further research is needed to assess its effect on real viral particles such as SARS-COV-2and measuring the presence or absence of infection in healthcare professionals and patients as an outcome. There is a need to consider the potential harm of adding air purifiers to medical wards, through effects on noise, reduced ambient humidity, and impact on the delivery of care. Existing literature has also identified health and safety risks of using UV sterilisation in the proximity of people, and has called for additional research into how hospital ward characteristics (humidity and temperature) can impact the effectiveness of the technology. Whilst our search strategy did not encompass techniques to manage aerosol concentrations such as heat and internal pressure difference, these approaches were still discussed in the included literature and were found to be effective at mitigating aerosol concentrations. Heat, internal pressure difference, microclimates, use of chemical products, room size, and number of people or type of furniture in a room, are avenues to research further in terms of their impact on air quality and must be considered as a multi-pronged approach as the factors all interact with each other.

There are numerous methods currently being used in hospitals to improve aerosol concentrations through ventilation, airflow, filtration, and pressurised rooms. Papers identified that the air change rates currently in use were not frequent enough to ensure effective reduction of infectious aerosols and that reliance on some of the above interventions would support with this. However the barriers to using such approaches must be considered in addition to ensuring their efficiency is monitored regularly. The articles also outlined the importance of aerosol concentrations in hospitals to reduce infections, identifying that using eUVGI in HVAC systems, HEPA filters and PECO air purifiers improved patient outcomes. Finally it is of huge importance that efforts to improve aerosol concentrations are considered as part of an organic strategy that encompasses a huge range of factors in addition to ventilation and filtration (microclimates, room dimensions, use of chemical products etc.) that can facilitate continuous improvement of air quality.

### Engineering infection controls to reduce indoor transmission of respiratory infections: a scoping review [^114b7KnW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Engineering infection controls include a wide range of interventions used indoors to reduce occupants' exposure to respiratory pathogens.

Purpose

To identify and describe primary studies evaluating the effects of engineering infection control interventions designed to reduce the spread of respiratory infections transmitted through indoor air.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Scopus, and Environmental Science Collection from database inception to 12 December 2023.

Study Selection

English-language primary research articles evaluating engineering infection control interventions.

Data Extraction

Publication information, population characteristics, intervention details, and all relevant outcomes were abstracted by a reviewer and verified by a second, senior reviewer.

Data Synthesis

A total of 672 studies published between 1929 and 2024 were identified. Most (n = 606) evaluated environmental samples only, 57 included human participants, and 9 included sentinel animal subjects. About half of the studies included at least 1 intervention classified as pathogen inactivation (n = 405), with fewer involving pathogen removal (n = 200) or air exchange or dilution (n = 143). Across all studies, about half (n = 332) measured the quantity of viable nonpathogenic organisms from air samples, followed by the quantity of nonbiological particulates (n = 197) or viable pathogenic organisms (n = 149). Harms, such as toxic byproducts, were rarely measured.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language publications and gray literature.

Conclusion

There is substantial heterogeneity in the available evidence. Gaps in evidence include studies measuring efficacy outcomes that are highly relevant for human infection transmission or harms. Refinements in classification of interventions and outcomes could strengthen reporting of these evaluations.

### Summary of WHO infection prevention and control guideline for COVID-19: striving for evidence based practice in infection prevention and control [^114prNPq]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Healthcare facilities

To prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the HCF and to minimise spread in the broader community, IPC measures need to be consistently implemented. The covid-19 pandemic reinforced the importance of establishing WHO minimum requirements for IPC programmes.

Integral to the WHO minimum requirements for the IPC programmes is the hierarchy of control measures, which is a framework used in IPC and occupational health to categorise mitigation measures that reduce the risk of disease acquisition (box 2). For IPC programmes, the most important categories include engineering controls (ie, reduce transmission risk through HCF design such as modifying ventilation systems or installing protective barriers); administrative controls (ie, reduce transmission risk in HCF through the implementation of policies and trainings — for example, visitor management, patient placements, and sick leave policies); and the appropriate selection and use of PPE.

Box 2
1 Summary of WHO recommendations for healthcare facilities

Prompt identification and recognition of covid-19 signs and symptoms and the immediate isolation of suspected or confirmed cases within HCFs are critical for preventing further transmission. Standard and transmission based precautions are applied based on a risk assessment when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19.

While the guideline reaffirms the application of standard precautions including hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, handling of linens and laundry, waste management, and handling of the deceased, it also highlights covid-19 specific considerations including targeted and universal use of medical masks, determined according to the level of community transmission. The guideline emphasises the importance of the appropriate selection and use of PPE, particularly during aerosol generating procedures. It also includes a section on prevention, identification, and management of health and care worker infections, to prevent onward transmission.

Specialised settings that might require a tailored approach in the implementation of IPC measures are dealt with in the guideline, including home care settings, long term care facilities and other specific activities such as vaccination administration.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel has identified the following topics related to allergen mitigation interventions (eg, acaricides, air purifiers, HEPA vacuum cleaners, carpet removal, pet removal, cleaning products, and mold mitigation) that require additional research:
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions that use the validated outcome measures recommended by the Asthma Outcomes Workshop
Effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions in individuals with asthma who have demonstrated exposure and/or sensitization to these allergens at home, school, or work
Multicomponent interventions targeted to specific allergens in study populations consisting only of people with demonstrated sensitization and exposure to those allergens
Comparisons of different combinations of multicomponent interventions to determine the optimal combination(s) of allergen-specific mitigation strategies that improve outcomes
Studies to determine the allergen reduction thresholds for symptoms
Interactions and necessity of exposure, sensitization, and symptoms to determine which individuals with asthma will benefit most from allergen mitigation strategies (eg, whether an allergen-specific mitigation strategy is beneficial for an individual with asthma who has sensitization on skin prick testing to an allergen, is exposed to that allergen, and denies having symptoms)

In addition, reports of studies on the effectiveness of allergen mitigation interventions must include details on the intervention studied (eg, the models of air purifiers used) and the protocols for using the intervention (eg, how often the air purifier was turned on, where it was located, and how often the filter was changed). These aspects of the intervention need to be measured, and levels of adherence to the protocol need to be reported.

### Protecting frontline healthcare workers should be the top priority in low-resource health systems: Bangladesh and COVID-19 [^114xsNX1]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

While awaiting essential PPE, environmental and administrative controls should be put in place to minimize HCW exposure. HCWs should strictly follow established protocols to assess, triage, and cohort patients. Additionally, trainings based on appropriate IPC practices, such as put forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should be required for HCWs caring for patients with COVID-19. To reduce HCW shortages, staff inadvertently exposed to patients with COVID-19 could perform diligent self-monitoring and universal mask wearing, with isolation only if signs develop, as has been done in Singapore. Furthermore, rational use of PPE can be applied when the "gold standard" is not available. For example, the CDC recommends N95 respirator plus a face shield or a powered, air-purifying respirator (PAPR) when caring for patients with COVID-19. Given the extremely short supply of both in Bangladesh and other LMICs, other strategies should be employed, such as the use of medical masks on both patients and providers, which is supported by a recent randomized trial showing equally effective infection prevention.

### Indoor environmental control practices and asthma management [^115m5Ktn]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers — effects, limitations, and use in homes with tobacco smoke exposure — have been shown to reduce indoor particulate matter (PM) and symptoms, but important caveats apply: the use of portable HEPA purifiers has been shown to reduce indoor PM concentrations by approximately 25% to 50% and to reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbations; portable HEPA purifiers appear to be effective in reducing PM from tobacco and nontobacco smoke sources, but there is little evidence to support their efficacy in reducing airborne animal allergens or pollen; for families not willing to make the home smoke free, 2 randomized controlled trials suggest that the use of portable HEPA purifiers in the home may be of some benefit but would not be as effective as if occupants stopped smoking or instituted a home smoking ban; if they are suggested, nonionizing HEPA purifiers with clean air delivery rates appropriate for the size of the room may be most effective; however, HEPA purifiers do not appear to have any effect on air nicotine and possibly other gaseous components of tobacco smoke, so HEPA purifiers will not offer any protection from the adverse health effects of these nonparticle components of secondhand smoke (SHS).

### Effect of plasma air purifiers on infection rates in orthopedic surgery [^116RuYqc]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical site infection (SSI) following orthopedic surgery impacts patient outcomes. Airborne transmission is one potential route of infection. Despite their high cost and resource demands, modern ventilation systems have shown limited efficacy in reducing SSI rates. This trial investigated the effectiveness of a low-cost air purifier in reducing SSI rates after orthopedic surgery.

Methods

In a nationwide, multicenter, double-blind, cluster-randomized crossover, placebo-controlled superiority trial, we included all patients undergoing orthopedic surgery during the trial period. The intervention group underwent surgery in operating rooms with active Novaerus NV800 air purifiers, while the control group underwent surgery in operating rooms with the same air purifiers that were inactive. The primary end point was SSI within 12 weeks post surgery, defined as a postsurgery infection marker (PSIM), a custom composite outcome based on registry codes for prescribed antibiotics, diagnoses, and surgical procedures. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the primary outcome.

Results

Of the 40,547 patients analyzed, 19,869 were in the intervention group and 20,678 in the control group. The PSIM rate was 9.2% in the invention group, and 9.4% in the control group, with an odds ratio of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.05) for the intervention group. This finding remained consistent across various subgroups based on diagnoses, hospital levels, and ventilation types.

Conclusions

In modern operating rooms equipped with standard, midrange airflow ventilation systems, the addition of wall-mounted plasma air purifiers did not reduce the PSIM rate after orthopedic surgery.

### Multisociety guidance for infection prevention and control in nursing homes [^111go6si]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

27. How should nursing homes implement respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and source control to control the spread of respiratory pathogens?

Recommendation: Nursing homes should have policies and protocols for respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and masking for source control to prevent transmission of infection to HCP, visitors, and residents that include:
Education of HCP, residents, and visitors in how to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens
Signage and reminders at entrances and in shared areas on hand hygiene and how and when to wear a mask for source control
Appropriate and easily accessed supplies (e.g. masks, ABHS) so practices can be followed.

Rationale: Clear and easily visible policies, guidance, and reminders about recommended practices to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens should be posted at facility entrances, break rooms, and shared areas frequented by residents. This is particularly true when changes in facility practice are made in response to a facility outbreak or increases in respiratory virus transmission in the community. For example, when there is an increase in respiratory virus transmission in the community, CDC recommends that healthcare facilities consider having everyone mask upon entry to the facility to ensure better adherence to respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette for those who might be infectious. Providing necessary supplies will ensure that individuals are able to follow recommended practices. CDC has created a viral respiratory pathogen toolkit for nursing homes to help them prepare for and prevent the spread of respiratory viruses.

28. How should nursing homes use ventilation to control the spread of respiratory pathogens?

Recommendation: Nursing homes should:
Ensure they are compliant with building code requirements for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
Monitor ventilation systems in accordance with engineers' and manufacturers' recommendations to ensure optimal performance
Ensure the IPC program collaborates with facility management, particularly in circumstances when considering implementation of any supplemental strategies to enhance ventilation (e.g. during a facility respiratory pathogen outbreak) (see 5)
Have a process in place for isolating residents with pathogens for which an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) is recommended (e.g. tuberculosis) If an AIIR is not available, the residents should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available. Place a mask on the resident (if tolerated) and isolate the resident in a private room with the door closed, while awaiting transfer.

### Air purifiers and acute respiratory infections in residential aged care: a randomized clinical trial [^112iUg4o]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The effectiveness of in-room air purification for the reduction of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in residential aged-care facilities (RACFs) is unknown.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of in-room air purifiers with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-14 filters in reducing the incidence of ARIs among residents of RACFs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used a multicenter, double-blind, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover design for 6 months from April 7 to October 26, 2023, in 3 RACFs with a bed capacity of 50 to 100 in New South Wales, Australia. The purposive sampling approach included permanent residents in private rooms in the enrolled RACFs. Data collection was performed every 2 weeks and required no additional follow-up beyond the final data collection on October 31, 2023.

Intervention

An air purifier containing a HEPA-14 filter was placed in rooms of participants in the intervention group, and an air purifier without a HEPA-14 filter was placed in rooms of the control participants. The groups crossed over after 3 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of ARIs, assessed with logistic mixed-model regression.

Results

Among 135 participants randomized (70 to the intervention-first group and 65 to the control-first group), 78 (57.8%) were female; mean (SD) age was 85.2 (8.6) years. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the use of air purifiers with HEPA-14 filters did not reduce ARIs compared with the control (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32–1.04; p = 0.07). Among the 104 participants who completed the entire study, the intervention reduced ARI incidence from 35.6% (37 participants) in the control group to 24.0% (25 participants) in the intervention group (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28–1.00; p = 0.048).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this clinical trial investigating use of air purifiers with HEPA-14 filters for reducing ARIs, no significant between-group difference was found in the intention-to-treat analysis. However, a significant reduction in ARIs was identified among participants who completed the entire study. These findings may help inform future large-scale studies of respiratory infectious diseases.

### Air purifier intervention for respiratory viral exposure in elementary schools: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113VGyrk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Treatment Effect of HEPA Purifiers

For our primary analysis, we conducted an intention-to-treat analysis including all classrooms with at least 1 baseline air sample collected. The main outcome of interest was the mean treatment effect of HEPA purifiers on the probability of high viral exposure, comparing preintervention and postintervention differences between treated (HEPA purifiers) and control (sham purifiers) classrooms. Secondary outcomes were compared between preintervention and postintervention periods. High viral exposure was analyzed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with logit link. Viral diversity was analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Both models included fixed effects for intervention group and intervention period (before vs after), with the interaction of the 2 terms serving as the primary effect of interest. Random effects were used to account for repeated measures within each school year in classrooms and clustering of classrooms in schools.

Sensitivity analyses were performed using generalized additive mixed models, with the addition of a spline term for days since the start of school to adjust for the effect of season as a precision variable. Analyses of virus-specific changes in concentration after the HEPA purifier intervention were conducted using generalized additive mixed models. Viral concentrations were normalized using z -score transformation to allow for comparability. Due to multiple comparisons across individual viruses, false-discovery-rate correction was applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

Implications of Viral Exposure for School Absenteeism

To evaluate the association between viral exposure and school absenteeism, we first calculated the proportion of classrooms with high viral exposure per year, and the mean number of viruses detected in each school. Absenteeism was similarly calculated per year in each school. We then used a linear regression model to investigate the effect of viral exposure on absenteeism.

### Guidance on mitigating the risk of transmitting respiratory infections during nebulization by the COPD foundation nebulizer consortium [^114CZD2d]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Home nebulization environment — Aerosol treatment should be administered in a location where the air is not recirculated into the house. Operating the nebulizer near open windows and in areas with increased air circulation, using one or more air purifiers, and minimizing the number of household members could reduce the risk of household exposures to fugitive aerosols further.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^115ntS8j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) in contingency or crisis capacity — access to PAPRs may be even more limited due to cost and the need for routine maintenance and cleaning/disinfection between uses; they can be considered if a healthcare facility has an established PAPR program that can appropriately service, clean, disinfect, and turn around devices for the next user. Programs that incorporate PAPRs must also include programs for battery supply and maintenance, and healthcare personnel must complete formal competency training on appropriate use and how to safely doff the PAPR hood to avoid self-contamination. Removal of PAPR hoods is more complicated than removal of an N95 or similar respirator and may increase the risk of self-contamination.

### Respiratory health effects of air pollutants [^116EUmqn]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

### The removal of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other microbial bioaerosols by air filtration on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surge units [^115dXHbG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has limitations. The evaluation was conducted in 2 rooms, and there are no data defining the optimal air changes required to remove detectable pathogens with the specified devices, nor their impact in better ventilated facilities. Given the large volume of air within the room and the stability of viruses in the sampling fluid, it was predictable that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 detected would be minimal. However, negative results from the control sampler — and the striking but reversible effect of the air filtration devices — suggest these are not false positive detections, and we cannot exclude the risk of airborne infection. Future studies should examine whether air filtration devices have an impact on healthcare professional and patient focused outcomes, including measuring infection/exposure as an endpoint, as well as assessing potential harm, such as noise, reduced ambient humidity, or impact on delivery of care.

We were able to detect airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a repurposed COVID-19 "surge ward" and found that air filtration can remove SARS-CoV-2 RNA below the limit of qPCR detection. SARS-CoV-2 was infrequently detected in the air of a "surge ICU"; however, the device retained its ability to reduce microbial bioaerosols. Portable air filtration devices may mitigate the reduced availability of airborne infection isolation facilities when surges of COVID-19 patients overwhelm healthcare resources and improve safety of those at risk of exposure to respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.

### Fit-tested N95 masks combined with portable high-efficiency particulate air filtration can protect against high aerosolized viral loads over prolonged periods at close range [^116CyyAL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

(See the Editorial Commentary by Klompas and Rhee on pages 191–4.)

Virus-laden aerosols can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and travel large distances while remaining infectious. Epidemiological evidence from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks highlight the importance of aerosol transmission. Nosocomial infection risk was demonstrated to be greatest in the setting of "aerosol-generating procedures", which informed enhanced respiratory protection recommendations for healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing such procedures. However, recent work has shown that HCWs caring for patients not receiving aerosol-generating procedures contracted COVID-19 despite the use of surgical masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Subsequent studies demonstrated that aerosols laden with infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are present in the rooms of COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, likely because aerosols are self-generated by COVID-19 patients when they cough, talk, and breathe.

These findings led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend that HCWs wear an N95 (or higher-level respirator) and to optimize indoor air quality, including the deployment of portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters when permanent air-handling systems cannot be feasibly improved. Importantly, there is evidence that each measure in isolation (enhanced personal protection and enhanced environmental protection) may be inadequate. For example, pre–COVID-19 studies demonstrated that respiratory infections still occur in the context of N95 and fit-tested N95 respirators. Furthermore, a Cochrane review showed uncertainty for any benefit of N95 masks over surgical masks in protecting against respiratory illness. Regarding environmental protection, COVID-19 can still be transmitted in outdoor (ie, optimally ventilated) settings and airborne SARS-CoV-2 can still be detected in negative-pressure isolation rooms (≥ 12 air exchanges/hour).

### We must rigorously follow basic infection control procedures to protect our healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 [^111emkWW]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Engineering and environmental controls

For potentially airborne infections, engineering controls consist of measures that: (1) create directional air flow to move air away from uninfected persons; (2) dilute the air to reduce the concentration of airborne infectious particles; (3) remove such particles from the air by high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration or effective UV light installation; and (4) prevent recirculation of potentially contaminated air. Some examples include enhanced ventilation in waiting areas, performing aerosol-generating procedures in airborne infection isolation rooms or the equivalent, and use of droplet and aerosol capture devices during aerosol-generating procedures.

Examples of environmental controls include (1) plexiglass partitions between patients and staff in triage areas and (2) meticulously cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and objects in all parts of the facility.

### A controlled crossover human volunteer study of the in vivo filtration efficacy of a high-efficiency particulate air-filtering oxygen mask [^114skccj]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Nosocomial airborne disease transmission can be important in some epidemics. An oxygen mask incorporating a high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filter may reduce the chance of inhaling airborne particles. In a randomized controlled crossover volunteer study, the median ratio of ambient:intramask 0.02 to 1-μ particles was significantly higher for the HEPA oxygen mask than for a Hudson-type mask (P < .001), and was ≥ 100 in 59%-64% of subjects. The use of HEPA masks may protect patients receiving supplementary oxygen against airborne pathogens.

### Air purifier intervention for respiratory viral exposure in elementary schools: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114YG6Vh]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SICAS-2, a randomized clinical trial of HEPA filters in elementary school classrooms, HEPA purifiers were not associated with a reduction in high viral exposure but were associated with a modest decrease in viral diversity. Future studies should further investigate multicomponent environmental interventions, such as targeting higher relative humidity, to reduce respiratory virus exposure in schools.

COVID-19 infection prevention — personal protective equipment (PPE) definitions and donning/doffing: Medical/surgical masks are described as masks with or without plastic shields used as a physical barrier to protect the user from hazards such as larger respiratory droplets, and medical masks also protect other people against infection by trapping large particles of body fluids expelled by the wearer. Respirator refers to devices used to protect healthcare personnel from airborne particles that can lead to infection, including N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), higher-level "mask-like" respirators (e.g. N99, N100), powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), controlled air purifying respirators, and elastomeric respirators. Donning and doffing procedures are defined as the practice of putting on and removing PPE, with donning referring to putting on PPE and doffing meaning removing it.

### Interventions used to reduce infectious aerosol concentrations in hospitals-a review [^1149nCBj]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Improvements or reduction in health conditions

Only four of the articles looked at the direct impact of interventions on health conditions (pneumonia, invasive aspergillosis, and respiratory distress). Many of the other publications often used simulations of particles that mimicked the infectious agents that cause health conditions. All four articles outlined improvements in health conditions as a result of an intervention (enhanced UV germicidal irradiation in HVAC systems, HEPA filters, PECO air purifiers) through changes in aerosol concentrations, despite only two of the publications having statistically significant results. None of the publications reported what impact seasons may have had on the changes in health conditions. Two of the studies had durations for over one-year, and one study was run from August to December.

Ryan et al. reported after using an enhanced UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) in HVAC systems, ventilator-assisted pneumonia (VAP) was decreased from 74% to 55% after 6-months (January 2002) and to 44% after 18-months (January 2003) (p = 0.04). However, it is worth noting that these findings are only relevant to HVAC systems which recirculate air, this is rare in UK healthcare settings as this method does not provide the level of filtration needed for hospitals. Additionally, the study did not evaluate if there were any by-products related to the use of UVGI. Salam et al. found that after HEPA filters were installed, incidences of invasive aspergillosis (IA) significantly decreased, individuals admitted after the HEPA filters were installed had around 51% lower risk of acquiring IA. The change in incidence was calculated over the 31-month study period. This study however did not report on the potential mechanism behind the HEPA filter's impact such as changes to air flow.

The two publications that found non-significant improvements in health conditions as a result of interventions stressed however that the results were still clinically meaningful. Rao et al. found improvements after the implementation of portable PECO air purifiers when running the study between August and December 2018. Pre-to post-intervention for patients showed non-invasive ventilation improved from 77% to 23%, rate of nebuliser use from 59% to 41% and rate of intubation from 57.1% to 43%. Whilst Vokurka et al.found an almost significant trend for reductions in pneumonia in the presence of HEPA filters, and therefore recommended where possible to use HEPA filters in rooms with immunocompromised patients.

### Evaluation of the rationale for concurrent use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with loose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators during aerosol-generating medical procedures [^115stBfr]. American Journal of Infection Control (2008). Low credibility.

The concurrent use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with powered air-purifying respirators during aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with severe respiratory pathogens has been promoted as offering additional protection against infectious agents. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of this additional respiratory equipment upon protection and personal performance. The presumed additive protective effect of an N95 filtering facepiece respirator used concurrently with a powered air-purifying respirator has not been subjected to rigorous scientific investigation. The burden imposed by additional respiratory protective equipment should not be discounted, and the potentially minor contribution to protection may be offset by the negative impact on personal performance. Novel uses of protective equipment occasionally are spawned during crisis situations, but their generalized applicability to healthcare workers should ultimately be evidence-based.

### Reducing airborne transmissible diseases in perioperative environments [^115E9LG5]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed our understanding of aerosol transmissible disease and the measures required to minimise transmission. Anaesthesia providers are often in close proximity to patients and other hospital staff for prolonged periods while working in operating and procedure rooms. Although enhanced ventilation provides some protection from aerosol transmissible disease in these work areas, close proximity and long duration of exposure have the opposite effect. Surgical masks provide only minimal additional protection. Surgical patients are also at risk from viral and bacterial aerosols. Despite having recently experienced the most significant pandemic in 100 yr, we continue to lack adequate understanding of the true risks encountered from aerosol transmissible diseases in the operating room, and the best course of action to protect patients and healthcare workers from them in the future. Nevertheless, hospitals can take specific actions now by providing respirators for routine use, encouraging staff to utilise respirators routinely, establishing triggers for situations that require respirator use, educating staff concerning the prevention of aerosol transmissible diseases, and providing portable air purifiers for perioperative spaces with low levels of ventilation.

Insertion

Perform in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). If an AIIR is not available, avoid entry into room by non-essential personnel for at least 10 min following the procedure due to persistence of viable virus in aerosols.
Limit the number of participants in the room to essential personnel only.
An experienced attending surgeon or other experienced individual should perform the procedure. Trainees should not be involved unless absolutely necessaryto expedite the procedure and avoid unnecessary risk.
Post a runner outside the room to aid communication and to obtain new equipment as needed.
Take only essential equipment into the room, including an oversupply of any medications that will be needed. Have potentially necessary and backup equipment immediately outside the room (thoracic equipment bag). It is important to avoid delays or interruptions after starting the procedure due to lack of equipment or sedative medications.
Ensure presence of a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) viral filter on the ventilator and also on suctioning equipment.
Set up the chest tube drainage system (as per previous section) prior to beginning the procedure.
Perform standard hand hygiene and use a double glove technique, which has been recommended to reduce risk of viral transfer during doffing of PPE. Wear a fluid-resistant gown. Double gowning has also been recommended by some. Personnel should use an N-95 or P100 or higher mask, along with a fluid shield and full eye protection. Individuals may prefer to use a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) with standard donning as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
During non-procedural situations, in the event of failure of PAPR gear, healthcare personnel are instructed to leave the room immediately since they are no longer protected from airborne viral transmission.
If the patient is mechanically ventilated, use neuromuscular blockade in addition to full sedation/analgesia to prevent coughing and resultant particulate spread.
Fully drape the entire patient and bed after sterile preparation of the chest to avoid any contamination of the bed, pillow, sheets or equipment. Use a double layer of impervious draping to prevent soak-through. Place instruments on a flat tray or table instead of on the patient to avoid equipment rolling or falling off the bed.
Clamp the tube prior to insertion.
If safe for the patient, hold ventilation prior to entry into the pleural space and until placement of the tube.
Make as small of a skin incision as necessary to adequately place the tube thoracostomy.
Following pleurotomy, immediately insert a sterile suction catheter to evacuate the space.
Place the tube into the pleural space using digital confirmation of entry into the thoracic cavity.
Attach the tube to the previously prepared chest tube management system tubing with in-line viral filters for egress of air from the thoracic cavity (see next section). Unclamp the chest tube once tube is connected to drainage system.
Ensure that the thoracostomy tube will not dislodge from the drainage system but still allow visual inspection of the connection. The use of cable ties instead of tape for this connection is particularly useful (figure 5).
Close the skin incision around the tube with additional sutures to prevent air leakage around the tube.
Doff PPE as recommended by the CDC.

### COVID-19 coronavirus: recommended personal protective equipment for the orthopaedic and trauma surgeon [^112Suz3p]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

In comparison to surgical masks, respirator masks show protection factors 11.5–15.9 times greater than those of surgical masks. In addition to the type of masks used, the fitting and sizing of the mask is of utmost importance. Only a perfect-sized and well-fitted mask leads to efficient sealing of the respiratory tract. Intact masks can be worn for up to 8 h continuously.

Powered air-purifying respirators were mainly used during the SARS outbreak for health-care personnel involved in high-risk invasive procedures or AGPs. These respirators in the form of a hood or a full-face mask consist of a motor-driven fan guiding the possibly contaminated air towards a filter, which then actively filters it and finally delivers the clean air to the user's face and/or mouth.

A recent systematic review of four randomised controlled trials by Bartoszko et al. compared medical masks to N95 respirator masks in their efficacy to prevent coronavirus in health-care workers. The authors found and concluded that low certainty evidence exists that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in health-care workers during non-aerosol-generating care.

### Using an air purifier as a supplementary protective measure in dental clinics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [^114XXk5Z]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

During dental treatments, saliva may become aerosolized, and microorganisms in such aerosols from the oral cavity contribute to the spread of infectious diseases. Our previous study proved that running air purifiers in suitable locations can remove aerosols in dental clinics significantly, resulting in the reduction of dental healthcare worker (DHCWs) exposure to aerosols ranging from 80% to 95%. Regarding to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a recent study found that the virus appears most commonly in aerosols in the submicron (0.25–1.0 μm) and supermicron ranges (> 2.5 μm). Hence, we measured size-dependent filtration efficiency of air purifiers integrated with 2 types of widely used filter media respectively: fine filters (F6 class) and high-efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA, H12 class) (Fig. 1). On average, an air purifier with F6 class filter media removed 54% of aerosols that may carry airborne SARS-CoV-2, while the one with H12 class filter media removed 83% of such aerosols. Therefore, for dental treatments generating a large amount of aerosols, air purifiers with HEPA may be more effective and protective for DHCWs than air purifiers with fine filters. Also, air purifiers with F6 class filter media may still have some efficacy. Notably, the measured filtration efficiency was obtained by measuring aerosol concentration before and after air flow through the filter media on first use. For actual air purifier use, the air is recirculated through the filter media, resulting in a higher efficiency of aerosol removal in enclosed spaces, including dental clinics and units.

Size-dependent filtration efficiency of fine filters (F6) and HEPA filters (H12).

Further studies may be needed to provide more direct evidence for the protective effectiveness of air purifiers in dental clinics and units. However, considering the urgent need for emergency dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly advisable to use air purifiers as an easy-to-use, portable, inexpensive, and high-efficiency precaution measure, especially in situations where air purifiers are already available.
