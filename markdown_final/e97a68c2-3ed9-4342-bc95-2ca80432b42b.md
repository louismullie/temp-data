## Question

What are the most effective pharmacological treatments for managing pain in concurrent OA and FM?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective pharmacological treatments for managing pain in concurrent osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the dual pain mechanisms and how they shape treatment selection. Then, I should review agents with evidence across both conditions and establish a hierarchy of pharmacologic choices. Next, I will integrate mandatory nonpharmacologic care, address comorbidities and monitoring, flag ineffective or harmful strategies, and finally tailor the regimen to clinical phenotype while self-checking key claims against guidelines and trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic complexity, because missing central sensitization will derail OA-centric approaches. OA pain is largely peripheral and nociceptive, whereas fibromyalgia pain reflects central sensitization and impaired descending inhibition; conflating these leads to overreliance on peripherally acting drugs that won't address the FM amplifier, and can even inflate disease activity assessments and complicate management decisions in coexisting rheumatic disease, so I need to keep both mechanisms in view [^111FmLVG] [^11574hNo] [^113Qi3Bb]. I should also note that FM features predict poorer post-arthroplasty analgesic outcomes, which underscores why treating the central component matters, not just the joint pathology [^1178GMx6].

> Next, I will examine pharmacologic options with dual relevance, and I need to verify which agents have credible guideline support across both conditions. SNRIs, particularly duloxetine, are compelling because they enhance descending inhibitory pathways for FM and have analgesic benefit in OA; recent AAFP guidance positions duloxetine after topical and oral NSAIDs for knee and hand OA, and Canadian FM guidance endorses SNRIs as class options, with randomized data supporting duloxetine's direct analgesic effect beyond mood improvement in FM, which is clinically helpful when comorbid depression is present [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^111C1oe9] [^111EAgPU]. Milnacipran is also FDA-approved for FM and supported by guideline evidence, though OA-specific endorsement is less consistent, so I should reserve it mainly for FM-dominant phenotypes when duloxetine is not suitable [^112SiaVz] [^111C1oe9].

> Hold on, I should verify alpha-2-delta ligands next, since central sensitization is a key therapeutic target. Pregabalin has the strongest FM-specific evidence with guideline support for moderate pain relief, and importantly, pooled analyses suggest efficacy at 450 mg/day in FM irrespective of comorbid OA, which reassures me that it can be layered onto an OA-focused plan without losing effect; gabapentin can be considered, but pregabalin's evidence base is more robust in FM [^117UvspK] [^1168UWfU] [^11574hNo]. I need to remember to titrate carefully and monitor for dizziness, edema, and weight gain, especially in multimorbidity clusters common in OA [^116EkB7i].

> I will now review peripherally directed analgesia, and I should double-check that topical NSAIDs remain first-line for OA joints due to efficacy and safety. AAFP recommends topical NSAIDs before oral NSAIDs for knee and hand OA, with similar effectiveness but fewer adverse effects, which is especially attractive in FM where systemic NSAIDs have limited direct benefit on central pain and higher risk profiles; using topical diclofenac to quiet OA joint nociception while addressing FM centrally is a rational division of labor [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^113oD5zg]. This approach minimizes GI, CV, and renal risks that can compound in multimorbid OA-FM patients [^117UvspK].

> Let me think about a stepwise hierarchy to operationalize this. First-line pharmacotherapy should target both mechanisms simultaneously; duloxetine at 60 mg daily, often after a one-week lead-in at 30 mg for tolerability, addresses FM's central amplification and has supportive evidence in OA; if duloxetine is contraindicated or not tolerated, pregabalin 300–450 mg daily is a reasonable alternative to prioritize the central FM driver while continuing local OA care, with dosing guided by efficacy-tolerability balance and the pooled data showing utility irrespective of comorbid OA [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^116EkB7i] [^1168UWfU]. I should confirm and monitor for duloxetine adverse effects and interactions, particularly in hepatic disease, and reassess pain, function, and mood early to ensure the central mechanism is being engaged [^117UvspK] [^111EAgPU].

> Next, I should review how to layer targeted OA therapy without overexposing the patient to systemic risks. Adding topical NSAIDs to the most symptomatic joints provides peripheral relief with minimal systemic burden; if response is inadequate and no contraindications exist, a cautious trial of oral NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration is acceptable, but I must acknowledge they will not correct FM central amplification and carry more adverse effects than topical preparations per guideline summaries [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^113oD5zg] [^116EkB7i]. I need to ensure gastroprotection and CV risk stratification if I proceed with oral NSAIDs, and to de-escalate promptly if benefits are marginal [^117UvspK].

> But wait, what if monotherapy only partially helps and the phenotype is mixed with high FM burden and focal OA flares. Combination therapy can be judicious: pairing an SNRI with pregabalin targets complementary central pathways, though evidence is mixed and should be framed as a time-limited therapeutic trial with predefined stopping rules; tramadol may be considered selectively for short-term rescue after other strategies fail, and I almost said "for ankle OA" based on an old mental note, but let me correct that — AAFP summarizes tramadol and other opioids as selective options in OA more generally, not ankle-specific, and FM guidance reserves weak opioids like tramadol only for moderate to severe pain unresponsive to other modalities, while broader opioid stewardship guidelines urge prioritizing nonopioid strategies and show no superior outcomes in FM on chronic opioids [^117UvspK] [^11261TiD] [^1126Yzqj] [^114iMZYe] [^117WEBVF]. I should confirm drug–drug interactions with tramadol, especially with SNRIs, and set tight boundaries if it is used at all [^11261TiD].

> I need to check adjunctive options for refractory symptoms and keep expectations realistic. Cannabinoid-based medicines can be considered as adjuncts when standard analgesics are inadequate in FM, with modest benefits and the need to monitor psychiatric and cognitive adverse effects; acetaminophen's role has diminished for chronic OA and FM pain, though it can be reserved for patients in whom NSAIDs are truly contraindicated, acknowledging limited efficacy [^114XzM1b] [^117UvspK] [^1156JrRd]. Shared decision-making about these adjuncts is essential given benefit–risk variability and regulatory constraints [^112NPA7J].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications alone; next, I should review mandatory nonpharmacologic therapy, because pharmacotherapy without activation won't meaningfully change outcomes in FM and OA. Exercise training, both aerobic and strengthening, improves pain and function in both conditions; CBT and related psychosocial interventions address catastrophizing, sleep, and mood that perpetuate central sensitization; mindfulness-based approaches such as MBSR, as well as tai chi and yoga, have EULAR support in FM and can be integrated with pacing and self-management education as core elements of care [^112NPA7J] [^113PTUdL] [^116FhGQ6]. I should confirm that weight management and load-modifying strategies are addressed for OA joints to reduce peripheral nociception, thereby synergizing with central pain modulation [^112NPA7J].

> I should double-check comorbidities and monitoring, because unrecognized mood and sleep disorders blunt analgesic response and inflate symptom severity. Screening for and treating depression and anxiety is essential, with duloxetine offering dual benefits and pregabalin potentially improving sleep architecture; baseline labs and risk assessments should include hepatic considerations for duloxetine, renal dosing for pregabalin, and CV/GI/renal risk if contemplating oral NSAIDs, followed by structured reassessment at about 4 and 12 weeks consistent with IMMPACT guidance to judge clinically meaningful improvement and guide de-escalation or augmentation [^111EAgPU]. If any opioid trial is undertaken, I need to ensure predefined discontinuation criteria and close follow-up, recognizing FM patients often report discontinuation due to side effects rather than improved pain [^114iMZYe].

> Let me consider pitfalls to avoid, and I should verify the evidence on intra-articular interventions. Routine reliance on oral NSAIDs as monotherapy in OA-FM is misguided because it neglects the central driver and increases systemic risk; strong opioids have no evidence of superior efficacy in FM and are associated with worse functional outcomes; and repeated intra-articular glucocorticoids can accelerate cartilage loss without meaningful pain improvement in knee OA, so injections should be used sparingly and for well-selected OA indications, not as a fix for widespread FM pain [^113oD5zg] [^1126Yzqj] [^114iMZYe] [^117N6LfJ]. I need to ensure any invasive approach is anchored to an OA pain generator and not deployed for central pain amplification [^112NPA7J].

> Next, I should tailor the plan to the individual phenotype, and I will now examine how OA- versus FM-predominant presentations shift emphasis. For OA-predominant symptoms, maintain duloxetine if tolerated, prioritize topical NSAIDs, and incorporate orthotics and assistive devices to reduce joint load; for FM-predominant symptoms, emphasize pregabalin or an SNRI as the pharmacologic backbone with intensive exercise and CBT, and interpret disease activity scores cautiously because FM inflates patient-reported indices and can mislead escalation if taken at face value [^114h67Sz] [^1177C2Vq] [^113Qi3Bb]. I should confirm that treatment targets are function-centric and that reassessment distinguishes central from peripheral drivers at each visit [^112NPA7J].

> Final synthesis, and let me quickly verify alignment with the cited guidance: the most effective, evidence-based pharmacologic scaffold for concurrent OA and FM is to initiate duloxetine 60 mg daily, titrating from 30 mg if needed, to engage central inhibition and support OA analgesia; add topical diclofenac to painful OA joints for peripheral nociception; escalate with pregabalin 300–450 mg daily if FM pain remains refractory or duloxetine is not tolerated; reserve short courses of oral NSAIDs for discrete OA flares and consider tramadol only under strict, time-limited conditions after other options fail, all while embedding mandatory nonpharmacologic therapy and monitoring comorbidities and safety at defined intervals [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^116EkB7i] [^112NPA7J]. I need to ensure each addition has a clear stop rule, revisit benefit–risk at 4 and 12 weeks, and pivot based on phenotype and patient goals to sustain clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function [^112NPA7J] [^111dA7PD].

The most effective pharmacological treatments for managing pain in concurrent osteoarthritis (OA) and fibromyalgia (FM) are **topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain** [^117UvspK] and **duloxetine or pregabalin for FM-related pain** [^116EkB7i] [^112NPA7J]. Topical NSAIDs are first-line for knee and hand OA due to efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects [^116wZybL] [^114iHfqs], while duloxetine (an SNRI) and pregabalin (an alpha-2-delta ligand) target central sensitization [^11574hNo] and are effective for FM pain [^112SiaVz] [^116EkB7i]. Tramadol may be considered for moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to other treatments [^11261TiD], but **opioids should generally be avoided** [^1126Yzqj] due to limited efficacy [^114iMZYe] and significant risks. Combination therapy is often **necessary** [^117WEBVF], and treatment should be individualized [^112NPA7J] based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^111C1oe9].

## Pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis

OA pain is primarily nociceptive and inflammatory; therefore, **NSAIDs are first-line** for localized joint pain [^113QJjWY]. Topical NSAIDs are preferred for knee and hand OA because they are effective and have minimal systemic adverse effects [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL]. Oral NSAIDs are effective [^117UvspK] but have higher risks of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal adverse effects [^114iHfqs]; therefore, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^116wZybL]. Acetaminophen is **less effective than NSAIDs** [^1156JrRd] but may be considered for mild OA pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^114iHfqs]. Duloxetine, an SNRI, is recommended [^117UvspK] for chronic musculoskeletal pain, including OA [^112SiaVz], especially when central sensitization or comorbid FM is present [^116wZybL].

---

## Pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia

FM pain is primarily due to central sensitization [^111JjKiw]; therefore, **centrally acting agents** are recommended [^112NPA7J]. Pregabalin, an alpha-2-delta ligand, has the strongest evidence for moderate pain relief in FM and is recommended by AAFP guidelines [^116EkB7i]. Duloxetine and milnacipran, both SNRIs, are also effective for FM pain [^117UvspK] and for associated symptoms, such as fatigue and sleep disturbances [^111C1oe9] [^112NPA7J]. Tramadol, a weak opioid with serotonergic and noradrenergic activity, may be considered for moderate-to-severe FM pain unresponsive to other treatments [^11261TiD], but **opioids should generally be avoided** [^1126Yzqj] due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^114iMZYe].

---

## Combination pharmacotherapy

Given the distinct mechanisms of OA and FM pain, **combination therapy** is often necessary [^114xAmCE]. Combining topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain with centrally acting agents such as duloxetine or pregabalin for FM-related pain is a rational approach [^112NPA7J]. This strategy targets both peripheral and central pain mechanisms, potentially providing superior analgesia and improved function [^117WEBVF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **multimodal approach** tailored to patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^112NPA7J]. EULAR guidelines recommend individualized treatment plans that balance benefits and risks and incorporate both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions [^1177C2Vq]. Canadian guidelines similarly recommend individualized, symptom-based treatment strategies, emphasizing patient education and self-management [^114f8gKA].

## Conclusion

The most effective pharmacological treatments for managing pain in concurrent OA and FM include topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain [^117UvspK] and centrally acting agents such as duloxetine and pregabalin for FM-related pain [^116EkB7i]. Combination therapy targeting both peripheral and central pain mechanisms is often **necessary** [^114xAmCE]. Treatment should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^112NPA7J], with careful consideration of safety and tolerability [^1126Yzqj].

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^112SiaVz]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic pain, defined as pain present for at least three months, is highly prevalent, affecting one in five U.S. adults, and can be debilitating. Treatment involves a comprehensive, patient-centered biopsychosocial approach that identifies pain type, focuses on improving function and quality of life, sets reasonable expectations around pain control, promotes self-management strategies, and addresses mental health comorbidities. It includes both pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy options.

For osteoarthritis, topical and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide significant pain relief. Limited evidence suggests benefits from serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and gabapentinoids. For chronic low back pain, no pharmacotherapy offers significant pain or functional benefit; evidence is limited to short-term outcomes. Oral and topical NSAIDs and SNRIs appear to improve pain slightly in the short term.

For neuropathic pain, duloxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and high-concentration (8%) topical capsaicin provide moderate pain benefits. For fibromyalgia, pregabalin has the best evidence of providing moderate pain benefits, followed by the SNRIs duloxetine and milnacipran. Opioids should be considered only after other strategies have been tried and following a risk-benefit assessment.

### Does association of opioid use with pain and function differ by fibromyalgia or widespread pain status [^114iMZYe]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Many consider chronic opioid therapy (COT) to be ineffective for fibromyalgia, but empirical evidence is limited. Among patients identified as initiating COT, we examined whether fibromyalgia was associated with different relationships of opioid use to pain and activity interference outcomes 12 months later. We obtained electronic data on diagnoses and opioid prescriptions, as well as patient self-report data, including pain and activity interference measures, at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.

Among 1218 patients, 429 (35%) met our definition of fibromyalgia. Patients with and without fibromyalgia who had intermittent/lower-dose or regular/higher-dose opioid use at 12 months had similar 12-month pain intensity scores. However, among patients with minimal/no opioid use at 12 months, 12-month pain intensity was greater for those with fibromyalgia (adjusted mean = 5.15 [95% confidence interval, 4.80–5.51]; 0–10 scale) than for those without (4.44 [4.15–4.72]). Similar patterns were observed for 12-month activity interference.

- **Discontinuation of opioids**: Among patients who discontinued opioids by 12 months, those with fibromyalgia were more likely to report bothersome side effects and less likely to report pain improvement as important reasons for discontinuation (P < 0.05). In sum, at 12 months, among patients who had discontinued opioids or used them minimally, those with fibromyalgia had worse outcomes and were less likely to have discontinued because of pain improvement. Among patients continuing COT, pain and activity interference outcomes were worse than those of patients with minimal/no opioid use.

### Canadian pain society and Canadian rheumatology association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^114f8gKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options, recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow-up were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Following review, these recommendations were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting with a spectrum of severity, characterized by pivotal symptoms such as body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not one of exclusion, and does not require specialist confirmation. While there are no confirmatory laboratory tests, some investigations may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is delivered in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation.

The treatment objective should not only be the reduction of symptoms but also the improvement of function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies, including good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control, are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. The outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern.

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^111dA7PD]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

If the research question demands a broad clinical sample of patients, we propose the following pain-related domains for consideration. As major eligibility criteria, these would be more inclusive than what is usually found in efficacy trials. Indeed, pragmatic trials are opportunities to conduct research for people from diverse or disadvantaged communities and with co-occurring medical or mental health conditions. Recruiting a representative sample may, in many cases, mean specifically targeting members of certain populations and reducing barriers to trial participation, for example, through early patient partner involvement.

Rather than offering generic advice on desirable eligibility criteria, we encourage researchers to consider what is warranted depending on their individual research objectives. Apart from necessary diagnostic criteria, we recommend:

- **Consider pain intensity**: Include pain of any intensity, not just ≥ 4/10, balancing clinical relevance with risk for flooring effects and the ability to detect meaningful changes. Chronic daily mild pain can be burdensome, and few clinical trials have examined treatments for this common clinical condition. Indeed, acetaminophen/paracetamol, NSAIDs, and their combination are widely available as over-the-counter medications, but little is known about their efficacy and effectiveness when used to self-treat mild pain. In addition, enrolling patients with mild pain intensity but impaired function or mood may provide adequate assay sensitivity if pain intensity is not the primary outcome, but an adverse consequence of such pain.

Patients and methods

- **Study design**: University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The reporting of this prospective, observational cohort study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement. Between July 27, 2010, and May 31, 2013, adult patients (≥ 18 years old) who were scheduled for primary, unilateral TKA or THA were prospectively recruited prior to surgery. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing bilateral arthroplasty, were undergoing revision arthroplasty, did not speak English, were unable to provide written informed consent, or were incarcerated. All patients provided written informed consent. Acute postoperative outcomes (anesthesia/acute pain) from a portion of this cohort were published earlier, but the long-term surgical outcomes explored herein have not been presented previously.

- **Phenotyping battery**: Patients completed validated self-report questionnaires prior to surgery, and other relevant data were obtained from surgical and anesthesia medical records. Additional details of the preoperative phenotyping battery have been described previously.

- **Fibromyalgia survey criteria**: The fibromyalgia survey is a validated self-report measure consisting of two scales, with one assessing widespread body pain and the other evaluating comorbid symptoms. First, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) was calculated using the Michigan Body Map to assess the 19 specific body areas described in the measure (score 0–19). The second aspect of the criteria was evaluated using the comorbid symptoms scale.

This review is based on a systematic review of the literature relevant to clinical topics in osteoarthritis (OA) performed for the period from February 22, 2016 to April 1, 2017. A PubMed search using the terms "osteoarthritis" and "treatment or epidemiology" returned over 800 papers, of which 57 are reviewed here, with inclusion primarily based on relevance to clinical OA. Epidemiologic studies during this time focused on the incidence and prevalence of OA, comorbidities, and mortality in relation to OA, particularly obesity and cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple joint involvement.

Papers on therapeutic approaches to OA considered non-pharmacologic options, various topical, oral, and intra-articular therapies, and the cost-effectiveness of some OA treatments. There is an enormous need to identify novel strategies to reduce the impact of this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^117N6LfJ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 10% of individuals aged 60 years and older, and treatment options for pain control are often considered inadequate. Management includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options, many of which offer at least short-term benefits. Intraarticular therapies, including injections of viscosupplements and glucocorticoids, may have limited efficacy. In a randomized clinical trial, intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids every 12 weeks for 2 years was associated with significantly greater loss of cartilage volume compared to placebo, with no significant difference in knee pain. It remains unknown whether the loss of cartilage volume has clinical significance. Pharmacologic treatments have been recommended for properly selected patients; however, they carry risks of adverse effects involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems. The presence of comorbidities may make individuals with knee OA more susceptible to these adverse effects, thus limiting treatment options. A total knee joint replacement often provides longer-term benefits. However, this surgery entails serious risks, and many patients continue to experience pain and disability following surgery. Additionally, many patients are not candidates for major surgery. Therefore, there is an unmet need for effective therapies to mitigate risks and provide effective pain management.

### Multidisciplinary modalities in the treatment of fibromyalgia [^113Ftz2N]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. Individuals with fibromyalgia often have comorbid anxiety, depression, and other pain syndromes. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan, including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms.

### Placebo effects in osteoarthritis: Implications for treatment and drug development [^115k7pDQ]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide, affecting approximately 500 million people, yet there are no effective treatments to halt its progression. Without any structure-modifying agents, management of OA focuses on ameliorating pain and improving function. Treatment approaches typically have modest efficacy, and many patients have contraindications to recommended pharmacological treatments. Drug development for OA is hindered by the gradual and progressive nature of the disease and the targeting of established disease in clinical trials. Additionally, new medications for OA cannot receive regulatory approval without demonstrating improvements in both structure (pathological features of OA) and symptoms (reduced pain and/or improved function).

In clinical trials, people with OA show high 'placebo responses', which hamper the ability to identify new effective treatments. Placebo responses refer to the individual variability in response to placebos given in the context of clinical trials and other settings. Placebo effects refer specifically to short-lasting improvements in symptoms that occur because of physiological changes. To mitigate the effects of the placebo phenomenon, we must first understand what it is, how it manifests, how to identify placebo responders in OA trials, and how these insights can be used to improve clinical trials in OA. Leveraging placebo responses and effects in clinical practice might provide additional avenues to augment symptom management of OA.

### The complexities of fibromyalgia and its comorbidities [^112XrZd8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is defined as chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness accompanied by mood and cognitive dysfunction. Several comorbidities have been reported to be associated with FMS. We reviewed the literature concerning the most noteworthy chronic conditions associated with FMS.

There is mounting evidence displaying the concurrence of fibromyalgia and coexisting medical and psychiatric conditions. Such comorbidities may blur the classical clinical presentations and erroneously lead to misinterpretation of disease activity. The recognition of this fact should be underlined, as misrecognition may lead to excessive therapy and avoidable side effects of medications on the one hand and to better handling of FMS on the other hand, leading to improved clinical outcomes.

A greater proportion of psychiatric and rheumatologic disorders are associated with FMS patients than the general population. Consequently, physicians treating patients with either condition should keep in mind that these patients may have such comorbidities and should be treated accordingly.

### Pharmacotherapy of chronic pain: A synthesis of recommendations from systematic reviews [^112ZFTcy]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent, costly, and disabling conditions in both clinical practice and the workplace, yet it often remains inadequately treated. Moreover, chronic pain commonly co-occurs with depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, adversely affecting the response of these conditions to psychiatric treatments. This article provides an evidence-based approach to the pharmacotherapy of chronic pain.

This narrative review is derived largely from meta-analyses and systematic reviews published since 2005. For a few medications, findings from multiple recent trials are synthesized if a systematic review has not yet been published. Classes of medications are first reviewed, followed by an overview of four common pain disorders: neuropathic pain, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis.

A stepped care approach based on existing evidence includes:

- **Simple analgesics**: Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: For neuropathic, back, or fibromyalgia pain, or tramadol
- **Neuropathic pain medications**: Gabapentin, duloxetine, or pregabalin
- **Fibromyalgia treatments**: Cyclobenzaprine, pregabalin, duloxetine, or milnacipran
- **Topical analgesics**: Capsaicin, lidocaine, or salicylates for localized neuropathic or arthritic pain
- **Opioids**

Disease-specific recommendations for neuropathic, low back, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis pain are reviewed.

A number of medications have proven effective in chronic pain disorders, and their use individually or in combination should improve the management of chronic pain.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: Practical strategies for improving diagnosis and patient outcomes [^11574hNo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recent advances in understanding the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia must be applied in clinical practice to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Evidence indicates fibromyalgia is a hyperalgesic state, resulting from a generalized problem with augmented pain processing due to the way the spinal cord and the brain process pain and other sensory information. The descending pain pathway involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as opposed to the descending opioid pain pathway, appears to be selectively attenuated.

Newer treatment options targeted at the pain mechanisms include the alpha(2)-delta drug pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons, and the serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors, duloxetine and milnacipran. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia.

In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise, and strength and flexibility training are important components of care. An individualized treatment plan should be developed, considering each patient's unique combination of fibromyalgia symptoms, functional level, and the presence of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions common in patients with fibromyalgia. This educational activity provides clinicians with the tools necessary to differentiate fibromyalgia syndrome from other chronic pain conditions through a review.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^116H1JDn]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

A protocol for the overview was published. Amendments to the protocol prior statement are in Supplementary Data S1 and Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online.

We included Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with FMS using an established diagnostic criterion. Reviews of children or mixed populations not reporting outcomes separately were excluded. Any pharmacological therapy and any comparator were eligible. We sought outcomes as close as possible to three months (13 weeks) after treatment; those earlier than one month (four weeks) after beginning treatment were not eligible.

Eligible study designs were RCTs or non-RCTs providing details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, databases searched and search strategies, patient-reported pain or pain relief, and summary results for at least one desired outcome. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2021 issue 12 of Cochrane Library Wiley interface, on 1 January 2022, using no limits on date or language, and checked again on 1 May 2024.

Two reviewers independently selected reviews for inclusion, carried out assessments of methodological quality, extracted data, analysed data if required, assessed how the review authors used the GRADE criteria, and made their own GRADE assessments based on the information provided. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus among all authors; all authors saw all data.

Information was collected on the number of included studies and participants; medicine, dose, and route of administration; and baseline demographic.

### Do comorbid fibromyalgia diagnoses change following a functional restoration program in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders [^113hsD3m]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

A retrospective study of prospectively collected data was conducted to determine whether comorbid fibromyalgia, identified in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders (CDOMDs), resolves with a functional restoration program (FRP).

Fibromyalgia involves widespread bodily pain and tenderness to palpation. In recent studies, 23% to 41% of patients with CDOMDs entering an FRP had comorbid fibromyalgia, compared with population averages of 2% to 5%. Few studies have examined whether fibromyalgia diagnoses resolve with any treatment, and none have investigated diagnosis responsiveness to an FRP.

A consecutive cohort of patients with CDOMDs (82% with spinal disorders and all reporting chronic spinal pain) and comorbid fibromyalgia (N = 117) completed an FRP, which included quantitatively directed exercise progression and multimodal disability management. Diagnosis responsiveness, evaluated at discharge, created two groups: those who retained fibromyalgia and those who did not. These groups were compared with chronic regional lumbar pain-only patients (LO group, n = 87), lacking widespread pain and fibromyalgia.

Of the patients with comorbid fibromyalgia, 59% (n = 69) retained the fibromyalgia diagnosis (RFM group), and 41% (n = 48) lost the fibromyalgia diagnosis (LFM group) at discharge. Although all three groups reported decreased pain intensity, disability, and depressive symptoms from admission to discharge, RFM patients reported higher symptom levels than the LFM and LO groups at discharge.

### Is osteoarthritis one disease or a collection of many [^1177KYRa]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous syndrome that may be amenable to tailored treatment. There has been an increasing focus within the OA research community on the identification of meaningful OA phenotypes with potential implications for prognosis and treatment. Experimental and clinical data combined with sophisticated statistical approaches have been used to characterize and define phenotypes from the symptomatic and structural perspectives. An improved understanding of the existing phenotypes based on underlying disease mechanisms may shed light on the distinct entities that make up the disease. This narrative review provides an updated summary of the most recent advances in this field as well as limitations from previous approaches that can be addressed in future studies.

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part I: Critical appraisal of existing treatment guidelines and systematic review of current research evidence [^1169VN1W]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

As a prelude to developing updated, evidence-based, international consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Treatment Guidelines Committee undertook a critical appraisal of published guidelines and a systematic review of more recent evidence for relevant therapies.

- **Methods**: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care two, rheumatology 11, orthopaedics one, and evidence-based medicine two), two continents, and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. Three additional experts were invited to take part in the critical appraisal of existing guidelines in languages other than English.

	- The search was conducted systematically across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, AMED, Cochrane Library, seven guidelines websites, and Google, to identify guidelines for the management of hip and/or knee OA. Guidelines meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were assigned to four groups of four appraisers. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) instrument, and standardized percent scores (0–100%) were calculated for scope, stakeholder involvement, rigor, clarity, applicability, editorial independence, and overall quality.

	- Treatment modalities addressed and recommended by the guidelines were summarized. Agreement was estimated as a percentage, and the best level of evidence to support each recommendation was extracted.

### Development of medical therapeutics in osteoarthritis: Time for action to improve patient care [^114gRB91]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Where does this leave us in the management of osteoarthritis (OA)? Stratification tools can be developed to aid in the assessment and management of OA. Enriching patient subgroups by stratification in clinical trials, for example, in post-traumatic, synovitis, and pain sensitization, may yield more useful results for patients who could benefit from personalized strategies. Such interventions may require one or more drug interventions. Furthermore, combining pharmacotherapy with exercise and physical therapy is proven to reduce pain and improve function in knee and hip OA, leading to improved performance, reduced disability, and enhanced quality of life.

Proposing combination interventions is an attractive strategy for OA. This combination therapy model relies on the efficacy of all the components for the outcome. Critically, pharmacological symptom improvement should allow people to gain maximal benefit by enabling physical therapies and improving outcomes. Novel trial design remains challenging in OA and is crucial in testing such complex interventions, as well as in assessing meaningful outcomes and effect size, where changes may only occur over several years. Effective therapies for OA are likely to involve a combination of therapies that modify joint structures and modulate pain symptoms.

### Osteoarthritis: Rapid evidence review [^114iHfqs]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

When considering medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, specifically with respect to pain management, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend initiating full-strength acetaminophen and topical therapy for the management of OA. Following this, NSAIDs can be introduced, and tramadol along with other opioids can be considered selectively. It is important to recognize that while NSAIDs and opioids may help reduce pain and improve function, they also carry significant potential harms.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms include chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Most patients with fibromyalgia experience muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations.

Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using updated clinical criteria that no longer rely on tender point examination. Laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders.

Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Managing chronic pain with nonopioid analgesics: A multidisciplinary consult [^114iPWLF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Determining the pain mechanism is a crucial aspect guiding treatment selection for chronic musculoskeletal pain states. Although broad classifications provide a framework, any combination of mechanisms may be present in a chronic pain patient. Evidence is growing that pain states generally considered nociceptive may also involve elements of augmented central nervous system pain processing.

Nonopioid analgesics, including serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and alpha-2-delta ligand anticonvulsants, are the treatments of choice for fibromyalgia and other central neuropathic pain states. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that certain SNRIs can be effective in treating "classic" nociceptive pain states, such as osteoarthritis, and are also effective for low back pain.

In addition to considering biological mechanisms, chronic pain management involves recognizing and evaluating the contribution of psychological and sociocultural factors that can influence pain chronicity and patient prognosis. A multimodal/multidisciplinary approach, incorporating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy into a program that includes more than one discipline, is important to improve outcomes in patients with chronic pain.

Regarding medical management for fibromyalgia, and more specifically in relation to non-opioid analgesics, the NFGAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering NSAIDs. If prescribed, NSAIDs should be used, particularly for associated conditions such as osteoarthritis, at the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period due to potentially serious adverse events.

### Concomitant fibromyalgia complicating chronic inflammatory arthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117PoAzs]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a complex neurosensory disorder characterized by a history of diffuse and persistent musculoskeletal pain, with numerous discrete tender points elicited on clinical examination. Additional symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and anxiety are associated features of this syndrome. FM is strongly associated with female gender and age and has a prevalence of around 1–5% in the general population.

FM is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion, but patients with inflammatory arthropathies commonly meet the criteria for FM, a phenomenon known as fibromyalgianess. The exact prevalence of this concomitant FM in inflammatory arthropathy is debated. It is also unclear whether FM arises as a complication of the index condition or occurs independently in susceptible individuals. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, the presence of concomitant FM and its impact on the underlying inflammatory condition may be important. Modern rheumatological management is increasingly target-driven, involving the escalation of drug therapy to achieve optimum reduction in disease activity or disease remission. Assessing disease activity in chronic inflammatory arthritis relies, in part, on self-assessment by the patient. Consequently, FM, which causes patients to experience pain independent of the inflammatory processes, may lead to inflated disease activity measures and, therefore, to inappropriate escalation or inappropriate stopping of treatment in the underlying index rheumatic condition.

The primary aim of this systematic review is to report the prev

### Management of fibromyalgia and comorbid psychiatric disorders [^111qRqap]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

According to the American College of Rheumatology, fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain lasting at least 3 months, combined with pain at 11 or more of 18 specific tender point sites on the body. Many individuals with fibromyalgia also experience comorbid psychiatric disorders, which can present diagnostic challenges and necessitate additional treatment considerations for optimal patient outcomes. Fibromyalgia is strongly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, a personal or family history of depression, and the use of antidepressants.

Psychiatric comorbidities negatively impact the severity and course of fibromyalgia. Pharmacotherapy can manage fibromyalgia and comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Nonpharmacologic therapies include cognitive-behavioral therapy and aerobic exercise. This article examines the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments and discusses the diagnostic difficulties presented by comorbid disorders.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^114vy7eq]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges and gaps in care

Data from a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies identified multiple barriers to offering optimal osteoarthritis (OA) care, such as guideline recommendations for OA. The studies highlighted only barriers, with no enablers, addressing system-related, disease-related, and patient-related obstacles. Four distinct themes emerged:

- **OA is not that serious**: This perception undermines the urgency and seriousness of care.
- **Clinicians perceive they are under-prepared**: A lack of confidence and preparedness among healthcare professionals contributes to care challenges.
- **Personal beliefs (e.g. negativity about OA)**: Some individuals hold negative beliefs about OA that hinder care acceptance.
- **Dissonance in patient expectations**: There exists a gap between patient expectations and the care they receive.

These findings elucidate some of the challenges in providing the comprehensive range of treatment options recommended and will be further described in the following sections.

### Concomitant fibromyalgia complicating chronic inflammatory arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Qi3Bb]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis describe the prevalence of concomitant fibromyalgia (FM) in adults with inflammatory arthritis and quantify the impact of FM on disease activity scores (DAS). Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using key terms and predefined exclusion criteria. As appropriate, proportional and pairwise meta-analysis methods were used to pool results.

Forty articles were identified. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of FM ranged from 4.9% to 52.4% (21% pooled). In axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the range was 4.11% to 25.2% (13% pooled in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) only). In psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the range was 9.6% to 27.2% (18% pooled). The presence of concomitant FM was related to higher DAS in patients with RA and AS (DAS28 mean difference 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.37 in RA; BASDAI mean difference 2.22, 95% CI: 1.86, 2.58 in AS). Concomitant FM was also associated with higher DAS in existing PsA studies. Self-reported, rather than objective, components of DAS appear to be raised in the presence of FM, such as tender joint count and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores.

Fibromyalgia is common in RA, axSpA, and PsA. Comorbid FM appears to amplify DAS and could therefore influence the management of these rheumatic conditions.

### Narrative review: The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia is a common yet poorly understood syndrome characterized by diffuse chronic pain accompanied by other somatic symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness, in the absence of disease. Fibromyalgia does not have a distinct cause or pathology. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the study of chronic pain has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders. Accruing evidence shows that patients with fibromyalgia experience pain differently from the general population because of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system.

Aberrant pain processing, which can result in chronic pain and associated symptoms, may be the result of several interplaying mechanisms, including central sensitization, blunting of inhibitory pain pathways, alterations in neurotransmitters, and psychiatric comorbid conditions. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms currently thought to be partly responsible for the chronic diffuse pain typical of fibromyalgia.

### Management of psychiatric comorbidity in fibromyalgia [^1147tUny]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain condition of unknown etiology that predominantly affects women. Lifetime mood and anxiety disorders are common in patients with fibromyalgia and affect the course and severity of fibromyalgia. Recent fibromyalgia clinical trials have included clinical assessments to identify comorbid psychiatric disorders and determine the impact of comorbidity on treatment response.

Options for the treatment of fibromyalgia patients with comorbid major depressive disorder or anxiety disorders include antidepressants with dual effects on serotonin and norepinephrine (e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine), which reduce pain in patients with fibromyalgia and have antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Other possible treatments for anxiety or sleep disturbances associated with fibromyalgia include the alpha-2-delta ligands (e.g. pregabalin, gabapentin), which reduce pain in fibromyalgia patients, have anxiolytic effects, and enhance slow-wave sleep.

Antidepressants or alpha-2-delta ligands should be combined with established mood stabilizers in patients with comorbid fibromyalgia and bipolar disorder. There is also evidence to support exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of fibromyalgia and mood or anxiety disorders. Many patients would likely benefit from combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults [^117WEBVF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic widespread pain condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Pharmacotherapies are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. Combining different agents could provide superior pain relief and possibly also fewer side effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of combination pharmacotherapy compared to monotherapy or placebo, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to September 2017. We also searched reference lists of other reviews and trials registries.

- **Selection criteria**: Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing combinations of two or more drugs to placebo or other comparators, or both, for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain.

- **Data collection and analysis**: From all studies, we extracted data on participant-reported pain relief of 30% or 50% or greater, patient global impression of clinical change (PGIC) much or very much improved, any other pain-related outcome of improvement; withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events; participants experiencing any adverse event; serious adverse events, and specific adverse events (e.g. somnolence and dizziness). The primary comparison was between combination and one or all single-agent comparators. We also assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

- **Main results**: We identified 16 studies with 1,474 participants. Three studies combined a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a benzodiazepine (306 participants were involved in this subgroup).

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^115bVBZ3]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The Bone and Joint Decade (2000–10) initiated the first international drive to prioritize osteoarthritis (OA) and joint pain in older adults, highlighting its impact on the Western world. The diagnostic label of OA is ranked 11th in terms of its impact on years lived with disability, whereas joint pain in individuals aged 45 years and over is ranked as the number one cause of years with disability worldwide. According to health leaders and epidemiologists, population trends are clear for the next 30 years: with the aging population, increased obesity, and physical inactivity, joint pain and OA are set to rise.

Joint pain and OA are predominantly managed in primary care. While national and international guidelines exist for the care and management of OA in adults, such as those from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), EULAR, Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and ACR, there remains a gap between knowledge and practice. This paper describes the challenges and gaps in OA care, particularly in relation to population health management, interventions, and outcomes. It is set against a backdrop of competing health priorities, multimorbidity, access to high-quality care, resource limitations, and models of care. The overuse of some therapies and neglect of others are discussed, alongside the potential for self-management. Many of the challenges derive from experiences within the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. The role of the healthcare team will be highlighted in enhancing best care for OA and providing solutions for closing the evidence-practice gap.

- **Definition**: FM is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disruption.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of FM is unknown; however, central sensitization involving genetic, immunological, and hormonal factors has been implicated.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of FM include:
	- **Pain characteristics**: Chronic widespread pain (diffuse, multifocal, deep, gnawing, burning, waxing and waning, migratory)
	- **Musculoskeletal and systemic effects**: Tender joints, fatigue, morning stiffness
	- **Neurological and psychological issues**: Cognitive disturbance, depression, anxiety, headaches, restless legs
	- **Gastrointestinal and bladder symptoms**: Irritable bowel disease, irritable bladder syndrome
	- **Sleep and sensory disturbances**: Sleep disturbances, heat and cold intolerance
	- **Miscellaneous symptoms**: Weight fluctuations, Raynaud's phenomenon

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: FM is not associated with increased mortality.

### Comparative pain and mood effects in patients with comorbid fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder: Secondary analyses of four pooled randomized controlled trials of duloxetine [^111EAgPU]. Pain (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this paper is to better understand the relationship between pain and mood in patients with fibromyalgia and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). Pooled data from four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of duloxetine hydrochloride (60–120 mg/day) in patients with fibromyalgia were included (N = 1332). Of these, 350 patients (26% [147 placebo, 203 duloxetine]) had comorbid MDD (per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision criteria) and were included in these analyses. Primary measures included the Brief Pain Inventory for average pain and either the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the consistency of treatment effects across various subgroups. Path analysis was used to assess the effect of duloxetine on improvement in pain in the presence of improvement in mood, and vice versa. Results indicated that 69% of improvement in pain was a direct effect of treatment, with improvement in mood accounting for 31% of the pain response. In conclusion, consistent with our hypothesis, duloxetine produced a substantial direct effect on pain improvement, and change in mood exerted a modest indirect effect on pain improvements in patients with fibromyalgia and MDD. Hence, both direct and indirect analgesic and antidepressant properties appear to be relevant for the treatment of these comorbid patients with duloxetine.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^1163z2HD]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

In primary care, adults aged 45 years and over consulting with joint pain and limitations in everyday activity are more likely to receive NICE recommendations if a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) has been recorded in the medical electronic record. A delay in diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and suboptimal care. The overuse of imaging has prompted NICE to highlight the recommendation for diagnosing OA on clinical grounds and set a quality standard to audit this approach.

Diagnosis and subsequent treatment are often focused on a single, most painful joint rather than addressing multisite joint problems. Yet, multisite joint pain is the most common presentation in consultations in primary care, and having more joint sites affected leads to more healthcare consultations regardless of specialty or site. As summarized in a recent systematic review, there is a paucity of evidence to guide practitioners regarding the treatment of multisite joint pain, with few studies describing interventions that consider OA in all affected joints. Comorbidities also often go under-recognized in primary care and the community, further hampering the holistic assessment recommended by NICE.

Reports have highlighted the impact of language when giving the diagnosis of OA. Healthcare professionals' views can be perceived to be negative, for example, 'nothing can be done' and 'it is your age'. Unhelpful descriptions and terminology can easily transfer from the X-ray report into the consultation, with people with OA concerned about their 'degenerative meniscal tear'.

### Evaluating and diagnosing fibromyalgia and comorbid psychiatric disorders [^111KvmJp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling chronic pain syndrome often accompanied by other chronic pain and/or psychiatric comorbidities, which impact the course and outcome of fibromyalgia. Although a primary care provider will likely take the lead in caring for patients with fibromyalgia, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may play a role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the condition. Psychiatrists' familiarity with many of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments currently used for fibromyalgia makes them valuable partners in the multidisciplinary team of clinicians addressing fibromyalgia and its comorbidities. In this activity, experts on fibromyalgia discuss the nature of the syndrome and its diagnosis and evaluation.

Regarding non-pharmacologic interventions for chronic arthritic pain, specifically concerning psychosocial interventions, the EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend considering basic social and psychological management support. This can include referral to a psychologist, social worker, self-management support program, CBT, or multidisciplinary treatment, particularly for patients with social variables or psychological factors that interfere with effective pain management and functional status. It is important to discuss treatment options with the patient and their primary care physician, especially if depression and anxiety are present.

### Towards a mechanism-based approach to pain management in osteoarthritis [^1158ZPu1]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pain is the defining symptom of osteoarthritis (OA). However, the available treatment options, including NSAIDs as the most common, provide inadequate pain relief and pose serious health risks when used long-term. Chronic pain pathways are subject to complex levels of control and modulation, both in the periphery and the central nervous system. Ongoing clinical and basic research is uncovering how these pathways operate in OA.

Clinical investigation into the types of pain associated with progressive OA considers the presence of central sensitization, correlation with structural changes in the joint, and the efficacy of novel analgesics and affords new insights into the pathophysiology of OA pain. Moreover, studies in disease-specific animal models enable the unravelling of the cellular and molecular pathways involved. We expect that increased understanding of the mechanisms by which chronic OA-associated pain is generated and maintained will offer opportunities for targeting and improving the safety of analgesia. In addition, using clinical and genetic approaches, it might become possible to identify subsets of patients with pain of different pathophysiology, thus enabling a tailored approach to pain management.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain: Nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatments [^111QmnFw]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic low back pain, neck pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia are the most common types of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Because no individual therapy has consistent benefit, a multimodal treatment approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain is recommended. Many nonpharmacologic, noninvasive treatment approaches yield small to moderate improvement and can be used with pharmacologic or more invasive modalities. Systematic reviews and guidelines support the effectiveness of various forms of exercise in improving pain and function in patients with chronic pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness techniques appear to be effective for small to moderate short- and long-term improvement of chronic low back pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be effective for small short- and intermediate-term improvement of fibromyalgia.

Spinal manipulation leads to a small benefit for chronic neck and low back pain. Acupuncture has a small to moderate benefit for low back pain and small benefit for nonpain fibromyalgia symptoms. Massage or myofascial release yields a small improvement in low back pain, hip and knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Low reactive level laser therapy may provide short-term relief of chronic neck and low back pain, and ultrasound may provide short-term pain relief for knee osteoarthritis. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation may be effective for short- and at least intermediate-term improvement in pain and function for chronic low back pain and fibromyalgia. Patients should be encouraged to engage in a variety of therapies aligned with their needs and preferences.

### Pregabalin improves pain scores in patients with fibromyalgia irrespective of comorbid osteoarthritis [^1168UWfU]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain disorder, and patients frequently suffer from comorbid conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA). Data on how FM patients with comorbid OA respond to recommended therapies, such as pregabalin, could aid their treatment.

- **Design**: This was a pooled exploratory analysis of three randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of pregabalin in FM patients to assess the impact of comorbid OA on the response to pregabalin.

- **Methods**: Patients were divided into those with and without comorbid OA. The difference in change in least squares (LS) mean pain score at the endpoint (assessed by a 0–10 numeric rating scale, controlled for baseline pain score) with pregabalin (300 mg/day and 450 mg/day) versus placebo was assessed. Changes in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) responders and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score were also assessed.

- **Results**: There were 1,665 patients in the analysis set (558 placebo; 552 pregabalin 300 mg/day; 555 pregabalin 450 mg/day), including 296 with comorbid OA. Pregabalin 450 mg/day significantly improved the LS mean (95% confidence interval) difference in the pain score versus placebo in patients with (0.99 [0.44, 1.55], P < 0.001) and without (0.64 [0.39, 0.89], P < 0.001) OA. Improvements with pregabalin 300 mg/day for patients with (0.31 [-0.25, 0.86], P = 0.276) and without (0.51 [0.25, 0.76], P < 0.001) OA were not consistently significant. Improvements in PGIC and FIQ total score were observed in patients with and without comorbid OA.

- **Conclusions**: FM patients with or without comorbid OA respond to treatment with pregabalin.

### Osteoarthritis year 2010 in review: Non-pharmacologic therapy [^115mruMR]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to highlight seminal publications from the past year on the non-pharmacologic management of osteoarthritis (OA). A systematic search was conducted in the PUBMED and Cochrane databases from September 2009 to September 2010. This search aimed to identify studies examining the safety or efficacy of non-pharmacologic therapies for managing OA, specifically those considered in the 2008 OARSI OA guidelines. Identified articles were reviewed for quality, with the highest-quality studies — those deemed to have the greatest potential impact on managing OA — being summarized.

The search identified 117 unique articles, from which four studies were chosen for highlighting:

- **Traditional Chinese acupuncture (TCA)**: A nested two-stage trial found TCA was not superior to sham acupuncture. However, the providers' style did affect both pain reduction and satisfaction with treatment, suggesting that the analgesic benefits of acupuncture might be partly mediated by the acupuncturists' behavior.

- **Electrostimulation**: A systematic review found little evidence of a significant effect of electrostimulation versus sham or no intervention on pain in knee OA.

- **Tai Chi**: A single-blinded trial comparing Tai Chi versus attention controls found that 12 weeks of Tai Chi was associated with improvements in symptoms and disability in patients with knee OA.

- **Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and rehabilitation**: A randomized trial compared early ACL reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation with structured rehabilitation alone in subjects with acute anterior cruciate ligament tears. Results showed that at 24 months following randomization, all study participants had improved.

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^116ahm4o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia presents heterogeneously, necessitating individualized treatment approaches based on the severity of pain, presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and degree of functional impairment. Management includes identifying and treating all pain sources in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g. comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g. comorbid irritable bowel syndrome). It is crucial to address other symptoms or disorders frequently occurring in fibromyalgia patients, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. The ultimate goal is to improve the patient's function and overall health status.

In most cases, managing fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized controlled trials for these approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice [^111P7sF8]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising because of the ageing population and the epidemic of obesity. Pain and loss of function are the main clinical features that lead to treatment, including non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Clinicians recognise that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is established late in the disease process, maybe too late to expect much help from disease-modifying drugs. Despite efforts over the past decades to develop markers of disease, imaging procedures and biochemical marker analyses still need to be improved and possibly extended with more specific and sensitive methods to reliably describe disease processes, diagnose the disease at an early stage, classify patients according to their prognosis, and follow the course of disease and treatment effectiveness. In the coming years, a better definition of osteoarthritis is expected by delineating different phenotypes of the disease. Treatment targeted more specifically at these phenotypes might lead to improved outcomes.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^1156JrRd]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Since 2002, we have known the benefits of exercise as analgesia for osteoarthritis (OA) pain, but despite the substantial evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of exercise, research funders still invest in underpowered studies comparing exercise vs. no exercise. More attention is needed on adherence to exercise, which is a major obstacle in exercise programs. Currently, the OA Trial Bank is supporting work to determine which subgroups may respond better to exercise. As of 2002, sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with OA, and further trials were deemed unlikely to overturn this result. However, the review highlighted that studies continued to be funded and published after this date. Furthermore, additional studies continue to be underpowered; in a Cochrane review, 35% of eligible studies recruited fewer than 25 participants in one or both allocation groups.

- **Topical NSAIDs and paracetamol**: Topical NSAIDs have retained their role as the first-line analgesia for peripheral joint OA, and electronic templates in general practice are known to enhance their uptake. The role of paracetamol as first-line analgesia has diminished following the evidence of poorer efficacy and increased side effects. Despite the concerns over paracetamol, clinicians are unaware of the benefits of other therapies. Stopping ineffective therapies presents an implementation challenge. Clinicians continue with paracetamol when an alternative pharmacological or non-pharmacological approach, such as topical NSAIDs, might be more effective.

### Non-inflammatory pain in inflammatory arthritis [^113rKMW5]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Joharatnam et al. (2015) concluded that a high prevalence of fibromyalgia features, poorer mental health, and higher patient-reported DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28) scores are linked in patients living with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The team noted high sensitivity at non-joint points, such as the anterior tibia and sternum, indicating that central mechanisms could contribute to pain sensitivity in RA even when inflammation might be under control.

A systematic review based on 19 studies concluded that fibromyalgia was significantly associated with higher disease activity scores, with all but one study reporting higher DAS28 in participants with comorbid fibromyalgia. In 16 of these studies, a statistically significant increase in the DAS in RA patients with comorbid fibromyalgia was noted compared to those without, but not with clinical (swollen joint count) or laboratory (ESR, CRP) markers of disease activity. This review concluded that fibromyalgia could lead to inflated disease activity measures, resulting in inappropriate escalation or cessation of treatment in the underlying index rheumatic condition.

This review highlights the limitations of using disease activity indices alone in assessing inflammatory activity in rheumatic patients with concomitant fibromyalgia. It is, therefore, important that these scores are interpreted in conjunction with knowledge of the presence of concomitant fibromyalgia to ensure optimal management and appropriate drug treatment. Indeed, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) definition of difficult-to-treat RA suggested that concomitant non-inflammatory disease should be considered.

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: A review - treatment and prognosis [^115WT1oh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The primary goal in the treatment of juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS) is to enhance quality of life through pain relief and improved function. A multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioral and exercise-based modalities, is currently the standard of care for JPFS. Treatment should begin with non-pharmacologic modalities, most importantly exercise. Other non-pharmacologic modalities include movement and meditative treatments, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Reassurance is very important, including acknowledging that the patient's pain is real, and emphasizing that it is not dangerous. Caregivers should communicate that although the pain may last for an unknown period and no immediate cure exists, there are therapeutic options that may reduce the pain over time. Setting goals of leading a full life, stressing the importance of lifestyle factors, and treating emotional symptoms are critical.

Multidisciplinary programs may be implemented in a hospital or outpatient setting. In a study comparing an intensive day-hospital rehabilitation program of physical, occupational, and psychological therapies to outpatient treatment for children with significant pain-related disability, those enrolled in the day-hospital rehabilitation had significantly larger improvements in functional disability, pain-related fear, and readiness to change. Intensive, multidisciplinary outpatient programs have also reported improved pain, function, and quality of life in children with JPFS.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Fibromyalgia: an overview [^111zqZx5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, the authors review concepts in fibromyalgia. Findings regarding diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidities, and potential pathophysiological links are discussed. Although fibromyalgia continues to be a complex disorder, there are specific criteria one must meet. Fibromyalgia questionnaires, along with commonalities of age, gender, menopause status, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms, may aid in the diagnosis. Additionally, the close relationship between fibromyalgia and other chronic disorders should alert the physician to explore for comorbid illnesses. The relationship between fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, migraine headaches, and obesity are addressed. The roles of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, potential effects of neurotransmitters, and gender-specific hormones all substantiate this diagnosis and provide clues to causality, as well as venues for future treatment.

### Classification of patients with osteoarthritis through clusters of comorbidities using 633 330 individuals from Spain [^111mTecG]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic condition affecting about 250 million people worldwide. The progressive degenerative nature of the disease causes functional impairment, often severe pain, and loss of quality of life. Given its chronic nature, OA often coexists alongside other chronic conditions, that is, comorbidities. A systematic review has shown that patients with OA are more likely to have multiple conditions compared with patients without OA, and further studies have shown that this increased likelihood exists both in the years preceding a diagnosis of OA and in the years after.

The co-existence of two or more chronic conditions or comorbidities is termed multimorbidity, and is estimated to affect between 19% and 27% of the UK general population. Studies have shown that increasing multimorbidity is associated with lower socioeconomic status and increasing age, and that it can drive higher healthcare utilization, including primary care usage, prescription costs, and hospitalization. There is a growing realization of the need to better understand multimorbidity, both in clinical practice and in the development of clinical guidelines.

- **Multimorbidity clusters**: Within the context of multimorbidity, there is an increasing recognition of the concept of comorbidities existing in groups or 'clusters'. Examining the exact conditions that co-exist within an individual, rather than simply the number of comorbidities, would allow us to understand whether a patient's chronic comorbid conditions are 'concordant' (may be treated with a unified approach) or 'discordant' (may worsen or compete with treatments).

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part II: OARSI evidence-based, expert consensus guidelines [^113QJjWY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

To develop concise, patient-focused, up-to-date, evidence-based expert consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA). These guidelines are adaptable and designed to assist physicians and allied healthcare professionals in both general and specialist practice worldwide.

Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines — primary care, rheumatology, orthopedics, and evidence-based medicine — across two continents and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. A systematic review of existing guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA published between 1945 and January 2006 was undertaken using the validated appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) instrument.

A core set of management modalities was generated based on the agreement between guidelines. Evidence before 2002 was based on a systematic review conducted by the European League Against Rheumatism, while evidence after 2002 was updated using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and HTA reports. The quality of evidence was evaluated, and where possible, the effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk or odds ratio, and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained were estimated. Consensus recommendations were produced following a Delphi exercise, and the strength of recommendation (SOR) for propositions relating to each modality was determined using a visual analogue scale.

Twenty-three treatment guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA were identified from the literature.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for management of chronic pain: from bench to bedside [^114xAmCE]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pain, a frequently neglected problem, is treated with different classes of drugs. These agents are limited by incomplete efficacy and dose-limiting side effects. Knowledge of pain processing implicates multiple mechanisms of nociceptive transmission and modulation. Thus, synergistic interactions of drug combinations might provide superior analgesia and fewer side effects than monotherapy by targeting multiple mechanisms. Several trials in neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, arthritis, and other disorders have assessed various two-drug combinations containing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, opioids, and other agents.

In some trials, combined treatment showed superiority over monotherapy, but in others, improved benefit or tolerability was not observed. Escalating efforts to develop novel analgesics that surpass the efficacy of current treatments have not yet been successful; therefore, combination therapy remains an important beneficial strategy. Methodological improvements in future translational research efforts are needed to maximize the potential of combination pharmacotherapy for pain.
