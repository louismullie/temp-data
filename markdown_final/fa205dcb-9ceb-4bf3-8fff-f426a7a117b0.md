## Question

Is Staphylococcus lugdunensis pathogenic and a cause of abscesses?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Staphylococcus lugdunensis is pathogenic and a cause of abscesses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how S. lugdunensis behaves compared with other coagulase-negative staphylococci. Then, I should verify epidemiologic data demonstrating clinically significant infections, especially skin and soft-tissue abscesses. Next, I will review mechanistic virulence evidence that would plausibly support abscess formation. After that, I should examine specific clinical syndromes where abscesses are prominent. Finally, I will consider practical clinical implications for diagnosis and management when this organism is isolated, including when to drain and when to treat with antibiotics [^113VmSBg] [^1137ds1y].

> Let me consider the baseline microbiology first. S. lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS), and my first instinct might be to downplay it as a contaminant — wait, let me verify whether that applies here, because S. lugdunensis has long been described as behaving more like S. aureus than like other CoNS and is often called a "wolf in sheep's clothing", which would contradict that initial assumption; yes, that initial blanket assumption would be a mistake, and I should correct it and treat S. lugdunensis as a potential pathogen when recovered from appropriate clinical contexts [^1137ds1y] [^115bBKum] [^111t55Jv] [^113VmSBg].

> Next, I should review population-level data to see if it truly causes disease rather than contaminating cultures. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude and phenotype of infections in the community: a population-based Danish study found 491 S. lugdunensis infections over four years with an incidence of 53 per 100,000 per year, and importantly, among general practice presentations, skin abscesses were the single most common entity at 36% — that pattern is hard to reconcile with mere contamination and strongly supports pathogenicity in skin and soft tissue infections [^111Qfjet]. I also need to check site predilections and abscess burdens; a clinical series using a screening protocol reported that 13 of 14 clinically significant cases were soft-tissue abscesses, with a predominance in the pelvic girdle region, which again underscores a real abscess phenotype rather than incidental carriage [^114DaeuJ]. But wait, what about other anatomic abscesses — right, a hospital-based cohort noted that among the relatively fewer infections above the waist, breast abscesses were frequent, further expanding the abscess spectrum attributed to S. lugdunensis [^1121eq3C].

> I will now examine whether specific dermatologic conditions characterized by nodules and abscesses implicate S. lugdunensis as a dominant organism. Hmm, wait a minute, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) offers a useful stress test of the concept: prospective studies culturing HS nodules and abscesses frequently recovered S. lugdunensis as a unique or predominant pathogen in a large fraction of cases, supporting a role in initiating or sustaining purulent collections in HS lesions, although some authors caution that HS is a predisposing condition rather than purely infectious — still, repeated recovery as the predominant organism argues for pathogenic involvement in abscess biology in that setting [^117NeYAU] [^1167SXQL]. Let me also double-check broader dermatologic series: in a tertiary center review of S. lugdunensis skin infections, abscess did appear among the documented presentations, alongside pustulosis and folliculitis, again reinforcing that abscess formation is within its clinical repertoire [^114426LS].

> Next, I should review mechanistic virulence data that would plausibly underwrite invasive infection and abscess formation. I need to ensure there are adhesion and immune-evasion strategies: S. lugdunensis uniquely binds von Willebrand factor under shear, enabling firm adhesion to endothelium and valves, a property not typical of most CoNS and consistent with its aggressive endovascular phenotype — this capacity signals a step-up in virulence potential compared with commensal CoNS and helps explain deep tissue seeding that can culminate in abscesses in susceptible sites [^114FGNkp]. I should confirm biofilm capacity and nutrient acquisition under host stressors; indeed, S. lugdunensis forms robust, proteinaceous biofilms and uses iron-regulated surface determinant proteins like IsdC to drive biofilm formation under iron limitation, a host-like condition, which supports persistence and abscess chronicity [^113ng4tS] [^112XYCRz]. Let me also verify iron scavenging: duplication and amplification of the isd locus provide a competitive advantage in iron-poor environments such as abscess cavities, further aligning the organism with true pathogens capable of thriving within purulent foci [^1137ds1y] [^115bBKum].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without reconciling this with clinical severity signals. I should confirm that clinicians consider S. lugdunensis significant when isolated from invasive sites; case-based and cohort data emphasize that it causes aggressive endocarditis and osteoarticular infections, and that discarding it as a contaminant has led to missed diagnoses — together this reinforces that recovery of S. lugdunensis from a purulent site or sterile compartment warrants clinical attention rather than dismissal [^112irwp3] [^115oTLQy] [^116ehd7K] [^111t55Jv].

> Now, I need to translate this into practical management when S. lugdunensis is isolated from an abscess. Let me first confirm source control guidance: for skin abscesses, incision and drainage is the cornerstone of therapy per IDSA guidance, and cultures should be obtained in recurrent or severe presentations, which fits well if we suspect S. lugdunensis and want organism-directed therapy if antibiotics are needed [^114AQV9v] [^117Vr2nK]. But wait, I should verify when to add antibiotics; IDSA suggests antibiotics after drainage for re-abscesses or when systemic involvement exists, and some guidelines argue that uncomplicated abscesses may not require antibiotics once adequately drained — so antibiotic decisions should be individualized, with culture-directed narrowing if S. lugdunensis is confirmed [^111LRskt] [^11537E23]. I should also double-check susceptibility considerations; S. lugdunensis is often broadly susceptible but can harbor beta-lactamase or even emerging oxacillin resistance that may be missed by certain methods, so accurate testing matters; when antibiotics are indicated, active beta-lactams can be used if susceptible, and several anti-staphylococcal agents used for SSTIs list S. lugdunensis among covered organisms on labeling [^1121eq3C] [^113VmSBg] [^116i7isw].

> Stepping back, I need to ensure I have directly answered the question. Yes — S. lugdunensis is a bona fide pathogen and a well-documented cause of skin and soft-tissue abscesses, with population-level data showing abscess as a leading presentation, focused series demonstrating abscess predilections (pelvic girdle, breast), and mechanistic virulence traits that align with invasive and purulent disease; it should not be reflexively dismissed as a contaminant when recovered from an abscess or sterile site [^111Qfjet] [^114DaeuJ] [^1121eq3C] [^1137ds1y] [^113VmSBg].

---

Yes, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a **clinically significant pathogen** [^111t55Jv] that causes abscesses and other aggressive infections. It is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus [^114m5qwp] that often behaves more like Staphylococcus aureus than other CoNS and is strongly associated with skin and soft tissue abscesses [^111Qfjet] — particularly in the pelvic girdle [^114DaeuJ] and lower extremities. S. lugdunensis is often isolated as the sole pathogen in abscesses and can cause severe infections such as endocarditis [^115oTLQy] and osteomyelitis; therefore, it **should not be dismissed as a contaminant** [^116ehd7K]. Management requires incision and drainage [^114AQV9v] with pathogen-directed antibiotics, and susceptibility testing should be performed [^113VmSBg] because resistance can occur [^1158pb9b].

## Clinical evidence of abscess formation

Multiple studies and case reports document the **association of S. lugdunensis with abscess formation**:

- **Pelvic girdle abscesses**: A study identified S. lugdunensis as the causative organism in 13 out of 14 clinically significant infections, with nine abscesses located in the pelvic girdle region, suggesting this area as a natural habitat for the organism [^114DaeuJ].

- **Skin and soft tissue abscesses**: S. lugdunensis is frequently isolated from skin abscesses [^117NeYAU], particularly in the lower extremities and pelvic region [^111Qfjet]. It is often the sole pathogen isolated from these infections, indicating its primary role in abscess formation.

- **Breast abscesses**: S. lugdunensis has been identified as a causative agent in breast abscesses, further demonstrating its ability to cause localized purulent infections [^1121eq3C].

---

## Virulence factors contributing to abscess formation

S. lugdunensis possesses several **virulence factors** that underlie its pathogenicity and propensity to cause abscesses:

- **Biofilm formation**: S. lugdunensis can form biofilms [^112XYCRz], particularly under iron-limited conditions, which enhances its ability to persist in host tissues and evade immune responses [^113ng4tS].

- **Iron acquisition systems**: The presence of an iron-regulated surface determinant (isd) locus [^1137ds1y] allows S. lugdunensis to acquire iron from host hemoglobin, providing a competitive advantage during infection [^115bBKum].

- **Adhesion factors**: S. lugdunensis expresses adhesion factors that facilitate attachment to host tissues [^114FGNkp], promoting colonization and abscess formation [^111t55Jv].

---

## Clinical significance and pathogenicity

S. lugdunensis is a **clinically significant pathogen** because of its aggressive behavior and capacity to cause severe infections — including abscesses, endocarditis [^115oTLQy], osteomyelitis, and device-related infections. Unlike other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. lugdunensis infections often resemble those caused by Staphylococcus aureus [^111t55Jv], necessitating **prompt and aggressive treatment** [^114m5qwp].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate identification of S. lugdunensis is **crucial** because it is often misidentified as Staphylococcus aureus due to similar morphology [^11439KLq]. Laboratory methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) have improved identification accuracy, underscoring the clinical significance of this organism [^117MQaYC].

---

## Treatment and management

The **management of abscesses** caused by S. lugdunensis includes:

- **Incision and drainage**: Surgical drainage [^114AQV9v] is essential for abscess resolution [^11537E23].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Antibiotic selection should be guided by susceptibility testing [^113VmSBg], as resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has been reported [^1158pb9b].

- **Source control**: Removal of infected devices or foreign bodies is critical in managing device-related infections.

---

## Conclusion

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a clinically significant pathogen **capable of causing abscesses** and other severe infections [^111Qfjet]. Its aggressive behavior, virulence factors, and ability to form biofilms [^112XYCRz] contribute to its pathogenicity. Accurate identification and appropriate management — including surgical drainage and targeted antibiotic therapy — are essential for effective treatment of abscesses caused by this organism.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a member of the coagulase-negative staphylococci with the potential to cause clinically significant infections. The spectrum of infections was investigated in 39 isolates of S. lugdunensis from 38 patients. Most (73%) infections were located below the waist, while those above the waist were mainly (5/7) breast abscesses.

Most isolates were susceptible to the antibiotics tested, although 15.4% were beta-lactamase-positive and could be identified by the disk-diffusion method for penicillin G. There was very good concordance between the disk-diffusion method and the Etest method for oxacillin resistance.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that 56% of the isolates belonged to one SmaI pulsotype, while phenotypic analysis by the Phene Plate system identified three main phenotypic groups. Although the S. lugdunensis isolates analyzed were obtained from different patients, treated in different wards and hospitals during a 4-year period, there was a low degree of diversity, both genotypically and phenotypically. For this reason, PFGE is not suitable for the analysis of an outbreak situation, and the homogeneity observed may indicate that S. lugdunensis is a genetically conserved species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the community [^111Qfjet]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a rare cause of severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, often causes superficial skin infections similar to Staphylococcus aureus infections. We initiated a study to optimize the identification methods in the routine laboratory, followed by a population-based epidemiologic analysis of patients infected with S. lugdunensis in Viborg County, Denmark. Recognition of a characteristic Eikenella corrodens-like odor on Columbia sheep blood agar combined with colony pleomorphism and prominent beta-hemolysis after 2 days of incubation, confirmed by API-ID-32 Staph, led to an 11-fold increase in the detection of S. lugdunensis. By these methods we found 491 S. lugdunensis infections in 4 years, corresponding to an incidence of 53 per 100,000 per year, an increase from 5 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the preceding years.

Seventy-five percent of the cases were found in general practice; these were dominated by skin abscesses (36%), wound infections (25%), and paronychias (13%). Fifty-six percent of the infections occurred below the waist, and toes were the most frequently infected site (21%). Only 3% of the patients suffered from severe invasive infections. The median age was 52 years, and the male/female ratio was 0.69.

Our study shows that S. lugdunensis is a common cause of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) and is probably underrated by many laboratories. S. lugdunensis should be accepted as a significant pathogen in SSTI and should be looked for in all routine bacteriological examinations, and clinicians should be acquainted with this information for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^113VmSBg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

This review provides an update on recent findings about the clinical and microbiological characteristics of *Staphylococcus lugdunensis*.

- **Recent findings**: The European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) differ in their methodology and breakpoints for the detection of penicillin and oxacillin resistance in *S. lugdunensis*. The EUCAST method for beta-lactamase detection recommends a 1-unit penicillin disk and has demonstrated superior performance compared to the 10-unit penicillin disk recommended by CLSI. A similar outcome has been previously reported in *Staphylococcus aureus*. Additionally, there is emerging oxacillin resistance in some geographical areas. Of particular concern is that oxacillin resistance in mecA positive isolates may not be reliably detected by Cefoxitin breakpoints.

- **Summary**: Coagulase-negative staphylococci are now recognized as a heterogeneous group of organisms that do not microbiologically or clinically behave the same way. The spectrum of clinical disease is species-dependent and is particularly true for *S. lugdunensis*, which causes an array of clinical infections similar to *S. aureus*. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of phenotypic tests to detect resistance to ensure that appropriate antimicrobial therapy is delivered to patients.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection sites: Predominance of abscesses in the pelvic girdle region [^114DaeuJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We used a screening protocol to identify *Staphylococcus lugdunensis* in clinical specimens with pure or predominant growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci. *S. lugdunensis* was isolated from 17 patients over a 12-month period and was judged to be the cause of infection in 14 cases. In 13 of these cases, the patient had a soft-tissue abscess, and in 9 instances, the abscess was located in the pelvic girdle region, suggesting that this may be the natural habitat of *S. lugdunensis*.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections [^114sYJVp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms may be normal flora of human skin; however, these bacteria can also be pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections. A summary of skin and soft tissue infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus species is provided in this review.

We conducted a search of the PubMed database using the following terms:

- **Infections and symptoms**: abscess, cellulitis, cyst, draining, felon, folliculitis, furuncle, indolent, infection, osteomyelitis, paronychia, sinus, skin, soft, systemic, tissue, vulvar
- **Organisms and microbiome-related**: auricularis, capitis, coagulase, epidermidis, haemolyticus, hominis, lugdunensis, mecA, microbiome, negative, saprophyticus, simulans, staphylococcus, virulence, virulent
- **Other**: biofilm, contaminant

The relevant papers and their references generated by the search were reviewed.

Skin and soft tissue infections have been observed to be caused by many coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms:

- **Common species**: Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus simulans

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin infections predominantly present as abscesses and paronychia. They are most common in elderly patients or those individuals who are immunosuppressed and tend to be broadly susceptible to antibiotic treatment.

In conclusion, albeit less common, coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms can result in skin and soft tissue infections, particularly in older and/or immunocompromised individuals.

### Testing for methicillin-resistant in the anterior nares for antibiotic de-escalation in patients presenting with acute skin and soft tissue infections: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113pCxkF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common worldwide and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus is the causative organism in a large portion of SSTIs, including antibiotic-resistant strains like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA-targeting antibiotics carry the risk of major adverse reactions, including clindamycin-associated Clostridioides difficile infection, vancomycin flushing syndrome, and renal toxicity. Antibiotic de-escalation after empiric treatment with MRSA-targeting agents is often desired, usually occurring after susceptibilities return. Nasal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of MRSA offers a relatively quick turnaround time, and screening and identifying MRSA-colonized patients has been proposed as a tool for antibiotic de-escalation.

- **Screening accuracy**:
	- Screening for MRSA in the anterior nares has high specificity for diabetic foot infections and MRSA pneumonia. However, the relationship between MRSA colonization of the nose and whether MRSA is the causative organism for patients presenting with SSTIs is less well-characterized. Previous studies reviewed the literature on the predictive value of MRSA colonization for many types of infections, including SSTIs, but they did not report nares-only data and included infections that developed during hospitalization. Healthcare-associated MRSA and community-associated MRSA have different genotypes, virulence factors, resistance profiles, and clinical characteristics. By only including patients who present with acute SSTIs, we can…

### Role of T cells in abscess formation [^111P4ZuW]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

A series of recent studies have shed new light on the strategy used by certain bacterial pathogens to induce a classic infectious process: abscess formation. This work describes how zwitterionic polysaccharides on the surface of these organisms interact with the host immune system in general, and with T cells in particular, to coordinate this pathobiologic response.

### Shear-resistant binding to von Willebrand factor allows Staphylococcus lugdunensis to adhere to the cardiac valves and initiate endocarditis [^114FGNkp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an emerging cause of endocarditis. To cause endovascular infections, S. lugdunensis requires mechanisms to overcome shear stress. We investigated whether platelets and von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediate bacterial adhesion to the vessel wall and the cardiac valves under flow.

- **Methods**: S. lugdunensis binding to VWF, collagen, and endothelial cells was studied in a parallel flow chamber in the absence and presence of platelets. In vivo adhesion of S. lugdunensis was evaluated in a mouse microvasculature perfusion model and a new mouse model of endocarditis.

- **Results**: Contrary to other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. lugdunensis bound to VWF under flow, thus enabling its adhesion to endothelial cells and to the subendothelial matrix. In inflamed vessels of the mesenteric circulation, VWF recruited S. lugdunensis to the vessel wall. In a novel endocarditis mouse model, local inflammation and the resulting release of VWF enabled S. lugdunensis to bind and colonize the heart valves.

- **Conclusions**: S. lugdunensis binds directly to VWF, which proved to be vital for withstanding shear forces and for its adhesion to the vessel wall and cardiac valves. This mechanism explains why S. lugdunensis causes more-aggressive infections, including endocarditis, compared with other coagulase-negative staphylococci.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111LRskt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for skin abscesses, specifically in the management of re-abscesses, drainage, and antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend administering a 5–10-day course of antibiotic therapy that is active against the isolated pathogen after obtaining cultures from a re-abscess.

### Oxacillin [^114sYjc6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Bacteriologic studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to oxacillin should always be performed. The duration of therapy varies with the type and severity of infection as well as the overall condition of the patient; therefore, it should be determined by the clinical and bacteriological response of the patient. In severe staphylococcal infections, therapy with oxacillin should be continued for at least 14 days. Therapy should be continued for at least 48 hours after the patient has become afebrile, asymptomatic, and cultures are negative. Treatment of endocarditis and osteomyelitis may require a longer duration of therapy.

- **Intravenous administration considerations**: With intravenous administration, particularly in elderly patients, care should be taken because of the possibility of thrombophlebitis.

- **Recommended dosages for oxacillin for injection, USP**

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^1167SXQL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Altogether, our study demonstrates that HS lesions are associated with bacterial species that can cause abscesses and severe infections. Compared with S. aureus or S. pyogenes, the low pathogenicity of these bacteria could account for the chronicity of suppuration of HS lesions that can last for years. Additionally, the particular propensity of HS patients to develop recurrent or chronic skin infections highly suggests that HS is not primarily an infectious disease but a predisposing condition that allows these low pathogenic species to cause soft tissue and skin infections.

Histopathologic studies of noninflammatory areas of the skin of HS patients have shown the presence of dilated and distorted hair follicles. These anatomic abnormalities are thought to be caused by the hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum, which can lead to dilatation and rupture and release of bacteria within the dermis. This event may predispose S. lugdunensis and anaerobic bacteria to cause nodules and abscesses in HS. Conversely, chronic suppurating HS lesions are deep abscesses drained by interconnected epithelialized sinus tracts. Colonization of these deep-seated lesions by anaerobic bacteria, streptococci of the Milleri group, and actinomycetes may account for chronic inflammation.

A limitation of our study is that HS patients who come to our center usually seek treatment for severe forms of the disease, thus the study population may not be representative of the HS patient population.

In summary, this study demonstrates that bacterial pathogens known to cause soft tissue and skin infections are frequently involved in HS.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis native tricuspid valve endocarditis: a case report and review of literature [^112irwp3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coagulase negative staphylococci are skin commensals and are generally disregarded as contaminants in clinical specimens. Repeated isolation of coagulase negative staphylococci in blood cultures should warrant a species identification to recognize unusually virulent organisms that demand aggressive treatment, such as Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Staphylococcus lugdunensis is known to cause a wide variety of infections, including a predominant left-sided endocarditis. We report a rare case of native tricuspid valve Staphylococcus lugdunensis endocarditis in a non-intravenous drug user and include a brief literature review.

### Septic arthritis with Staphylococcus lugdunensis following arthroscopic ACL revision with BPTB allograft [^11439KLq]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Septic arthritis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is an uncommon but serious complication, resulting in six times greater hospital costs than uncomplicated ACL surgery and an inferior postoperative activity level. Prompt initiation of specific antibiotic therapy is the most critical treatment, followed by open or arthroscopic joint decompression, debridement, and lavage.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus predominantly infecting the skin and soft tissue. Few reported cases of bone and joint infections by S. lugdunensis indicate severe clinical manifestations, elusive diagnosis, and difficult treatment. If the microbiology laboratory does not use the tube coagulase (long) test to confirm the slide coagulase test result, the organism might be misidentified as Staphylococcus aureus. S. lugdunensis is more virulent than other coagulase-negative staphylococci. In many clinical situations, it behaves like S. aureus, further increasing confusion and worsening the expected outcome.

S. lugdunensis is known to cause infective endocarditis with a worse outcome, septicemia, deep tissue infection, vascular and joint prosthesis infection, osteomyelitis, discitis, breast abscess, urinary tract infections, toxic shock, and osteitis pubis. We present the first case report in the literature of septic arthritis with S. lugdunensis following arthroscopic ACL revision with bone-patellar-tendon-bone allograft.

### Heterogeneity in clinical patterns of adult lung abscess patients: An 8-year retrospective study in a tertiary hospital [^113QVgLe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Lung abscess is a purulent infection within the pulmonary parenchyma, characterized by the formation of a cavity containing necrotic debris, inflammatory cells, and infectious material. Recent advancements in understanding the etiology of lung abscess have uncovered a spectrum of contributing factors, including pulmonary structural abnormalities, bronchial obstruction, and hematogenous dissemination from distant infected sites.

Among these factors, infection plays the central role in the development of lung abscess. Despite significant progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms, lung abscess remains a complex and underexplored condition. Diagnosis typically relies on a combination of imaging studies, clinical evaluation, and laboratory tests. Treatment usually involves targeted antibiotic therapy based on the identified pathogen, and timely intervention is crucial to prevent complications and ensure full recovery. The relationship between different pathogens and clinical outcomes highlights the critical importance of accurately identifying the causative agent.

However, conventional diagnostic methods are often proved time-consuming and less sensitive, leading to delayed diagnosis and inappropriate antibiotic use. Given the multifactorial etiology of lung abscesses, conventional tests fail to meet clinical needs. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a promising solution for pathogen detection, providing an unbiased and highly sensitive method for identifying the causative agents of infection. Despite its potential, limited research has been conducted to explore its effectiveness in clinical settings.

### A small membrane stabilizing protein critical to the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus [^115VmpqK]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, where the types of infections it causes range in severity from relatively superficial skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) to fatal cases of endocarditis and bacteremia. While SSTIs rarely require clinical intervention, more invasive or prolonged infections require antibiotic treatment. Unfortunately, the widespread use of antibiotics has given rise to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus, including the notorious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which at its peak was reported to be responsible for more than 50% of infections in hospitals.

Infection control measures and changes to antibiotic usage policies have led to a decrease in the incidence of MRSA in several countries. In England, where the surveillance of S. aureus bacteremia is mandatory, the incidence of MRSA declined for several years (by more than 80% since 2007). However, the incidence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia has increased year on year, resulting in an overall increase in bacteremia incidence by 30.3% since 2011, when mandatory surveillance began. This is a worrying trend that has also been observed in other countries. Although new classes of antibiotics are under development, given the rate at which S. aureus evolves resistance, it is clear that we need to improve our understanding of this pathogen to develop alternative therapeutic strategies.

One approach is to target specific virulence factors through either vaccination or molecular inhibition. To identify and develop such strategies, we need to have a thorough understanding of the pathogenicity of S. aureus.

### Competing for iron: Duplication and amplification of the isd locus in Staphylococcus lugdunensis HKU09–01 provides a competitive advantage to overcome nutritional limitation [^1137ds1y]. PLoS Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Although S. lugdunensis belongs to the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), it in many ways behaves more like the coagulase-positive S. aureus than other CoNS, including having an apparently elevated degree of virulence. As a result, S. lugdunensis is often referred to as a wolf in sheep's clothing. Apart from skin and soft tissue infections, S. lugdunensis is particularly associated with an aggressive form of infective endocarditis (IE), with 70% of the patients requiring surgery compared to 37% of patients suffering from S. aureus IE.

Iron (Fe3+/Fe2+) is a scarce nutrient during invasive disease since body fluids are actively depleted of free iron and other divalent metals by the host to prevent bacterial growth. This process is referred to as "nutritional immunity". A noteworthy characteristic of the genome sequence of S. lugdunensis is an iron-dependent surface determinant (isd) locus. S. aureus is the only other staphylococcal species known to harbor an isd locus, where it facilitates the acquisition of heme from hemoglobin as a source of nutrient iron. This allows the bacteria to overcome iron restriction during host colonization and invasive disease. Interestingly, the isd operon was found to be tandemly duplicated in the S. lugdunensis clinical isolate HKU09–01.

We demonstrated that this duplication undergoes constant RecA-dependent amplification and segregation, leading to significant changes in isd expression levels. Duplication and amplification of isd improved the hemoglobin-binding capacity and provided a significant advantage for pathogen survival.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^117NeYAU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a skin disease characterized by nodules or abscesses and chronic suppurating lesions. In the absence of clear pathophysiology, HS is considered to be an inflammatory disease and has no satisfactory medical treatment. Recently, prolonged antimicrobial treatments were shown to improve or resolve HS lesions. We prospectively studied the microbiology of 102 HS lesions sampled from 82 patients using prolonged bacterial cultures and bacterial metagenomics on 6 samples.

- **Prevalence of Staphylococcus lugdunensis**: Staphylococcus lugdunensis was cultured as a unique or predominant isolate from 58% of HS nodules and abscesses.
- **Polymicrobial anaerobic microflora**: A polymicrobial anaerobic microflora comprising strict anaerobes, Milleri group streptococci, and actinomycetes was found in 24% of abscesses or nodules and in 87% of chronic suppurating lesions.

These data show that bacteria known to cause soft tissue and skin infections are associated with HS lesions. Whether these pathogens are the cause of the lesions or are secondary infectious agents, these findings support targeted antimicrobial treatment of HS.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: A clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), along with several other bacteria primarily originating from the skin flora. MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

- **Management guidelines**: Table 1 outlines that antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel…

### Whole genome sequence and comparative genomics analysis of multi-drug resistant environmental ST59 [^115HNbCW]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common human skin commensal, but it is also the most frequent pathogen among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), primarily causing device-associated healthcare-associated infections (DA-HAIs). Compared with the more virulent S. aureus, CoNS rarely produce toxins, and less is known about whether the toxin genes contribute to strain virulence. S. epidermidis forms biofilms on medical devices and implants. From these biofilms, single cells can dissociate and disseminate via the bloodstream to start colonization at a different site, potentially leading to sepsis, meningitis, and endocarditis. Additionally, S. epidermidis and other CoNS are believed to act as a reservoir of resistance and virulence genes for S. aureus, contributing to the evolution and emergence of successful clones of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

Together with S. aureus and other CoNS, S. epidermidis accounts for 30% of hospital-associated infections. These nosocomial pathogens have developed an arsenal of strategies contributing to the colonization and infection of hosts, while often being resistant to multiple antibiotics. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has been primarily attributed to healthcare-associated settings. However, more recently, the selection of antibiotic resistance has also been associated with the community, linked to the misuse of antibiotics. A typical example of this is the community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), which, in addition to acquiring methicillin resistance, has gradually increased the frequency of resistance determinants, similar to hospital-acquired MRSA.

### Competing for iron: Duplication and amplification of the isd locus in Staphylococcus lugdunensis HKU09–01 provides a competitive advantage to overcome nutritional limitation [^115bBKum]. PLoS Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative bacterial pathogen that is particularly associated with severe cases of infectious endocarditis. Unique among the coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. lugdunensis harbors an iron-regulated surface determinant locus (isd). This locus facilitates the acquisition of heme as a source of nutrient iron during infection and allows iron limitation, caused by "nutritional immunity", to be overcome. The isd locus is duplicated in S. lugdunensis HKU09–01, and we show here that the duplication is intrinsically unstable and undergoes accordion-like amplification and segregation, leading to extensive isd copy number variation.

Amplification of the locus increased the level of expression of Isd proteins and improved the binding of hemoglobin to the cell surface of S. lugdunensis. Furthermore, Isd overexpression provided an advantage when strains were competing for a limited amount of hemoglobin as the sole source of iron. Gene duplications and amplifications (GDA) are events of fundamental importance for bacterial evolution and are frequently associated with antibiotic resistance in many species.

As such, GDAs are regarded as evolutionary adaptations to novel selective pressures in hostile environments, pointing towards a special importance of isd for S. lugdunensis. For the first time, we show an example of a GDA that involves a virulence factor of a Gram-positive pathogen and link the GDA directly to a competitive advantage when the bacteria were struggling with selective pressures mimicking "nutritional immunity".

### Study of Staphylococcus aureus pathogenic genes by transfer and expression in the less virulent organism Streptococcus gordonii [^114LKCoQ]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Because Staphylococcus aureus strains contain multiple virulence factors, studying their pathogenic role by single-gene inactivation generates equivocal results. To circumvent this problem, we have expressed specific S. aureus genes in the less virulent organism, Streptococcus gordonii, and tested the recombinants for a gain of function both in vitro and in vivo. Clumping factor A (ClfA) and coagulase were investigated. Both gene products were expressed functionally and with similar kinetics during growth by streptococci and staphylococci.

ClfA-positive S. gordonii was more adherent to platelet-fibrin clots mimicking cardiac vegetations in vitro and more infective in rats with experimental endocarditis (P < 0.05). Moreover, deleting clfA from clfA-positive streptococcal transformants restored both the low in vitro adherence and the low in vivo infectivity of the parent. Coagulase-positive transformants, on the other hand, were neither more adherent nor more infective than the parent. Furthermore, coagulase did not increase the pathogenicity of clfA-positive streptococci when both clfA and coa genes were simultaneously expressed in an artificial minioperon in streptococci.

These results definitively attribute a role for ClfA, but not coagulase, in S. aureus endovascular infections. This gain-of-function strategy might help solve the role of individual factors in the complex S. aureus-host relationship.

### Is Staphylococcus lugdunensis significant in clinical samples [^111t55Jv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

The implication of coagulase-negative staphylococci in human diseases is a major issue, particularly in hospital settings where these species often act as opportunistic pathogens. In addition, some coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as S. lugdunensis, have emerged as pathogenic bacteria implicated in severe infections, particularly osteoarticular infections, foreign-body-associated infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis. In vitro studies have shown the presence of several putative virulence factors such as adhesion factors, biofilm production, and proteolytic factors that might explain clinical manifestations. Taken together, the clinical and microbiological data might change the way clinicians and microbiologists look at S. lugdunensis in clinical samples.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^112F7VvU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Previous reports have rarely emphasized colony variation as an important feature of *S. lugdunensis*. In the initial description of the species in 1988, colony variation was observed in 3 of 11 strains. More recently, Leung et al. reported colony variation of *S. lugdunensis* in a fatal case of endocarditis. Unlike other staphylococcal species such as *S. capitis* and *S. hominis*, which show colony variation that disappeared after extended incubation, mixed morphotypes of *S. lugdunensis* were persistently detectable through incubation and subculture. The authors speculated that preceding antimicrobial drug therapy may play a role in producing colony variation in *S. lugdunensis* and that previous studies may have underreported the characteristic of colony variation seen in this species.

Some of the aberrant morphotypes described in earlier studies may have, in fact, been small colony variants (SCVs). Both prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs and the presence of chronic or recurring infections, often with indwelling foreign devices that have been associated with SCVs of *S. aureus*, *S. epidermidis*, and *S. capitis*, are features commonly observed in infections with *S. lugdunensis*. In our case, repeated courses of gentamicin therapy may have selected for SCVs. Although the infection showed a rather benign clinical course and did not confirm other reports of *S. lugdunensis* endocarditis in which the infection was more aggressive, it illustrates the chronic, recurrent, and persistent nature of infections with SCVs and the problems associated with delayed identification of *S. lugdunensis* colony variants.

### Poly-N-acetylglucosamine is not a major component of the extracellular matrix in biofilms formed by icaADBC-positive Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolates [^113ng4tS]. Infection and Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a pathogen of heightened virulence that causes infections resembling those caused by Staphylococcus aureus, rather than those caused by its coagulase-negative staphylococcal counterparts. Many types of S. lugdunensis infection, including native valve endocarditis, prosthetic joint infection, and intravascular catheter-related infection, are associated with biofilm etiology. Poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), a polysaccharide synthesized by products of the icaADBC locus, is a common mechanism of intercellular adhesion in staphylococcal biofilms.

Here we report the characterization of ica homologues and the in vitro biofilm formation properties of a collection of S. lugdunensis clinical isolates. Isolates formed biofilms in microtiter wells to various degrees. Biofilm formation by most isolates was enhanced with glucose but diminished by sodium chloride or ethanol. icaADBC homologues were found in all S. lugdunensis isolates tested, although the locus organization differed substantially from that of other staphylococcal ica loci.

icaR was not detected in S. lugdunensis, but a novel open reading frame with putative glycosyl hydrolase function is located upstream of the ica locus. icaADBC sequence heterogeneity did not explain the variability in biofilm formation among isolates. PNAG was not detected in S. lugdunensis extracts by immunoblotting with an anti-deacetylated PNAG antibody or wheat germ agglutinin. Confocal microscopy with fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin showed a paucity of PNAG in S. lugdunensis biofilms, but abundant extracellular matrix components.

### Summary of clinical features of 1800 cases of pyogenic liver abscess [^115uo8cZ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

A liver abscess is a localized infection in the liver caused by pathogenic microorganisms entering through various routes, such as the bloodstream or portal vein, leading to the formation of focal abscesses. The pathogens responsible for liver abscesses include amebae, fungi, and bacteria, with bacteria being the most common causative agents. In recent years, the incidence of pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) has been rising annually due to an aging population and increased rates of conditions like cholelithiasis and diabetes. Some PLA patients experience the dissemination of pathogens through the bloodstream, leading to extrahepatic infections such as endophthalmitis, lung abscesses, and brain abscesses. These infections involving extrahepatic metastasis are referred to as extrahepatic metastatic infections (EMIs), with an occurrence rate of approximately 20%. This study aims to summarize the clinical and microbiological characteristics of PLA patients by retrospectively analyzing clinical data from 1800 PLA patients at the First Hospital of Jilin University from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, the study focuses on PLA patients with EMI to outline their clinical features and provide insights into the diagnosis and treatment of PLA.

### Pathogenesis of infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci [^114m5qwp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

As a group, the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are among the most frequently isolated bacteria in the clinical microbiology laboratory and are becoming increasingly important, especially as causes of hospital-acquired infections. These bacteria are normal inhabitants of human skin and mucous membranes; therefore, one of the major challenges of daily diagnostic work is to distinguish clinically significant CoNS from contaminant strains. This overview addresses knowledge of the pathogenesis of infections due to CoNS and particularly focuses on virulence factors of the species Staphylococcus epidermidis. S. epidermidis has been identified as a major cause of nosocomial infections, especially in patients with predisposing factors such as indwelling or implanted foreign polymer bodies.

- **Biofilm formation**: Most important in the pathogenesis of foreign-body-associated infections is the ability of these bacteria to colonize the polymer surface by the formation of a thick, multilayered biofilm. Biofilm formation takes place in two phases. The first phase involves the attachment of the bacteria to polymer surfaces that may be either unmodified or coated with host extracellular matrix proteins. In the second phase, the bacteria proliferate and accumulate into multilayered cell clusters that are embedded in an extracellular material. The bacterial factors involved in both phases of biofilm formation are discussed in this review.

In addition, the most important aspects of the pathogenic potential of S. saprophyticus, S. lugdunensis, and S. schleiferi are described.

### Disease-associated genotypes of the commensal skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis [^114a5zia]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The most commonly cultured bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories are the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), especially Staphylococcus epidermidis. Despite their importance as nosocomial pathogens, CoNS are not routinely surveyed even though they can represent over 40% of cultured isolates from blood or cerebrospinal fluid samples. The reasons for this underreporting, compared with notorious nosocomial pathogens such as Clostridium difficile and S. aureus, are linked to the ubiquity of CoNS as commensal colonizers of human skin and mucus membranes. This leads to difficulties in determining the clinical significance of isolates for two reasons.

First, isolates that have caused infection during invasive procedures are difficult to distinguish from those that have contaminated microbiological samples unless they are isolated multiple times. Second, the incomplete understanding of the determinants of pathogenicity in CoNS means they are often described as opportunistic or accidental pathogens with little attention given to the emergence and spread of virulent lineages.

There is mounting evidence that S. epidermidis isolated from infections are a subset of those found on the skin surface. This implies that, rather than simple passive infection, there may be certain lineages or specific virulence factors associated with the emergence of pathogens from a background of harmless ancestors. For example, S. epidermidis pathogenesis is associated with antibiotic resistance, attachment to host tissues, and accumulation in multi-layered biofilms on implanted devices.

### The "surreptitious Staphylococcus": Staphylococcus lugdunensis endocarditis in a child [^115qynY3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

A child with congenital heart disease developed infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Despite an excellent initial response to antibiotic treatment — evidenced by clinical, inflammatory, and echocardiographic indices — the patient's valve damage progressed silently, ultimately necessitating surgical intervention. This case underscores the potential for misidentification of S. lugdunensis, its usual susceptibility to penicillin, and the aggressive nature of endocarditis caused by this coagulase-negative staphylococcus. The epidemiology and treatment of endocarditis caused by this organism are reviewed.

At our pediatric center, only 2.1% (7/347) of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates were found to be S. lugdunensis, and only 1 isolate was considered possibly clinically significant. S. lugdunensis does not appear to be a common pathogen in children.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections [^113Vf9E9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are differentiated from the closely related but more virulent Staphylococcus aureus by their inability to produce free coagulase. Currently, there are over 40 recognized species of CNS. These organisms typically reside on healthy human skin and mucus membranes, rarely cause disease, and are most frequently encountered by clinicians as contaminants of microbiological cultures. However, CNS have been increasingly recognized to cause clinically significant infections. The conversion of the CNS from symbiont to human pathogen has been a direct reflection of the use of indwelling medical devices. This article deals with the clinical syndromes, epidemiology, prevention, and management of infections caused by this unique group of organisms.

### Endovascular stent-associated infection with Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^113NEtff]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

An elderly woman presented febrile 5 days after stenting of multiple coronary arteries. Echocardiography showed a thickening of the aortic root, raising the possibility of stent infection. Four of four blood culture bottles grew Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and repeat echo showed an aortic root abscess. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, the patient died.

A 24-year-old man with a ventricular septal defect presented febrile 4 weeks after stenting of an aortic coarctation. Initial transoesophageal echo found no vegetations around the stent or elsewhere. Four of six blood culture bottles grew S. lugdunensis. Following an episode of hypoxia, imaging was repeated and a new large vegetation was seen on the pulmonary valve, with two thin-walled cavities in the lungs on a CT pulmonary angiogram. The patient was treated with a long course of appropriate antibiotic therapy and was discharged from the hospital 6 weeks later.

### Microbial flora and antibiotic resistance in odontogenic abscesses in Upstate New York [^116XiokG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Abscesses in the head and neck frequently have odontogenic sources. As bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns may change over time and based on location, we describe the common bacteria found in odontogenic abscesses, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, and differences in each between pediatric and adult patients in Upstate New York. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent drainage of odontogenic abscesses (n = 131) from 2002 to 2012 at an academic institution. The medical records were reviewed for results of abscess cultures, comorbidities, and drainage procedures.

Polymicrobial sources were identified in 60.3% of cases and monomicrobial in 33.6%. Overall, the most common bacteria were alpha hemolytic streptococci (33.6%), Streptococcus milleri (32.1%), Prevotella (16.8%), and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (14.5%). Candida and Morganella spp. were more common in children than in adults.

Overall, antibiotic resistance was observed in seven different pathogens. The most common antibiotic resistances were to clindamycin and erythromycin, which should be considered when deciding initial antibiotic therapy, especially in adult patients, who trended in this study toward having pathogens with higher rates of resistance.

### Pathogenic aspects of pyogenic liver abscess associated with experimental schistosomiasis [^116ewebR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2001). Low credibility.

Schistosomiasis mansoni infection that occurs concurrently with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia favors the formation of pyogenic liver abscess. The present experimental study in mice evaluated the following aspects of the relationship between infection with Schistosoma mansoni and liver abscess caused by S. aureus:

- **The role of the eggs of S. mansoni**: in the genesis of the abscesses.
- **The influence of different phases of schistosomiasis**: in the development of liver abscesses.
- **The effect of the treatment of schistosomiasis**: on the development of the abscesses.

Macroscopic and histopathological study showed multiple liver abscesses around granulomas of S. mansoni in the acute and chronic phases of schistosomiasis. Treatment of acute schistosomiasis before experimentally-induced bacteremia did not prevent the formation of liver abscess. The study findings indicate that granulomas around S. mansoni eggs and worms lodged in the liver provide a focus and substrate for pyogenic abscesses caused by S. aureus.

### Bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by CD4(+) T-cell activation via the CD28-B7–2 costimulatory pathway [^111ER7DC]. Infection and Immunity (2000). Low credibility.

Abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. The immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that T cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. To delineate the mechanism by which T cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of T-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via CD28-B7 costimulation were investigated.

T cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (Zps), known to induce abscess formation, required CD28-B7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naïve rats, promoted abscess formation. Blockade of T-cell activation via the CD28-B7 pathway in animals with CTLA4Ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides distasonis. In contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo T-cell activation via CD28 signaling. Abscess formation in vivo and T-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by B7–2 but not B7–1. These results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires T-cell activation via the CD28-B7–2 pathway.

### Spinal subdural Staphylococcus aureus abscess: case report and review of the literature [^116RvH7p]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal subdural abscess is very rare, and its exact incidence is unknown to our knowledge. At the time of writing, including our patient, only 65 cases have been reported. Articles, reviews, and case reports published in English language journals and indexed by PubMed (National Library of Medicine) were systematically searched. Additional articles and/or case reports were retrieved from the reference lists of the online literature found. A combination of the following terms was used in the search: spinal infection, spinal subdural abscess, Staphylococcus aureus, and abscess. Cerebral abscesses, which are also extremely rare complications of infections (meningitis, pharyngeal infection, sepsis, mastoiditis) or complications of rare syndromes/diseases, are not included in our review.

The review of these 65 cases showed that Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent causative agent, and the lumbar region was the most frequent localization of the spinal subdural abscess. The most frequent age is between 60 and 70 years. It is a very uncommon localized central nervous system infection.

Most patients with spinal subdural abscess have one or more predisposing conditions, such as an underlying disease which diminishes the resistance of the patient to infection (diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, tumors, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus) or anatomical abnormalities of the spinal cord or vertebral column.

### Updates on the causes, diagnosis, and management of peritoneal abscesses: A systematic review [^116ZnbaQ]. Cureus (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intra-abdominal abscess:

- **Definition**: Intra-abdominal abscesses are localized collections of pus within the abdominal cavity, often resulting from an intra-abdominal infection or a perforation of the gastrointestinal tract.

- **Pathophysiology**: Intra-abdominal abscesses commonly occur as complications of intra-abdominal infections such as diverticulitis (diverticular abscess), appendicitis (periappendiceal abscess), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pelvic inflammatory disease (tubo-ovarian abscess), or following abdominal surgery, gastrointestinal tract perforation, or penetrating abdominal trauma. Abscesses confined to single organs or structures can also occur, such as in the liver (pyogenic or amebic), spleen, subphrenic area, or psoas muscle.

- **Disease course**: Intra-abdominal abscesses often present with abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. A palpable abdominal mass, peritoneal findings, ileus, and anorexia may also be present.

### A rare presentation of Brodie abscess in the clavicle [^114WmJzJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for most osteomyelitis cases. Other common pathogens include coagulase-negative staphylococcus, beta hemolytic streptococcus, enterococci, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Salmonella species should be considered in patients with sickle cell disease. Treatment of acute or subacute osteomyelitis is tailored to the sensitivities of the offending pathogen. There is no consensus regarding the guidelines for the duration of antibiotic therapy. Some recommend courses of parenteral antibiotics for greater than 7 days, followed by oral antibiotics, whereas others advocate expedited transition from parenteral antibiotics. In a review of cohort studies, Le Saux et al. reported that children treated with 7 days or less of parenteral antibiotics had cure rates surpassing 90%. The duration of parenteral medication is dependent on patient improvement because more resistant pathogens may require prolonged therapy. After administration of parenteral antimicrobials, individualized oral therapy is recommended for 4 to 6 weeks.

A high index of suspicion is required because patients presenting with subacute hematogenous osteomyelitis may have subtle clinical features. To reduce the incidence of serious sequelae, a swift diagnosis and initiation of treatment is necessary.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococci release a purine analog that inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence [^117WXihJ]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals and conceivably compete for space and nutrients. Here, we report that a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus chromogenes ATCC43764, synthesizes and secretes 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a purine analog that suppresses S. aureus growth by inhibiting de novo purine biosynthesis.

We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius, and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harboring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production.

RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates the expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr), and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.

### Pathogenesis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^113m9Pdf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen capable of causing a wide range of human diseases. However, the role of different virulence factors in the development of staphylococcal infections remains incompletely understood. Some clonal types are well equipped to cause disease globally, whereas others are facile at causing disease among community members. In this review, general aspects of staphylococcal pathogenesis are addressed, with emphasis on methicillin-resistant strains. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are not necessarily more virulent than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains, some MRSA strains contain factors or genetic backgrounds that may enhance their virulence or may enable them to cause particular clinical syndromes. We examine these pathogenic factors.

### Pulmonary valve infective endocarditis caused by Mycobacterium abscessus [^116B1etg]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Most infective endocarditis affects the left heart, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism. Right-sided heart endocarditis is much less common, usually involving the tricuspid valve when it occurs. Pulmonary valve endocarditis is even rarer, accounting for less than 2% of all infective endocarditis cases. Risk factors for the disease include intravenous drug use, central venous catheters, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and degenerative valve lesions. Patients with prosthetic valves and a history of endocarditis experience a 400-fold increased risk.

In a retrospective study of 24 patients with pulmonary valve endocarditis, most had received prosthetic mechanical, autograft, or homograft valves. Mycobacterium abscessus is a non-tuberculous, rapidly growing mycobacterium species known for its exceptional drug resistance. It commonly infects indwelling medical devices such as catheters and prosthetic valves, although it is an uncommon agent of endocarditis.

Through a literature search using PubMed/Medline, we identified 20 cases of infective endocarditis caused by Mycobacterium abscessus. This includes a review article summarizing ten cases published on or before 2008 and another ten sporadic cases published after 2008. Among these, eight (40%) involved prosthetic valve infections. The in-hospital mortality associated with endocarditis caused by Mycobacterium abscessus was very high (n = 12, 60%), despite surgery and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Notably, only one case (5%) involved the pulmonary valve.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis vertebral osteomyelitis [^116ehd7K]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

We report a case of vertebral osteomyelitis due to the coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis. This is only the second such case reported in the literature in an immunocompetent host. When the patient's lumbar spine inflammatory mass was drained, the coagulase-negative staphylococcus obtained was discarded as a likely contaminant.

We discuss the situation when coagulase-negative staphylococci require further identification and examine the unique features of S. lugdunensis. Isolation of S. lugdunensis is usually significant, and the organism should not be discarded as a contaminant without careful consideration.

### The global burden of hospitalisation due to pneumonia caused by in the under-5 years children: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111W9zRx]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is known to be a common cause of complicated pneumonia in the paediatric population, which can lead to specific radiological patterns like cavitations, abscesses, and parapneumonic effusions. Although radiological evidence is not sufficient to determine the aetiology of pneumonia, such radiological features can help suggest the aetiology. This is particularly important considering the poor yield of microbiological methods and lack of resources in low-resource settings. Radiological evidence may, thus, be used to prioritise or select cases for microbiological testing, as demonstrated by Camacho et al.

The increasing availability of post-mortem data from child mortality studies is helping us better understand the complex interplay of pathogens and syndromes leading to death. One example is the provision of structured descriptions of the cause of death at sentinel sites in Asia and Africa as part of the CHAMPS network, which identifies the specific role of respiratory pathogens in causing death. We have excluded such studies or reports from our systematic review because these studies do not include a consecutive sample of all pneumonia cases reported to the health facilities involved in the study and focus on a very specific population (children who have died). However, future research is likely to benefit from the inclusion of such data.

Blood samples were the most widely tested in included studies. Previous studies suggest that the sample volume of blood in childhood pneumonia is typically low, and this affects testing efficacy.

### Pathogenic conversion of coagulase-negative staphylococci [^115x44FR]. Microbes and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Humans and animals are colonized by members of the genus *Staphylococcus*; however, only some of these species evolved to cause invasive diseases. The genetic basis for the conversion of commensal staphylococci into pathogens is not known. We hypothesized that *Staphylococcus aureus* genes for coagulation and agglutination in vertebrate blood (*coa, vwb*, and *clfA*) may support pathogenic conversion. Expression of *coa* and *vwb* in *Staphylococcus epidermidis* or *Staphylococcus simulans* supported a coagulase-positive phenotype but not the ability to cause disease in a mouse model of bloodstream infection. However, the simultaneous expression of *coa, vwb*, and *clfA* in coagulase-negative staphylococci enabled bacterial agglutination in plasma and enhanced survival of *S. simulans* in human whole blood. Agglutination of *S. simulans* in the bloodstream of infected mice upon expression of *coa, vwb*, and *clfA* also provided a means for dissemination and replication in distal organs. Thus, the acquisition of genes for bacterial agglutination with fibrin appears sufficient for the conversion of commensal staphylococci into invasive pathogens.

### Clinical and microbiological properties of Staphylococcus lugdunensis skin infections [^114426LS]. The Journal of dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is an emerging pathogen in skin and soft tissue infections that was previously considered a commensal. The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of skin infections by S. lugdunensis and its appropriate management, in a tertiary referral medical center. The clinical files, bacterial cultures and histopathology reports of all S. lugdunensis isolates from skin infections over a period of 8 years (September 2009-September 2017) were reviewed. S. lugdunensis was isolated from 29 patients with skin infections, aged 7–89 years (mean 33.3 years). A state of immune suppression (drug-induced, malignancy or diabetes) was present in five patients (17%). Folliculitis and cutaneous pustulosis were the most common presentations (16 cases, 55%), followed by secondary infection of hidradenitis suppurativa (five cases, 17%). Other sources of isolation were infected molluscum contagiosum (two cases), folliculitis decalvans (one case), dissecting cellulitis (one case), abscess (one case), cyst (one case), impetigo (one case) and granuloma after trauma (one case). The in vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed susceptibility to most tested antibiotics, although a few isolates were resistant to gentamycin, penicillin and oxacillin. In 19 of 20 patients for whom follow ups were available, cutaneous manifestations improved or resolved with proper local and/or oral antibiotic therapy. S. lugdunensis may play a role as a primary or secondary pathogen in various skin infections, most commonly folliculitis and pustulosis. Proper antibiotic therapy may lead

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^112RrLj2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Sheep blood agar plates (A–E) and magnified sectors (a–e) after overnight incubation at 37°C show different morphotypes of clonal isolates of the Staphylococcus lugdunensis strain recovered from blood cultures and the infected pocket of a patient with pacemaker infection. Plates A–D/a–d exhibit S. lugdunensis colonies with a normal phenotype characterized by colonies of various diameters, ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 mm, with creamy (A/a) or yellow (B–D/b–d) pigmentation and moderately heavy (B/b), weak (C–D/c–d), or absent (A/a) hemolysis. Plate E/e displays the small-colony variant phenotype characterized by tiny (pinpoint), nonpigmented, and nonhemolytic colonies.

Four months later, in July 2003, the patient presented at the local hospital with high fever and chills, a leukocyte count of 12,200/μL, and a CRP value of 37 mg/L, but showed no peripheral signs of endocarditis. Four sets of blood cultures drawn on admission revealed S. lugdunensis. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed large vegetations in the right atrium inserting at the ventricular lead but no involvement of cardiac valves. The patient responded promptly to the initiation of antimicrobial drug therapy with intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin, becoming afebrile. He was then transferred to our cardiothoracic surgery department for pacemaker ablation.

Four days later, the complete pacemaker system, including the intracardiac leads, was removed by open heart surgery. The cardiac valves did not show signs of infective endocarditis, but large vegetations adhered to both the atrial.

To evaluate the incidence and the clinical and echocardiographic features of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis and to identify the prognostic factors of surgery and mortality in this disease, a prospective cohort study was conducted in two centers: a tertiary care center and a community hospital.

- **Patients**: The study included 10 patients with IE caused by S. lugdunensis out of 912 consecutive patients with IE between 1990 and 2003.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary team for diagnosis and treatment of IE carried out a prospective study of consecutive patients from the study institutions. The team searched English, French, and Spanish literature by computer under the terms "endocarditis" and "Staphylococcus lugdunensis", covering publications from 1989 to December 2003.

- **Main Outcome Measures**: The study focused on patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, required surgery, and prognostic factors of mortality in left-sided cases of IE.

- **Results**: 10 cases of IE caused by S. lugdunensis were identified at our institutions. These represented 0.8% (four of 467), 1.5% (two of 135), and 7.8% (four of 51) of cases of native valve, prosthetic valve, and pacemaker lead endocarditis in the non-drug misusers. Native valve IE was present in four patients (two aortic, one mitral, and one pulmonary), prosthetic valve aortic IE in two patients, and pacemaker lead IE in four patients. All patients with left-sided IE experienced serious complications such as heart failure, periannular abscess formation, or shock, necessitating surgery in 60% (three of five patients) of these cases, with an overall mortality rate.

### Diagnosis and management of prosthetic joint infection: Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116Un3A2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of prosthetic joint infection, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy following debridement in cases of staphylococcal PJI, the IDSA 2013 guidelines recommend completing 2–6 weeks of pathogen-specific intravenous antimicrobial therapy in combination with rifampin (300–450 mg PO BID) for patients with staphylococcal prosthetic-joint infection undergoing debridement, followed by:

- **Rifampin plus a companion oral drug for a total of 3 months**: This applies to total hip arthroplasty infections.

- **Rifampin plus a companion oral drug for a total of 6 months**: This is recommended for total knee arthroplasty infections.

### Clinical features, outcomes, and molecular characteristics of community- and health care-associated Staphylococcus lugdunensis infections [^1158pb9b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a major cause of aggressive endocarditis, but it is also responsible for a broad spectrum of infections. The differences in clinical and molecular characteristics between community-associated (CA) and health care-associated (HA) S. lugdunensis infections have remained unclear. We performed a retrospective study of S. lugdunensis infections between 2003 and 2014 to compare the clinical and molecular characteristics of CA and HA isolates.

We collected 129 S. lugdunensis isolates in total: 81 (62.8%) HA isolates and 48 (37.2%) CA isolates. HA infections were more frequent than CA infections in children (16.0% versus 4.2%, respectively; P = 0.041) and the elderly (38.3% versus 14.6%, respectively; P = 0.004). The CA isolates were more likely to cause skin and soft tissue infections (85.4% versus 19.8%, respectively; P < 0.001). HA isolates were more frequently responsible for bacteremia of unknown origin (34.6% versus 4.2%, respectively; P < 0.001) and for catheter-related bacteremia (12.3% versus 0%, respectively; P = 0.011) than CA isolates.

The 14-day mortality was higher for HA infections than for CA infections (11.1% versus 0%, respectively). A higher proportion of the HA isolates than of the CA isolates were resistant to penicillin (76.5% versus 52.1%, respectively; P = 0.004) and oxacillin (32.1% versus 2.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). Two major clonal complexes (CC1 and CC3) were identified. Sequence type 41 (ST41) was the most common sequence type identified (29.5%). The proportion of ST38 isolates was higher for HA than for CA infections.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococci release a purine analog that inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence [^113MrfrQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to severe life-threatening diseases such as endocarditis and pneumonia. The enormous health burden caused by S. aureus is, in part, attributed to its ability to acquire resistance against several classes of antibiotics, making it refractory to many treatment options. Moreover, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) can infect both healthy and immunocompromised populations in the community and hospital settings. Due to the emergence of MRSA, drug discovery is critically important for combating S. aureus infections.

To identify compounds that antagonize S. aureus, several groups have focused on coagulase-negative staphylococcal species (CoNS), as many of these species often colonize the same niches as S. aureus and likely compete for space and nutrients. CoNS have been shown to secrete antimicrobials that directly kill S. aureus, which helps them successfully compete with S. aureus. Strains of S. epidermidis and S. hominis species, among others, have been reported to secrete posttranslationally modified peptides termed bacteriocins that inhibit S. aureus colonization on human skin. In addition, S. lugdunensis has recently been shown to produce a non-ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide antibiotic termed lugdunin that directly kills S. aureus. Moreover, lugdunin can stimulate host production of antimicrobial peptides and recruit immune cells to clear infections.

### Spinal subdural Staphylococcus aureus abscess: Case report and review of the literature [^113Q2pqg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

**Conclusion**: Spinal subdural abscess is a very rare but well-described entity associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is a neurosurgical emergency, and as soon as the diagnosis is established, surgical treatment in collaboration with antibiotic therapy should be performed. Progressive neurological deficits, severe pain, and fever suggest the diagnosis. The timing of the contrast-enhanced MRI, which is the modality of choice, is very important when physicians notice the above symptoms. Staphylococcus aureus should be considered the most likely pathogen.

### Staphylococcus lugdunensis pacemaker-related infection [^114SVnuT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The refusal of the patient to have the pacemaker removed contributed to the chronic course of the infection. Although these variants were not identified until the removal of the device, the clinical importance of small colony variants (SCVs) for this persistent infection can be anticipated. Clinical isolates are often a mixed population of parent strains and SCVs. Due to their different generation times, even a small percentage of normally growing organisms may rapidly replace SCVs in liquid medium, such as a blood culture, during overnight incubation. Consequently, SCVs may have gone undetected in previously obtained blood cultures. Increased awareness of colony variation and the possible occurrence of SCVs as a characteristic feature of Staphylococcus lugdunensis should be helpful in the earlier recognition of the pathogen and appropriate management of the infection.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for skin abscesses, particularly concerning the management of recurrent abscesses, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation for local causes. This includes assessing for conditions such as pilonidal cysts, hidradenitis suppurativa, and foreign material in patients with recurrent skin abscesses at sites of previous skin infections.

### Endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis [^1175aqB8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

We describe a case of native valve endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus lugdunensis, a perineal skin commensal, and review 28 other cases from the medical literature. Correctly identifying this coagulase-negative organism is critical because endocarditis is usually associated with left-sided valvular disruption and life-threatening embolic complications reminiscent of disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Urgent surgical intervention is necessary in most cases.

### Isdc from Staphylococcus lugdunensis induces biofilm formation under low-iron growth conditions [^112XYCRz]. Infection and Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is a commensal of humans and an opportunistic pathogen. It can cause a spectrum of infections, including those associated with the ability to form biofilm, such as occurs with endocarditis or indwelling medical devices. The genome sequences of two strains revealed the presence of orthologues of the ica genes, responsible for the synthesis of poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), commonly associated with biofilm in other staphylococci.

However, we discovered that biofilm formed by a panel of S. lugdunensis isolates growing in iron-restricted medium was susceptible to degradation by proteases and not by metaperiodate, suggesting that the biofilm matrix comprised proteins and not PNAG. When the iron concentration was raised to 1 mM, biofilm formation by all strains tested was greatly reduced.

A mutant of strain N920143 lacking the entire locus that encodes iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins was defective in biofilm formation under iron-limited conditions. An IsdC-null mutant was defective, whereas IsdK, IsdJ, and IsdB mutants formed biofilm to the same level as the parental strain.

Expression of IsdC was required both for the primary attachment to unconditioned polystyrene and for the accumulation phase of biofilm involving cell-cell interactions. Purified recombinant IsdC protein formed dimers in solution, and Lactococcus lactis cells expressing only IsdC adhered to immobilized recombinant IsdC, but not to IsdJ, IsdK, or IsdB. This is consistent with a specific homophilic interaction.

Unbiased species-level identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identified Staphylococcus lugdunensis to be a more commonly isolated CoNS in our laboratory than previously observed. It has also highlighted the possibility of vertical transmission.
