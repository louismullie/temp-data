## Question

3-year-old girl with feeding-related respiratory distress and poor growth percentiles; echocardiography shows a membranous VSD and moderately decreased LVEF; asked to identify most likely physical exam finding.

A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?

Answer Choices:
A. Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching
B. Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis
C. Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap
D. Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which physical examination finding is most likely in a 3-year-old girl with a membranous ventricular septal defect, moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, feeding-related respiratory distress, and poor growth percentiles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of a membranous VSD and how it produces a murmur. Then, I should verify how left ventricular dysfunction modifies the murmur and the overall exam. Next, I will review the classic bedside maneuvers that change murmur intensity and decide which option matches a VSD. After that, I need to check each distractor against the expected findings for VSD and competing lesions. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely answer and confirm it aligns with authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the lesion and its hemodynamics. A membranous VSD is the most common type of VSD and creates a left-to-right shunt from the high-pressure left ventricle to the lower-pressure right ventricle, producing a holosystolic murmur that is typically maximal at the left lower sternal border and often accompanied by a palpable thrill when the shunt is significant, with the intensity reflecting the pressure gradient and shunt magnitude [^7341e92f] [^605b9569].

> Wait, let me verify how LV dysfunction alters the picture. Moderately decreased LVEF implies volume overload and increased left-sided filling pressures, which can amplify the left-to-right shunt and exacerbate heart failure symptoms such as feeding-related tachypnea and diaphoresis; this aligns with pediatric heart failure phenotypes where infants manifest dyspnea and sweating with feeds and growth failure due to heart failure physiology [^a34d0be2] [^51c17d02].

> I will now examine the murmur characteristics and bedside dynamics. A VSD murmur is holosystolic and blowing, often with a thrill, and its intensity is primarily determined by the size of the defect and the pressure gradient; maneuvers that increase systemic vascular resistance, such as handgrip or isometric exercise, will increase left-sided pressure and augment the shunt, thereby making the murmur louder, whereas maneuvers that decrease systemic resistance or increase right-sided pressure will blunt it [^605b9569].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review each option carefully. Option A proposes a systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching, which is essentially a handgrip maneuver that raises afterload and should intensify a left-to-right shunt murmur like a VSD; this fits the expected physiology and is the most consistent choice here [^605b9569]. Option B suggests a murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (Valsalva), which characteristically decreases venous return and afterload and would be expected to diminish a VSD murmur, not enhance it; this pattern is classic for outflow obstruction or mitral valve prolapse, not a shunt lesion [^notfound]. Option C describes a diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap, which is pathognomonic for mitral stenosis and not a feature of isolated VSD physiology [^notfound]. Option D describes a continuous murmur peaking at S2, which is classic for a patent ductus arteriosus rather than a VSD, so this would be a mismatch for the stated diagnosis [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if a continuous murmur could be confused with a large VSD, but that would be incorrect; a continuous murmur reflects flow throughout systole and diastole, as in PDA, whereas a VSD produces a purely systolic holosystolic murmur that ends at S2, so option D should be excluded [^notfound]. I should also double-check that the handgrip effect is indeed the correct differentiator here; yes, increasing afterload with handgrip augments left-to-right shunt and murmur intensity in VSD, reinforcing option A as the best answer [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and confirm. Given a hemodynamically significant membranous VSD with LV dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure, the most likely auscultatory finding is a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that intensifies with handgrip or hand clenching due to increased afterload and shunt, which corresponds to option A [^605b9569]. The other options either reflect maneuvers that would decrease a VSD murmur or describe murmurs of different lesions, making them less likely in this scenario [^notfound].

---

The most likely physical exam finding in a 3-year-old girl with a membranous VSD, moderately decreased LVEF, and feeding-related respiratory distress is a **holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border** [^605b9569] that increases with hand clenching [^notfound] (option A). This murmur reflects a left-to-right shunt across the VSD [^7341e92f], and hand clenching increases systemic vascular resistance, thereby augmenting the shunt and murmur intensity. The other options are incorrect: hand clenching does not increase murmur intensity in outflow obstruction (option B) [^notfound], a diastolic murmur with an opening snap indicates mitral stenosis (option C), and a continuous murmur loudest at S2 is characteristic of patent ductus arteriosus (option D) [^notfound].

## Pathophysiology of membranous ventricular septal defect

A membranous VSD is a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum, allowing **left-to-right shunting** of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle during systole [^7341e92f]. The magnitude of the shunt depends on the size of the defect and the relative resistances of the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds [^320939b5]. Large defects cause significant left-to-right shunting, leading to volume overload of the left ventricle, left atrial enlargement, and pulmonary congestion [^c046f088].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Children with large VSDs often present with:

- **Failure to thrive**: Poor growth due to increased caloric demands from the shunt and heart failure [^a34d0be2].
- **Respiratory distress**: Tachypnea, retractions, and feeding difficulties due to pulmonary congestion and heart failure [^51c17d02].
- **Recurrent respiratory infections**: Increased susceptibility due to pulmonary congestion [^289feeab].
- **Sweating and diaphoresis**: Especially during feeding, indicating heart failure [^51c17d02].

---

## Physical examination findings

On physical examination, the following findings are characteristic of a membranous VSD:

- **Holosystolic murmur**: A harsh, blowing holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border (LLSB), reflecting the left-to-right shunt across the defect [^605b9569].
- **Palpable thrill**: Often palpable at the LLSB due to the high-velocity jet across the defect.
- **Increased intensity with hand clenching**: Hand clenching increases systemic vascular resistance, thereby increasing the left-to-right shunt and intensifying the murmur [^notfound].
- **Loud P2**: Pulmonary hypertension may cause a loud second heart sound (P2) [^notfound].
- **Signs of heart failure**: Hepatomegaly, tachypnea, and peripheral edema may be present [^cd7cafe6].

## Explanation of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Relevance to vsd** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching | Correct. Hand clenching increases systemic vascular resistance, augmenting the left-to-right shunt and intensifying the murmur [^notfound]. |
| B | Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (Valsalva maneuver) | Incorrect. The Valsalva maneuver decreases venous return and preload, typically decreasing the intensity of VSD murmurs. This pattern is more characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or mitral valve prolapse [^notfound]. |
| C | Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap | Incorrect. This is characteristic of mitral stenosis, not VSD [^notfound]. |
| D | Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound | Incorrect. This is characteristic of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), not VSD [^notfound]. |

---

## Conclusion

The most likely physical examination finding in a 3-year-old girl with a membranous VSD, moderately decreased LVEF, and feeding-related respiratory distress is a **holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases with hand clenching** (option A). This murmur reflects the left-to-right shunt across the VSD, and hand clenching augments the shunt by increasing systemic vascular resistance, thereby intensifying the murmur [^notfound].

In 1918, a French study reported the clinical findings in a young boy whose murmur and thrill disappeared at 5 years of age, documenting from first record of SC of VSD. Here, we have reviewed reports on SC of VSD 1987 to 2015 from various countries, which have been detailed in Table 6. Reported closure rates vary from 6 to 88.9% with size and location of VSD, age at presentation and patient population, and results from our study are consistent with previous reports. SC of VSD is most common during the first year of life, with the likelihood of SC decreasing during adolescent years and adult life. It has been reported that the SC rate of patients with VSD not receiving surgical closure during childhood was as low as 6%.

Single studies on spontaneous closure of ventricular septal defect

Congestive heart failure CHF

In line with many previous reports, perimembranous VSD was the most prevalent form of VSD, and muscular VSD had an obviously higher SC rate [,–,,,,]. However, the average diameter of muscular VSD was smaller than other types and none of the subjects required surgical intervention. The closure of muscular defects begins with septal muscle adherence, followed by obliteration of the defect by a fibrous tissue plug. In closure of membranous defects, the VSD is “covered” by tricuspid valve tissue, Nir also suggested that closure of membranous VSDs may begin in utero and the mechanism of closure was similar to that of postnatally.

Conclusion

In summary, birth weight and prenatal echocardiographic measurement of size and location of VSD enables the estimation of SC probability in individual patients. These data would be particularly informative for patients whose defect diameter indicates a high SC probability.

Introduction

Congenital heart disease(CHD) is one of the causes of neonatal mortality, with an incidence of approximately 4–13% of live births in China, and worldwide the total incidence of CHD in live births is 0.8–1.1%. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common form of CHD that refers to an incomplete development of the septal portion of the heart, resulting in an incomplete separation between the two chambers of the heart. Normally, the right and left chambers of the heart are separated by the ventricular septum, thus keeping oxygen-rich blood separate from oxygen-poor blood in circulation. However, VSD may cause these two types of blood to mix, thus affecting the normal functioning of the heart. According to statistics, the prevalence of VSD is about 20–57% of the CHD. Many studies have shown that the apical four-chamber cardiac view (4CH) and left ventricular outflow tract view (LVOT) are the most commonly used planes for prenatal screening for VSD. The schematic diagram of VSD and no-VSD in 4CH and LVOT is shown in Fig. 1. The width of the defect in VSD often ranges from 0.1 to 3.0 cm, with smaller defects located in the muscular portion and larger defects located in the membranous portion. In small defects, the heart size can be normal, but in large defects, the left ventricle is more obviously enlarged compared with the right ventricle. The large defects not only affect the development, but are also associated with difficulty in feeding, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, fatigue, respiratory difficulties, recurrent lung infections, or even accompanied heart failure and infective endocarditis, which can seriously affect the health of the fetus. VSD can exist alone or in conjunction with other cardiac anomalies such as atrial septal defects, arterial conduit failure, or as part of cardiac complex anomalies such as permanent arterial trunks, tetralogy of Fallot, and right ventricular double outlet. Due to the close association of this disease with changes in the internal diameter of the heart chambers and the size of the defects, if not intervened promptly, it will have a serious impact on the child’s growth and development. In addition, different fetuses with VSD have different types and locations of defects, and there are obvious differences in the choice of clinical treatment timing and prognosis assessment. Therefore, for a fetus with VSD during pregnancy, early detection helps identify changes in the defect promptly, clarify the potential for self-healing, and ensure timely, effective interventions. This benefits both maternal and fetal health, significantly improving prognosis and holding great clinical significance.

Six patients (2.4%) had moderate/severe Echo findings of immediate clinical significance, and 20 patients (8%) had mild findings of potential clinical hemodynamic contribution as assessed by a senior cardiologist and requiring follow‐up (Table 1a & b).

Table 1 
Echo findings and follow‐Up.

Additional information about the six patients (2.4%) with moderate/severe Echo findings:
o A patient with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) + patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) + atrial septal defect (ASD) that required surgical intervention during the bronchiolitis hospitalization. Later diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome.
o A patient with congenital diaphragmatic hernia + ASD. This patient had a suspected small lung cyst on prenatal ultrasound. She was born asymptomatic with a normal chest X‐ray on her first day of life. She was readmitted at 23 days of age due to new onset of dyspnea, tachypnea, and feeding difficulty, and was diagnosed as suspected bronchiolitis in the emergency room. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sepsis workup were normal; an Echo assessment was requested immediately, which surprisingly revealed abdominal contents in the thorax confirmed by chest X‐ray. An ASD was also diagnosed. In this case, late displacement of abdominal contents due to undiagnosed diaphragmatic hernia was the final diagnosis.
o A patient with a large PDA closed via catheterization one month after the bronchiolitis admission.
o A patient with left ventricular dysfunction. This patient was a 35 + 4‐weeks of gestation preterm neonate, admitted at 5 weeks of age due to dyspnea, cough and vomiting, and was diagnosed with bronchiolitis with negative viral PCR. Three days after admission, he had a clinical deterioration with cyanosis and low blood pressure and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Echo assessment revealed poor myocardial function. He was put on an extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device but later passed away. The final diagnosis was cardiomyopathy.
o A patient with dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced left ventricular function, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Continued cardiological follow‐up until passing away at the age of 13 years old.
o A patient with coarctation of the aorta and mild pulmonic stenosis (PS). Lost to follow‐up at the age of six months.

### Uncommon clinical presentation of cystic fibrosis in a patient homozygous for a rare CFTR mutation: a case report [^b62a46f7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We present the case of a one-year-old patient of Polish origin, who was referred to our Clinic at the age of 4 months (timeline – Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Timeline (legend: CF - cystic fibrosis, VSD – ventricular septal defect, URTI – upper respiratory tract infection, LRTI – lower respiratory tract infection)

The boy was born prematurely (35 weeks of gestation) from a pregnancy complicated by maternal pneumonia, hypothyroidism and cervical insufficiency. In the neonatal period, the child was treated with phototherapy due to jaundice and diagnosed with ventricular septal defect. Family history was positive for allergy (older brother) and celiac disease (uncle). He was hospitalised for the first time due to an upper respiratory tract infection in the second month of life. Further hospitalisation was necessary 2 weeks later due to poor weight gain, intense regurgitation and vomiting. The physical examination revealed: a poor general condition and general nutrition status, pale skin, peripheral oedema, signs of mild dehydration, a systolic murmur and an umbilical hernia. Abnormal laboratory findings included: anaemia (red cell concentrate transfusion was needed), hypoproteinemia, elevated conjugated bilirubin, GGTP, lactate and ammonia, and decreased alpha-1-antitrypsin level (Table 2). Newborn screening was positive for cystic fibrosis (IRT over 99.4th percentile). However, sweat test results (conductivity) were equivocal – of the 4 outcomes, one was positive and three proved negative (Table 2), and the first genetic examination excluded 700 mutations. The abdomen ultrasound examination did not reveal any abnormalities, while the radiographic barium studies showed gastroesophageal reflux and excluded congenital anomalies of the digestive tract. Cranial sonography was negative. Due to insufficient oral food administration, the boy was fed through a nasogastric tube. Because of the symptoms of bronchitis, antibiotic and aerosol therapy were introduced. The child was then referred to a tertiary children’s hospital with the suspicion of metabolic disease.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) clinical examination—VSD is characterized clinically by a systolic murmur usually maximal at the left lower sternal border; when RV pressure is low the murmur is blowing and pansystolic; with incremental increases in RV pressure, the murmur is shorter, softer, and lower pitched; and small, muscular VSDs are very high-pitched and occupy early systole only because muscular contraction closes the defect.

The diagnosis of weight faltering can be challenging and often controversial. The determination should be made based on careful evaluation of growth parameters, including longitudinal patterns plotted on age- and gender-appropriate growth charts. For children with suspected or diagnosed weight faltering, the initial work-up should be limited, with laboratory tests and studies directed by findings on history and physical examination. Treatment should include nutritional counselling, familial support, and close outpatient follow-up. Hospitalisation may be useful in some cases but should not be used routinely to assist in the diagnostic work-up. Patients with limited response to these interventions may require further evaluation.

Identical cardiac lesions with divergent physiology in a monozygous/diamniotic pregnancy

Robert Petersen 1, Beth Price 2, Chetena Reddy 1

1 St. Louis University, St. Louis, USA. 2 SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital, St. Louis, USA

Abstract

Introduction: This case study reviews a monozygous/diamniotic pregnancy resulting in twins with identical cardiac lesions with divergent physiology.

Case Presentation: Fetal care Institute patient with pregnancy complications including monozygous/diamniotic pregnancy, NIPT positive for Trisomy 21 in both twins, gestational diabetes, and growth restriction of Twin A. The fetal ECHO on both twins showed suspected Tetralogy of Fallot and with arch hypoplasia in Twin A. They were born at 30 weeks of gestation due to preterm labor. Postnatal Trisomy 21 was confirmed on both twins. Postnatal echocardiogram for Twin A showed a moderate perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) (3.7 mm) with bidirectional flow, small-to-moderate PDA with bidirectional shunting, mostly left to right. Patent foramen ovale with left-to-right flow. No left heart enlargement. Mild tricuspid regurgitation, estimated RVSP 52 mmHg + RAp. Normal biventricular systolic function. The findings on twin B after delivery found moderate perimembranous VSD (3.5 mm) with bidirectional flow, mostly left to right, partially covered by tricuspid valve tissue. Moderate PDA with bidirectional shunting, mostly left to right. Patent foramen ovale with mostly left-to-right flow. No left heart enlargement. Mild tricuspid regurgitation, with estimated RVSP 54 mmHg + RAp. Normal biventricular systolic function. Both spent 3 months in the NICU due to feeding difficulties resulting in a G-tube placement and respiratory failure. Both required Lasix while in the NICU for clinical signs of pulmonary overcirculation. Both failed weaning from respiratory support and were sent home on 1/8L nasal cannula. At their first outpatient clinic visit, both had low velocity flow across their VSD and a soft murmur on exam concerning for elevated right heart pressures. Prior to undergoing repair, both underwent a cardiac catheterization. The catheterization findings on Twin A showed a moderate perimembranous VSD, moderate secundum ASD, mildly elevated RVEDP (11 mmHg), elevated PA pressure (40–42 mmHg), normal PVR (1.92 iWU), upper normal LVEDP (10 mmHg), Qp:Qs = 4.25:1. The findings on Twin B showed a large perimembranous VSD with baseline Qp:Qs 2.27:1, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance at baseline 5.7 Woods units × m 2, pulmonary vasodilator testing with iNO 40 ppm and FiO 2 60% demonstrated improvement in PVR to high normal level 2.7 iWU and decreased cardiac output 2.4 L/min/m2. Based on the information found during the catheterization twin A underwent surgical closure of VSD, closure of ASD, and ligation of the PDA. Based on the information found during the cardiac catheterization, Twin B was started on Tadalafil prior to repair. Twin B underwent closure of an ASD and VSD and ligation of PDA. The post-operative course for both twins was uncomplicated.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^8876ad89]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Persistent ductus arteriosus constituted a special category as it is part of the fetal circulation and, therefore, represents a normal finding on foetal echocardiography. As postnatally, it can be a part of various complex defects, we have included it into the separate category only if present in an isolated form. This class was associated with the highest occurrence of circulatory instability. This, however, was influenced by the immaturity of neonates and neonatological complications. Still, it is, at present, not possible to accurately predict the development of circulatory instability in infants with persistent ductus arteriosus. In other CHDs, circulatory collapse was less common that in persistent ductus arteriosus, and the defects were detected according to clinical signs before severe alteration of circulation. This may indicate the quality of paediatric care in the monitored region. The clinical course of a child with CHD and beginning heart failure may imitate respiratory diseases, particularly dyspnoea and cough. Other possible symptoms of CHD are poor feeding and failure to thrive. These were rare symptoms in our patients, and were most commonly found in children with aortic and aortic arch defects. Sometimes stigmatisation and suspected genetic abnormality indicated cardiological examination of the child. This was evident in atrioventricular septal defects, which were in a quarter of cases associated with a genetic impairment, especially trisomy 21. Surprisingly, coarctation of the aorta was rarely detected by examination of femoral artery pulsation in the study region. This examination is a screening test and the gold standard for the clinical detection of this defect. This should improve with better education of paediatricians and a more focused attention during preventive examinations throughout childhood.

The main strength of the present study was the long-term follow-up in a region with a stable birth rate. The limitation of the study is the possible missing data on some cases – for example, the prenatally undetected defect may have not been registered in the event of the newborn’s death immediately after delivery in the regional hospital.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^3ecfe8a9]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)–associated pulmonary hypertension (PH)—screening with echocardiography is advised as follows: We recommend early echocardiograms for the diagnosis of PH in preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome who require high levels of ventilator support and supplemental oxygen, and infants with more severe prematurity (<26 weeks) are at highest risk for late PH. In established BPD, preterm infants at a corrected age of 36 weeks still requiring positive-pressure ventilation support, not weaning consistently from oxygen, having oxygen needs disproportionate to lung disease, or recurrent cyanotic episodes warrant screening; other markers include feeding dysfunction, poor growth, recurrent hospitalizations, and elevated Paco2, and high Paco2 is an indication for PH screening. Another strategy would be to screen every patient at 36 weeks of age with moderate or severe BPD, though the frequency of missed PH in milder BPD is uncertain. Serial electrocardiograms may be inadequate; as a result, we recommend echocardiograms to screen for PH in patients with BPD, with serial studies performed at 4- to 6-month intervals depending on clinical course and PH management changes.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) in adults—management of small restrictive defects indicates that small restrictive defects of the muscular or membranous septum may be managed by observation without need for operative intervention, but 6% of patients with small supracristal (subaortic) or perimembranous defects may develop aortic valve prolapse with progressive aortic regurgitation; at the time of VSD closure, aortic valve repair may be performed and, for patients who meet GDMT criteria for aortic valve replacement, this may be performed concomitant with VSD closure.

### Preoperative malnutrition increases risk of in-hospital mortality, major infection, and longer intensive care unit stay after ventricular septal defect closure [^cba81876]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High energy requirements and poor feeding can lead to growth failure in patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD), but effects of preoperative malnutrition on surgical outcomes are poorly understood, especially in low-resource settings.

Methods and Results

We analyzed a cohort of children <5years of age undergoing VSD closure at 60 global centers participating in the International Quality Improvement Collaborative for Congenital Heart Disease, 2015 to 2020. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital death and major infection and adjusted coefficients for duration of intensive care unit stay for 4 measures of malnutrition: severe wasting (weight-for-height Z score, <-3), moderate wasting (-3<weight-for-height Z score≤-2), underweight (weight-for-age Z score, ≤-2), and stunting (height-for-age Z score, ≤-2) according to World Health Organization Child Growth Standards. Among 10966 children undergoing VSD closure in the analyzed cohort, 8136 (74%) were membranous VSDs. Median age was 9.6months (interquartile range, 3.6-12.0), and 4088 (37.3%) had wasting/severe wasting, 5029 (45.9%) had underweight, and 3515 (32.1%) had stunting. There were 4749 (43.3%) children who met the criteria for ≥2 malnutrition categories. Overall, 84 patients (0.8%) died in-hospital, and 199 (1.8%) had major infection. Severe wasting (OR, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.55-7.35]; P =0.002), underweight (OR, 6.46 [95% CI, 2.81-14.8]; P <0.001), and stunting (OR, 2.73 [95% CI, 1.40-5.34]; P =0.003) were independent predictors of mortality. Similar results were observed for infection and duration of intensive care unit stay. Underweight was the strongest predictor of adverse outcomes. Children meeting criteria for all 3 (stunting, wasting, and underweight) had 17.2 times higher odds of mortality ( P <0.001) than nonmalnourished children.

Conclusions

Malnutrition was associated with mortality, infection, and longer intensive care unit stay in a global cohort of children undergoing VSD closure.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic: examination in children and all patients with congenital heart disease: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^b01d2596]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair—transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guides intraoperative assessment across multiple views and defect-size thresholds: “Preoperatively, the focus is on confirmation of the anatomic findings including type, number, size, shunt direction, and assessment of adjacent structures,” and “Assessment for a residual VSD should always occur in more than one view and the decision to return to bypass should take into account several factors, including associated aortic regurgitation, outflow tract obstruction, and hemodynamic significance.” Size-based guidance states “Most residual VSDs ≤ 2 mm will spontaneously resolve,” “Residual VSDs ≤ 3 mm are typically not hemodynamically significant and some will spontaneously resolve,” and “Residual VSDs measuring 3 to 4 mm require careful analysis including measurement of Qp:Qs by echocardiographic or blood oxygen saturation analysis to better determine need of return to bypass.” When shunt or size criteria are met, “A Qp:Qs of > 1.5:1 or a residual VSD ≥ 4 mm should have an additional attempt(s) at closure in most cases.”

### Increase in diameter of ventricular septal defect and membranous septal aneurysm formation during the infantile period [^a204dc22]. Pediatric Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Serial changes in diameters of ventricular septal defect (VSD), and in the formation patterns of membranous septal aneurysm (MSA), were evaluated using two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography during the infantile period. We studied 65 patients with VSD, who were classified into three groups by clinical feature. The patients with severe respiratory symptoms and significant failure to thrive were classified as group A (n = 15). The patients with no respiratory symptoms and mild or moderate failure to thrive were classified as group B (n = 38). Group C had no or trivial clinical symptoms and no need for surgical repair (n = 12). Group A showed rapid enlargement of VSD during early infancy. In this group, the mean diameter of VSD at age 5 months was 75% larger than the mean diameter at age 1 month (an increase of 5.5 to 9.6 mm; p<0.05). The other two groups (B, C) showed a slower enlargement as compared with group A. The rapid enlargement of VSD in group A seemed to induce the rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow with severe clinical symptoms. We suggest that careful observation of the changes in VSD diameters by periodic echocardiography is important in predicting the clinical course and in deciding the operation indication.

### Percutaneous ventricular septal defect closure in patients under 1 year of age [^c28f0a1f]. Pediatric Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Untreated ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an important cause of congestive heart failure in early infancy. Growth is impaired in this population, and surgical closure is challenging because of congestion in the lungs, making infants prone to respiratory infection, and because of their poor nutritional status. The aim of this study is to share our experience with percutaneous VSD closure in patients under 1 year of age. Patients with hemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt, less than 1 year of age, and with VSD diameter≤6 mm were retrospectively included in the study between December 2014 and January 2017. The median length of follow-up was 8.5 (4-14.2) months. Twelve patients from 2 to 12 months of age, with a median weight of 6.75 (5.4-8) kg, were included. The mean VSD diameter as measured by angiography from the left ventricle side was 4.7±0.25 mm, and from the right ventricle side was 3.4±1.1 mm. All were of a perimembranous type except three, which were muscular. All defects were closed with the Amplatzer Duct Occluder II (ADO II) or the ADO II-additional size. The mean fluoroscopy duration and total radiation dose were 22.6±18.7 min and 1674±851 cGy/min, respectively. No aortic regurgitation associated with device closure was seen in any of the patients. Complete atrioventricular block occurred in one patient 6 months after the procedure, and was treated with a permanent pacemaker. VSD closure is challenging, regardless of whether a surgical or percutaneous procedure is used. The risks are higher for children younger than 1 year with low body weight. Percutaneous closure, which carries similar risks but is less invasive than surgery, may be the preferred alternative in early infancy.

### Unusual hemodynamic changes in an infant with a restrictive ventricular septal defect [^7b1ea97e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

A 7-month-old asymptomatic infant was known to have a restrictive membranous ventricular septal defect partially closed by an aneurysm of the membranous septum. At 13 months of age, he developed unexpected pulmonary hypertension, with no clinical sign of cardiac failure. Cardiac catheterization assessed the pulmonary artery pressure at a systemic level with significant left-to-right shunt. After surgical closure, the pulmonary arterial pressure decreased by 50%. We suspect an enlargement of the ventricular septal defect caused by the rupture of the aneurysm of the membranous septum-a rare complication.

Case presentation

The proband was a 4-month-old female born to a 29-year-old father and a 27-year-old mother via vaginal delivery at 38 gestational weeks. During pregnancy, no specific problems were identified. The patient was hospitalized in a local hospital for 7 days after birth for “respiratory distress syndrome”. She was found to have slow weight gain since birth, with a birth weight of 2.5 kg and a current weight of 3.5 kg, accompanied by poor feeding, dry vomiting, minor crying, and bruised lips while crying. In order to seek further medical treatment, the patient was admitted to Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University (Zhengzhou, China) at 4-months-old for “malnutrition”. Since the onset of the disease, the patient had poor mental response, poor appetite, and slightly dilute stool. The examination showed a stunted development, malnutrition, and thin subcutaneous fat. There were peculiar facial features including wide eye spacing, small jaw, high palatal arch, left eyelid ptosis, hawkish nose and low ear position. The left thumb was attached on top of the palm, and the little fingers on both hands were flexed and deformed. The breath sounds of both lungs were coarse and a grade 3/6 murmur could be heard in the precordial region. Congenital heart disease was suspected. This diagnosis was followed by transthoracic atrial septal defect closure and arterial catheterization for treatment.

### Major heart defects: the diagnostic evaluations of first-year-olds [^a3238687]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most frequently observed congenital defects in the human population, representing up to 40% of all congenital malformations. The incidence of CHD varies from 4 to 50 cases per 1000 live births, but when minor ventricular septal defects are also included, the incidence rises to 75 cases per 1000 live births. The aetiology of CHDs is complex, with genetic and environmental factors known to play a part. Indeed, most defects likely have an underlying multifactorial aetiology. Approximately 20–25% of CHDs have a precise genetic cause. Most CHDs can be prenatally detected, and the overall success of prenatal CHD diagnoses has generally improved. Foetal echocardiography displays high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of major CHDs. However, some children are born with prenatally undetected CHDs that are diagnosed only after birth. Of the total number of CHDs, 35% are considered severe or critical, and these defects can be health- and life-threatening. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose these defects as soon as possible. Symptoms of heart disease may develop slowly or very rapidly and worsen in the maternity hospital or at home. In critical and severe CHDs, the most common symptom is the development of hypoxemia and heart failure. In other defects, the most common symptoms are pulmonary symptomatology, failure to thrive, or murmur. CHDs have an incidence of 2–75 per 1000 live births. Moreover, although the association between the first CHD manifestations and the different stages of childhood is less frequently studied, this information is very important for paediatricians.

Thus, the aim of this work was to identify clinical symptoms and determine the individual risk periods for CHD manifestation.

Materials

This investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by The Bioethical Commission of The Children’s Memorial Health Institute. Two patients with BTHS and seven fibroblast cultures of patients with SCO2 (Pronicki et al) and SURF1 (Pronicki et al) mutations were studied.

Patient 1

The boy was born at full term from a second pregnancy (there was a maternal history of a single miscarriage). His birth weight was 3.090 g, and his Apgar score after 5 min was a 10. During infancy, feeding difficulties, growth retardation (height 10th, weight corrected for height <3rd percentile) and delayed motor development were observed (he sat at 8 mo, stood at 13 mo and started to walk at 24 mo).

At the age of 14 months, after a respiratory infection, a cardiomyopathy occurred with severe heart failure (class IV according to modified Ross Heart Failure classification). After the treatment the patient's cardiac function progressively improved. Since the age of two years no symptoms or signs of heart failure have been found. ECG was without signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Slight cardiomegaly was observed in roentgenogram. In echocardiography the dimensions of left atrium and left ventricle diminished, the diameter of left atrium was within normal limits and the left ventricular diameter was on the upper border. The left ventricular contractility markedly improved, SF was 30 %, EF 58 % (modified Simpson formula), and the moderate mitral regurgitation was recorded. The ejection fraction reached about 64 % at the age of 3.5 - 4 years and the treatment with digoxin was stopped. In the next six following months further reduction of the left ventricular dimensions was observed and spironolacton was withdrawn.

Physical development has been delayed, always with weight below the 3rd percentile.

Now, at the age of 9, the patient is asymptomatic, treated only with captopril, and systematically followed by paediatric cardiologists and metabolic paediatricians.

Subject 6, younger brother of subject 5, presented at 13 months of age with bronchiolitis, requiring admission to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). He was diagnosed with DCM and 3-MGCA was identified. Following the findings in his brother, TAZ mutation analysis was performed and the c.118A > G mutation identified. His CM resolved quickly and by the age of 2 years all medication was stopped. He is now 11 years old, is well, has no learning problems and has normal cardiac function. He is active, joining in physical education with his peers, but suffers fatigue after these lessons. His height and weight are on the 2nd–9th centiles. He has had no episodes of neutropenia and no history of infections.

Subject 7 from a third unrelated family (Fig. 1c), presented to his local emergency department at 4 months of age with a 2-day history of poor feeding. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle (LV) with poor contractility. He became acidotic and unwell and was transferred to PICU at a specialist paediatric centre. Further echocardiogram suggested left ventricular non-compaction. A CM screen was normal apart from a slight increase in urine 3-MGCA. The screen included the finding of normal bloodspot CL 4. He was treated with diuretics, ACE inhibitors and a beta-blocker, resulting in improvement of LV function over the following year and an increase of fractional shortening from 5 to 35 %. His presentation was typical of other patients with BTHS seen by the clinical team so further investigations were pursued. Leukocyte MLCL/CL 4 was measured and found to be above the reference range, prompting TAZ mutation analysis which identified a previously reported pathogenic mutation in exon 7, c.553A > G (p.Met185Val). His LV function has improved from his initial presentation and is stable on ACE inhibitors, digoxin and a beta-blocker. At 2 years of age he is well and active; his motor skills are developing well. His height and weight are on the 2nd–9th centile. He has had no recorded neutropenia.

Delivery of care—care of patients in the lowest ACHD AP classification (IA): Possible solutions list “Face-to-face consultation with an ACHD cardiologist” and “Collaborative care planning between an ACHD patient’s general cardiologist or primary care provider and an ACHD cardiologist.” Rationale notes these patients “are likely to be asymptomatic and not require frequent routine congenital cardiac care,” that “available data suggest that patients with simple CHD have higher cardiac mortality in long-term follow-up than age-matched controls,” and that “Consultation with an ACHD cardiologist should help to accurately assess the patient’s ACHD AP class, provide information regarding potential long-term outcomes, and reinforce signs and symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.” The example states that “patients with small VSDs warrant lifelong follow-up.”

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)—postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) types—anatomic location and frequency report that Type 1 VSDs lie in the outflow portion of the right ventricle (RV) and account for approximately 6% of defects in non-Asian populations but up to 33% in Asian patients, with spontaneous closure uncommon. Type 2 or perimembranous VSDs are the most common defects, and almost 80% of defects are in this location. Type 3 or inlet VSDs occur in the lower part of the right ventricle and adjacent to the tricuspid valve. Type 4 or muscular VSDs can be multiple, have common spontaneous closure, and can account for up to 20% of VSDs in infants, with incidence much lower in adults.

### Echocardiographic features of a giant aneurysm of membranous ventricular septum [^993c880b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Aneurysm of Membranous Ventricular Septum is a less common form of septal disease. According to scholars, AMVS accounts for 0.3% of all congenital heart diseases and 19.1% of VSD. AMVS is formed in different periods from newborns to 6 years, but most often formed in the early stages of infancy. Onat et al. reported that spontaneous closure was strongly associated with AMVS formation, which is seen in 5% of adult patients.

AMVS is always a natural closure of the ventricular septal defect. VSD is subjected to high-pressure blood flow, resulting in endocardial fibroplasia around the VSD with irregular fibroplasia as well as adhesive fusion of the septal valve, the anterior septal valve junction, and some of the tendinous cords. Due to the hemodynamic changes, the morphology of the aneurysm is often altered.

### Unusual cause of dyspnoea: a case presentation of an echocardiographic pitfall [^19cb8e2d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The causes for new occurrence of dyspnoea are manifold. However, especially cardiologists are confronted with echocardiographic findings more and more often, which are not common in routine daily work – on the one hand due to the increasing age of the population and the associated increasingly recurring cardiac defects which often require surgery and on the other hand due to successfully remediated congenital cardiac defects originated in the early childhood with now normal expectancy of life.

We report the case of a patient who early after aortic valve replacement felt recurring dyspnoea and showed signs of cardiac decompensation.

### Ventricular septal defect [^7341e92f]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Ventricular septal defects account for up to 40% of all congenital cardiac malformations. The diagnosis encompasses a broad range of anomalies, including isolated defects and those associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. Presentation, symptoms, natural history, and management of ventricular septal defects depend on size and anatomical associations of the anomaly, patient's age, and local diagnostic and interventional expertise. In this Seminar, we describe the anatomical range of ventricular septal defects and discuss present management of these malformations. Genetic determinants, diagnostic techniques, physiological considerations, and management challenges are examined in detail. Unfortunately, in many circumstances, evidence on which to guide optimum management is scarce. We present some longer term considerations of ventricular septal defects in adolescents and adults, with particular emphasis on patients with raised pulmonary vascular resistance and Eisenmenger's syndrome.

### Development and validation of a novel score to predict adverse outcomes in paediatric congenital mitral regurgitation (PRIMARY): a multicentre cohort study [^dd74c23b]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Demographics and procedural results

During 2009–22, a total of 2640 patients (57% female) with a median age at surgery of 0.99 (IQR, 0.47–2.60) years were included (Fig. 1), among whom MR was graded moderate in 55.4% (n = 1463) and severe in 20.6% (n = 545) (Table 1). Clinically, 613 patients presented with feeding difficulties (23.2%), 961 failure to thrive (36.4%), and 637 with dyspnoea (24.1%), while thirty-five percent of the patients (n = 927) were asymptomatic at the initial surgery. Approximately, 90% of the patients with MR had coexisting cardiac lesions wherein isolated ventricular septal defect (n = 920; 34.8%) was the most prevalent, followed by AVSD (n = 610; 23.1%), isolated atrial septal defect (n = 590; 22.3%), and patent ductus arteriosus (n = 83; 3.1%). Of the 632 patients with mild MR, 449 (71%) had a diagnosis of AVSD. The presence of AVSD had a strong correlation with preoperative LA z score (r = 0.14, P < 0.001) and increased preoperative NT-proBNP (r = 0.75, P < 0.001). Of the 1358 patients, whose age was less than 1 year, 1186 had secondary MR and the majority (76.9%; 912/1186) had a combination with VSD, ASD, and/or PDA. Distribution of MR severity was similar between primary (moderate in 56.8%; severe in 21.6%) and non-primary MR (moderate in 53.9%; severe in 18.9%), while patients with primary MR tended to undergo the index MV surgery at older age (median age of 2.74 [IQR, 1.48–5.36] years vs. 0.97 [IQR, 0.45–2.50] years; P < 0.0001), had higher level of preoperative NT-proBNP (2.83 [IQR, 0.99–8.56] vs. 1.40 [IQR, 0.35–4.04] ng/mL; P = 0.018), and had longer cardiac care unit duration (6.0 [IQR, 4.0–8.3] vs. 3.0 [IQR, 2.0–6.0] days; P < 0.0001). The most prevalent MR aetiology was type-I lesion (Supplemental Figure S1). On average, the patients had a median LVEF of 63.6% (IQR, 60.5–67.7%; most were >50%) with a wide range of left heart enlargement (mean LVEDD z score 3.98, LVESD z score 2.94, and LA z score 2.56) preoperatively, and 1687 patients (63.9%) had mitral annulus dilation. Congestion-related biomarker, serum NT-proBNP concentration, was elevated in 2106 patients (79.8%), defined as the level >0.45 ng/ml.

### Noonan syndrome: improving recognition and diagnosis [^0e5cf599]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

In childhood

Monitoring of growth and developmental milestones from birth to mid-childhood (7 years) provides repeated opportunities for the identification of NS. The distinctive facial features of NS remain, and facial shape may become more triangular with age as the face lengthens (figure 3). In addition, children with NS may present with skeletal abnormalities (pectus carinatum/pectus excavatum and scoliosis),heart diseases (eg, pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy),abnormal bruising or bleeding,deafness, varying degrees of developmental delay/learning issues (eg, delayed speech or motor milestones)and short stature,whereas feeding difficulties/failure to thrive often resolve after the first years of life. In the case of short stature, children with NS often have normal birth measurements but usually show a decline in their growth curve during the first years of life, so the typical growth curve of infants and children with NS may provide a clue to the diagnosis.With regard to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in childhood, adolescence or adulthood, the finding of certain additional cardiac lesions (eg, mitral valve dysplasia, pulmonary stenosis) or particular cardiac phenotypes (eg, biventricular hypertrophy) should also raise suspicion of NS.

In adolescence

In addition to the characteristic skeletal, cardiac, bruising/bleeding, neurological and developmental features of NS, the distinctive facial features of NS are often florid in adolescents (figure 3).In addition, puberty may be delayed, particularly in boys, and the pubertal growth spurt may be attenuated or absent. As mentioned above, the finding in adolescents of certain additional cardiac lesions or particular cardiac phenotypes should also raise suspicion of NS.

In adulthood

While the characteristic skeletal, cardiac, bruising/bleeding, and neurological features may be present in adults, the facial features of NS are often difficult to recognise (figure 3).As growth during childhood is often parallel but below the third centile, individuals with NS often have short stature, with a mean final adult height of 63–66 inches (160–168 cm) in men and 59–61 inches (150–155 cm) in women.Fertility problems may occur in men, while fertility tends to be normal in women. Again, the finding in adults of certain additional cardiac lesions or particular cardiac phenotypes should also raise suspicion of NS.

Coarctation of the aorta—noninvasive testing findings include ECG, chest x-ray, and echocardiography/Doppler features. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST–T–wave abnormalities or occasionally right ventricular conduction delay. Chest x-ray can demonstrate a dilated ascending aorta, a classic “3 sign,” and rib notching, usually involving ribs 3 to 9. Echocardiography can depict the coarctation from a suprasternal notch view, demonstrate turbulence and forward diastolic flow in the proximal descending aorta, show abnormal abdominal aortic Doppler with decreased pulsatility and absent early diastolic flow reversal, and should assess aortic dimensions and associated lesions such as VSD, SubAS, and mitral valve deformity.

### CT imaging features of atrioventricular shunts: what the radiologist must know [^320939b5]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Ventricular shunts

A ventricular septum defect (VSD) is an abnormal opening in the VS, allowing communication between the ventricular cavities. In children, VSDs are the second most common CHD (34 %) with a birth incidence of 2.62 per 1000 live births. Most of these are small and spontaneously resolve in childhood, the majority within the 1 year after birth. VSDs may also be acquired after acute myocardial infarction, chest trauma, cardiac interventions, or endocarditis.

In the adult population, the prevalence is estimated to be 0.3 per 1000, making it the second most common form of CHD after the bicuspid aortic valve.

Membranous VSD

Membranous VSDs are the most common type of VSD, accounting for 70–80 % of all cases. It is located in the upper part of the VS directly below the aortic valve and behind the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Fig. 16). Because of their proximity to the defect regurgitation of these valves may occur.

Fig. 16 
This axial contrast-enhanced CT nicely illustrates a defect in the membranous portion of the IVS (arrow). This defect permits a communication between the ventricular cavities, and causes blood shunting from the high pressure left systemic circulation to the low-pressure pulmonary circulation. The magnitude of the shunt is influenced by the size of the defect, the pressure in right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) and the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. RA right atrium, LA left atrium

There are two main subtypes, a true defect that is confined to the membranous septum alone and defects that extend into the muscular septum. Untreated VSDs in adults are almost always small defects with little hemodynamic load on the heart, and no risk of pulmonary vascular disease. Their only risk is infective endocarditis or arrhythmias. The proportion of VSDs that are large and hemodynamically significant is assumed to form 20 % of all VSDs. In large defects, there is usually a volume overload of the right ventricle, the pulmonary circulation and eventually the left atrium and left ventricle. If untreated, this leads to a left ventricular dilatation, systolic dysfunction and heart failure. Eventually, even pulmonary vascular disease and right-to-left shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome) will develop. Most patients with these large defects born before 1960 would not have had effective surgical treatment and very few of them would be alive today. Therefore, those adults seen today are virtually all postoperative.

5 LIMITATION

There were many limitations in this study. (a) The number of patients was not big enough, and the follow‐up time was not long enough. The validation of the model requires more cases and longer follow‐up. (b) This study did not combine other clinical examinations and laboratory indicators. Therefore, our information can be used to predict the possibility of spontaneous closure and decide treatment options, but not to provide an accurate diagnosis.

### Hybrid versus traditional method closure of ventricular septal defects in children [^29f8fd88]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Methods

Surgery was indicated if patients (aged 0-3 years) had a VSD of >4 mm, were older than 3 years, VSD of >3 mm with a pulmonary/systemic blood flow of >1.5, and/or signs of heart failure. Children who had a VSD of >4 mm between the ages of 0 and 3 years and shunts greater than 1.5:1 generally have mild-to-moderate elevations of pulmonary artery pressure and resistance. They can be monitored until they are up to 5 years of age to maximize the chance of spontaneous closure. If failing the latter, surgical treatment may be performed.

Inclusion criteria for both methods included (1) patients with congenital isolated VSD (perimembranous, muscular, atrioventricular conal type [inlet], and subarterial [outlet]); (2) patients with residual VSD postsurgical correction of a congenital VSD; and (3) clinical signs: symptoms of heart failure, recurrent respiratory infection, developmental delay, or history of bacterial endocarditis.

Echocardiographic inclusion criteria for hybrid method included (1) distance to the pulmonary valve >2 mm; (2) no prolapse of the aortic valve into the defect; (3) subaortic rim (distance from the defect to the aortic valve) of >2 mm; (4) distance to the tricuspid valve >2 mm; (5) defect size from 4 to 12 mm; and (6) for perimembranous defects, the ratio of the size of the VSD and the weight of the patient was taken into account: (a) ≤6 mm with a weight of 4 to 8 kg; (b) ≤8 mm with a weight of 9 to 12 kg; and (c) ≤10 mm greater than 13 kg.

Exclusion criteria for the hybrid method included (1) large, nonrestrictive VSDs with indistinct margins or high pulmonary hypertension and bidirectional shunting; (2) prolapse of the aortic valve leaflet into the defect; (3) infective endocarditis; (4) concomitant anomalies requiring correction using cardiopulmonary bypass; (5) the presence of cardiac arrhythmias (in particular, AV block); (6) aortic dextraposition; (7) aortic valve regurgitation (more than mild); (8) tricuspid valve regurgitation (more than mild); and (9) aneurysm of the interventricular septum.,

### Growth charts: what to know-CDC (...) [^0e67960d]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

The WHO growth charts establish the growth of the breastfed infant as the norm for growth. Healthy breastfed infants typically put on weight more slowly than formula fed infants in the first year of life. Formula fed infants gain weight more rapidly after about 3 months of age. Differences in weight patterns continue even after complementary foods are introduced. If the charts were updated to include only these children, 5%, not 19. 7%, would be above the 95th percentile. This would lead to two problems for surveillance of child growth and obesity. First, this new 5% of children would have much higher BMI values than the 5% of children in the original 2000 growth chart reference population who were over the 95th percentile. Guo SS, Roche AF, Chumlea WC, Casey PH, Moore WM. Growth in weight, recumbent length, and head circumference for preterm low-birthweight infants during the first three years of life using gestation-adjusted ages. Early Hum Dev.

1997; 47: 305-325. Unlike other options for monitoring growth in children with very high BMI values that use theoretical or statistical extrapolations, the CDC extended BMI-for-age growth charts are based on actual data from nationally representative samples. Pediatric health care providers and researchers can track a child’s trajectory against these new curves that reflect measurements of real children with obesity. The BMI-for-age growth charts allow comparison of a child’s BMI to a reference population, similar to using and interpreting other growth charts such as weight-for-age and height-for-age. Percentiles and z scores based on the reference population provide metrics for monitoring change in BMI over time and for setting threshold values for overweight and obesity.

For most children, the reference for the CDC BMI-for-age growth charts came from a nationally representative sample of children aged 2–19 years during 1963-1980, a period before recent increases in childhood obesity prevalence. The Extended CDC BMI-for-age charts are based on data from U. S. children in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Percentage of the 95th percentile is not based on data on actual children but is a statistical extrapolation. Because 120% of the 95th percentile is the definition of severe obesity, this line is included on the extended BMI-for-age growth charts images.

### Risk factor analysis for adverse prognosis of the fetal ventricular septal defect (VSD) [^ade35b46]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Both peri-membranous and outflow tracts could raise the likelihood of unfavourable results depending on where the lesion is located. However, the number of outflow tract problems was insufficient to produce reliable statistical findings. As a result, this part was not addressed in the current study. Our data showed that peri-membranous deficiencies predominated over muscle ones. This outcome was consistent with several earlier studies. According to our results, the membranous location was an independent risk factor for the adverse prognosis of VSD fetuses. Compared with muscular defects, the multivariable logistic regression results showed that membranous defects increase the 5.3-fold risk of adverse fetal outcomes. Since the adverse fetal outcome caused by VSD location might be associated with defect size, VSD size was used as a re-adjusting factor. Results indicated that membranous defects still increase the 2.9-fold risk of adverse fetal outcomes after re-adjusting. The main causes of membranous defects leading to the poor prognosis might be the following. First, unlike muscular defects, membranous defects are not quickly closed spontaneously. Nir suggested that the membranous defect is "covered" by tricuspid valve tissue during the process of closure, which is much more complicated than a fibrous tissue plug padding in the closure of a muscular defect. Some researchers also supposed that isolated muscular VSD should be considered a delayed normal process of cardiac development, most of which could close spontaneously during gestation or in the first two years of life. However, a membranous defect should be viewed as a pathological symptom, which may need surgical interventions after birth. Second, the average diameter of membranous defects is statistically more considerable than those of muscular ones (3.054 ± 1.2174mm vs 2.055 ± 0.6104mm, respectively). This finding was in line with Li et al. They also found that the average defect diameter of peri-membranous defects was larger than muscular ones.

Ventricular septal defects (VSD) are the most common congenital cardiac defect. Patients with large VSDs present early due to an increase in the volume load on the left ventricle and pressure load on the right ventricle. Few of them present late even without surgical intervention, due to partial restriction of perimembranous (PM) VSD, either by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve or by aortic valve cusp prolapse into the VSD. The authors observed a novel structure (ie, subaortic membrane in this case) restricting the large PM VSD in a 15-year-old child.

### Spontaneous regression of left ventricular dilation in children with restrictive ventricular septal defects [^aefcb27f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) dilation associated with pressure-restrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD) often remains stable or regresses spontaneously, calling into question the role of interventional management for such defects.

Study Design

We analyzed 96 serial echocardiograms from 33 unoperated patients with a moderate-to-large VSD with LV dilation (LV end-diastolic dimension [LVED] z score >2.0) at enrollment who were followed for more than 2 years. Records of 125 surgical patients also were reviewed. Patients were evaluated for evidence of persistent or progressive LV dilation; signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), failure to thrive (FTT), or pulmonary hypertension (PAH); as well as acquired ventricular outflow obstruction or aortic regurgitation. LVED z scores at enrollment versus latest follow-up were compared using paired t tests. A random-effects model with random intercept and slope was fitted to account for repeated observations for each patient.

Results

Mean age at enrollment was 4.6 +/- 3.2 years, and mean follow-up was 7.8 +/- 4 years (range, 2.8 to 22 years), during which mean LVED z score decreased from 3.0 +/- 0.6 to 1.2 +/- 1.3 (P < .01). LVED z score decreased in 29 of the 33 patients, and decreased to <2 in 26 of these 29 (79%).

Conclusions

Most patients with pressure-restrictive VSD with moderate-to-severe LV dilation without CHF, FTT, or PAH will experience spontaneous resolution of LV dilation and can avoid cardiac surgery or catheter-based intervention.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) with Eisenmenger syndrome—surgical closure considerations report that early attempts at surgical closure of nonrestrictive VSD in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome were associated with an unacceptably high risk of mortality and the practice was quickly abandoned; however, adult patients with large VSD and PAH may benefit from closure if the net shunt is left-to-right either at baseline or with PAH therapies, and fenestrated devices or fenestrated surgical patches may leave a small residual shunt to allow decompression of the right heart.

Case report

A girl was born at term to a 23-year-old woman. A second-trimester US had shown bilateral ventriculomegaly, left hydronephrosis, a 2-vessel cord, vertebral segmentation anomalies, and polyhydramnios. At delivery, the infant was dysmorphic and had a poor cry and increased tone with jitteriness. The infant weighed 3,125 g (35th percentile), and had an occipital-frontal circumference of 35.5 cm (65th percentile). Physical examination revealed right microophthalmia, hypertelorism, an asymmetrically smaller right face with elevated nasal bridge, and a thin and downturned upper lip. A lower lumbar deformity was noted as well as a heart murmur. The neurologic exam found hypertonia, cortical thumb posturing, poor suck, exaggerated reflexes and seizure-like activity similar to myoclonic jerks. EEG showed abnormal baseline activity but did not specifically correlate with the myoclonic jerks. Echocardiogram showed only a small muscular ventricular septal defect. High-resolution chromosome studies were normal.

### Recommendations for cardiac point-of-care ultrasound in children: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography [^16e7447e]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Apical four chamber view—at the point of maximal impulse with the indicator at 3 o’clock, centered over the cardiac apex with the left heart displayed on the right side of the screen; all four chambers of the heart and both atrioventricular valves should be visualized. Key uses include assessment of left ventricle (LV) size and systolic function, assessment of right ventricle (RV) size and systolic function, assessment for gross left and/or right atrial dilation, identifying presence of pericardial effusion and presence of RV/right atrial collapse, and it allows color Doppler assessment of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

### Mechanism of tricuspid regurgitation in paramembranous ventricular septal defect [^16e153e8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2002). Low credibility.

Literature has been limited in regard to the mechanisms of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with paramembranous (perimembranous) ventricular septal defect (VSD). Most observations have noted tricuspid valve clefts or dysplasia. We describe another mechanism for production of TR in association with paramembranous VSD. In 8 patients, we found significant TR produced by the VSD jet pushing the tricuspid anterior leaflet forward to open the tricuspid valve orifice. In these patients, a moderate paramembranous VSD extended slightly below the septal tricuspid leaflet with only partial obstruction of the VSD jet. All patients had restrictive VSD with low right ventricular pressure. This mechanism to produce TR was best defined by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, but current higher resolution imaging should allow correct diagnosis. We believe that when this mechanism for TR is found in association with a moderate VSD, surgical VSD closure is warranted.

### Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children [^a1c2bc3c]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

Left-sided obstructive lesions—cor triatriatum—adults presenting with cor triatriatum sinister should be evaluated for other congenital abnormalities, particularly ASD, VSD, and anomalous pulmonary venous connection. In adults with prior repair of cor triatriatum sinister and recurrent symptoms, it is reasonable to evaluate for pulmonary vein stenosis. Surgical repair is indicated for adults with cor triatriatum sinister for symptoms attributable to the obstruction or a substantial gradient across the membrane.
