## Question

Approach to Hematuria with pyuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the approach to hematuria with pyuria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hematuria and pyuria and excluding contamination. Then, I should verify whether infection is present and treat it appropriately. Next, I will consider noninfectious glomerular and systemic causes if pyuria persists without infection. After that, I should apply malignancy risk stratification to guide imaging and cystoscopy. Finally, I will outline follow-up and special populations, and I will double-check where guidelines conflict or where I might be overgeneralizing so I can correct course as needed.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory findings before labeling the problem, because dipstick hematuria is not sufficient and pyuria must be interpreted in context. I need to ensure microscopic urinalysis shows at least 3 red blood cells per high-power field on a properly collected specimen, and I should verify pyuria as at least 5 white blood cells per high-power field, while checking for dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, and proteinuria that would suggest glomerular disease rather than a lower tract source [^55b5409c] [^8a4bd1b2] [^92bd1c95].

> Wait, let me verify the specimen quality because contamination can mimic pyuria and confound hematuria. If there are squamous epithelial cells or the patient cannot provide a clean-catch specimen, I should obtain a catheterized sample to avoid misclassification, and I should remember that in children, enhanced urinalysis or counting chamber thresholds improve sensitivity for pyuria and help distinguish true infection from contamination or asymptomatic bacteriuria [^fdfe8e61] [^a0aaf861].

> Next, I should review for infection as the most common cause of combined hematuria and pyuria. I need to check for symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, fever, or flank pain, and I should obtain a urine culture with susceptibilities to guide therapy, because hematuria often resolves after treating the UTI and persistent hematuria after adequate therapy warrants further evaluation [^f40ab8ed] [^55b5409c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics if the patient has a catheter or is asymptomatic. I should confirm that pyuria accompanying catheter-associated bacteriuria is not an indication for treatment, and I should avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria except in pregnancy or specific procedural contexts, to prevent overtreatment and resistance [^20fb9446] [^0156406d].

> I will now examine the urinalysis sediment carefully for glomerular clues. If I see dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria, I should consider glomerulonephritis and expedite nephrology referral, because these features indicate a medical renal process rather than a urologic source of bleeding [^83275ef5] [^92bd1c95].

> But wait, what if pyuria is present without bacteriuria or symptoms of infection. I need to consider sterile pyuria and think about tuberculosis, especially in patients from endemic areas or with immunosuppression, and I should also remember that isolated hematuria and/or pyuria can herald lupus activity even without other systemic manifestations, so I should check for SLE serologies and extrarenal signs if suspected [^86c4ef6d] [^d8ce46c7].

> Let me consider malignancy risk next, because hematuria with pyuria can still reflect urothelial cancer. I should confirm risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, occupational exposures, and family history, and then apply AUA/SUFU risk stratification to decide on imaging and cystoscopy, noting that the 2025 update emphasizes risk-based evaluation rather than blanket testing for all patients [^83275ef5] [^96018b79].

> For low or negligible risk patients, I should double-check that routine cystoscopy or immediate imaging is not recommended. Instead, I should repeat urinalysis within 6 months and escalate evaluation only if hematuria persists or worsens, which balances the low malignancy yield against procedural harms and costs [^45f94ea2] [^a9dae20f].

> For intermediate risk, I need to ensure I obtain cystoscopy and renal ultrasound, and I should confirm that CT urography is reasonable if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or if symptoms and risk profile raise concern for upper tract disease, aligning with AUA/SUFU and ACR guidance [^34fe16d4] [^f2fecbbe].

> For high risk, I should confirm that both cystoscopy and axial upper tract imaging are indicated, with multiphasic CT urography preferred when feasible, and MR urography or retrograde pyelography as alternatives when contrast or radiation are concerns, to maximize detection of urothelial lesions [^2c9dddab] [^f2fecbbe].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of urine cytology. Routine cytology is not recommended in the initial evaluation of microhematuria because of low sensitivity and limited impact on management, though it may be considered selectively in high-risk patients or when there is suspicion for high-grade urothelial carcinoma [^167cdd83] [^258b589d].

> Next, I should review follow-up after infection treatment. I need to ensure a repeat urinalysis in about 6 weeks to confirm resolution of hematuria, and if hematuria persists, I should proceed with risk-based urologic evaluation rather than assuming the infection explained everything [^f40ab8ed] [^fdfe8e61].

> I will now examine special populations. In children, I should prioritize glomerular causes and use ultrasound rather than CT for imaging when possible, whereas in pregnancy, I should avoid ionizing radiation and favor ultrasound or MRI, and in patients with ADPKD, I should differentiate cyst hemorrhage from infection using clinical features and inflammatory markers before treating presumed infection [^05ca0dba] [^5889d04f] [^2d884389].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm true hematuria and pyuria with microscopy, exclude contamination, treat documented infection and recheck urinalysis, evaluate for glomerular disease if red cell casts or proteinuria are present, risk-stratify for malignancy, and pursue cystoscopy and upper tract imaging according to risk, with follow-up tailored to findings and patient preference, which aligns with contemporary AUA/SUFU and nephrology guidance [^83275ef5] [^92bd1c95].

---

Hematuria with pyuria most often reflects **UTI** [^d5f3a63e] or **interstitial nephritis**, but persistent hematuria after infection clears, or the presence of dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria, should prompt evaluation for **glomerular disease** [^92bd1c95] or malignancy [^46be03bc]. The workup should include a focused history, exam, urinalysis with microscopy, urine culture, and serum creatinine; if hematuria persists after treating infection, apply **risk-based imaging** (renal ultrasound for low risk; CT urography for intermediate/high risk) and cystoscopy for intermediate/high risk or if gross hematuria occurs [^83275ef5] [^2c9dddab]. Refer to nephrology for suspected glomerular disease and to urology for suspected malignancy or structural lesions [^83275ef5].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Hematuria with pyuria has a broad differential; the most common causes are **infection and inflammation**, but persistent hematuria after infection, or specific urinary sediment findings, should raise concern for **glomerular disease** or malignancy [^46be03bc].

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Urinary tract infection (UTI) [^d5f3a63e] <br/> - Pyelonephritis [^5889d04f] <br/> - Prostatitis <br/> - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) |
| Inflammatory | - Interstitial nephritis [^notfound] <br/> - Glomerulonephritis (post-infectious, IgA, lupus, ANCA-associated) [^92bd1c95] <br/> - Tubulointerstitial nephritis |
| Structural | - Stones [^d5f3a63e] <br/> - Tumors (bladder, renal, prostate) [^ddf6d5a3] <br/> - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) <br/> - Urethral strictures |
| Systemic | - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [^d8ce46c7] <br/> - Vasculitis [^65676369] <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Hypertension |

---

## Initial evaluation

### History and physical examination

A thorough history and physical are essential to guide testing and risk stratification [^83275ef5]. Key elements include:

- **Onset and duration**: Acute vs chronic; persistent hematuria warrants further evaluation [^46be03bc].
- **Symptoms**: Dysuria, frequency, urgency, flank pain, fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, joint pain.
- **Risk factors**: Smoking, occupational exposures, prior urologic disease, family history of malignancy or kidney disease.
- **Medications**: Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, antibiotics, immunosuppressants.
- **Physical exam**: Blood pressure, abdominal/flank tenderness, prostate exam, gynecologic exam.

---

### Laboratory evaluation

- **Urinalysis with microscopy**: Confirm hematuria and pyuria; assess for dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, proteinuria [^8a4bd1b2].
- **Urine culture**: Identify causative organisms in suspected infection [^55b5409c].
- **Serum creatinine and eGFR**: Assess renal function [^83275ef5].
- **Autoimmune serologies**: ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM, complement if glomerular disease suspected [^92bd1c95].

---

## Indications for further evaluation

Persistent hematuria after appropriate treatment of infection, or the presence of **dysmorphic RBCs**, **RBC casts**, or **proteinuria**, should prompt further evaluation for glomerular disease or malignancy [^46be03bc].

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging is selected based on **risk stratification** and clinical suspicion:

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Renal ultrasound | - Low-risk patients <br/> - Initial screening | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation | - Limited sensitivity for small lesions |
| CT urography | - Intermediate/high-risk patients <br/> - Gross hematuria | - High sensitivity for stones, tumors, and structural abnormalities | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast risks |
| MRI urography | - Contrast allergy <br/> - Renal insufficiency | - No radiation <br/> - Good soft-tissue resolution | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time |
| Cystoscopy | - Intermediate/high-risk patients <br/> - Gross hematuria | - Direct visualization of bladder mucosa | - Invasive <br/> - Potential discomfort |

---

## Role of cystoscopy

Cystoscopy is indicated for intermediate/high-risk patients, those with gross hematuria, or when **upper-tract imaging** is inconclusive. It allows direct visualization of the urethra and bladder and enables biopsy of suspicious lesions [^2c9dddab].

---

## Follow-up and management

- **Infection**: Treat with appropriate antibiotics; repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution of hematuria [^f40ab8ed].
- **Persistent hematuria**: Risk-based imaging and cystoscopy as indicated [^83275ef5].
- **Glomerular disease**: Nephrology referral for biopsy and immunosuppressive therapy [^92bd1c95].
- **Malignancy**: Urology referral for definitive management [^ddf6d5a3].

---

## Special considerations

- **Children**: Emphasize glomerular causes; use ultrasound for imaging [^05ca0dba].
- **Pregnancy**: Use ultrasound or MRI; avoid CT and radiation [^5889d04f].
- **Elderly**: Higher suspicion for malignancy; lower threshold for imaging and cystoscopy [^258b589d].

---

Hematuria with pyuria requires a **structured approach**: treat infection first, then pursue risk-based evaluation for persistent hematuria or glomerular features, using ultrasound for low risk and CT urography plus cystoscopy for intermediate/high risk. Early recognition of glomerular disease or malignancy improves outcomes and guides timely referral [^83275ef5].

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

Discussion

Our study indicates that the prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is low (7%). A key question is what is the proportion of subjects in whom a positive cytology prompted a biopsy that was positive for cancer, in whom a biopsy would not otherwise have been performed? None of our patients had a positive cytology and a negative cytsoscopic/radiologic evaluation. This is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated an extremely low yield of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria. To our knowledge, these are the first contemporary report bringing the utility of urinary cytology in patients with microscopic hematuria into question.

As for the application of serial urinary cytologies, previous studies demonstrated a marginally improved by serial examinations, which was confirmed in our study. Because of this low prevalence and the low sensitivity, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria is minimal, especially since all high risk patients proceeded to cystourethroscopy and upper urinary tract radiologic evaluation.

Current AUA guidelines recommend that patients presenting with microscopic hematuria should undergo upper tract evaluation along with cystoscopy. When the CT scan is not feasible, MRI or renal ultrasound with bilateral retrograde pyelograms can be substituted (2). This evaluation is adequate in assessing the kidneys, collecting system, ureters, bladder, and urethra as the cause of the hematuria. Unfortunately, except in select patients our current diagnostic modalities will not allow us to diagnose urothelial carcinomas without visualization of a lesion followed by biopsy, which is the gold standard. With this said, the acquisition of urinary cytology even as an adjunct to the above studies rarely changes the evaluation or management and may lead to an exhaustive, unfruitful, and costly evaluation. In the face of abnormal cytology and normal cystoscopy confirmed by biopsy and normal imaging of the upper tract, the question arises whether to pursue the abnormal cytology as a possible upper tract tumor. Evaluation may include retrograde pyelogram, ureteroscopy, and selective cytology. The yield of these maneuvers is reported to be extremely low and of little benefit, except in highly select patients, especially in the face of normal radiologic studies and normal cystoscopic evaluation. However, if an abnormality is noted on radiologic or cystoscopic examination, urinary cytology may prove to be useful as a confirmation of a malignancy prior to formal biopsy.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^af3a1e66]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^49da5f0c]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^f40ab8ed]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU microhematuria — Urinary tract infection (UTI)–attributed hematuria and follow-up: In patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C); patients suspected of having UTI should undergo urine culture and, if necessary, antibiotic treatment, those suspected to have a UTI as the etiology of MH should be treated for the UTI and then undergo repeat UA to confirm resolution, and if MH does not resolve following UTI treatment, a risk-based urologic evaluation should be performed.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^45f94ea2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

Initial evaluation of NLUTD — use of cystoscopy is addressed: clinicians should not perform routine cystoscopy, which should be reserved for defined clinical indications or strong suspicion of an anatomic abnormality; cystoscopy is an invasive, potentially morbid, expensive, and oftentimes uncomfortable diagnostic procedure and a diagnosis of NLUTD is not an absolute or relative indication, although cystoscopy may be indicated at initial evaluation for unexplained hematuria or pyuria, suspected urethral pathology such as stricture or false passage, bladder stones, or known or suspected bladder cancer.

Practice points 2.6.3 and 2.6.4 — UTIs in ADPKD need differentiation from noninfectious processes and specific clinical features should trigger workup for kidney cyst infection: differentiate from cyst hemorrhage or kidney stone; overlapping presentations necessitate history, exam, labs and imaging; fever, abdominal or flank pain, elevated white blood cells, and elevated C-reactive protein suggest cyst infection or pyelonephritis, whereas gross hematuria without fever can occur with hemorrhage or stone and should not be treated with antibiotics absent proven infection; people with fever, acute abdominal or flank pain, and increased white blood cells and/or C-reactive protein should be worked up for kidney cyst infection.

### Urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b6c5ff5b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^d8ee5911]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^03cefe05]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^bce6aa43]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, the evolved treatment strategy is as follows: UTI diagnosis rests on symptoms, signs and microscopic pyuria. Without the latter, we do not initiate antibiotic treatment. We combine methenamine hippurate with a first-generation, narrow-spectrum antibiotic against urinary infection to find a tolerated regime that mediates a symptomatic response and a reduction in pyuria. If urethral pain and dysuria are prominent, macrolides and tetracyclines are favoured. We continue treatment until symptom control is optimal and pyuria has cleared before trialling treatment withdrawal. More than one cycle is frequently required to achieve lasting symptom resolution.

We provide all patients who have completed their treatment with a short course of first-generation antibiotic used for urinary infection that can be self-initiated at the very first hint of symptom resurgence. Patients are advised to take 3–7 days of antimicrobial treatment, dependening on how quickly the new symptoms settle, and this approach is advocated to prevent chronic symptoms reasserting themselves after an acute infection. In the medium term, this approach seems to be effective, although we have yet to collect data on the long-term success of this strategy.

Given these data, an RCT is the next logical step. We believe that the correct design should be a comparative trial of the management protocol evolved here against treatment stipulated by current guidelines. We hope that these data will help in the design of future studies.

### Isolated hematuria and sterile pyuria may indicate systemic lupus erythematosus activity [^d8ce46c7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify patients presenting with isolated hematuria and/or pyuria in the absence of other systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity, describe their demographics, and determine whether they present with evidence of SLE flare in a period adjacent to the presentation.

Methods

We studied patients followed at the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic between 1970 and 2012. An episode of isolated hematuria (> 5 red blood cells per high power field) and/or pyuria (> 5 white blood cells per high power field) was defined as 2 consecutive visits with these findings in the absence of other concurrent SLE manifestations such as proteinuria, casts, or azotemia. We then excluded patients whose findings might be explained by urinary tract infections, menstruation, urolithiasis, and/or anticoagulation. Only patients presenting with no other SLE disease activity were included.

Results

Isolated hematuria and/or pyuria were identified in 49 patients, of whom 17 were excluded according to the criteria above, leaving 32. Twenty-four patients had another renal manifestation 1 year before and/or after the occurrence; 27 had a non-renal manifestation 1 year before and/or after the occurrence; 3 patients had a biopsy in the same time frame, all with evidence of active lupus nephritis. Therefore the majority of patients with an occurrence of isolated hematuria and/or pyuria had evidence of renal or other non-renal SLE disease activity at a time adjacent to this presentation.

Conclusion

Although not proven, our results suggest that these manifestations were associated with SLE activity, either before or after the episode, and therefore may represent a phase of active disease.

### Hematuria [^d5f3a63e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to elicit a history and perform a physical examination, including BP measurement, and obtain serum creatinine in patients with microscopic hematuria to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy (such as detailed smoking history), medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microscopic hematuria.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis — diagnostic strategy: In a patient who presents with rapid decline in kidney function, if the urine dipstick is positive for protein and blood, evaluate whether urine sediment is positive for glomerular hematuria and/or pyuria without infection; if positive, consider rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and evaluate for extrarenal signs/symptoms, obtain autoimmune serologies (ANCA, ANA, anti-GBM antibodies, complement), exclude infection, and obtain kidney biopsy if feasible. If the dipstick is not positive or if the sediment is not positive, evaluate for nonglomerular etiology of acute kidney injury.

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^d7fc928b]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common finding in patients presenting to both primary care doctors as well as urologists. Sources of microscopic hematuria include infection, stones, inflammatory disorders as well as cancer of the genitourinary tract, particularly urothelial cancer. A primary focus in the urologic workup of hematuria is to rule out cancer. This is done using radiographic studies as well as procedures such as cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. As the authors state in their article titled "The utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria", cytologic analysis of voided urine, though attractive due to its noninvasive nature, has been found to have the neither the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, nor the ease of administration necessary to replace more invasive diagnostics in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^83275ef5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria initial evaluation — in patients with microhematuria, clinicians should perform a history, physical examination including blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy, medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microhematuria; clinicians should perform the same evaluation of patients with microhematuria who are taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (regardless of the type or level of therapy) as patients not on these agents; in patients with findings suggestive of a gynecologic or non-malignant urologic etiology, clinicians should evaluate the patients with appropriate physical examination techniques and tests to identify such an etiology; in patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause, and if microhematuria persists or the etiology cannot be identified, clinicians should perform risk-based urologic evaluation; in patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria; and clinicians should refer patients with microhematuria for nephrological evaluation if medical renal disease is suspected. However, risk-based urologic evaluation should still be performed.

### A new diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria [^f38d1bd5]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a new diagnostic algorithm for microscopic hematuria in which intravenous urography (IVU) is performed as a secondary radiographic study when microhematuria has persisted for 3 months after the initial workup with renal ultrasound (US) and cystoscopy was negative.

Methods

We evaluated 372 consecutive patients who presented with microhematuria and negative urine cultures and cytologic findings at our institution. All patients underwent renal US scanning and cystoscopy as their initial evaluation. All patients underwent re-evaluation 3 months after the initial workup. Patients with persistent microhematuria with no apparent etiology were then evaluated with IVU.

Results

The initial evaluation was negative in 212 of 372 patients. Eighty-one of these patients had persistence of their microhematuria at the 3-month follow-up without a definitive diagnosis. Seventy-five of these patients underwent IVU. Abnormalities were found in 11 of the 75 patients. Six patients had renal stones, two had ureteral stones, two had ureteral tumors, and one had a tumor of the renal pelvis. Forty of the 131 patients with resolution of their microhematuria underwent IVU at their request. All those studies were normal.

Conclusions

The combination of cystoscopy and renal US along with urinalysis, urine culture, and cytology is a good initial evaluation in patients with microhematuria. Those patients with persistent microhematuria after 3 months without definite etiology of the bleeding may still benefit from IVU.

### Imaging of hematuria [^50dabb2c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In this article, we will discuss the current status of imaging in patients with hematuria of urologic origin. Issues impacting evaluation of these patients with radiography, excretory urography, retrograde pyelography, and sonography will be discussed.

Conclusion

Conventional radiography has no role in the detection of renal or urothelial carcinoma. Low-dose CT offers much greater sensitivities for the detection of urinary tract calculi than radiography at doses equivalent to conventional radiography. Ultrasound alone is insufficient for imaging of hematuria. Using ultrasound alone, it is often difficult to differentiate renal transitional cell carcinoma from other causes of filling defects of the renal collecting system such as blood clots, sloughed papillae, or fungus balls. The prominence of the role of excretory urography in the evaluation of patients with hematuria has diminished, and MDCT urography is now preferred to excretory urography in most cases.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^e0712acc]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Renal mass and localized renal cancer — baseline laboratory and metastatic assessment is as follows: In patients with suspected renal malignancy, clinicians should obtain a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis, and metastatic evaluation should include chest imaging to evaluate for possible thoracic metastases (Clinical Principle). Urinalysis with dipstick and microscopic evaluation should be obtained to assess for proteinuria, hematuria, pyuria or signs of other genitourinary malignancy, and the presence of proteinuria is an important prognostic indicator and can be detected by urinalysis.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^178c370e]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^55b5409c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^818fd57c]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^4e3d1b21]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### Imaging of hematuria [^30764832]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria may have a number of causes, of which the more common are urinary tract calculi, urinary tract infection, urinary tract neoplasms (including renal cell carcinoma and urothelial tumors), trauma to the urinary tract, and renal parenchymal disease. This article discusses the current status of imaging of patients suspected of having urologic causes of hematuria. The role of all modalities, including plain radiography, intravenous urography or excretory urography, retrograde pyelography, ultrasonography, and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in evaluation of these patients is discussed. The article highlights the current status of MDCT urography in imaging of patients with hematuria, and discusses various-often controversial-issues, such as optimal protocol design, accuracy of the technique in imaging of the urothelium, and the significant issue of radiation dose associated with MDCT urography.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^0ee4f3d3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Etiology… [^fdfe8e61]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

In 2012, the American Urological Association published an updated guideline on the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults. 6 Based on the guideline, this article describes the current approaches to diagnosis, follow-up, and referral for patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. 6 Approximately 10 mL of midstream urine should be collected and immediately centrifuged at 2, 000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes. The supernatant should be discarded and the sediment suspended in 0. 3 mL of supernatant and/or saline, and placed on a microscopic slide. At least 10 to 20 microscopic fields should be examined under 400× magnification. 16 According to the AUA, the presence of three or more red blood cells on a single, properly collected, noncontaminated urinalysis without evidence of infection is considered clinically significant microscopic hematuria.

6 If the specimen shows large amounts of squamous epithelial cells or if the patient is unable to provide an uncontaminated specimen secondary to anatomic constraints, catheterization should be used to obtain a specimen.
6. HEMATURIA WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS If a patient has microscopic hematuria in the presence of pyuria or bacteriuria, a urine culture should be obtained to rule out urinary tract infection. Culture-directed antibiotics should be administered, and a microscopic urinalysis should be repeated in six weeks to assess for resolution of the hematuria. 6, 17 If the hematuria has resolved after the infection has cleared, no further workup is needed. If hematuria persists, diagnostic evaluation should commence.
6.

Initial Evaluation All patients with confirmed asymptomatic microscopic hematuria should provide a patient history and have a physical examination that includes blood pressure measurement and a laboratory assessment. 37 To safely evaluate the entire upper tract in this population, retrograde pyelography, which detects urothelial filling defects, can be used in combination with noncontrast CT or ultrasonography. Although the test is invasive, when it is combined with renal ultrasonography, the sensitivity and specificity are 97% and 93%, respectively. 6, 38.

### Evaluation of gross hematuria [^96328893]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^96018b79]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline (2020, Amended 2025) — purpose and methodology are outlined as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of microhematuria (MH). OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating hematuria using criteria determined by the expert panel; the initial draft evidence report included evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, and a second search included studies published up to December 2019. Five systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies met the study selection criteria and were chosen to form the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular modality was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low); and evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed, with additional information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence exists. In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA update literature review (ULR) process, which identified 82 studies for full-text review that were published between December 2019 and June 7, 2024; of those 82 studies, 23 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, and the subsequent amendment is based on data released since the initial 2020 publication of this Guideline.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^15b213b6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^8c727380]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^ee133812]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

No clinical investigation was prompted by the observation of hematuria in our participants so we were unable to identify its source and further understand if the origin of the hematuria (renal vs. urinary tract) affected the magnitude of the association of dipstick hematuria with outcomes. We could not classify different levels of hematuria or the coexistence of pyuria based on the available data. Also, as for the exposure, covariates were assessed only at baseline and residual confounding could have played a role in our findings given the limitations of our observational study design. Lastly, information was missing on multiple covariates that may have created bias despite our use of multiple imputation.

Few novel risk factors have been proven powerful enough to improve upon the capacity to predict renal outcomes using established markers like proteinuria and eGFR level. The C-statistics obtained for our baseline models are very robust making it difficult to improve upon prediction with the addition of information on hematuria. Our category free-NRI analysis suggested that hematuria may be useful for prediction of renal outcomes and death among CKD patients within the 2 years following its first assessment. However, these findings were not supported by the categorical NRI or by improvement in the C-statistics suggesting that the evaluation of hematuria does not substantially improve prediction of risk of progression of CKD.

Given the universal access to the dipstick test for hematuria, we understand our finding imply the value of enhanced testing among individuals with CKD. However, analysis of the predictive value of hematuria and our inability to explore the causes of hematuria do not support the conclusion that screening for hematuria in the setting of CKD should be expanded.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^1398985e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

Microhematuria — interventions, comparators, and outcomes note that interventions include urinary cytology and urine-based tumor markers (UBTMs), patient engagement tools and decision aids, and follow-up schedules in patients with initial negative hematuria evaluation. Comparators are defined as any of the included interventions of interest when used as the control and compared to another intervention, and it was anticipated that most identified studies would be single arm. Critical outcomes include hematuria detection concordance (urinalysis [UA] versus dipstick), diagnostic yield incorporating prevalence of malignant and/or benign diagnoses, diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and false positive rate), risk stratification for urologic malignancy with system performance characteristics (predictive ability, prognostic ability, number needed to screen), and rate of adverse events and number needed to harm; important outcomes include disease specific survival rates, diagnostic grade/stage of malignancy, prevalence of risk factors in hematuria patients, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^4a280c02]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Pyuria, detected by microscopy of a fresh midstream urine (MSU) specimen, is the most sensitive surrogate marker of UTI. It circumvents the problems associated with quantitative bacterial culture, and its value in the diagnosis of UTI is recognised by international practice guidelines. Whilst ≥ 10 wbc μL⁻¹ is employed almost universally to diagnose UTI, contemporary data cast doubt on this threshold in patients with LUTS. In the symptomatic patient, controlled studies have demonstrated that lower pyuria counts of 1–9 wbc μL⁻¹ are associated with an increase in independent inflammatory and microbiological markers of UTI. Thus, lower levels of pyuria may also indicate infection and immune activation.

The diagnostic picture has become even more complex with the recent discovery that UTI can legitimately involve polymicrobial infection; mixed growth cultures do not necessarily reflect contamination. What's more, advances in enhanced culture and genomics technology have revealed that even the normal bladder is not sterile and that a bona fide, possibly protective, urinary microbiota can be described. Uncertain diagnosis is not the only area that complicates UTI management. The treatment of acute cystitis also has its limitations. A Cochrane review reported symptomatic and microbiological failure rates of 37 and 28% 4–10 weeks after treatment. Amongst healthy young women with their first UTI, the risk of recurrence within 6 months is 24%. If they have a history of one or more UTIs, the risk of recurrence rises to 70% in that same year. In a Canadian surveillance study, 14% of 30,851 residents with UTI experienced more than one episode during the 2-year study period, and 2% had six or more episodes.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — history, physical examination, and urinalysis elements are specified. History elements include lower urinary tract management (voluntary voiding, CIC, indwelling catheter), LUTS, catheterization use, incontinence, sexual and fertility function, bowel function, skin integrity, AD, renal function tests and imaging, current and prior assessments and management (behavioral, medical, surgical), efficacy and adverse events, complications (stones, UTIs, catheter issues, skin breakdown), functional limitations, socio-economic support, goals of evaluation within the neurological condition, co-existent genitourinary conditions and prior GU surgery, past medical and surgical history, medications, and allergies. Physical exam components include general mental status and cognition, mobility and upper extremity function, abdominal and flank exam, pelvic and vaginal examination in females, genital and digital rectal exam, rectal tone, masses, reflexes and prostate assessment in males, skin integrity of pelvis, perineum, buttocks, lower back, and lower extremities, and directed neurological assessment including evaluation of bulbocavernosus, anal and cremasteric reflexes and tone and voluntary contraction of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. UA (dipstick and/or microscopic) is performed to assess for hematuria, pyuria, glucosuria, proteinuria, and other findings; abnormalities should be interpreted in context and an initial abnormal dipstick UA may prompt formal microscopic examination; the initial evaluation is part of risk stratification and may or may not lead to further investigations such as urinary tract imaging or multichannel UDS.

### Exercise in clinical reasoning: getting a foothold on lower extremity weakness [^01ed7fe4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The elevated white blood cell count, CRP, and ESR point toward a systemic inflammatory response. Prior to admission, the patient was prescribed prednisone, which could explain the rise in white blood cells secondary to neutrophil demargination. Certain leukemias and lymphomas are possibilities, but one would expect B-type symptoms and abnormal cells on the differential.

Occam's razor and Hickam's dictum can be helpful clinical reasoning tools to explore. Does the patient have a unifying diagnosis or multiple concurrent diseases? The evaluation thus far has identified numerous findings that are abnormal. Revisiting the patient's initial problem representation with new data can aid in identifying the proper evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Initial representation: "An 88-year-old man with hypertension presented to the emergency room with six weeks of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness".

Updated representation: "An elderly man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension presents with subacute, progressive motor weakness of the lower extremities, worsening pitting edema, hematuria, and acute kidney injury with labs concerning for a systemic inflammatory syndrome".

Although a biopsy of the muscle would likely be helpful obtaining a diagnosis, the results would not return in time to help with management of the disease process that appears to be rapidly progressing. The patient now has worsening edema, acute kidney injury, and hematuria which raises the concern for glomerulonephritis.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a disease process that involves the abrupt onset of hematuria, acute renal failure, and fluid retention (edema and hypertension). Proteinuria and pyuria can also occur. Given the patient's rapid decline in renal function, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) should be considered. This rare disorder can occur as a primary disorder or be associated with other primary glomerular diseases. RPGN can also be associated with vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### CT urography for evaluation of the ureter [^5308a55d]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, computed tomographic (CT) urography has emerged as the primary imaging modality for evaluating the urinary tract in various clinical settings, including the initial workup of hematuria. With the widespread implementation of CT urography, it is critical for radiologists to understand normal ureteral anatomy and the varied appearance of pathologic ureteral conditions at CT urography. Pathologic findings at CT urography include congenital abnormalities, filling defects, dilatation, narrowing, and deviations in course. These abnormalities are reviewed, along with the indications for CT urography, current imaging protocols with specific techniques for optimal evaluation of the ureter, and dose reduction strategies.

### The role of computerized tomographic urography in the initial evaluation of hematuria [^2ca2dc80]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the usefulness of computerized tomographic urography for the initial evaluation of patients with hematuria as an alternative to excretory urography.

Materials and Methods

A total of 259 patients (140 men and 119 women), age range 20 to 100 (mean 59.4) years, underwent computerized tomographic urography for the evaluation of hematuria and were available for followup. A cohort of 253 patients (153 men, 100 women), age range 21 to 92 (mean 57.6) years, underwent conventional excretory urography and were evaluated for comparison.

Results

A source of hematuria was identified in 107 patients (41.3%) in the computerized tomographic urography cohort and in 103 patients (40.7%) in the excretory urography cohort. Computerized tomographic urography alone identified a source of hematuria in 25.5% of these patients with the most commonly diagnosed lesions being renal calculi (18.9%), ureteral calculi (2.7%) and renal pelvic masses (2.3%) in the upper tract (0.94 sensitivity), and bladder masses (8.1%), prostatic abnormalities (5.4%) and inflammatory disorders (3.5%) in the lower tract (0.40 sensitivity, 0.99 specificity). The overall detection rate (19.5%), most commonly diagnosed lesions, and lower urinary tract sensitivity and specificity were similar in the excretory urography cohort. However, excretory urography exhibited a markedly lower sensitivity in detecting upper tract lesions (0.50).

Conclusions

Computerized tomographic urography exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity than conventional excretory urography in detecting upper tract pathology (94.1% vs 50%). However, sensitivity for detecting lower tract lesions was low (40% or less), suggesting that computerized tomographic urography offers a comprehensive alternative to excretory urography but does not obviate the need for adjunctive cystourethroscopy for accurate evaluation of the lower urinary tract.

### Urinary urgency and frequency: what should a clinician do? [^e4de37eb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists often care for women with urinary symptoms of urgency and frequency. These symptoms are bothersome and treatable. Although it is rare that serious disease is causative, the clinician must be alert to ominous signs and physical findings. Most patients experience relief of their symptoms after a simple initial evaluation with appropriately directed treatment. A step-wise evaluation includes the directed history and physical, assessment of urinary habits, typically with a urinary diary, and occasionally an assessment of voiding efficiency, typically with a postvoid residual. Treatments may include myofascial therapy when trigger points are present on physical examination. Behavioral therapy and pharmaceuticals also play an important role. Persistent symptoms, hematuria, severe de novo postoperative symptoms, and ominous physical findings may warrant specialty consultation.

### Practical use of investigations in patients with hematuria [^559e7209]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The majority of patients with microscopic hematuria undergo a complete evaluation resulting in negative findings. The outcome of patients with hematuria was analyzed in an effort to optimize the use of investigations.

Patients and Methods

The records for 404 patients who presented with hematuria were reviewed. Data were collected on demographics, type of hematuria, investigations, and final diagnosis.

Results

The hematuria was microscopic in 140 patients (35%) and gross in 264 patients (65%). In gross hematuria patients, 10% had urinary tract tumors and 12% had calculi. All patients with genitourinary tumors and 87% of patients with calculi had gross hematuria and/or ≥ 5 RBCs/HPF (red blood cells per high-power microscopic field) on urinalysis. The sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 6% for the dipstick urine test, 37% and 71% for urine cytology, 92% and 93% for computed tomography (CT), 50% and 95% for ultrasound scans, and 38% and 90% for intravenous pyelography, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that age and number of RBCs/HPF in the urinalyses were the only significant factors predicting genitourinary cancer. In patients ≤ 40 years old, there was one patient with malignancy and seven patients with stones. In older patients, there were 31 patients with malignancy and 32 patients with stones.

Conclusions

Patients with < 5 RBCs/HPF on three urinalyses are unlikely to have significant pathology and could possibly be followed up conservatively. Patients ≤ 40 years of age should have a noncontrast CT or ultrasound study if they present with microscopic hematuria, and a cystoscopy should be added if gross hematuria exists. In older patients, a pre- and postcontrast CT and a cystoscopy should be performed.

AAP urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline — diagnostic thresholds and pyuria: For urine obtained by catheterization, 50 000 cfu/ml was proposed as the appropriate threshold; lower colony counts are sufficient if obtained by SPA, and most (80%) cases of UTI documented with urine obtained by SPA have 10⁵ cfu/ mL or more. Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm³ on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^ad5165c0]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

The American Urological Association guideline for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends yearly evaluation for urinary tract cancer in case of persistent hematuria after a negative urologic workup. We identified few additional cases of invasive bladder cancer more than 1 year after hematuria diagnosis among patients who underwent a cystoscopy within 3 months before or after their hematuria diagnosis. Because the American Urological Association recommends cystoscopy for all patients older than 35 years with hematuria, follow-up for more than 1 year may not be needed. This recommendation accords with suggestions by Mishriki et althat patients with monosymptomatic hematuria who have undergone a thorough initial investigation with normal results do not need further follow-up.

Inclusion of nonurologic cancers in this study adds to the existing literature. The 12-fold increased risk of any cancer during the first 3 months after the initial hematuria diagnosis likely indicates that hematuria can be the presenting symptom of an occult cancer or that an occult cancer can be an incidental finding during diagnostic workup for hematuria. For rectal and gynecologic cancers, the initial increased risk of cancer was succeeded by a compensatory decreased risk, which was sustained during more than 5 years of follow-up.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) evaluation — Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history and perform a pelvic examination in women presenting with rUTIs (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). To make a diagnosis of rUTI, clinicians should document evidence of inflammation (pyuria) and the presence of uropathogenic bacteria in association with symptomatic episodes (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should obtain repeat urine studies when an initial urine specimen is suspect for contamination, with consideration for obtaining a catheterized specimen (Clinical Principle). Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may offer patient-initiated treatment (self-start treatment) to select rUTI patients with acute episodes while awaiting urine cultures (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Multi-detector row CT urography in the evaluation of hematuria [^6c069952]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Hematuria can be well evaluated with a comprehensive contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) protocol that combines unenhanced, nephrographic-phase, and excretory-phase imaging. Unenhanced images are obtained from the kidneys to the bladder and allow optimal detection of renal calculi, a common cause of hematuria. Renal parenchymal abnormalities, particularly masses, are best visualized on nephrographic-phase images, which also provide excellent evaluation of the other abdominal organs. Thin-section delayed images obtained from the kidneys to the bladder demonstrate the urinary tract distended with contrast material and are useful in detecting urothelial disease. Intravenous urography, ultrasonography, CT, retrograde ureterography and pyelography, cystoscopy, and ureteroscopy can all be used to evaluate patients with hematuria. In the past, a combination of several of these examinations was necessary to fully evaluate these patients. Now, however, this CT protocol may permit evaluation of hematuria patients with a single comprehensive examination, although more experience and data are needed to determine its efficacy in this setting.

Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with "a suspicious mass involving the kidney that has been visualized using a radiographic study, often a CT scan", and with wider imaging use "the frequency of incidental detection of RCC has increased… and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain)". Less frequent presentations include "signs or symptoms resulting from metastatic disease, including bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms… " and "fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele". "RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder… and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation". For workup, "A thorough physical examination should be performed… Laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)", and the metabolic panel "may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis". For imaging, "CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup"; "Abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT… when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency", and "All imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol".

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^9b1ec760]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Further research is needed to establish clear criteria for urine testing in febrile patients. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Effective management of UTI hinges on appropriate diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship, aiming to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for ASB. Symptom-based testing is key to ensure appropriate urine culture testing and proper diagnosis of UTI. 52, 53 A 2017 systematic review54 showed 45% of included patients experienced inappropriate initiation of antimicrobial treatment for ASB; various interventions, such as education on diagnostic protocols, provided a significant absolute risk reduction of 33%. Avoiding overtesting and resulting overtreatment of ASB is essential to preserving antimicrobial effectiveness. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs.

Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates. Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections. 78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates.

Based on several randomized clinical trials, we can provide a clear recommendation on the duration of therapy for the following antimicrobial classes for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis: Fluoroquinolones: 5 to 7 days134-139 Dose-optimized β-lactams: 7 days140-143. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation. Multiple RCTs comprised patients with gram negative bacteremia from predominantly urinary sources demonstrate noninferiority of 7 days compared with 14 total days of treatment for a variety of patient-oriented outcomes, such as clinical cure, clinical failure, relapse, and all-cause mortality. 145–148 Thus, we can provide a clear recommendation for 7 days of treatment for gram negative bacteremia from a urinary source when source control has been addressed. Whether shorter duration.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^51f25589]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — evaluation scope and evidence indicate the guideline "lowered the age threshold for evaluation from older than 40 years to 35 years", and "the recommended evaluation for all patients meeting the criteria for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (after other causes have been ruled out) includes cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with multiphasic computed tomography (CT) urography, with and without intravenous contrast". The document emphasizes that "'blood' on a dipstick urinalysis is not hematuria, and this finding indicates the need for a microscopic urinalysis to evaluate for red blood cells". Regarding screening, "the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2011 concluded the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults (4)". The evidence strength behind the AUA recommendations "is Grade C", is "primarily… based on data from male patients", and "the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men".

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^be6c22a1]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

Microhematuria — diagnostic evaluation context: Most experts agree that patients with gross hematuria (GH) should be evaluated with cystoscopy, upper tract imaging and urinary cytology, but variability exists across guidelines regarding microhematuria. The 2012 AUA Guideline recommended computed tomography (CT) urography and cystoscopy in all patients over 35 years of age with microhematuria and was crafted without regard to an individual patients' risk of malignancy, and its principal goal was to minimize the likelihood of missing a malignancy diagnosis.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

Pyuria thresholds and assessment — The absence of pyuria in children with true UTIs is rare; common explanations for bacteriuria without pyuria include contaminated specimens, insensitive pyuria criteria, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Standard microscopy of centrifuged urine uses a threshold of 5 white blood cells (WBCs) per high-power field (~25 WBCs per μL), whereas in uncentrifuged urine a counting chamber threshold of at least 10 WBCs per μL has been demonstrated to be more sensitive and performs well in very young infants.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^b58a3adf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^f4c0a824]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

It is acknowledged that the population used to derive the G INDEX, P INDEX and G + P INDEX in this instance consisted of patients with macrohematuria. Therefore, the derived NPV values are only applicable to the macrohematuria population. The sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.86–0.98) may, however, be applied across populations. Presuming that patients with and without UC are similarly distributed amongst the micro- and macrohematuria patient populations as depicted in, and that expected UC prevalence is 4% in the microhematuria population, a higher NPV and test-negative rate can be expected in the target microhematuria population.

By applying the G + P INDEX to the sample population of patients with microhematuria who do not have UC it was shown that 80% of the patients would have been triaged out on the basis of the result. Only 20% would be referred for a full urological work-up. This compares with conventional guidelines that would currently see all of the patients (100%) with microhematuria that cannot be attributed to a benign cause undergoing a full urological work-up, incurring significant unnecessary costs and negatively impacting patient QoL.

Severity of hematuria is correlated with the probability of a patient having UC, but not the stage or grade of any tumor, and an estimated 96% and 77–88% of patients with micro- and macrohematuria, respectively, referred to a urologist will not have UC. Consequently, avoiding potentially unnecessary urological work-ups for patients with hematuria has several benefits. Cystoscopy may be associated with adverse effects, such as pain on voiding, bleeding, UTIs, male sexual dysfunction and the anxiety that accompanies an inconclusive or unconfirmed UC diagnosis. Most notably, this novel approach has the potential to reduce the burden on resources and the financial cost associated with a full urological work-up on UC-negative patients. For example, in the UK, avoiding cystoscopy in patients with hematuria with an initial negative cytology and/or tumor biomarker test has been estimated to save approximately US$770 per patient (£483 per patient) evaluated. The G + P INDEX described here provides an effective alternative to the use of urine cytology when used in a primary evaluation setting. This is particularly relevant in settings where primary evaluation is carried out by primary care physicians.

### Hematuria: a problem-based imaging algorithm illustrating the recent Dutch guidelines on hematuria [^204b2611]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a problem-based algorithm in the work-up of patients with Hematuria. Since the 2010 Dutch Guideline on Hematuria was problem-based, this served as an illustration for such an approach.

Conclusion

The work-up of hematuria should be individualized and risk-based. Given the a priori low likelihood of cancer in hematuria, risk categories should be established and imaging algorithms should be tailored to populations at low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk for developing urothelial cancer.

### HIV-associated bladder cancer: a case series evaluating difficulties in diagnosis and management [^bb8482a0]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

All ten patients with a reported clinical presentation had signs or symptoms which led to the diagnosis of bladder cancer. Nine (82%) patients presented with hematuria, and in five cases this was the only presenting sign. Microscopic hematuria was identified in four patients, incidentally in two cases, and during evaluation for urinary symptoms in another two cases. Five patients presented with or developed gross hematuria with blood clots, including two patients who initially had microscopic hematuria. Three patients (27%) had lower abdominal pain on presentation and four (36%) complained of irritative symptoms such as frequency, urgency and/or dysuria. One individual had notable weight loss and was found on physical examination to have a large mass invading the anterior vaginal wall.

The radiologic and urologic evaluation of the urinary symptoms involved several modalities including urine cytology, ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), computerized tomography (CT) scans and cystoscopy. The diagnostic tests used in these patients varied based on available technology at the time of diagnosis and degree of symptoms. Three patients had urine cytology for initial evaluation, and only one had a positive result. Two patients underwent IVP, and one study was positive for a large filling defect and a bladder calculus, and the other did not demonstrate any abnormalities. Ultrasound of the urinary system was the initial test in three patients, including two patients with incidental microscopic hematuria. This modality suggested a muscle-invading bladder tumor in one patient, bilateral nephrolithiasis in one patient and was normal in the third patient. CT scans, including the CT-urogram technique, was used in seven patients for evaluation of symptoms and/or for staging. Bladder wall thickening and hydronephrosis were the most common abnormalities identified. Three patients were found to have locally invasive or metastatic disease by CT scan (Figures 1 and 2).

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^05ca0dba]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease.

### Confirmatory microscopic urinalysis after positive dipstick microhematuria: adherence patterns and quality improvement [^cf545e18]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate adherence to the 2025 AUA/SUFU microhematuria (MH) guideline, which requires confirmatory microscopic urinalysis (MUA ≥ 3 RBC/HPF) after a positive dipstick.

Materials and Methods

TriNetX Research Network data (109 U.S. health systems) were queried for adults aged 18–90 years with an initial positive dipstick from July 2020 to February 2025. Patients with gross hematuria, urinary tract infections, and kidney and/or ureteral calculi, cystitis, proteinuria, dysuria, and pregnancy diagnoses were excluded. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: no MUA, negative MUA, and positive MUA. We recorded the use of CT urography, MRI urography, renal ultrasound, or cystoscopy within 6 months of positive dipstick.

Results

Among 37,300 eligible patients, 25,904 (69%) received MUA and 11,396 (31%) did not. MUA was positive in 9,913 cases (38%) and negative in 15,991 (62%). Downstream testing followed 7.5% of dipstick-only cases, 16.1% of negative-MUA cases, and 16.3% of positive-MUA cases. In total, 855 procedures were performed without any MUA and 2,575 after a negative MUA, resulting in potentially avoidable charges. Conversely, 84% of patients with confirmed MH underwent no further evaluation.

Conclusion

31% of positive urine dipstick results were not followed by a confirmatory MUA, and 84% of patients with a positive MUA underwent no additional evaluation. These shortfalls point to gaps in the implementation of guideline-based care for MH. Future work should test targeted decision-support tools and simplified referral pathways to improve adherence and patient outcomes.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^2bb74b10]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging — patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^85cdd8de]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^fabb0055]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We determine the utility of serial urinary cytologies in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria who were evaluated with upper and lower urinary tract studies to rule out a malignancy.

Methods

Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with the diagnosis of microscopic hematuria were evaluated at an inner-city tertiary care hospital. Of these 239 patients, 182 patients had 405 cytologies obtained as part of their evaluation for hematuria. In addition, all patients had their lower urinary tract and upper tract thoroughly evaluated.

Results

Two hundred and seventy four cytology samples were read as normal, 104 (26%) as atypia, 7 (2%) as suspicious/malignant, and 20 (5%) as unsatisfactory. Seventeen patients (9.3%) had biopsy confirmed bladder cancer. Of these 17 patients, 2 had normal cytology, 11 had atypia, and 5 had suspicious/malignant. No patient had a positive cytology and a negative biopsy. Overall the number of hematuric patients harboring bladder cancer was small (7%). Cytology #1 detected 4 cases of cancer, cytology #2 detected an additional case and cytology #3 did not detect any additional cancers.

Conclusion

Because of this low prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria and the low sensitivity of detecting bladder cancers, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with hematuria may be minimal. The exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of hematuria is unknown.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a1cd4853]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider avoiding antibiotics for patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, to which a resistant pathogen has been previously isolated from the urine.
Use more recent urine cultures as a better guide than more distant urine cultures.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^36552811]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Renal tuberculosis in the modern era [^86c4ef6d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease remains as an important public health problem in developing countries. Extrapulmonary TB became more common with the advent of infection with human immunodeficiency virus and by the increase in the number of organ transplantation, which also leads to immunosuppression of thousand of persons. Urogenital TB represents 27% of extrapulmonary cases. Renal involvement in TB can be part of a disseminated infection or a localized genitourinary disease. Renal involvement by TB infection is underdiagnosed in most health care centers. Most patients with renal TB have sterile pyuria, which can be accompanied by microscopic hematuria. The diagnosis of urinary tract TB is based on the finding of pyuria in the absence of common bacterial infection. The first choice drugs include isoniazide, rifampicin, pirazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin. Awareness of renal TB is urgently needed by physicians for suspecting this disease in patients with unexplained urinary tract abnormalities, mainly in those with any immunosuppression and those coming from TB-endemic areas.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^5889d04f]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.
