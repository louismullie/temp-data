## Question

What physical exam should be done to assess for fibromyalgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what physical examination should be performed to assess for fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and how it has evolved from 1990 to 2010/2016. Then, I should verify what current guidelines say about whether a physical exam is required and what it should entail. Next, I will examine the role of tender points versus generalized hyperalgesia and how to palpate if needed. After that, I should consider functional and neurologic screening elements that support the diagnosis and differential. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, stepwise approach and clarify when to use criteria versus when to avoid overtesting, making sure I cite the most authoritative sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't anchor on outdated concepts. Historically, the 1990 ACR classification required chronic widespread pain plus at least 11 of 18 tender points, but that tender-point threshold has been removed in the 2010 and 2016 ACR diagnostic criteria, which instead use the Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Scale to classify fibromyalgia without mandating a tender-point exam, reflecting concerns about subjectivity and poor reproducibility of manual tender point testing [^4ad2eb6f] [^2ef5c9d6] [^f2401572].

> Wait, let me verify what current guidelines actually recommend about the physical examination. The Canadian 2012 guidelines advise performing a physical examination in all patients with suspected fibromyalgia, but emphasize that the exam should be within normal limits except for tenderness on palpation of soft tissues, and explicitly state that the specific 18-point tender point examination is not required to confirm the diagnosis, aligning with the ACR 2010/2016 symptom-based approach [^00a4cf18] [^36478650]. EULAR 2017 similarly recommends a comprehensive assessment of pain, function, and psychosocial context, again underscoring that the diagnosis is clinical and not dependent on a standardized tender-point count [^bc56f509].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning palpation altogether. I should clarify the role of tenderness assessment. While the 18-point tender point exam is optional, guidelines still support assessing for generalized soft-tissue tenderness or hyperalgesia during palpation, recognizing that patients with fibromyalgia demonstrate increased pain sensitivity to pressure even when the exam is otherwise unremarkable, which can support the clinical picture without being a diagnostic gatekeeper [^00a4cf18] [^36478650]. Let me consider technique: if I do palpate for tenderness, I need to ensure consistent pressure approximating 4 kg (enough to blanch the thumbnail) and confirm that the patient perceives the stimulus as painful, not just tender, to align with the 1990 methodology even though I am not using the 11/18 cutoff for diagnosis [^f8b5080d] [^60a522ff].

> I will now examine functional and neurologic screening elements that meaningfully complement the assessment. Functional tests such as the Five Times Sit-to-Stand and Single-Leg Stand can quantify lower-body strength, endurance, and balance, which are often impaired in fibromyalgia and help objectify disability, while a focused neurologic exam should be normal, excluding focal deficits, to support a central pain processing disorder rather than a peripheral neuropathy or radiculopathy, and to guide the differential diagnosis [^a1be1b03] [^56990500]. But wait, what if I see true weakness or sensory loss? That should prompt me to reconsider alternative diagnoses rather than attributing everything to fibromyalgia, so I need to ensure I document any abnormal neurologic findings carefully [^56990500].

> Next, I should review how to integrate symptom-based criteria with the physical exam. The ACR 2010/2016 criteria rely on the WPI and SSS, and diagnosis is met with either WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9, provided symptoms have persisted at least 3 months and no other disorder better explains the pain; the physical exam supports the diagnosis by showing generalized tenderness without structural abnormalities, but it is not used to count tender points for classification as in 1990 [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57]. I should double-check that I am not substituting a tender-point count for the WPI/SSS, because that would misapply the current criteria and risk misclassification [^4ad2eb6f].

> Let me think about the differential diagnosis so I don't miss mimics. I need to ensure I screen for inflammatory arthritis, spondyloarthritis, hypothyroidism, and other systemic or regional pain syndromes that can present with widespread pain, using targeted history and limited labs when indicated; this is where a normal musculoskeletal and neurologic exam, apart from soft-tissue tenderness, strengthens the case for fibromyalgia and helps avoid overtesting once red flags are absent [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not anchoring on a single positive lab; most patients with fibromyalgia have normal labs, so abnormal results should redirect the workup rather than confirm fibromyalgia itself [^ffd1a966].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances because the question can apply to adolescents as well. In juvenile fibromyalgia, the 2010 ACR criteria have been adapted and show good sensitivity and specificity against the Yunus and Masi criteria, and while tender points may be present, they are not required; the physical exam remains largely normal aside from possible generalized tenderness, and a careful neurologic exam helps exclude other causes of chronic pain in children [^5ebf156c] [^56990500]. Let me reconsider whether I need a tender-point count in pediatrics; no, the same principle applies: assess for tenderness broadly if it aids understanding, but do not rely on a specific tender-point threshold for diagnosis [^56990500].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: first, take a careful history to establish chronic widespread pain and characterize associated symptoms for the WPI and SSS. Second, perform a focused physical examination that includes inspection of gait and posture, range of motion of major joints, and a brief neurologic screen, with selective palpation of soft tissues to assess for generalized tenderness while avoiding a rigid 18-point tender-point count. Third, apply the ACR 2010/2016 WPI/SSS criteria to classify fibromyalgia if symptoms have persisted at least 3 months and no other disorder better explains the pain. Fourth, reserve additional testing for atypical features or red flags, and document functional limitations with simple performance measures when appropriate [^4ad2eb6f] [^00a4cf18] [^a1be1b03]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to count tender points out of habit; I should correct that and emphasize that tenderness assessment is supportive, not diagnostic, under current criteria [^4ad2eb6f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the physical examination for suspected fibromyalgia is normal except for possible generalized soft-tissue tenderness, that I do not require a specific tender-point count, and that I use the exam to support the clinical diagnosis, exclude alternative conditions, and quantify functional impact, while relying on the WPI and SSS for classification and longitudinal monitoring [^00a4cf18] [^36478650] [^4ad2eb6f].

The physical exam for fibromyalgia should focus on **generalized soft-tissue tenderness** [^00a4cf18] and **exclusion of other conditions** [^bc56f509]; the exam is otherwise normal [^00a4cf18]. Tender point testing is no longer required [^4ad2eb6f] [^36478650], but gentle palpation can reveal widespread tenderness and hyperalgesia [^00a4cf18] [^2ed000d6]. Assess for **myofascial trigger points** to distinguish from myofascial pain syndrome [^888edfdd], and perform a brief neurologic exam to rule out neuropathy or radiculopathy [^56990500]. Use the Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Scale to support diagnosis [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57], and reserve labs or imaging only for atypical features or suspected comorbidities [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3].

## Key elements of the physical examination

### General appearance and vital signs

Assess **general appearance** for fatigue, distress, or anxiety, and measure **vital signs** — including blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and BMI — to screen for comorbidities [^7ff5b3a0].

---

### Musculoskeletal examination

- **Inspection**: Observe for deformities, swelling, or erythema; typically absent in fibromyalgia [^00a4cf18].

- **Palpation**: Gently palpate soft tissues for generalized tenderness or hyperalgesia [^00a4cf18]; avoid firm pressure that may exacerbate pain [^118f698e].

- **Range of motion**: Assess joint ROM; usually normal in fibromyalgia [^00a4cf18].

- **Tender points**: Historically, ≥ 11/18 tender points supported diagnosis [^f2401572]; now optional and not required by current criteria [^4ad2eb6f] [^36478650].

---

### Neurological examination

Perform a **sensory exam** to assess light touch, pinprick, and vibration; typically normal in fibromyalgia [^56990500]. The **motor exam** should evaluate strength, reflexes, and coordination to exclude neuropathy or radiculopathy [^56990500].

---

### Differentiation from myofascial pain syndrome

Assess for **trigger points** — characteristic of myofascial pain syndrome — and distinguish them from fibromyalgia tender points [^888edfdd]. Trigger points are focal, reproduce referred pain, and respond to local therapy, whereas fibromyalgia tender points are diffuse and nonreferred [^888edfdd].

---

## Clinical tools and diagnostic criteria

- **Widespread Pain Index (WPI)**: Counts painful regions (0–19) [^4ad2eb6f].

- **Symptom Severity Scale (SSS)**: Rates fatigue, sleep, cognitive symptoms, and somatic complaints (0–12) [^4ad2eb6f].

- **ACR 2010/2016 criteria**: Diagnosis based on WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9, persisting ≥ 3 months without another explanatory disorder [^4ad2eb6f] [^28a2be57].

---

## Role of laboratory and imaging studies

Routine labs are not required but may be used to exclude other conditions; consider **CBC, ESR, CRP, TSH, and CK** if indicated [^ffd1a966] [^91a245d3]. Imaging is reserved for atypical features or suspected comorbidities, such as inflammatory arthritis or neuropathy [^91a245d3].

---

## Clinical pearls and pitfalls

- **Normal exam**: The physical exam is typically normal except for generalized tenderness [^00a4cf18].

- **Tender points**: Not required; use gentle palpation to avoid exacerbating pain [^4ad2eb6f] [^118f698e].

- **Differential**: Exclude inflammatory, endocrine, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions [^472c08e2].

- **Patient education**: Explain that fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis with no definitive lab test [^f2401572].

---

The physical exam for fibromyalgia centers on **generalized soft-tissue tenderness** [^00a4cf18] and exclusion of other conditions; tender point counting is optional [^36478650]. Use WPI and SSS to support diagnosis [^4ad2eb6f], and reserve labs or imaging for atypical features or suspected comorbidities [^ffd1a966].

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^1c30d85c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Assessing and diagnosing fibromyalgia in the clinical setting [^a19a19d9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling condition that may be difficult to assess and diagnose owing to its wide range of symptoms and common comorbidities. The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia include widespread pain over the whole body, pain at specific tender points, fatigue, memory and other cognitive problems, sleep and mood disturbances, and impaired functioning. Accurately diagnosing fibromyalgia may require diagnostic testing and physical examinations such as tender points examinations; however, patients with longstanding symptoms may be diagnosed according to a symptom-based fibromyalgia criteria checklist. This activity provides a sample assessment and diagnosis in a clinical situation.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^472c08e2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Fibromyalgia: mechanisms and potential impact of the ACR 2010 classification criteria [^2ef5c9d6]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain in the presence of widespread tenderness, and multiple somatic symptoms. Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia, research has proliferated and, in a relatively short period, investigators have begun to unravel the etiology and long-term impact of this complex condition. Although the ACR 1990 criteria have been central to fibromyalgia research during the past two decades, a number of practical and philosophical objections have been raised in relation to them. Principally these objections have centered on the use (or lack thereof) of the tender point examination, the lack of consideration of associated symptoms, and the observation that fibromyalgia might represent the extreme end of a pain continuum. In developing the ACR 2010 criteria, experts have sought to address these issues and to simplify clinical diagnosis. An implicit aim was to facilitate more rigorous study of etiology. The purpose of this Review is to summarize research to date that has described the epidemiology, pathology and clinical course of fibromyalgia, and to assess the probable impact of the ACR 2010 criteria on future research efforts.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^4ad2eb6f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop simple, practical criteria for clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia that are suitable for use in primary and specialty care and that do not require a tender point examination, and to provide a severity scale for characteristic fibromyalgia symptoms.

Methods

We performed a multicenter study of 829 previously diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and controls using physician physical and interview examinations, including a widespread pain index (WPI), a measure of the number of painful body regions. Random forest and recursive partitioning analyses were used to guide the development of a case definition of fibromyalgia, to develop criteria, and to construct a symptom severity (SS) scale.

Results

Approximately 25% of fibromyalgia patients did not satisfy the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria at the time of the study. The most important diagnostic variables were WPI and categorical scales for cognitive symptoms, unrefreshed sleep, fatigue, and number of somatic symptoms. The categorical scales were summed to create an SS scale. We combined the SS scale and the WPI to recommend a new case definition of fibromyalgia: (WPI ≥ 7 AND SS ≥ 5) OR (WPI 3–6 AND SS ≥ 9).

Conclusion

This simple clinical case definition of fibromyalgia correctly classifies 88.1% of cases classified by the ACR classification criteria, and does not require a physical or tender point examination. The SS scale enables assessment of fibromyalgia symptom severity in persons with current or previous fibromyalgia, and in those to whom the criteria have not been applied. It will be especially useful in the longitudinal evaluation of patients with marked symptom variability.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^ba0c8212]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### Do people with musculoskeletal pain differ from healthy cohorts in terms of global measures of strength? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^4a68180c]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The influence of experimental and clinical pain on muscle activity and maximal voluntary contraction has been widely investigated. – The available evidence suggests that pain reduces strength capabilities in participants with persistent pain conditions. Only one study included in this systematic review reported whether participants (namely 6 participants out of 18) could not perform the 1 repetition maximum strength test due to pain severity. None of the remaining studies mentioned pain interference during multi-joint strength testing. Therefore, it may be inferred that pain interference was not a barrier during multi-joint strength assessment in the included samples. However, more clarity is needed when describing physical performance testing in participants with musculoskeletal pain disorders.

Only four studies assessing adult women with fibromyalgia were deemed eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Our results (moderate level of evidence) suggested that only small differences in strength were present between women with fibromyalgia and active peers in both multi-joint exercises examined (i.e. chest press and leg press). However, caution should be taken when interpreting these results. Three out of four studies, used outdated criteria to identify participants with fibromyalgia(e.g. tender points examination), which may overestimate the presence of such a condition. – This may result in the erroneous inclusion of participants presenting with nociceptive musculoskeletal pain with signs typical of central pain processes (i.e. increased pain response evoked by stimuli outside the affected area). – Therefore, further studies identifying participants with fibromyalgia using the most appropriate diagnostic criteria and assessing strength with multi-joint exercises are needed to corroborate our results.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^11aafc7c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia 18 years ago, there have been an ever-increasing number of research articles and reviews. From the National Library of Medicine alone there are more than 10,000 articles related to fibromyalgia. The major clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia have not changed, but their prevalence, associations, relative importance to the patient, and scientific underpinnings are increasingly better understood. This article provides an update on fibromyalgia symptomatology and looks at issues that need to be considered in the development of updated diagnostic guidelines. There is still no gold standard for making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but there is an increasing consensus for the development of new guidelines for diagnosis that modifies the currently proscribed tender point evaluation.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^015a7d21]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

We tried to identify studies that assessed an association between clinical fibromyalgia and mortality rates. Thus, patients in the current cohort had 'tender points' on physical examination (1990 criteria), or suffered from other somatic symptoms that comprise the 'symptom severity scale' (2010, 2011 or 2016 criteria), in addition to chronic widespread pain. So, although the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved over the years, our meta-analysis approaches a real-life situation with a mixed population of patients that were diagnosed over the years by different fibromyalgia criteria.

Due to significant heterogeneity across the studies, which were also small in number, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the available data. However, it is possible that for the subgroup of patients diagnosed by the 1990 criteria there is no increased risk for mortality, and for those diagnosed by later versions the risk is increased. As only minimally adjusted effect measures were extracted from the included studies (age and sex, where possible), our study was not designed to address the question of whether fibromyalgia per se, or its degree of comorbidity, is the reason for this increase. As for specific-cause mortality, an impressive finding is the highly increased SMR for suicide mortality, with all the studies demonstrating an increased risk. A recent systematic review on over 390 000 fibromyalgia patients described a prominently increased suicidal ideation rate and suicide attempts among fibromyalgia patients. The physical and especially the psychiatric comorbidities, that are characteristic of fibromyalgia patients, are possible explanations for this finding. The finding of increased mortality associated with accidents can stem from fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and the concentration difficulties that accompany fibromyalgia, and are a component of its diagnostic criteria since 2010. More and more evidence supports immune system involvement and inflammation in fibromyalgia pathophysiology, which can explain the finding of increased mortality from infections. Physical comorbidity may be an additional explanation. The results of our meta-analysis point to decreased cancer mortality, without heterogeneity between the studies. Previous meta-analyses, that examined cancer mortality among patients who suffer from chronic widespread pain, showed increased mortality in one study, and no difference in mortality in another. We believe that a logical explanation for the finding of decreased cancer mortality in fibromyalgia patients is extensive utilisation of health services, including imaging tests that can serve as secondary prevention or early detection for these patients. Mortality from heart disease was not increased in our study. The results of meta-analyses on the association of chronic pain with heart/cardiovascular mortality varied, with a borderline increase in mortality in one study, no difference in mortality in another, and a significant increase in mortality in the third, although the criteria of pain distribution were different in those studies. Contrary to our finding of no association between fibromyalgia and cerebrovascular mortality, one meta-analysisfound an increased mortality rate, but it included participants with chronic, not necessarily widespread, pain. Similar to findings from meta-anlyses on chronic pain, in our study fibromyalgia was not associated with increased respiratory mortality. No other meta-analysis assessed an association of widespread pain or fibromyalgia with liver disease and this association was not statistically significant in our meta-analysis. A potential explanation for the interesting finding of decreased in-hospital mortality for perioperative or opioid use disorder is the disproportionate extent of medical surveillance for fibromyalgia patients.

### Is fibromyalgia a discrete entity? [^2ed000d6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined as chronic widespread pain (CWP) with allodynia or hyperalgesia to pressure pain, and is classified as one of the largest group of soft tissue pain syndromes. Its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, although it is currently believed to be the result of a central nervous system (CNS) malfunction that increases pain transmission and perception. There are no instrumental tests to confirm the diagnosis, but many of the differential diagnoses can be excluded by means of an extensive clinical examination and patient history. Although fibromyalgia is a recognisable clinical entity, it would seem appropriate to consider the entire range of tenderness and distress in clinic patients in order to tailor treatment on an individual basis.

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis [^92682355]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Physical examination

The physical examination of children with FM might reveal multiple TP and in some cases evidence of JH, but it is otherwise unimpressive, with no evidence of arthritis or other pathological findings.

The presence of multiple TP in the physical examination of adult and pediatric FM patients, as compared to their healthy peers reflects their generalized sensitivity to pain. In a study of 47 female adolescents with JPFS, the mean number of TP was 11, compared to an average of 2–3 in healthy controls. Children with FM may have fewer TP, as compared to adults. Children and adolescents with FM were found to have a mean of 9.7 TPs summed over all visits; fewer than the criterion of 11 established for adults at a single visit.

Use of the manual TP examination as a diagnostic criterion is controversial, as it is frequently performed incorrectly. The amount of pressure applied is inconsistent, as well as the degree of subjectivity and lack of reproducibility between examiners and over time. In addition, it is less applicable for men because they generally appreciate smaller amounts of pain from pressure.

King et al. quantitatively assessed pressure pain thresholds in 34 adolescent females with JPFS, using a hand-held algometer. Participants with JPFS had significantly higher pressure pain sensitivity than did healthy controls. Therefore, it has been suggested that a manual TP examination may not be necessary in the diagnosis of JPFS.

During physical examination, JPFS patients often demonstrate a significant difference between their reported high pain intensity and the minimal pain behaviors they demonstrate. This is in addition to an ill-matched affect (complaints of intense pain while remaining calm and happy).

Further evaluation

Often, after a thorough history and physical examination, the diagnosis of JPFS is quite clear, requiring no further evaluation. However, when the diagnosis is uncertain or when another pain diagnosis is suspected (Table 1), bloodwork and imaging are often evaluated. Baseline laboratory tests include a complete blood count, blood chemistry, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and creatinine kinase. If anamnesis suggests systemic constitutional symptoms such as lupus, an antinuclear antibody (ANA) should be obtained. Most FM patients have normal laboratory values, although some have a low positive ANA titer. However, this is found incidentally in approximately 5% of the general population and is inconsequential when there is no clinical evidence of inflammatory or autoimmune disease. Imaging studies are usually normal, with the exception of disuse osteoporosis, that might be present if immobility is prolonged.

### Do people with musculoskeletal pain differ from healthy cohorts in terms of global measures of strength? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^f658a864]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of this review was to synthesize and critically evaluate the available literature assessing multi-joint strength values in participants with musculoskeletal painful conditions, and to investigate whether these differ from healthy cohorts. The main findings revealed that, although clinical guidelines recommend strength assessment as an essential part of physical examination in participants presenting with musculoskeletal pain disorders, only very limited data is available on multi-joint strength levels. These were limited to knee osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain and rheumatoid arthritis. However, owing to the heterogeneous samples, varied and inaccurate strength assessment methods among the included trials, and absence of healthy active control groups, it was not possible to determine whether participants with knee osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and rheumatoid arthritis presented with different multi-joint strength levels than healthy active cohorts. A meta-analytic review was available only for women with fibromyalgia since it is recommended to include at least two adequately homogeneous studies for quantitative analysis. However, controls were extracted from a database of active community members, with limitations highlighted in the specific section of this review. Interestingly, no measures of multi-joint strength level were reported in sports rehabilitation research (e.g. upper and lower limb tendinopathies cohorts), where thorough physical preparedness is often advocated before return to sport. –

### Development and testing of the fibromyalgia diagnostic screen for primary care [^433868f6]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Screen was developed for use by primary care clinicians to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of fibromyalgia, a disorder that predominantly affects women.

Methods

The screen was designed to have a patient-completed questionnaire and a clinician-completed section, which included a brief physical examination pertinent to the differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The items in the questionnaire were based on patient focus groups and clinician and patient Delphi exercises, which resulted in a ranking of the most common and troublesome fibromyalgia symptoms. One hundred new chronic pain patients (pain > 30 days) and their primary care physicians completed the screen. The patients were grouped as fibromyalgia or nonfibromyalgia by an independent fibromyalgia specialist, who was blind to screen responses. Logistic regression was used to model the probability of fibromyalgia as a function of physician-reported and patient-reported variables. Best subset regression was used to identify a subset of symptoms that were summed to form a single measure. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was then used to select thresholds for continuous variables. The symptom and clinical variables were combined to create candidate prediction rules that were compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity to select the best criterion.

Results

Two final models were selected based on overall accuracy in predicting fibromyalgia: one used the patient-reported questionnaire only, and the other added a subset of the physical examination items to this patient questionnaire.

Conclusion

A patient-reported questionnaire with or without a brief physical examination may improve identification of fibromyalgia patients in primary care settings.

### Advances in the assessment of fibromyalgia [^981bded3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) has historically been considered a chronic pain condition. Recent clinical studies, however, reveal that while pain may be the cardinal symptom of FM, there are many other symptoms and consequences of having FM that have an impact on the lives of individuals with this condition. As such, an area of intense clinical research has focused upon improving approaches to assessment for FM. This article provides an overview of how the art of assessing FM has evolved over time, current methods of assessment, the value of patients' perspectives in assessment, and emerging advancements representing the future of for FM.

### Are the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia better than the 1990 criteria? [^4d0b3687]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is difficult to diagnose and manage chronic pain condition whose symptoms have no clear pathophysiological cause, although it is thought that patient hypersensitivity to a range of stimuli may give rise to mechanical hyperalgesia as a result of altered central nociceptive processing. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, which have been widely used in clinical practice, require the existence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) for > 3months, and the presence of at least 11 out of 18 specified tender points upon digital palpation, although this latter criterion has long been criticised. The newer 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria state that FM can be defined as CWP associated with somatic symptoms, and recommend the use of a widespread pain index and a scale to rate symptom severity. A modified version of the 2010 criteria removed the physician assessment of the extent of somatic symptoms and replaced it by a summary score of three self-reported symptoms, thus making it easier to use while maintaining its sensitivity. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of all of these criteria.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c7c68778]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

The authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science electronic databases in August 2022 to identify studies that addressed associations between fibromyalgia and mortality. The search was conducted using the key words 'fibromyalgia' and 'mortality'. There was no limitation by date or language of publication. To identify additional studies, we reviewed the bibliographies of the full text papers that were included in the systematic review.

To ensure that the studies introduced into the review included patients with fibromyalgia, we selected studies that used the following fibromyalgia definitions:

In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was extracted from medical records, the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD) codes 729.1 (for version 9) and M79.7 (for version 10) were used.
In studies in which the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was verified by interview/physical examination, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (versions 1990, 2010, 2011, or 2016), or referring rheumatologist diagnosis by criteria in effect at the time of enrolment, if before 1990, were used.

Although the criteria for fibromyalgia have evolved over the years and may identify different sets of patients, the strategy adopted was deemed appropriate since the aim of our review focused on question of whether clinical, real-life cohorts of fibromyalgia patients suffer from excess mortality. In real-life clinical practice, fibromyalgia patients are a mixed population, diagnosed in different years by different criteria relevant at the time of diagnosis, who were diagnosed by rheumatologists or family physicians.

### Fibromyalgia: a critical digest of the recent literature [^5701ae0d]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome characterised by widespread pain and a constellation of other symptoms and overlapping conditions that contribute to complicate the diagnosis, the assessment and the treatment. Furthermore, the etiological causes for the moment only consist of assumptions, and the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms still remain to be clarified. For the above-mentioned reasons, with the present review we sought to provide an overview of the literature on fibromyalgia from both the pre-clinical and clinical studies indexed in PubMed during the last year, classifying original articles and reviews into etiopathogenesis, assessment and therapy.

### Complex measures and indices for clinical research compared with simple patient questionnaires to assess function, pain, and global estimates as rheumatology "vital signs" for usual clinical care [^545f62e0]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Indices of multiple measures have been developed to assess and monitor patients with rheumatic diseases, as no single "gold standard" measure is available for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of all individual patients. Rheumatology indices generally include 4 types of measures from a standard medical evaluation: patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Well-characterized indices are available for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ankylosing spondylitis, vasculitis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and other rheumatic diseases. These indices are complex and applied widely in clinical research, but rarely are scored in usual rheumatology patient encounters, which generally are conducted without quantitative data other than laboratory tests. Information from a patient often is as prominent in clinical decisions as information from a physical examination or laboratory tests, and is easily collected as standardized "scientific" data on patient questionnaires designed for usual clinical care, which require minimal professional effort. Patient-derived data-along with physical examination, laboratory, and imaging data-are useful rheumatology "vital signs" to assess and monitor patient status, provide documentation, and improve the quality of clinical care, in addition to their possible value for clinical research. Differences between complex measures for research and simple questionnaires designed for usual clinical care might be more widely recognized, to promote quantitative measurement in the infrastructure of usual rheumatology care.

### One year in review 2017: fibromyalgia [^a63bc385]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome characterised by chronic pain, fatigue and functional symptoms. Widespread pain is often its most typical feature, whereas other manifestations may be associated to various extents. Its aetiopathogenesis is still a matter of debate, but various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are currently available for its treatment. We review the literature concerning the most recent findings relating to the aetiopathogenesis, assessment and treatment of FM published between January 2016 and January 2017.

### Misdiagnosis in fibromyalgia: a multicentre study [^6ff32b61]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is the second most common cause of visits to rheumatologists after osteoarthritis, and may be difficult to diagnose in many patients. It is associated with various rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies (SpA) and connective tissue disease (CTD), and a late diagnosis or misdiagnosis is a common and underestimated problem.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the 'underdiagnosis' of FM, and which rheumatic diseases tend to be confused with it.

Methods

The following data were collected at baseline: symptoms, disease duration, physical examination findings, previous and current investigations and management, laboratory tests, tender point count, tender and swollen joint counts, and spinal pain. The clinimetric evaluation included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS).

Results

The study population consisted of 427 outpatients (418 females and 9 males; mean age 49.3 years; mean disease duration 8.5 years). Fifty-seven patients (13.3%) had been previously misdiagnosed as having other musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs); 370 patients had been previous correctly diagnosed as having FM, or were diagnosed as having it during the course of the study. The FM and MSD groups were comparable in terms of demographic data and referral patterns. Disease duration was longer and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was higher in the MSD patients, who also had less severe FIQ and lower pain visual analogue scale scores. Moreover, the FIQ and FAS scores correlated in the MS group.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest that, although FM is a wellknown clinical entity, differential diagnosis with SpA, CTD and inflammatory arthritis can still be a challenge for rheumatologists and general practitioners.

### Chronic low back pain in older adults: prevalence, reliability, and validity of physical examination findings [^fbf3b4db]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a structured physical examination protocol that identifies common biomechanical and soft-tissue abnormalities for older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) that can be used as a triage tool for healthcare providers and to test the interobserver reliability and discriminant validity of this protocol.

Design

Cross-sectional survey and examination.

Setting

Older adult pain clinic.

Participants

One hundred eleven community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older with CLBP and 20 who were pain-free.

Measurements

Clinical history for demographics, pain duration, previous lumbar surgery or advanced imaging, neurogenic claudication, and imaging clinically serious symptoms. Physical examination for scoliosis, functional leg length discrepancy, pain with lumbar movement, myofascial pain (paralumbar, piriformis, tensor fasciae latae (TFL)), regional bone pain (sacroiliac joint (SIJ), hip, vertebral body), and fibromyalgia.

Results

Scoliosis was prevalent in those with (77.5%) and without pain (60.0%), but prevalence of SIJ pain (84% vs 5%), fibromyalgia tender points (19% vs 0%), myofascial pain (96% vs 10%), and hip pain (48% vs 0%) was significantly different between groups (P < .001). Interrater reliability was excellent for SIJ pain (0.81), number of fibromyalgia tender points (0.84), and TFL pain (0.81); good for scoliosis (0.43), kyphosis (0.66), lumbar movement pain (0.75), piriformis pain (0.71), and hip disease by internal rotation (0.56); and marginal for leg length (0.00) and paravertebral pain (0.39).

Conclusion

Biomechanical and soft tissue pathologies are common in older adults with CLBP, and many can be assessed reliably using a brief physical examination. Their recognition may save unnecessary healthcare expenditure and patient suffering.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^9024966b]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Management recommendations

General considerations (evaluating a patient with pain)

The recommendations are based on graded evidence as explained previously. The grades are mentioned in parenthesis next to each recommendation.

History

A thorough evaluation of the patient profile, patient history and presence of comorbid conditions is necessary as a first step toward pain diagnosis (C).
Diagnosis should involve measurement of pain intensity, physical examination, sensory examination, motor examination and evaluation of cognitive and functional well-being (B).

Assessment and monitoring

Identify and use appropriate pain assessment tools (A) For the purpose of designing treatment strategies for managing pain, it is essential to assess the severity of the pain. Use of pain assessment scales may help in the diagnosis of the disease, design of treatment strategies, monitoring and evaluation of outcome of therapy or for predicting the impact of pain on functional outcomes of a patient (Table 3). Factors that should be taken into consideration while selecting the appropriate pain assessment method include sensitivity and specificity, usefulness or value of the assessment tool, objective of the assessment, age of the patient and extent of symptoms presented by the patient.
Sensory examination Components of a sensory examination include light touch, pinprick, temperature (hot or cold) and vibration. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) might help distinguish between various types of neuropathic pain. In patients with neuropathy, the threshold for pinprick and thermal sensations are increased, while increased sensitivity to light touch may indicate presence of allodynia or hyperalgesia, which may point toward painful inflammation or fibromyalgia with a central neuropathic origin.–The QST has also been used in the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, although not as a sole measure.
Motor examination Evaluation of motor function is an important method of diagnosing musculoskeletal pain, especially back pain and neck pain. Exercises such as neck rotation and neck flexion or extension tests may help determine the localization and intensity of pain (D).
Diagnostic tests Examination by X-rays is the most common method used to confirm the localization of pain, particularly in LBP, neck pain, joint pain or pain associated with internal organs. Use of computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be useful in cases in which diagnosis by physical examination or X-ray may be insufficient or if any underlying damage to the CNS is suspected to be involved. Further details are presented in the Supplementary material section.

### Efficacy and safety of ASP0819 in patients with fibromyalgia: results of a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^65a0b449]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

Study Design and Patients

This phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (NCT03056690) was conducted at 24 sites in the US to assess the analgesic efficacy and safety of ASP0819 in patients with fibromyalgia. The study consisted of the following: a screening period of up to 42 days, which included a washout period and a 7-day baseline diary run-in; a 57-day double-blind, randomized treatment period with site visits at Days 1, 15, 29, and 57; and a 4-week follow-up period consisting of a clinic visit after 2 weeks and a phone call after 4 weeks. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the initiation of any study procedures.

Male and female patients aged 18 to 80 years with a body mass index of ≤ 45 kg/m 2 were included in the trial if they met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 and 2010 fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria at screening. The core diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are defined by the 1990 criteria, and while ACR has published newer criteria, the 1990 version is still commonly utilized in clinical trials. To meet ACR 1990 criteria, patients must have had widespread pain for at least 3 months, defined as the presence of pain on the right and left sides of the body, pain above and below the waist, and pain in the axial skeleton (cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back). They must also have had pain in at least 11 of 18 tender point sites on digital palpation performed with an approximate force of 4 kg. Investigators were trained in tender point examination and the assessment of the ACR2010 criteria; these investigators performed this exam and confirmed the diagnosis.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^9f0a59d2]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

With the ABC indicators, the specificity of FM diagnosis is substantially above that of the 2011 criteria, which tend to "over-diagnose" FM. Additionally, while the sensitivity is 13.2% below the 2011 criteria's sensitivity, the overall discriminative ability (DOR) of the proposed clinical indicators is substantially higher than that of the 2011 criteria. An eminent difference between the 2011 criteria and the proposed ABC indicators lies in its completely different clinical approach: ACR criteria 2011 diagnose FM by exclusion and based on 2 linear scales of self-administered symptoms. In contrast, the ABC indicators regard FM as a tangible and complex clinical disease-entity with generalized hyperalgesia, which should be diagnosed face-to-face by a physician in a structured clinical assessment in search of positive clinical indicators. More importantly, the underlying pathophysiological concept of the ABC indicators allows for a suitable and viable communication of this pain disorder to patients as well as to medical students and health professionals due to its etiopathogenetic underpinning. We hope to stimulate international discourse on the improvement of the understanding of FM through our proposed ABC indicators and encourage future research to investigate their utility and validation in further clinical settings.

In summary, we recommend the following approach for identifying FM:
Clinical examination and serological or radiological screens for the verification/exclusion of lesion-based or inflammatory comorbid components (according to rheumatology standards).
Indicator A: Testing for generalized hyperalgesia by quantifying hyper-perceptive components of pain sensation using a standardized algometric measure.
Indicator B: Examining, eg with pain drawings, the fulfilment of a bilateral axial-symmetric pain distribution (fulfilled, when there are ≥ 3 pairs of WPI marks).
Indicator C: Use of the SSS 2011 as a brief Stress Symptom Screen with the cutoff of ≥ 5. Decide whether a more detailed exploration of psychological distress is required.
If a patient exhibits all three indicators, the fulfilment of the FM syndrome can be communicated and explained, and care according to current guidelines a multimodal therapy should be recommended.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: an update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^888edfdd]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Versus Fibromyalgia

MPS and fibromyalgia are two common pain syndromes that often present with overlapping symptoms, making differential diagnosis challenging due to the absence of validated gold‐standard criteria. The clinical distinction between them currently relies on a thorough patient history and physical examination.

A key determinant in differentiating MPS from fibromyalgia is the nature of the tender regions and the pattern of pain presentation. MPS is typically characterized by regionally distributed pain associated with discrete MTrPs. These MTrPs are located within taut bands of muscle fibers and, when compressed, produce stereotypical referred pain patterns. They may elicit a local twitch response upon snapping palpation (i.e. rapid compression across muscle fibers) and are often responsive to local treatments.

In contrast, fibromyalgia patients present with widespread pain lasting longer than 3 months, without clear localization to specific muscles, and with symmetrically distributed tender regions within soft tissues. These tender regions are sites of exquisite tenderness but differ from MTrPs in several ways: they are not located within taut bands of muscle fibers, do not elicit a local twitch response upon snapping palpation, do not give rise to pain at distant sites upon local stimulation, and are generally unresponsive to local treatments targeting specific points. This suggests that maladaptive central processing may be an important underlying mechanism driving the clinical features of fibromyalgia.

The underlying pathophysiology further distinguishes the two conditions. MPS involves localized peripheral tissue changes, including elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in MTrPs. Conversely, tender regions in fibromyalgia do not typically exhibit these inflammatory changes, supporting the notion of central sensitization rather than peripheral tissue pathology.

Differentiating MPS from fibromyalgia is complicated by several factors. The nonspecific nature of localized tender regions and associated pain is common to various clinical conditions. Moreover, MPS, although primarily a regional pain syndrome, can become widespread and persist for more than 3 months, mirroring the chronicity of fibromyalgia. Consequently, patients may exhibit characteristics and symptoms that satisfy criteria for both syndromes. Clinically, we recommend considering the following classification: regional pain without central sensitization, regional pain with central sensitization, and widespread pain (which has central sensitization).

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis [^56990500]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and evaluation of JPFS

Diagnosis of JPFS is clinical, based on a detailed history and physical examination, including a thorough neurological assessment. Other than possible findings of tender points or increased pain susceptibility to touch, no positive neurological signs, such as change in tonus, strength or sensorial sensation should be found. Patients with JPFS often undergo assessments by their primary pediatrician and multiple specialists prior to their eventual diagnosis. This is because JPFS is under-recognized by healthcare providers, which can lead to delays in diagnosis from 6 months to as long as 5 years, and thus, to a delay in proper treatment, which increases the negative impact on patients' lives (mood, functionality, academic achievement, etc.). Additionally, lack of recognition of JPFS increases the medical costs for the patient, their families and the healthcare system, due to many office visits, medications and diagnostic tests.

JPFS is considered part of the spectrum of functional pain syndromes or central sensitivity syndromes. Consequently, the symptoms of JPFS frequently overlap those of other functional pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, temporomandibular joint disorder, myofascial pain syndromes, premenstrual syndrome, tension-type headaches and mood and anxiety disorders. Therefore, as part of the diagnostic process, other causes of chronic pain should be considered and ruled out (Table 1), including chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain that does not result from FM. Other medical conditions should also be considered and ruled out. An example is Familial Mediterranean Fever which can be presented with exertional leg pain.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of pediatric chronic musculoskeletal pain

History

As the diagnosis of JPFS is clinical, a thorough history is very important. The history should address pain properties, typically revealing widespread musculoskeletal pain with high subjective pain severity. The presence and severity of additional symptoms, including sleep disturbances, psychological comorbidities and other somatic manifestations should be mapped. The degree of functional impairment should be assessed, including school absenteeism, and avoidance of regular daily activities and peer relationships. Measures of well-being should be evaluated. It is imperative to include information regarding the child's familial, social and academic environments in the primary assessment, due to their importance in treatment.

### Fibromyalgia and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^66877654]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia is a poorly understood disease whose prevalence has increased over the years. The diagnostic criteria have evolved since 1990 in parallel with an enhanced understanding of its clinical manifestations, from widespread pain and tender points on clinical examination, to fibromyalgia as a polysymptomatic disorder in the 2010 and 2011 criteria, and to the 2016 criteria that incorporates modified widespread pain, with improved specificity. There is a growing understanding that fibromyalgia coexists with other health problems including other rheumatic diseases, and gastrointestinal, neurologic and mental health disorders. A recent study showed a positive association between the number of comorbid conditions and the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms. In light of the high burden of comorbidity, fibromyalgia patients could suffer from increased mortality. This hypothesis is strengthened by reports of the association of the widespread pain — the central criteria for fibromyalgia — and increased mortality rates for all-causes, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, and suicide attempts. To date there is no consensus as to whether fibromyalgia is associated with increased mortality. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on the association between clinical fibromyalgia and mortality, either all-cause or specific, and to pool the results in a meta-analysis.

### Electronic medical record data to identify variables associated with a fibromyalgia diagnosis: importance of health care resource utilization [^75da9166]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Widespread pain is the hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic, complex musculoskeletal condition that remains undiagnosed in a substantial proportion of patients with this disease. While the pain is generally defined as bilateral both above and below the waist and includes axial skeletal pain, FM is also characterized by a variety of other symptoms and comorbidities, including fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and irritable bowel syndrome. The substantial socioeconomic burden of FM is well recognized, resulting from reductions in patient function, productivity, and quality of life, as well as high health care resource utilization.–

The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have long provided guidance for the diagnosis of FM based on the primary criteria of widespread pain and a manual tender-point exam for demonstrating the presence of tenderness at a minimum of 11 of 18 specified points. These criteria were updated in 2010 by adding a symptom-severity assessment and eliminating the tender-point exam. Despite the availability of these diagnostic criteria and various screening tools, FM patients still cycle through the health care system for several years before receiving a diagnosis; patients have reported delays of up to 5 years from when they first presented to a physician about their FM symptoms to receiving an actual diagnosis.

Identifying variables associated with, or predictive of, developing FM can enhance understanding of the disease and provide a focus for development of appropriate management strategies. Previously, patient-reported registry data demonstrated that the widespread pain that is characteristic of FM was predicted by somatic symptoms, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, fatigue, sleep problems, and workplace stress. A recent narrative review of biologic markers further highlighted the need for such identification, since while several markers can be considered suggestive of FM, none has unequivocally been shown to be a clinically useful predictor of developing this condition.

Another relevant approach is to identify variables associated with an FM diagnosis, which can be used to inform health care providers of patients in the clinical setting who have a high likelihood of FM, thus reducing the diagnostic delay and facilitating earlier treatment initiation. To identify such variables, it may be necessary to go beyond the demographic and clinical characteristics that have been evaluated based on their ready availability in databases that are frequently used for these types of analyses.

### The accuracy of a fibromyalgia diagnosis in general practice [^87b1bcbb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the characteristics of people with fibromyalgia (FM) with those with other forms of nonmalignant chronic pain.

Design

A prospective cohort study conducted in a chronic pain management clinic within an academic medical center.

Setting

Many symptoms of the chronic pain syndrome FM are common to other pain or musculoskeletal syndromes. FM may be misdiagnosed by clinicians.

Subjects

Thirty-three patients with a working diagnosis of FM were identified: 26 (78.8%) participated in the study. They were matched by age (mean = 53.0years) and gender (80.8% female) to a control group with other forms of chronic nonmalignant pain.

Methods

Standardized physical examinations for FM were undertaken using the 1990 and revised 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines. The groups were compared using diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and responses to the Pain Disability Index, Personal Health Questionnaire, Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and Rapid Estimate Adult Literacy in Medicine.

Results

The most common psychiatric disorders were depression (44.4%) and anxiety (27.3%). Incidence of at least one psychiatric condition was 80.8%, and the only difference (P = 0.002) between the two populations was the mean number of tender points: 5.6 (± 4.2) vs controls 3.2 (± 2.2). Only three (11.5%) participants with a prior diagnosis of FM fulfilled the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria, increasing to 38.5% when the 2010 criteria were applied; however, 46.1% of controls also met the revised diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

FM is commonly misdiagnosed: all patients with a working diagnosis should be reassessed and reviewed to ensure that the most appropriate treatment is provided.

### Do we need core sets of fibromyalgia domains? The assessment of fibromyalgia (and other rheumatic disorders) in clinical practice [^f7e20608]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

An OMERACT consensus process recommended domains for investigation in fibromyalgia (FM) clinical trials. We used patient data to investigate variable importance in the determination of patient global and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in FM and non-FM patients to determine whether variables were valued differently in FM compared with non-FM states.

Methods

We used ACR 2010 diagnostic FM criteria modified for epidemiological and clinical research to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; N = 5884) with and without FM, and also characterized previously diagnosed patients with FM (N = 808) as to current criteria status. We measured variable importance by multivariable regression, decomposing regression variance by averaging over model orderings. We examined the distributions of key variables in the various disorders, and the distributions as a function of a FM severity index (fibromyalgianess).

Results

Out of 9 measures, pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index, and fatigue explained more than 50% of explainable variance (50.49%-56.59%). Explained variance was similar across all disorders and diagnostic groups. In addition, the SF-36 physical component summary score varied across disorders as a function of fibromyalgianess.

Conclusion

The main determinants of global severity and HRQOL in FM are pain, function, and fatigue. But these variables are also the main determinants in RA and other rheumatic diseases. The content and impact of FM, whether measured by discrete variables or a fibromyalgianess scale, seems to be independent of diagnosis. These data argue for a common set of variables rather than disease-specific variables. Clinical use is supported and enhanced by simple measures.

### Fibromyalgia position paper [^67922361]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome is one of the most common causes of chronic widespread pain, but pain accompanies a wide range of ancillary symptoms. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains elusive, and diagnosis is exquisitely clinical, due to the lack of biomarkers or specific laboratory alterations in fibromyalgia patients. This position paper has the purpose to summarise the current scientific knowledge and expert opinions about the main controversies regarding fibromyalgia syndrome, namely: (i) fibromyalgia definition and why it is still not recognised in many countries as a distinct clinical entity; (ii) fibromyalgia severity and how to evaluate treatment outcome; (iii) how to treat fibromyalgia and which is a correct approach to fibromyalgia patients.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of chronic widespread pain in the general population [^d3e6dc1f]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a condition characterized by long-standing diffuse musculoskeletal pain and frequently associated with other physical symptoms such as fatigue, psychological distress, and concentration problems. In the American College of Rheumatology 1990 (ACR-1990) definition, CWP is the fundamental feature of fibromyalgia (FM) and is defined as pain lasting 3 months or longer, located axially (cervical spine, thoracic spine, anterior chest, or low back), above and below the waist, and on the left and right sides of the body.

In 2010, the ACR published an alternative set of criteria (ACR-2010), meant to be used clinically, which emphasized the importance of somatic symptoms (eg, fatigue, waking unrefreshed) that have been associated with FM. The ACR-2010 criteria dispensed with tender-point examination and instead used a measure of the widespreadness of pain and a measure of the number of somatic symptoms experienced, such as fatigue and cognitive impairment. The new criteria place FM at one extreme on a spectrum of polysymptomatic distress that includes CWP.

Although studies have reported the prevalence of CWP in different populations, there has been no attempt to consolidate these studies to derive a robust prevalence estimate of CWP or to assess how this is influenced by sociodemographic factors. There have been 3 systematic reviews and 2 narrative reviews of the prevalence of "chronic pain", and 1 study has summarized the reported prevalence of CWP from 16 population studies but was not a systematic review and did not attempt a meta-analysis. Ascertaining the population prevalence of CWP has important public health implications. It is difficult to justify and plan interventions for conditions with an unknown community burden. Furthermore, clinicians take into account estimates of disease prevalence in different groups of the population (age, sex, ethnicity) when formulating differential diagnoses. Investigating how prevalence varies according to features such as age, sex, and geographical location offers insights into possible aetiology.

We aimed to systematically review the existing literature that presents estimates for CWP prevalence in the adult general population. We chose to limit our review to studies using ACR criteria to define CWP to ensure that prevalence estimates were comparable. The ACR-1990 criteria were selected as an established and widely used measure of CWP diagnosis. However, we also chose to include the more recent ACR-2010 criteria to investigate variation in prevalence based on the 2 ACR CWP case definitions. We explored variation in prevalence estimates by age, sex, and geographical location.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^53eaf564]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Identification of a potential fibromyalgia diagnosis using random forest modeling applied to electronic medical records [^7f13cb5c]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, complex musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread pain generally defined as bilateral pain both above and below the waist and includes axial skeletal pain. It has been well established that FM is associated with reduced patient function and quality of life as well as substantial health care resource utilization and associated costs.–

Diagnosis of FM has conventionally been based on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, which was updated in 2010 by adding a symptom severity assessment, a widespread pain index, and eliminating the need for a tender point examination. Despite these diagnostic criteria and the development of tools that may be useful to screen patients for the presence of FM,–diagnosis remains challenging, and patients tend to cycle through the health care system for years before being diagnosed with FM.–

The challenge of accurately diagnosing FM arises in part from the presence of a variety of symptoms in addition to pain, such as sleep disturbance, headache, and fatigue, as well as an association of FM with several comorbidities that include mood disorders, sleep disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome. Thus, a search for specific characteristics or predictors of developing FM has been considered an important component of increasing the diagnostic accuracy and improving patient management. In the search for predictors, several studies have identified somatic symptoms, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors, fatigue, sleep problems, and workplace stress as significant precursors of widespread pain.–Another study that further explored predictors of FM identified several potential variables, including socioeconomic status, psychological distress, comorbidity, and rheumatoid arthritis severity. However, that study only evaluated FM development in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which may not necessarily reflect onset of FM in a broader population. The need to identify FM predictors was further emphasized in a recent narrative review of predictive FM studies. The review discussed the association of FM with potential biological markers and clinical characteristics, but also highlighted the complexity of determining the importance of these variables as predictors, suggesting that additional studies or new approaches may be needed.

### Low back pain in older adults-the need for specific outcome and psychometric tools [^ec144e5e]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Comprehensive history taking and physical examinations are essential for making differential diagnoses for seniors with LBP. Specifically, the history of present illness should focus on the nature, location, severity, onset, and chronicity of LBP. The aggravating and easing factors of LBP should be asked for, to help differentiate between mechanical and nonmechanical LBP. Potential "red flags" (eg, fever, night pain, radiating pain/numbness, general malaise, weight loss, colicky/abdominal pain, and urinary and/or bowel incontinence) should be questioned to rule out specific pathology. Since physical, mental, and psychological comorbidities, can adversely affect LBP prognosis in seniors, the past medical history of patients should also be taken.

Although many self-reported LBP-related questionnaires have been developed to evaluate the impacts of LBP on working-age patients, only a few of them (eg, modified Oswestry disability index and Quebec Back Pain Disability questionnaires) have been validated in seniors. Because the physical and psychosocial challenges encountered by community-dwelling/institutionalized older adults significantly differ from those faced by young adults, appropriate LBP outcome measures should be developed/adopted to evaluate age-specific LBP conditions of geriatric patients.

Aside from self-reported measurements, physical examinations of the lumbar region are commonly used to identify spinal anomalies, while neurological examinations (eg, reflex, muscle strength, sensation, or straight leg raising) are applied to evaluate neurological deficits. Further, physical examinations can be used to diagnose sacroiliac joint syndrome, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, or hip problems without using medical imaging. If there are signs of sphincter dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, acute neurologic deterioration, or nerve compression, further imaging and emergency surgical managements are indicated. Similarly, patients with unrelenting pain, fever, shock, diaphoresis, and a recent acute trauma may require additional investigations to exclude specific pathology. Since many geriatric patients with LBP experience musculoskeletal comorbidity, successful identification and treatment of concomitant disorders can reduce patients' long-term disability and health-related quality of life.

Physical Examinations

The physical examinations need to be done last, because exercise may induce pain to worsen to the extent that the relevant questionnaire is affected.
Digit Span Test (DST): DST is a neuropsychological assessment that evaluates short-term attention and working memory through two tasks: digit span forward and digit span backward. In the forward task, participants repeat a sequence of digits, while in the backward task, they repeat the same digits in reverse order. Higher DST scores are indicative of better performance. For FMS patients, cognitive symptoms, often called "fibro fog", can impact memory and concentration, making the DST useful for evaluating these cognitive limitations. Studies indicate that patients with FMS tend to show reduced performance on DST, highlighting attention and working memory deficits which are part of the cognitive challenges faced by individuals with FMS.
Five Times Sit to Stand Test(FTSTS): The FTSTS is a validated functional assessment tool used to quantitatively evaluate lower body strength, endurance, and flexibility by measuring the time required for an individual to rise from a seated position to standing and return to sitting five times consecutively. In patients with FMS, who commonly experience compromised muscle endurance and chronic fatigue, FTSTS serves as an objective indicator of functional mobility and physical endurance, both of which are typically reduced in this population. Additionally, diminished performance on the FTSTS in FMS patients has been correlated with an elevated risk of falls, attributable to muscle weakness and balance impairments associated with the condition. Consequently, FTSTS results can provide valuable insights into the physical limitations and fall risks inherent in FMS, aiding in the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and guiding targeted interventions for mobility and stability improvement in these patients.
Single-Leg Stand Test (SLS): The SLS is a straightforward clinical assessment tool that evaluates balance, lower limb strength, and proprioception. In this test, patients are instructed to maintain stability while standing on one leg for a designated period, allowing for the assessment of neuromuscular control. The SLS is widely utilized in orthopedic and neurological assessments as well as in fall-risk evaluations. This test is particularly relevant in the context of FMS, where impairments in static balance and postural control are common. A small randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 2016 indicated that patients with FMS exhibit poorer bilateral coordination than control subjects, further underscoring the utility of the SLS in evaluating balance deficits and neuromuscular function in this population.

### Progression of fibromyalgia: results from a 2-year observational fibromyalgia and chronic pain study in the US [^c5b6937f]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Physicians at the study site were trained on the manual tender pointand blood pressure cuff examination, two objective measures, in order to assess the level of FM pain. Physicians also reported treating at least ten FM patients on average each month in their practice. During the site visit, physicians completed an FM assessment, including a tender point examinationand blood pressure cuff examination. Physicians based the diagnosis of FM on their clinical impression of the subject following the assessment.

After the site visit, subjects completed an online questionnaire that included questions to capture subject demographics, comorbidities, and other clinical characteristics; health care resource utilization; and several validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. This questionnaire included the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF), an 11-item measure to assess pain severity and interference (with function (scored on 0–10 scale with higher scores indicating worse outcomes; Pain Severity Index comprised pain at its worst, least, average, and right now; Pain Interference (with function) Index comprised general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life); the modified (self-report) ACR 2010 Criteria, a three-item measure to assess FM symptoms and pain locations (total modified ACR 2010 Criteria scored on 0–31 scale with higher scores indicating worse outcomes); the Medical Outcomes Study – Sleep Scale, a 12-item measure of sleep outcomes (Overall Sleep Problem Index based on nine items; scored on a 0–100 scale with higher scores indicating more sleep problems); and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-12v2) to assess physical and mental health statuses (scored on a 0–100 scale with higher scores indicating better outcomes; Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores based on eight domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health).

### Fibromyalgia [^f2401572]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common illness characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep problems (including unrefreshing sleep), physical exhaustion and cognitive difficulties. The definition, pathogenesis and treatment are controversial, and some even contest the existence of this disorder. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) defined classification criteria that required multiple tender points (areas of tenderness occurring in muscles and muscle-tendon junctions) and chronic widespread pain. In 2010, the ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties. Fibromyalgia occurs in all populations worldwide, and symptom prevalence ranges between 2% and 4% in the general population. The prevalence of people who are actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia ('administrative prevalence') is much lower. A model of fibromyalgia pathogenesis has been suggested in which biological and psychosocial variables interact to influence the predisposition, triggering and aggravation of a chronic disease, but the details are unclear. Diagnosis requires the history of a typical cluster of symptoms and the exclusion of a somatic disease that sufficiently explains the symptoms by medical examination. Current evidence-based guidelines emphasize the value of multimodal treatments, which encompass both non-pharmacological and selected pharmacological treatments tailored to individual symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep problems and mood problems.

### A comprehensive medical evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [^b7fd9637]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common and distressful condition. It is imperative that all physicians do their best to help these suffering patients with understanding and respect, since the primary responsibility of a physician is to ameliorate suffering of a patient, irrespective of the type of the disease or the illness. (The authors use the terms "disease" and "illness" synonymously, since any distinction between these two terms are really pointless because the word "disease" means lack of ease or presence of suffering.) It is clear that a physician cannot optimize management of a patient with FMS without a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation. A good evaluation helps to make a proper diagnosis, assess severity, recognize aggravating and relieving factors of symptoms, appraise psychologic factors, evaluate relevant associated or concomitant conditions, document individualized problems in a given patient, and subsequently formulate proper and individualized management. This article focuses on the major elements of a comprehensive medical evaluation, with some reference to psychologic aspects — are covered in detail in the article by Turk et al in this issue.

### Aftersensations and lingering pain after examination in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [^118f698e]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic widespread pain condition of uncertain etiology. FMS pain, associated tenderness, and fatigue often have a devastating impact on patients' function, activity, and quality of life. FMS has been classically viewed as a pain state with central amplification. However, there is also mounting evidence of peripheral abnormalities, including small-fiber pathology with abnormal nociceptor function and abnormal thermoregulatory peripheral innervations.

In patients with FMS, quantitative sensory testing (QST) demonstrates marked hypersensitivity to a broad spectrum of standardized stimuli; such hypersensitivity is established by registering the patient's evaluation of the stimulus while it is applied. Patients' blunt pressure pain thresholds are typically reduced, which is termed static mechanical allodynia, but gentle brushstroke alone can induce pain, or dynamic mechanical allodynia, in 10–20%. In relation to noxious thermal stimuli (i.e. stimuli that would be painful in normal skin), patients with FMS, similar to patients with other chronic pain conditions, can report painful aftersensations (PAS), i.e. sensations that persist even though application of the stimulus has ceased. In FMS, such PAS occur in up to 83% of cases after noxious thermal stimuli (e.g. 49.5°C to 51.5°C), with the remainder of patients experiencing nonpainful aftersensations. Thermal PAS also occur in healthy individuals at a frequency of 20% to 37%, but aside from being more common in FMS, they are more painful and longer-lasting in FMS. After noxious mechanical pressure cuff stimuli, PAS also occur at an increased frequency in FMS, at 50% in patients with FMS vs 12% in controls, and are correlated with clinical pain intensity.

Anecdotally, other types of skin stimuli can also elicit painful aftersensations in patients with FMS; for example, in our practice, tender point testing required for the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic protocol seems to cause long-lasting pain increases at the testing sites. To our knowledge, no quantitative or qualitative data on aftersensations after brushstroke stimuli have been published. Our goals in the present study were to describe, in patients with persistent FMS, aftersensations arising from aspects of mechanical QST assessment and from clinical examination as per ACR 1990, as well as to characterize subgroups formed on the basis of these phenomena. Here, we report on aftersensations after application of both blunt mechanical pressure and brushstroke in a cohort of patients with FMS.

### Fibromyalgia: an afferent processing disorder leading to a complex pain generalized syndrome [^60a522ff]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a condition which appears to involve disordered central afferent processing. The major symptoms of fibromyalgia include multifocal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive or memory problems. Other symptoms may include psychological distress, impaired functioning, and sexual dysfunction. The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains uncertain but is believed to be largely central in nature. In 1990 the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published diagnostic research criteria for fibromyalgia. The criteria included a history of chronic and widespread pain and the presence of 11 or more out of 18 tender points. Pain was considered chronic widespread when all of the following are present: pain in the left side of the body; pain in the right side of the body; pain above the waist; pain below the waist. In addition, axial skeletal pain must be present and the duration of pain must be more than 3 months. A tender point is considered positive when pain can be elicited by pressures of 4 kg/cm2 or less. For tender points to be considered positive, the patient must perceive the palpation as painful; tenderness to palpation is not sufficient. However, over the next 20 years it became increasingly appreciated that the focus on tender points was not justified. In 2010 a similar group of investigators performed a multicenter study of 829 previously diagnosed fibromyalgia patients and controls using physician physical and interview examinations, including a widespread pain index (WPI), a measure of the number of painful body regions. Random forest and recursive partitioning analyses were used to guide the development of a case definition of fibromyalgia, to develop new preliminary ACR diagnostic criteria, and to construct a symptom severity (SS) scale. The most important diagnostic variables were WPI and categorical scales for cognitive symptoms, un-refreshed sleep, fatigue, and number of somatic symptoms. The categorical scales were summed to create an SS scale. The investigators combined the SS scale and the WPI to recommend a new case definition of fibromyalgia: (WPI ≥ 7 AND SS ≥ 5). Although there is no known cure for fibromyalgia, multidisciplinary team efforts using combined treatment approaches, including patient education, aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapies (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [e.g., duloxetine, milnacipran] and alpha 2-delta receptor ligands [e.g., pregabalin]) might improve symptoms as well as function in patients with fibromyalgia.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^28a2be57]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia" for fibromyalgia.

The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. The criteria are designed to provide a standardized approach to diagnosis, facilitating early intervention and management.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria include the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score. The WPI assesses the number of areas in which the patient has experienced pain over the past week, while the SSS score evaluates the severity of three common symptoms: fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria are met if the patient has a WPI of 7 or more and an SSS score of 5 or more, and these symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, with no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. Alternatively, the criteria are also met if the patient has a WPI between 3 and 6 and an SSS score of 9 or more, with the same conditions regarding symptom duration and exclusion of other disorders.

These criteria provide a comprehensive and objective measure for diagnosing fibromyalgia, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and treatment.

The diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia helps determine if a person meets the criteria for a diagnosis by evaluating specific conditions. Here's how it works:

- The tool considers the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity (SS) scale scores in two scenarios:

- WPI of 7 or more and an SS score of 5 or more.
- WPI between 3 and 6 and an SS score of 9 or more.

- It also considers whether the symptoms have persisted at a similar level for at least three months.

- Additionally, it verifies that no other disorder explains the pain.

To determine if the diagnostic criteria are met, the tool checks the following conditions:

- The first condition is met if WPI is 7 or more, SS score is 5 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

- The second condition is met if WPI is between 3 and 6, SS score is 9 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

If either of these conditions is satisfied, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are met. Otherwise, it concludes that they are not met. This approach systematically uses established measurements to assess whether a fibromyalgia diagnosis is justified based on pain index, severity, duration, and exclusion of other disorders.

### Which kind of exercise is best in fibromyalgia therapeutic programmes? A practical review [^b13026fb]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

All of the specialists who deal in some way with fibromyalgia (FM) broadly agree that physical reconditioning programmes are useful, but it is not yet clear what type of physical activity is the most appropriate for different subsets of patients. The aim of this review was to examine the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1985 and August 2010 whose outcome measures indicate the effectiveness of different types of physical exercise (PE) on the main health domains affected by FM: pain, and physical and mental function. Studies that simultaneously used different types of PE or multimodal treatment strategies were excluded from the analysis, as were those in which the primary and secondary endpoints prevented any assessment of treatment efficacy in all three health domains. Twenty-seven studies were selected: 15 considered land-based physical aerobic exercise (PAE); seven exercises in water; and five muscle strengthening exercise (MSE). There was substantial uniformity in assessing the effectiveness of land- or water-based PAE and MSE in improving aerobic physical fitness (PF) and functional state. Water-based PAE offers some advantages over similarly intense land-based PAE in reducing spontaneous pain and improving depressive symptoms, but the data are insufficient to establish its overall superiority. Regardless of method, the latest findings concerning the neurophysiology of nociception indicate the fundamental importance of assigning workloads that do not exacerbate post-exercise pain.

### Evaluation of the accuracy of several symptoms and domains in distinguishing patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia from healthy controls [^7408d294]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the discriminative power of several symptoms and domains that may assist in the diagnosis of subjects with Fibromyalgia (FM).

Methods

79 individuals with FM and 66 healthy controls participated in the study. The potential domains proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were considered (Wolfe et al., 1990). Binary logistic regression and area under a ROC curve (AUC) were used to rank the importance of the variables in distinguishing patients from pain-free controls. Z values were then calculated to compare the AUC values obtained for each variable with that which yielded the highest AUC (reference standard). For each measure, the cut-offs that maximise sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.

Results

The mean pressure pain threshold (PPT) yielded the highest discriminative power (AUC, 0.991) and was therefore chosen as the reference standard; considering an optimal cut- off ≤ 3.97, it correctly classified 95% of patients and 97% of controls. The discriminative powers of tender point count (cut-off ≥ 9), health-related quality of life (cut-off ≤ 63.27) and vitality (cut-off ≤ 46.97) were as good as that of the reference standard. Finally, items related to physical role and function, body pain, fatigue and memory loss showed adequate discriminative power, although slightly lower than that of the reference.

Conclusions

In addition to pain, health-related quality of life and fatigue/vitality were confirmed as the best predictors of individuals with FM. The study findings indicate that tender point count and especially pressure pain threshold (measured with an algometer) continue to be key issues in the clinical assessment of subjects with FM relative to pain-free controls.

### Prevalence of fibromyalgia in pharmacy professionals and students: a cross-sectional study [^a0b6450a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as chronic widespread pain and tenderness in at least 11 of 18 defined tender points for at least three months.FM is considered the second most common rheumatic disorder after osteoarthritis, affecting 5% of all women in the USA and 4.7% in European countries. The specific aetiology of FM is not clearly understood. People with FM report a wide array of somatic and psychological symptoms, including pain, fatigue, headache, unrefreshing sleep, depression and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms have a substantial effect on physical functioning and may result in disabilities, resulting in limited social participation. Moreover, a massive impact on the quality of life, productivity and absenteeismhas been found with a substantial economic burden on healthcare. Other conditions can coexist with FM, such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, depression and headache.

Patients with FM often lack a diagnosis for years due to the discrepancies in recognising symptoms and in the validity of FM as a diagnosis. The wide array of FM symptoms that may exist with a diversity of rheumatologic, medical or psychological comorbid conditions presents a diagnostic challenge for healthcare practitioners (HCP). The diagnosis is primarily clinically performed by HCPs using the 1990 ACR criteria considered the gold standard. The tender point examination in the 1990 ACR is difficult, rarely performed and mostly conducted incorrectly. The diagnosis of FM has evolved with the development of more practical diagnostic tools. The new tools overcoming the challenge of tender point examination made diagnosing FM possible using simple self-reported questionnaires, such as the preliminary and modified 2010 ACR, the 2016 ACR, the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening Questionnaire (LFESSQ), the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST), and the Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire (FSQ).

### Diagnosis of compressive neuropathies in patients with fibromyalgia [^bc987a5e]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The hand surgeon relies on the Tinel sign in the physical examination of the patient suspected of having a peripheral nerve entrapment. Fibromyalgia is recognized by the American College of Rheumatology as a condition characterized by having tender points on physical examination. This article reviews the location of the 9 bilateral critical diagnostic fibromyalgia points as they relate to known sites of anatomic entrapment of peripheral nerves in the upper extremity. The interpretation of this article is that the Tinel sign may be used with validity to identify the site of a peripheral nerve compression in the upper extremity in the patient with fibromyalgia.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome: evaluation and treatment [^8ebc3b9d]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Severe fatigue is a common complaint among patients. Often, the fatigue is transient or can be attributed to a definable organic illness. Some patients present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.

### Aftersensations and lingering pain after examination in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome [^11f20e62]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Here we report, for the first time, the presence of aftersensations after the cessation of an innocuous light touch stimulus in a cohort of patients with fibromyalgia. When present, these aftersensations are often uncomfortable. We also report on the prevalence of lingering pain after pressure examination. We suggest that these findings have key implications for clinicians examining patients and ramifications for experimental trajectories. The recognition of these aftersensations could reassure patients and inform the advice and education given to them. Further research is, of course, needed to investigate these phenomena in FMS and other chronic pains. In this regard, we note that medical efficacy is contingent on placing patients at the center of diagnostic formulations and the interrogation of etiologies.

### Effects of wearable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial [^7a5cf6f4]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Limitations

This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. There were only 8 male subjects. This makes it difficult to generalize the findings to men, which may account for at least 10% of fibromyalgia cases. Although fibromyalgia was diagnosed by accepted criteria and confirmed by a physician's diagnosis in the medical record, the study did not incorporate an in-person medical history and physical examination. A physical examination is not always necessary to accurately diagnose fibromyalgia, however a concurrent assessment of fibromyalgia may have influenced the makeup of the study population. Data on analgesic use at baseline and changes during the study were collected by self-report, which is subject to recall bias and the ability and willingness of the subjects to provide accurate account. Within these constraints, there was no evidence of group differences at baseline or over the course of the study. Despite being encouraged to not change their fibromyalgia treatments during the study, some subjects may have pursued other non-pharmacological approaches (eg, physical therapy). It is difficult to know how other treatments or environmental factors such as weathermight have affected the study. Outside treatments were found to be evenly divided between the active and sham groups, so one group did not have an advantage in receiving more pain-related treatments compared with the other. Finally, treatment effects may be slightly larger in single-center compared to multi-center RCTs.

### Pitfalls in diagnosing geriatric general pain: coexistence of polymyalgia rheumatism and fibromyalgia [^70094a25]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatism and fibromyalgia are clinically similar. As there are no specific diagnostic markers, they are difficult to distinguish. A 92-year-old woman with a 3-month history of general pain, including left hip pain, was referred to our hospital. Her medical history included polymyalgia rheumatism that had been treated with prednisolone for 18 years. We found 14 of 18 symmetrical tender points. We diagnosed fibromyalgia based on two physical examinations and her personal history of general pain. Pregabalin was prescribed, and her pain gradually disappeared. About a month later, she complained of returned buttock pain and fever. She was diagnosed with exacerbation of polymyalgia rheumatism by various examinations and was treated with prednisolone. We found 3 of 18 asymmetrical tender points. No symptoms had recurred at the 1-month follow-up visit. Her case provides an opportunity to highlight the possible pitfalls when diagnosing geriatric general pain.

Methods

Case Definition/Diagnostic Criteria

The definition of fibromyalgia has an unsettled history. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria of fibromyalgia syndrome have been comprehensively debated and undergone several revisions in the past 30 years. While palpatoric examination of so-called "tender points" (≥ 11 of 18 had to be positive) was crucial for diagnosis for two decades (1990–2010), the current criteria dating from 2016, the latest in a succession of revisions, are based on two self-administered anamnestic scores, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Score (SSS), together subsumed in the Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire (FSQ). The WPI counts the number of painful body parts from 0 to 19. The SSS ranges from 0 to 12 and is the sum of 3 dimensional items scaled 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe/always and referring to: Daily fatigue, waking unrefreshed, cognitive symptoms plus 3 binary yes/no items regarding the presence (= 1)/absence (= 0) of headache, pain and cramps in the lower abdomen, and depression. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia requires chronic pain (≥ 3 months) in 4 of 5 body regions (the 4 quadrants and the spine, assessed by the WPI) together with either (WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5) or (WPI 4–6 and SSS ≥ 9).

### Discriminative value of tender points in fibromyalgia syndrome [^d50546a3]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to assess the discriminative value of all tender points, alone and in combination, that are designated as criteria for fibromyalgia diagnosis by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), by investigating the appropriate pressure magnitude that should be applied during tenderness examination.

Design

Cross-sectional.

Patients

This study was performed on 66 patients with fibromyalgia diagnosed according to ACR classification criteria and 50 control subjects.

Setting

The outpatient rheumatology clinic of a PM&R department of a university hospital. Intervention. Pressure pain threshold values were measured by a dolorimeter on nine specific point pairs in both groups and a cutoff value for discriminating positivity and negativity was calculated for each. Then the most valuable tender point pairs were assessed for discrimination of fibromyalgia syndrome using ACR criteria set as a reference standard.

Results

All tender points with determined pressure cutoff values were found out to significantly discriminate fibromyalgia syndrome and their area under curve values ranged from 0.779 to 0.934. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lateral epicondyle and supraspinatus point pairs had the most powerful discriminative ability (odds ratio = 113.6 and 45.0, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis with backward stepwise method showed that lateral epicondyle and second rib point pairs were most discriminative with sensitivity and specificity rates of 87.9–94.0% and 77.3–84.0%, respectively.

Conclusions

Fibromyalgia syndrome can have potential to be recognized simply by pressing fewer tender point areas but with various pressure cutoff levels identified for each tender point areas.

Clinical Examinations

Both FM and CON underwent a brief clinical examination of heart and lungs, which included recording diastolic and systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) after two minutes of rest in a horizontal position. The proportions with systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg and/or diastolic ≥ 85 mm Hg were determined. In addition, their weight (kg) and height (m) were recorded. Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m 2) was calculated and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: < 18.5 = underweight; 18.5–24.9 = normal range; 25.0–29.9 = overweight; 30.0–34.9 = obesity; and ≥ 35.0 = severe obesity. The clinical examination also ensured that the controls were healthy with respect to anamnesis for rheumatic diseases, neurological diseases, diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases, psychiatric diseases, and high alcohol consumption (ie, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) > 6 according to the recommendations for women).

The clinical examination of the patients ensured that they met the criteria for FM according to the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. The number of tender points were registered both in FM and in CON. The 1990 ACR criteria are based on anamnestic reports and semi-objective examinations of hyperalgesia/allodynia (tender points). Newer criteria (2010/2011 and 2016) based on anamnestic reports have been presented. As we wanted to compare our study with earlier studies and consensus is lacking concerning the 2010–2016 criteria, we chose the 1990 ACR criteria.

Pressure Pain Thresholds

Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were determined using a manual pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Sweden) mounted with a probe (contact area of 1 cm 2) on the muscle belly (for details, see). The erector spinae, tibialis anterior, and trapezius were investigated bilaterally. The pressure was increased by 30 kPa/s until the subject perceived pain, which the subject indicated by pushing a stop button, or until the maximum threshold of 600 kPa was reached. The PPT for each anatomical location was defined as the mean of two trials obtained with a minimum interval of 30s. We used the mean of the six anatomical locations (PPT-tot) as a global measure of pain sensitivity.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^23ef486a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Perform a biopsychosocial assessment and address expectations

Where there is an identifiable cause of chronic pain (eg, diabetes, fibromyalgia), management should proceed as per the current available treatment guidelines with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. However, after appropriate investigations, in patients in whom the cause of chronic pain cannot be determined, repeated radiological and other special investigations are rarely helpful and should be avoided.

Management is guided by careful assessment for the presence of risk factors for chronic pain, psychosocial history, assessment of pain severity and the degree of functional impairment. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is recommended as a simple tool to measure pain intensity and physical and psychosocial components of pain.

Psychosocial and behavioral factors (Box 2) may complicate diagnosis, management and the course of chronic pain, and it is necessary to conduct a careful assessment for these using simple questions (Box 4) and/or self-rating scales (eg, Beck's Depression Inventory). Detailed assessment tools are time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It is important to point out that many of these psychosocial factors are normal psychological processes and/or responses to adversity. However, in some patients they can influence the subjective experience of pain and directly modulate pain pathways leading to maladaptive coping and persistent pain that is apparently non-responsive to treatment. Management in the primary care setting is often sufficient, but if necessary patients should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional.

Box 4
Helpful brief screening questions to identify risk factors for chronic pain, disability and delayed return to work

It is important to explain to patients and their family/caregivers that chronic pain is multifactorial and does not necessarily indicate harm, and also to set realistic expectations in terms of goals of treatment. In chronic pain, complete pain relief is rarely achieved and aims of therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and return to work and physical activity. A clinically meaningful improvement is at least a 30% reduction in pain (or ≥ 2 points on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) and/or 30% improvement in function. Other important outcomes include improvement in sleep and mood, reduced analgesic consumption and reduced health care consultations.

Work absenteeism is associated with low self-esteem, depression, loss of skills, delayed recovery, and in some patients, personal re-identification as a "disabled person". Because the likelihood of returning to work diminishes with increasing duration of absence, it is important to encourage patients who are still working to continue to do so. Those who are off work should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^e9054316]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Another feature linking these two conditions is the inevitable presence of variable levels of pain, tenderness or stiffness in the spinal region on the side of the CRPS. For instance, patients with CRPS affecting the wrist/hand region will also have neck and shoulder girdle signs on the affected side.

Thus both can have variable shared clinical features, such as regional pain, allodynia, and sensory symptoms. In CRPS these are more severe and peripheral but the two conditions are deemed to be on the same spectrum. The more pronounced and more easily defined clinical features of CRPS allow for better validated diagnostic criteria compared to regional pain syndrome.

An additional link between CRPS and other musculoskeletal pain syndromes derives from the 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. These criteria were designed to be more clinically useful for fibromyalgia diagnosis compared to the existing 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. This occurred through the elimination of the need for a certain number of tender points to be present on examination. The tender point requirement was replaced by the number of self-reported painful or tender areas plus a high level of common symptoms, namely sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive problems, as well as adding in the presence of headache, abdominal pain or depression. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed if there are seven or more painful regions and high level of symptoms, or if there are three to six painful regions plus very high levels of the previously mentioned symptoms. Thus these latter criteria for fibromyalgia will include most patients with regional pain syndrome, as these patients have regional pain affecting at least three regions and usually high scores of the designated symptoms. Thus the spectrum of symptoms in CRPS extends to fibromyalgia (Table 6).

There are common mechanisms involved in fibromyalgia and CRPS. These include a number of key neurophysiological mechanisms. The first is that of neuro-inflammation through release of inflammatory mediators predominantly from C-type fibers in the periphery. These mediators include calcitonin gene related peptide, substance P, and neurokinin A, among others. These neuropeptides induce regional inflammation comprising vasodilatation, vascular permeability with regional edema, and egress of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These substances also act to sensitize peripheral pain nerves thus enhancing allodynia. Additional effects involve the innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells. Neuro-inflammation is a key feature of both disorders but seems more intense in a regionalized fashion in CRPS. In both conditions there is significant abnormality in peripheral nociceptive nerve anatomy, particularly the C-fibers. There is decreased density of such fibers in both disorders.

### Gender differences in the presentation of fibromyalgia amongst children who have been maltreated [^83684cbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We thank Professor Martinez-Lavin for his kind opinion on our published work. We agree that further understanding of gender differences in the presentation of physical and psychological illness is extremely important for children who have experienced maltreatment as it may influence risk prediction and subsequent management. Further exploration of this particular point is of interest as our previous work has demonstrated there are gendered differences in the initiation of medications used to treat illness amongst children who have been maltreated. This is of note in this context considering the role of mental ill health in the aetiological pathway associated with fibromyalgia.

In our current study, when examining those without a pre-existing diagnosis of fibromyalgia, we noted that 300 patients exposed to childhood maltreatment were given a new diagnosis of fibromyalgia during the study's follow up time. Of those 300 patients, 269 were female (89.7%) and 31 were male (10.3%). Our findings correlate with Martinez-Lavin's findings suggesting a higher prevalence of female patients presenting with fibromyalgia compared to males. This finding has been replicated in other settings where the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria (not used in our current study) are applied to diagnose fibromyalgia. However, interestingly when using updated diagnostic criteria which do not include the need to conduct tender point examinations the sex ratio begins to get closer to equal. Therefore, we advise exploring this sex difference is needed in more cohorts which apply different diagnostic criteria.

### Prevalence of fibromyalgia in fourteen Korean tertiary care university hospital pain clinics [^769deb43]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a condition characterized by chronic soft tissue pain with a number of comorbidities. Epidemiological studies have reported that the prevalence of FM is ~2%–4% in the general population and is much more common in women than in men, as well as among the elderly.FM is typically associated with chronic widespread pain and tenderness to palpation, resulting from a generalized low pain threshold. Currently, this change in threshold is attributed to changes in various neurotransmitters in patients with a genetic predisposition to FM.

The first uniform diagnostic criteria for FM were developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1990. These 1990 ACR criteria required the presence of at least 11 of 18 specified tender anatomical points upon palpation. Although "palpation" is defined as the application of about 4 kg of force, in clinical practice this procedure may vary depending on the physician. Therefore, this criterion has been criticized as subjective and time-consuming. The 1990 ACR criteria also failed to account for many typical comorbid symptoms experienced by most FM patients. Due to these shortcomings, in 2010, new ACR criteria (2010 ACR criteria), with an emphasis on easy application in clinical practice, were proposed. In these revised 2010 criteria, a widespread pain index (WPI), a specific type of self-report scale, was included in place of the previous tender point diagnostic criteria. A symptom severity (SS) scale was also proposed, with a focus on the comorbid symptoms experienced by FM patients.

### Malingering in the medical setting [^609b2401]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Malingering of mental illness has been studied extensively; however, malingered medical illness has been examined much less avidly. While in theory any ailment can be fabricated or self-induced, pain — including lower back pain, cervical pain, and fibromyalgia — and cognitive deficits associated with mild head trauma or toxic exposure are feigned most frequently, especially in situations where there are financial incentives to malinger. Structured assessments have been developed to help detect both types of malingering; however, in daily practice, the physician should generally suspect malingering when there are tangible incentives and when reported symptoms do not match the physical examination or no organic basis for the physical complaints is found.

### Holocaust survivors: the pain behind the agony. increased prevalence of fibromyalgia among holocaust survivors [^d43e62b5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the frequency of fibromyalgia among a population of Holocaust survivors in Israel as well as the occurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and concurrent psychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety among survivors.

Methods

Eighty-three survivors of the Nazi Holocaust and 65 age-matched individuals not exposed to Nazi occupation were recruited. Physical examination and manual tender point assessment was performed for the establishment of the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and information was collected regarding quality of life (SF-36), physical function and health (FIQ), psychiatric symptoms (SCL-90) and PTSD symptoms (CAPS).

Results

Significantly increased rates of fibromyalgia were identified among Holocaust survivors compared with controls (23.81% vs. 10.94, p < 0.05). Significantly increased rates of posttraumatic symptoms and measures of mental distress were also identified among survivors.

Conclusions

The results indicate a significantly increased prevalence of fibromyalgia among Holocaust survivors six decades after the end of the Second World War. This finding furthers our knowledge regarding the long-term effect of stress on the development of fibromyalgia.

### Widespread pain and low widespread pain index scores among fibromyalgia-positive cases assessed with the 2010 / 2011 fibromyalgia criteria [^81226f90]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Widespread pain is no longer required for fibromyalgia (FM) diagnosis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 preliminary diagnostic criteria and its 2011 modification, but its absence may be of concern. We investigated whether the widespread pain definition was satisfactory and the consequences of having a small number of painful regions or of not satisfying the widespread pain criterion.

Methods

We studied 5011 patients who satisfied the 2011 criteria. FM was identified using the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS): WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5 or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9. Widespread pain was 4 quadrants plus axial pain, according to the 1990 ACR FM criteria.

Results

There were 4700 patients (93.8%) who satisfied the ACR 1990 widespread pain criterion. Using a new strict definition for 5 pain regions based on the WPI sites, a modified widespread pain criterion requiring 4 of 5 regions identified 98.8% of criteria-positive patients. Patients without widespread pain or those in the low WPI/high SSS group had milder FM and no evidence of increased psychological or physical distress.

Conclusion

In usual clinical and epidemiological studies, the 2011 and 2010 criteria work well, but are not as effective in patients with asymmetrical or regional pain who do not satisfy a widespread pain criterion. A ≥ 4-pain region widespread pain definition will eliminate regional pain false-positives and will identify 98.8% of current 2011 cases. Future revisions of the 2010/2011 criteria should consider incorporating the ≥ 4-region requirement to avoid misclassification.

### Fibromyalgia [^87161d6b]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is an idiopathic, chronic, nonarticular pain syndrome with generalized tender points. It is a multisystem disease characterized by sleep disturbance, fatigue, headache, morning stiffness, paresthesias, and anxiety. Nearly 2 percent of the general population in the United States suffers from fibromyalgia, with females of middle age being at increased risk. The diagnosis is primarily based on the presence of widespread pain for a period of at least three months and the presence of 11 tender points among 18 specific anatomic sites. There are certain comorbid conditions that overlap with, and also may be confused with, fibromyalgia. Recently there has been improved recognition and understanding of fibromyalgia. Although there are no guidelines for treatment, there is evidence that a multidimensional approach with patient education, cognitive behavior therapy, exercise, physical therapy, and pharmacologic therapy can be effective.

### 2010 American College of Rheumatology adult fibromyalgia criteria for use in an adolescent female population with juvenile fibromyalgia [^5ebf156c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the utility of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) adult fibromyalgia criteria for use in adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM).

Study Design

Participants included 47 adolescent girls diagnosed with JFM (mean age = 15.3 years) and 48 age- and sex-matched adolescents (mean age = 15.0 years) with localized chronic pain (eg, headaches or abdominal pain). A trained examiner administered the Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity measures and also completed a manual tender point exam. Clinicians completed a form indicating the presence of active JFM per Yunus and Masi (1985) criteria, the only available and most commonly used measure for JFM. Criterion validity analysis was performed as well as t tests comparing symptoms between JFM and controls.

Results

With the Yunus and Masi criteria used as the gold standard, the 2010 ACR fibromyalgia criteria showed a sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity of 87.5%.

Conclusion

The 2010 ACR measure appears to be a valuable tool for the identification of JFM. However, a slight modification to the 2010 ACR measure and inclusion of a clinical exam is recommended.

### Elements of fibromyalgia in an open population [^7922144a]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the nosological concept of fibromyalgia in the general population.

Methods

A postal survey of rheumatic pain and non-specific bodily complaints was sent to all 3174 German female residents of Bad Säckingen, Germany, aged 35 to 74 yr. A stratified random sample of 653 subjects was further examined in a clinical survey.

Results

On the population level the point prevalence of chronic widespread pain was 13.5%. In the clinical survey, tender point count was associated not only with the extent of rheumatic pain, but also independently with the extent of bodily complaints. Subjects with no history of rheumatic pain but with non-specific bodily complaints had as many positive tender points as subjects without bodily complaints but with a history of rheumatic pain. Subjects could be identified who met the tender point criterion of the ACR without a history of widespread pain. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that some symptoms carry a risk for positive tender points (low physical mobility, pain, bodily complaints) and some for chronic widespread pain (poor health status, catastrophizing, emotional reactions, low energy level, sleep disturbances) that are independent of each other and of age.

Conclusions

The results do not only question the relevance and specificity of a history of widespread pain in diagnosing fibromyalgia, but also the concept of fibromyalgia as a distinct rheumatological disorder. The results support the concept of fibromyalgia as part of a wider spectrum of dysfunctional syndromes.

Diagnostic criteria for JPFS

Yunus and Masi were the first to propose criteria for JPFS, in 1985 (Table 2). Although they have never been validated, to date they are the only criteria specifically developed for diagnosing FM in the pediatric population and are commonly used by pediatric rheumatologists. Other sets of criteria were developed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for the diagnosis of FM in adults. Although the 1990 ACR criteria were used to evaluate JPFS, they were never validated in the pediatric population. In 2010, the ACR suggested new criteria for the clinical diagnosis of FM in adults. These criteria were evaluated for use in the diagnosis of JPFS in adolescent females, with the Yunus and Masi criteria as the gold standard, and found to have a sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity of 87.5%, suggesting that they can be applied to this population. Notable advantages of the 2010 ACR criteria over the Yunus and Masi or the 1990 ACR criteria, include assessment of symptom severity and of additional somatic FM symptoms, ease and rapidity of use, and elimination of the TP examination (which has been criticized due to its subjectivity and inconsistent administration and results). The ACR adult criteria were revised in 2010/2011 and in 2016, but they have not been evaluated for use in the pediatric FM population.

Table 2
Yunus and Masi suggested diagnostic criteria for Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome

a Yunus and Masi listed 31 tender points. However, after the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria were published, most rheumatologists use the 18 tender points suggested there: occiput, low cervical, trapezius, supraspinatus, second costochondral junction, lateral epicondyles, gluteal folds, posterior greater trochanter and the medial knee fat pad

Most recently, in 2018, the American Pain Society with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks developed and published a new set of criteria for diagnosing FM in adults. However, they have yet to be validated, and their application to pediatric FM cases has not been studied.

To date, there are no gold standard criteria for the diagnosis of JPFS, and no consensus among pediatric rheumatologists as to which of the existing criteria should be used. Furthermore, the diagnosis of JPFS is fluid, as symptoms may change or evolve over time. Thus, children with diffuse idiopathic pain should be reassessed periodically by their rheumatologist.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^f94e2727]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing problem with diagnosing fibromyalgia by the ACR criteria

Since their inception in 1990, criteria for the diagnosis of the fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) have been discussed controversially.–Recent literature has highlighted current uncertainty and skepticism of the diagnosis of FM in the general medical community. Aiming to overcome previous shortcomings, experts proposed new diagnostic criteria for FM to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2010, with a revised version subsequently published in 2011. Both the 2010 and 2011 criteria are based on satisfying one of two numerical cut-off combinations of the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). The WPI is an inventory of the occurrence of pain in 19 defined body locations. The SSS contains the four items fatigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive symptoms and an item comprising a multiplicity of other concomitant symptoms.

Even though the 2010/2011 criteria are easy-to-administer, uncertainty remained regarding its clinical validity. Concerns raised were a) the lack of any pathophysiological disease concept underlying the criteria; b) exclusive reliance on self-reported symptoms; c) inconclusive recommendations for their use in overlapping rheumatological diseases, and d) insufficient diagnostic specificity and differentiation from localized functional pain syndromes.

In a previous study, the limitations of the ACR criteria 2010/2011 were examined in relation to other functional pain syndromes. By realizing the latter diagnostic deficit of the ACR criteria 2010/2011, Wolfe and colleagues aimed to increase specificity by (re-)defining FM as a generalized pain syndrome in 2016. Additively to the SSS and WPI scores, they reintroduced a widespread pain criterion (whole-body pain with pain in at least 4 of 5 defined body regions), while retaining the arguably redundant WPI-limit, which overlaps with the reintroduced widespread pain criterion. To summarize, in 2016 FM still appears as a "non-clinical diagnosis", emerged out of 3 checklists (with many redundancies) and without any visible underlying pathophysiological concept. Therefore, we fear that the acceptance and communicability of FM criteria remain limited. We believe that despite the ACR's decision in 2015 "to cease funding and endorsing research on further diagnostic criteria", the FM diagnosis still needs optimization.

Baseline clinic examination

The baseline examination at the IFAR clinical research center was conducted by experienced research nurses trained in the administration of the complex battery of clinical and performance measures. The intensive assessment was carefully paced to allow rest periods, avoid rushing and prevent excessive burden to participants.

Musculoskeletal examination

The primary purpose of the musculoskeletal exam was to assess the American College of Rheumatology's clinical criteria for hip, knee, and hand osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia, for subsequent adjudication by the study rheumatologist. The assessment included observation and movement of hands, wrists, hips, knees, and feet for joint tenderness and swelling, and pain on movement. In addition, we evaluated hip and knee range of motion using a goniometer and inclinometer and assessed for knee angular deformities. The manual tender point exam of 18 tender points assessed criteria for fibromyalgia. Staff were trained by physician specialists (rheumatologist and physiatrist) and certified by demonstrating proficiency in conducting the assessments. An initial reliability study was conducted using 20 elderly volunteers, respectively, to assess inter-rater reliability of the musculoskeletal and tender point exams, and to determine areas of the exams that required further staff training and clarifications to the protocols. Following the additional training, a second reliability study was conducted using 29 volunteers; all measures generally showed good to very good agreement, with kappa statistics ranging from 0.40 to 0.76. Staff have been recertified annually by the trainers in each of the musculoskeletal exam measures.

### Comorbid conditions… [^f8b5080d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

2 Assessment of physical activity is important because functional impairment is common in patients with fibromyalgia. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire is a useful tool in assessing functional abilities in daily life and measures patient status, progress, and outcomes. 8 It is a self-administered instrument that is composed of 10 items and can be completed in about 10 minutes. This questionnaire has been translated into numerous languages and has been shown to retain its validity.
8. Diagnosis Fibromyalgia is not a diagnosis of exclusion and should be identified by its own characteristics. The ACR criteria have two components: widespread pain involving both sides of the body, above and below the waist as well as the axial skeletal system, for at least three months; and presence of 11 tender points among the nine pairs of specified sites as shown in. Figure 1.

2 An important portion of the physical examination for a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is to systematically palpate the 18 sites. 2 A moderate and consistent degree of pressure should be used in digital palpation of these tender points. The amount of force applied should be 8. 8 lb, which should just blanch the examiner's thumbnail. This amount of pressure does not produce significant tenderness or pain in patients without fibromyalgia. The Manual Tender Point Survey describes the pressure application technique and the precise identification of survey sites.
12. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings from the history and physical examination, with diagnostic testing having a limited role.

Although routine tests of complete blood count and thyroid-stimulating hormone and a comprehensive metabolic panel can be performed to rule out other pathology, additional tests are not recommended for a diagnosis unless they are clinically indicated. Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia includes myofascial pain syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and hypothyroidism. These conditions also can affect patients with fibromyalgia, thereby making the diagnosis more difficult. Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by painful, tender areas in the muscles. It is a localized disorder without any systemic manifestations. It commonly affects the axial muscles. In contrast to the widespread pain of fibromyalgia, the pain in myofascial pain syndrome arises from trigger points in individual muscles. On examination, the presence of trigger points is characteristic of myofascial pain syndrome.

### Prevalence of axial spondyloarthritis among patients with fibromyalgia: a magnetic resonance imaging study with application of the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society classification criteria [^496e83d9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of sacroiliitis, the radiographic hallmark of inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, among patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), using the current Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria and magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

Patients experiencing FMS (American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria) were interviewed regarding the presence of spondyloarthritis (SpA) features and underwent HLA-B27 testing, C-reactive protein (CRP) level measurement, and magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the sacroiliac joints. FMS severity was assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 health survey. SpA severity was assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index.

Results

Sacroiliitis was demonstrated among 8 patients (8.1%) and ASAS criteria for diagnosis of axial SpA were met in 10 patients (10.2%). Imaging changes suggestive of inflammatory involvement (e.g., erosions and subchondral sclerosis) were demonstrated in 15 patients (17%) and 22 patients (25%), respectively. The diagnosis of axial SpA was positively correlated with increased CRP level and with physical role limitation at recruitment.

Conclusion

Imaging changes suggestive of axial SpA were common among patients with a diagnosis of FMS. These findings suggest that FMS may mask an underlying axial SpA, a diagnosis with important therapeutic implications. Physicians involved in the management of FMS should remain vigilant to the possibility of underlying inflammatory disorders and actively search for such comorbidities.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^a93ab4da]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Alternatives in diagnosing FM are needed

Analogous to the Complex Regional Pain Syndromes (CRPS), we support the paradigm which defines FM as a Complex Generalized Pain Syndrome (CGPS). Neurogenic inflammatory modulation processes have been demonstrated to play a role in both CRPS and FM. However, for both pain disorders there is no generally accepted neurochemical surrogate-marker to identify the disorders (yet). Subsequently, the diagnosis must further be made phenotypically. Analogous to the "Budapest Criteria" for CRPS, the "ABC Indicators" presented in this study introduce a method to diagnose FM phenotypically. By retaining the SSS, they reflect a possible further development of the 2011 ACR criteria.

However, before proposing new ways to optimize FM diagnosis, the function of the medical-diagnostic process of FM criteria must undoubtedly be clarified: As experts share the opinion that FM may occur alongside, for example, rheumatological diseases, FM may neither represent an exclusion diagnosis, nor a residual category within rheumatological diseases (Figure 1).–

Figure 1
The fibromyalgia syndrome and the ABC indicators within the context of functional pain syndromes and rheumatological diseases.

Based on the above-mentioned possibility of a comorbid rheumatological disorder, peripheral biomorphologic pain correlates must be identified or ruled out in clinical practice, as is the case with any other complex pain syndrome.

Additionally and independent of this first step, patients should be tested specifically for FM symptoms. In absence of a simple diagnostic surrogate-marker-test for FM, patients should be tested for positive clinical characteristics of FM. These clinical indicators should be in line with the current medical understanding of the syndrome. The combination of the indicators should capture the clinical phenotype of FM as accurately as possible and correctly identify it within the spectrum of other pain syndromes.

### Progression of fibromyalgia: results from a 2-year observational fibromyalgia and chronic pain study in the US [^58173d9e]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Of the patients in our study who no longer met the study definition of FM, only one patient stopped taking a medication class; the majority of changes in medication use between assessments were the initiation of new medication classes. This could suggest that initiation of new medications may have contributed to symptom relief and some subjects no longer meeting study definition for FM. Proactive management (both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) in the first years after diagnosis could influence long-term outcomes in some FM patients, though additional research on this topic is needed.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of the current study include the geographically diverse study sites and sample, the in-person evaluation by the same site at baseline and follow-up, and administration of the same validated PRO measures at both assessments, which allowed for an assessment of the characteristics of the transition groups. The findings point to the value of PRO measures, among many other diagnostic and clinical tools, in helping clinicians identify patients at risk of developing FM. In addition to the data on FM subjects, the study provides data on the transitions into and out of the FM+CWP+ group. However, due to the small sample sizes in each of the transition status groups, the presented results are descriptive and not inferential.

As a result of the requirements of the Institutional Review Board to disclose the purpose of the study in the email invitation and informed consent, the response at baseline may have been higher among those with chronic pain, FM, or both, despite language in the informed consent designed to encourage participation of those without chronic pain. Although the overall estimated FM prevalence was higher than some previous estimates, the characteristics of our FM sample were similar to other FM samples in the literature.,

Participants were contacted with an invitation to participate in a follow-up assessment just prior to follow-up data collection. As such, additional contact information was not collected at baseline, which limited our ability to recontact some of the subjects at follow-up. While comparable loss to follow-up has been reported in previous studies,–some other studies have reported higher follow-through.

Finally, for the most part, subjects were not treated by the study sites between baseline and follow-up assessments; physicians made FM diagnoses at baseline and follow-up based on their examination of the subjects without detailed knowledge of the patient's medical history or previous and current therapies.

A demographic form regarding the participant's age, sex, race and ethnicity was completed by the parent(s).

Tender point assessment (pain sensitivity)

An 18-count TP examination, as described in the ACR criteria for FM, was performed by a trained pediatric rheumatologist. A dolorimeter (Pain Diagnostics & Treatment Inc. Great Neck, NY) with a 1 cm rubber tip was applied at a rate of 1 kg/cm 2 of pressure per second. The participant was asked to inform the evaluator the point at which pain (not pressure) was felt and this pain threshold, from 1 to > 4 kg/cm 2, was noted for each of the 18 TP sites. An average TP score (pain threshold) based upon the 18 points was calculated, with lower scores indicating greater pain sensitivity. The total number of positive (score of < 4 kg/cm 2) painful TPs was also recorded.

Pain rating (VAS)

For one week prior to their assessment visit, adolescents completed a diary rating of their average level of pain each day using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS, 10 cm horizontal line with no numerical markings). VAS scales are well-validated and widely used in pediatric pain research. The pain VAS scale was anchored with the descriptors of 0 = "no pain" and 10 = "worst possible pain". The average pain rating over the period of one week of daily diaries was used as a measure of self-reported clinical pain intensity.

Medical chart review

Medical charts were reviewed for participant information regarding physical exam findings, including joint HM. HM was defined by each individual clinician's assessment of increased joint laxity (HM noted to be present if found in at least 4 joints). For this preliminary clinical observational study, information about specific standardized criteria for HM (such as Beighton scores) was not available due to variability in clinical documentation in medical records at each site. However, all examining physicians were board certified/eligible pediatric rheumatologists who are trained to use similar criteria for classification of HM in children. Each of the 6 pediatric rheumatologists indicated they used either the Beighton or Carter and Wilkinson criteria (Table 1) for joint hypermobility and documented hypermobility if they met criteria.

### Back pain in children and adolescents [^2af2498e]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Back pain is a relatively common presenting symptom in children and adolescents. Typical causes include muscle strain or spasm, spinal deformities (e.g. Scheuermann kyphosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis), spondylolysis, bulging or herniated intervertebral disks, apophysitis of the iliac crest, and functional pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia. Spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis may present with low back pain and stiffness, which are often worse in the morning. Less common but more serious causes include malignancy and infections. The physical examination should include postural inspection, evaluation for tenderness, range of motion, strength testing, and testing for fractures and nerve impingement. Treatment for patients with muscle strain include relative rest, home-based exercises, physical therapy, and limited use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If findings from the history and physical examination suggest underlying pathology, radiography and laboratory studies are indicated initially; magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or a bone scan may be needed for further evaluation. It is generally accepted that the following factors warrant immediate evaluation: patient age younger than five years, symptoms persisting beyond four weeks, systemic symptoms, nighttime pain, bowel incontinence/urinary retention, or other neurologic symptoms.

### Implications of nerve fiber density on the diagnosis and treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia [^715d08cd]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Juvenile Fibromyalgia

Presentation

JFM presents as chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. This pain is generally diffuse; however, patients can have so-called tender points or specific painful bodily locations, usually several. Symptomatology also includes fatigue. It can be associated with other clinical entities including migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression.

Diagnosis

The literature outlining diagnostic criteria for JFM is limited. When the Yunus and Masi criteria was published in 1985, it was the first guideline for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the pediatric population and remains widely used. More recently, the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Adult Fibromyalgia Criteria was evaluated for use in female pediatric patients.

Under both criteria, diagnosis is symptom-based. The Yunus and Masi criteria stipulates that in order to make a diagnosis of JFM, patients must exhibit generalized musculoskeletal pain at three or more sites, five or more "tender points", and three other minor criteria; four tender points and five minor criteria are also sufficient. The 2010 ACR criteria provides a scoring metric, by which patients are assigned a numerical value based on the number of painful bodily locations and associated symptoms; diagnosis is indicated at a threshold score. The 2010 ACR criteria does away with the tender point exam, which is often criticized as it may be done incorrectly or omitted in clinical practice. Notably, between both criteria, there are no objective measures to diagnose or assess the severity of the condition.

Treatment

Evidence-based treatment of JFM is predominantly non-pharmacologic. Recommended treatments include exercise and physical therapy; however, adherence can be challenging for patients in the long term. Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of JFM.

The evidence regarding the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment is generally poor. There is some evidence that the use of serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be effective in pediatric patients. In adults, tricyclic antidepressants and anti-convulsant drugs such as gabapentin and pregabalin have been used; however, there is no strong evidence for these being used successfully in pediatric patients. Pregabalin specifically was found to not improve morbidity in a statistically significant manner in pediatric patients. Pharmacologic therapy should thus be used sparingly due to lack of evidence regarding efficacy and known adverse effects.

### The spectrum of pediatric amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome [^878d0c35]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study site and participants

This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study of subjects ≤ 18 years old diagnosed with AMPS between January 2015 and July 2019 enrolled in an IRB approved patient registry. This prospective patient registry captures data from patients' initial clinic visit as well as all subsequent follow-up visits and included approximately 96% all new patients. AMPS was defined as pain disproportionate to the stimulus without other medical explanation such as inflammation. The treating pediatric rheumatologist diagnosed AMPS on the basis of physical examination, patient history, and the absence of an underlying condition explaining pain. Juvenile fibromyalgia was defined according to the 2010 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for fibromyalgia in adults. We excluded children with prominent and prolonged autonomic changes seen in CRPS, such as cyanosis, coolness to the extremity, edema or perspiration changes. We included subjects who reported fleeting hot or cold changes, swelling, or other symptoms that were not evidenced on examination and did not fulfill criteria for CRPS. Although CRPS can be included in the entire spectrum of children with chronic non-inflammatory pain, CRPS is generally easily diagnosed. The focus of this study was to concentrate on those who are more difficult to diagnose and who represent a much larger proportion of children presenting with chronic pain.

### Fibromyalgia [^0bf57ea8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and associated fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other cognitive and somatic symptoms. For many patients, these symptoms persist for years and lead to frequent health care use; for some, fibromyalgia and its symptoms can be debilitating. Although many treatments are available, management remains challenging. This article highlights the clinical features of fibromyalgia, discusses diagnostic criteria and their evolution, and reviews treatment options.

### Fibromyalgia predicts increased odds of pain-related addiction exacerbation among individuals with pain and opioid use disorder [^84d97c1b]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

One notable feature of our study that may be considered a limitation or a strength is the use of ACR-FMS in lieu of a provider examination to assess fibromyalgia. The American College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Survey is a validated self-report instrument with excellent sensitivity and specificity for fibromyalgia well-suited to our study design. Although clinician assessment is not necessary to diagnose fibromyalgia with ACR-FMS, such assessment might have provided additional useful data about other pain diagnoses present in the sample. Our findings do not preclude the possibility that other pain conditions might have similar important implications for OUD disease trajectory.

This study has research and clinical implications. We have demonstrated a promising new scale for measuring pain-related OUD exacerbations (PrOUD ES), as well as a novel methodology for studying fibromyalgia in OUD treatment settings where practitioners may lack specialized knowledge of musculoskeletal pain conditions. American College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Survey and PrOUD ES may be considered for use as patient-reported outcome measures in OUD research. Additional studies are needed to further assess the psychometric properties of PrOUD ES and its relationship to pain catastrophizing. The American College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Survey might be useful in epidemiological and community-based studies of OUD, including among non–treatment-seeking populations, to establish the role of fibromyalgia in OUD. Although additional research is needed, these instruments might be useful for identifying patients at risk of pain-related OUD exacerbations.

Enrollment and screening (Visit 0)

After informed consent, the initial standard medical evaluation includes a medical history, physical exam, pregnancy, and urine dipstick tests. Physical evaluation includes height, weight, lying and standing blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature, and body mass index. An RA leads each visit to ensure direct, in-person contact between clinical and study personnel. Once the above information is obtained, a study investigator reviews subject information and performs a routine physical examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, extremities, and abdomen and assesses neurologic function. Particular attention is paid to any neurologic findings (eg, neuropathy, Parkinsonian features) that would require exclusion. Next, the RA and study investigator begin the first of several scripted examinations. Figures 3 and 4 show the locations of points examined for tenderness over the abdominal musculature, the inguinal ligaments, adductor muscles, and the pelvic floor musculature. The abdomen, inguinal region, and adductors are examined by applying 3 kg of force using an algometer (Model FDN-50; Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT, USA). Both the force associated with the first pain experience and a pain score (NRS: 0–10) at 3 kg (or the maximum tolerated force) are recorded. Pelvic floor muscle examination is done using 2 kg finger pressure where the study investigator standardizes the pressure applied by the digit with the algometer prior to starting the examination. The vulvodynia examination involves moving a lubricated cotton-tipped applicator back and forth inside the vagina (reported as a pressure or pain sensation) followed by a standard six-point assessment of the vulvar mucosa. The subject is oriented to the sensation of pin and cotton on the thigh and asked to determine whether similar contact on the vulva is experienced as pin or cotton and to rank any pain on an NRS of 0–10. A diagnosis of vulvodynia requires three or more points ranked at a pain NRS of four or more. The fibromyalgia examination is conducted per American College of Rheumatology criteriausing 4 kg of pressure applied by the thumb standardized against the pressure algometer at standard sites. The fibromyalgia examination is conducted at Visit 0 only for healthy controls – as fibromyalgia is exclusionary for healthy controls – and at Visit 2 for IC/BPS, MPP, and family members. The RA records the subject pain ratings and study investigator comments pertaining to the examination. Based on history, examination, and referring physician records, subjects are grouped as IC/BPS ± MPP, MPP alone, or healthy subject. If the subject qualifies for the study, the RA schedules additional study visits and the subject is sent home with a urine hat and 24-hour voiding diary to be completed before her next visit.

### The Spanish version of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia: reliability and validity assessment [^5d58c1c4]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria for Fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with chronic pain.

Methods

The 2010 ACR Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria for FM were adapted to a Spanish version following the guidelines of the Rheumatology Spanish Society Study Group of FM. Based on the 1990 ACR classi cation criteria for FM, patients with chronic pain were initially divided into two groups: a FM group and another group of non-FM individuals. Patients from the FM group were evaluated by tender points (TP) examination, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Widespread Pain Index (WPI), and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS). The non-FM (control) group included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). They were evaluated by WPI and SSS.

Results

We included 1,169 patients divided into two groups: FM group (n = 803; 777 women and 26 men) and non-FM group (n = 366; 147 patients with RA, and 219 with OA). The median value of TP and FIQ in the FM group was 16 and 74 respectively. The preliminary 2010 ACR criteria were met by 665 (82.8%) FM patients and by 112 (30.6%) patients from the non-FM group (p < 0.0001). Statistically signi cant differences in the number of TP (p < 0.03), FIQ (p < 0.0001), WPI (p < 0.0001) and SSS (p < 0.0001) were observed when FM patients fulfilling the 2010 ACR criteria were compared with the remaining FM patients who did not fulfill these criteria. Sensitivity of the Spanish version of the 2010 ACR criteria was 85.6% (95%CI: 83.1–88.1), speci city 73.2% (95%CI: 68.4–78), positive predictive value 87.7% (95%CI: 85.3–90.1) and negative predictive value 69.4% (95%CI: 64.5–74.2).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that the 2010 ACR Preliminary Diagnostic Criteria for FM may be useful to establish a diagnosis of FM in Spanish individuals with chronic pain.

### Common and contrasting characteristics of the chronic soft-tissue pain conditions fibromyalgia and lipedema [^733ea9a6]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the levels of pain and other signs and symptoms are, on average, worse in fibromyalgia than in lipedema, an overlap between disorders in single cases is possible. The distances measured by the 6MWD were comparable. Compared to the performance on the examiner-based 6MWD (mean distance difference = –12 meters, SMD = –0.09, p = 0.640), results on the SF-36 Physical functioning were much worse self-rated in the fibromyalgia group than in the inpatient lipedema group (mean score difference = –23.2 points, SMD = –0.54, p = 0.004). Five of the ten (50%) items of the SF-36 Physical functioning scale address walking performance. This leads to the hypothesis that the mismatch between subjective and "objective" ratings may also be observed in other health dimensions, such as pain, social function, vitality, and depression (SF-36 Mental health), where persons with fibromyalgia judge themselves sicker than expected, a phenomenon consistently reported in the literature. This phenomenon might point to a relatively unrealistic, pessimistic self-assessment of physical function in fibromyalgia. The discordance between the subjective and objective assessments of physical function was shown to be associated with catastrophizing, which is highly prevalent in fibromyalgia. This is consistent with the typical clinical observation of a discrepancy in fibromyalgia patients between subjectively pronounced impairment and only mildly abnormal signs in physical examination. This may originate in the complex mechanisms of pain centralization and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with sympathetic overactivity. For lipedema, comparable research and findings are lacking.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^96454b9d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia have been subject to debate and controversy for many years. The preliminary diagnostic criteria introduced in 2010 and 2011 have been criticized for different reasons, including questionable diagnostic specificity and a lack of an etiopathogenetic foundation. The "ABC indicators" presented in this study reflect a further development of the 2011 criteria and refer to (A) algesia, (B) bilateral, axial-symmetric pain distribution, and (C) chronic distress.

Patients and methods

We compared the diagnostic performance of the ABC indicators with that of the 2011 criteria by analyzing the data of 409 inpatients with chronic functional pain divided into two subgroups of pain patients: Those with whole-body pain and those with pain not involving the whole body. Under the premise that FM phenotypically represents a whole-body pain disorder, sensitivity, specificity, correct classification and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated.

Results

The 2011 criteria demonstrated a specificity of 68.1%, a sensitivity of 75.5%, a correct classification of 71.0% and a diagnostic odds ratio of 6.56 (CI: 4.17–10.31). The ABC indicators achieved a specificity of 88.3%, a sensitivity of 62.3%, a correct classification of 78.6%, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 12.47 (CI: 7.30–21.28).

Conclusion

The ABC fibromyalgia indicators demonstrated better specificity, lower sensitivity, and better overall diagnostic effectiveness than the original 2011 criteria.

Peripheral joint disease in IBD: study characteristics

Thirty-five of 69 studies (51%) evaluated peripheral joint disease (table 3). SpA criteria (ASAS, ESSG, Amor) were employed to define peripheral disease in 16/35 (46%). Three studies specifically excluded patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or fibromyalgia and six studies recorded the presence OA and/or fibromyalgia. The majority of studies, 26/35 (74%), did not mention whether OA and fibromyalgia were assessed.

Table 3
Study characteristics — studies evaluating peripheral joint disease

Direct rheumatologist involvement was recorded in 28/35 (80%) studies. A physical examination performed by any provider was done in 26/35 (74%) and physical examination by a rheumatologist was performed in 19/35 (54%). Self-report was used in 7/35 (20%) and medical record review was used in 12/35 (34%).

Peripheral joint disease in IBD: imaging

Peripheral joint imaging was performed in 14/35 (40%) studies evaluating peripheral disease in IBD cohorts. X-ray of peripheral joints was done in 8/35 (23%), ultrasound in 5/35 (14%) and whole-body scintigraphy in 1/35 (3%). Four of the studies that incorporated ultrasound used formal/validated ultrasound outcome measures. Three of the five ultrasound studies explicitly imaged asymptomatic patients. Peripheral imaging was used in less than half of the studies, and despite the general widespread and increasing use in rheumatology, ultrasound was infrequently used.

### Progression of fibromyalgia: results from a 2-year observational fibromyalgia and chronic pain study in the US [^aea557f7]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A previous fibromyalgia (FM) research reports that 20%–47% of diagnosed patients may not meet the study definition of FM 1–2 years after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the progression of FM in a geographically diverse cohort over a 2-year time period.

Methods

This cohort study followed 226 subjects recruited online to assess FM and chronic widespread pain (CWP) diagnosis stability over time. At enrollment (baseline), subjects provided informed consent, completed an online questionnaire consisting of the London Fibromyalgia Epidemiology Study Screening Questionnaire to screen for CWP (bilateral pain above/below waist lasting ≥ 1 week in the past 3 months), visited a site for physician evaluation for FM, and completed a questionnaire with validated patient-reported outcome instruments. Subjects were classified into mutually exclusive groups: FM+CWP+ (screened positive for CWP and received physician diagnosis of FM), FM−CWP+ (screened positive for CWP but did not receive physician diagnosis of FM), and FM−CWP− (screened negative for CWP). Approximately 2 years later (follow-up), subjects were reassessed at the same study site and completed a questionnaire with the same patient-reported outcomes.

Results

Seventy-six FM+CWP+ subjects completed assessments at both time points; 56 (73.7%) met the FM study definition at follow-up. Twenty subjects no longer met the FM study definition (eleven became FM−CWP− and nine became FM−CWP+). Ten subjects (two from FM−CWP− and eight from FM−CWP+) transitioned into the FM+CWP+ group at follow-up; they reported more tender points and pain interference with sleep and worse physical function at baseline compared with subjects who did not transition to FM+CWP+. Most (76.7%) of the subjects who transitioned into/out of FM+CWP+ experienced changes in CWP, number of positive tender points, or both.

Conclusion

The results suggest that some FM+CWP+ patients experience fluctuation in symptoms over time, which may reflect the waxing and waning nature of FM and affect diagnosis and treatment.
