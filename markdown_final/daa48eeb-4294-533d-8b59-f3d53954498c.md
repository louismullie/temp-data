## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains how security studies can be interpreted as an imperial field of knowledge, with choices A, B, C, or D (all of the above). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical emergence of security studies and whether it aligned with U.S. and British post-WWII interests. Then, I should verify whether the field's theoretical frame reflects a "colonizer's view of the world". Next, I will examine whether its original definition coincided with U.S./British imperial power and ongoing colonial relations. Finally, I will synthesize whether all three claims are supported and choose the best answer accordingly.

> Let me first confirm the historical emergence claim. Security studies as a formal academic field crystallized after World War II in close alignment with U.S. and British strategic priorities, reflecting state-centric, military-political conceptions of security that privileged great-power interests and sovereignty over alternative referents or threats, which is precisely the context in which Critical Security Studies later emerged to challenge that narrow paradigm.

> Wait, let me verify the epistemic framing. Traditional security studies, grounded in political realism, treats the state as the primary referent object and external military threats as the main concern, reinforcing a worldview that centers Western state interests and marginalizes non-Western perspectives. Postcolonial critics aptly describe this as a "colonizer's view of the world", which is why Critical Security Studies sought to widen and deepen the security discourse beyond states and militaries [^notfound].

> I need to check the temporal overlap with imperial power. The field's foundational period coincided with the height of U.S. and British global dominance and their active support for colonial and neo-imperial relations in the Global South, embedding within security studies a hierarchy that privileged Western sovereignty and external threat framings while downplaying structural inequities and internal or non-military threats, a bias that contemporary critical approaches explicitly contest [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm whether all three options are independently supported before selecting D. Option A is supported by the post-WWII emergence tied to U.S. and British interests. Option B is supported by the characterization of traditional security theory as a colonizer's worldview. Option C is supported by the alignment of the field's origins with Western imperial power and ongoing colonial relations. Therefore, D, "All of these options", is the most accurate choice given the evidence base [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **D. All of these options**. Security studies is imperial because it emerged from U.S. and British post-WWII interests (A), adopts a "colonizer's view" that centers Western state-centric security and marginalizes the Global South (B), and was defined by U.S./British power during active colonial/imperial relations in the Global South (C). These features persist in modern security paradigms, including health security, which often reflect Western priorities and reinforce global inequities [^115nb7wD].

---

## Historical emergence and imperial context

Security studies arose after WWII in the U.S. and UK, shaped by Cold War geopolitics and colonial legacies; its early focus on state-centric, military threats mirrored Western strategic interests and the global order they sought to maintain [^112CvPgE]. This origin story ties the field to imperial power structures and the priorities of dominant states.

---

## Adoption of a "colonizer's view of the world"

Postcolonial scholars argue that security studies often reflects a "colonizer's view", privileging Western state interests and marginalizing non-Western perspectives [^notfound]. Traditional security paradigms emphasize state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and military power — concepts rooted in Western political thought — while downplaying non-Western security concerns, such as colonial legacies, economic dependency, and cultural erasure [^112CvPgE].

---

## Definition by imperial powers during colonial relations

Security studies was codified when the U.S. and UK were actively supporting colonial and imperial relations in the Global South. This timing meant the field's concepts and priorities were shaped by imperial interests, reinforcing hierarchies that privileged Western states and their security concerns over those of colonized or formerly colonized nations [^112CvPgE].

---

## Contemporary implications and critiques

These imperial foundations persist: modern security frameworks, including health security, often reflect Western priorities and reinforce global inequities [^112CvPgE]. Critical security studies and postcolonial critiques call for a more inclusive, decolonized approach that recognizes diverse security needs and challenges imperial legacies [^115nb7wD].

---

Security studies is an imperial field of knowledge because it emerged from U.S. and British interests (A), adopts a colonizer's worldview (B), and was defined by imperial powers during active colonial relations (C). These features continue to shape the field, necessitating critical reflection and decolonization efforts [^112CvPgE].

### How to study improvement interventions: a brief overview of possible study types [^111tTBPo]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Improvement (defined broadly as purposive efforts to secure positive change) has become an increasingly important activity and field of inquiry within healthcare. This article offers an overview of possible methods for the study of improvement interventions. The choice of available designs is wide, but debates continue about how far improvement efforts can be simultaneously practical (aimed at producing change) and scientific (aimed at producing new knowledge), and whether the distinction between the practical and the scientific is a real and useful one. Quality improvement projects tend to be applied and, in some senses, self-evaluating. They are not necessarily directed at generating new knowledge, but reports of such projects if well conducted and cautious in their inferences may be of considerable value. They can be distinguished heuristically from research studies, which are motivated by and set out explicitly to test a hypothesis, or otherwise generate new knowledge, and from formal evaluations of improvement projects. We discuss variants of trial designs, quasi-experimental designs, systematic reviews, programme evaluations, process evaluations, qualitative studies, and economic evaluations. We note that designs that are better suited to the evaluation of clearly defined and static interventions may be adopted without giving sufficient attention to the challenges associated with the dynamic nature of improvement interventions and their interactions with contextual factors. Reconciling pragmatism and research rigour is highly desirable in the study of improvement. Trade-offs need to be made wisely, taking into account the objectives involved and inferences to be made.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^112CvPgE]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

In general, the term health security refers to the policy areas in which health and security overlap. Different conceptions of 'health' and 'security' therefore produce different concepts of health security. In a macro-setting, 'health' is mainly used in a public health context referring to the collective actions of the society to protect population health. The term 'security' is defined by scholars of International Relations (IR) as protection from threats that pose risks to the survival and existence of a designated referent object (traditionally the state and its sovereignty) and that justify extraordinary mobilisation of the state and emergency measures.

Three questions of central importance emerge when it comes to defining the notion of security: security for whom, security against what and security by what means? In the traditional military–political understanding of security, it is the state that is protected against external threats through military means. This notion of security is grounded in the Westphalian notion of sovereignty and political realism that are based on the idea that in an anarchical international system — where there is no governing authority above the states — the principal actors in the international arena are the states that act in their own self-interest to protect their sovereignty. This theoretical perspective is the most influential and parsimonious theoretical frames to date among North American scholars who had and continue to have enormous influence on political leadership in the West. It continues to dominate our understanding of global politics, the interactions between states, and the national security strategies of states. Scholars have questioned this mode of theorisation on several grounds, chief among them include its overemphasis on state as the central locus of analysis, its removal of people from the equation, its overemphasis on military threats and territorial security, its disregard to the damage done to states who are not part of the West, its abstraction from the fact that states do actually cooperate with each other to achieve mutual goals, its inadequacy in explaining security in an interdependent and globalised world, and its reinforcement of imperialism and highly militaristic national security strategies. Despite these drawbacks, realism and neorealism retain their influence and in doing so reinforce a narrow conception of national security that is no longer indicative of the contemporary nature of threats particularly after the Cold War.

### Clinical bioinformatician body of knowledge-clinical laboratory regulation and data security core: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^111H7BEb]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

Coding systems for data retrieval — Bioinformaticians should construct systems to be able to retrieve discrete variant data across multiple patients and populations for laboratory accreditation purposes, as well as for quality assurance and research. Genetic testing reports are often constructed as free text, which can make the retrieval of variants, their metadata, and variant interpretations difficult if these interpretations are not discretely stored in a separate database. Although natural language processing and manual report reviews have been used for years to extract data from reports, this is known to be an expensive endeavor, and natural language processing is still somewhat computationally expensive and prone to errors; manual extraction is less prone to deciphering errors but is more prone to human error and is expensive and time-consuming from a human resource perspective. Such coding systems have advantages and disadvantages; however, they are best used when captured along with discrete data elements in database systems, and an ontology is a specialized type of medical terminology in which the concepts and codes are formally structured and usually hierarchical.

### Assessing and interpreting real-world evidence studies: introductory points for new reviewers [^114WW7px]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonrandomized real-world evidence (RWE) studies are conducted using healthcare data collected as part of clinical practice. As RWE studies are increasingly considered for regulatory, coverage, and other clinical decision making, nonspecialists will find themselves in the position of assessing the validity of RWE studies, a field that may be less familiar to them. This introductory guide provides conceptual guidance for reviewing RWE studies and is particularly directed at professionals for whom this is new or whose prior experience has primarily been in reviewing randomized controlled trial evidence. We focus on RWE studies that make causal inference, evaluating whether one treatment option is better, worse, or neutral compared to another. Although we provide citations to direct the reader to resources with more details on complex issues, this guide cannot substitute for years of training and expertise in the field.

Human subjects research — Common Rule and secondary use of biospecimens — Government-funded research involving human subjects must follow the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (known as the Common Rule). In particular, the Revised Common Rule allows biospecimens that are collected in a clinical environment and contain genetic material to be used for secondary purposes without informed consent only under certain conditions. Because additional constraints may apply, state and local governments and health care organization policies may have additional requirements for using or sharing genomic data for research, and bioinformaticians should verify the legality and appropriateness before any use or sharing of genomic data for research.

### Reconceptualising health security in post-COVID-19 world [^115nb7wD]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

In response to the perceived shortcomings of the narrowly defined state and military-centric notion of security, European IR scholars developed Critical Security Studies (CSS) as a way to widen and deepen the security discourse by incorporating both traditional and non-traditional security threats (such as those related to the economy, public health, food security, race, gender and the environment) and by including people as the referent object of security. An important offshoot of the CSS is the Copenhagen School of Security Studies that was launched in 1983. This approach adopted a social constructivist approach to explain the securitisation of an issue as a socially and politically constructed process involving a speech act conducted by a securitising actor who makes a 'securitising move' by presenting an issue as an 'existential threat'. Whether the issue becomes securitised depends on the logic presented and whether the audience accepts it.

Despite the evolution in the theoretical perspectives to conceptualise security, we argue that the practice of security in national and global governance frameworks is largely dominated by the state and military-centric notion of security. This concept of security, when deployed to securitise health, is exclusively focused on exogenously originating infectious diseases and bioterrorism, and suggests improved intelligence of the outbreak, border security, and public health emergency response measures to counter them. While this appears to be a highly focused and parsimonious strategy to protect states from external public health threats in the short run, its effectiveness in improving health systems and health outcomes that can mitigate the chances of occurrence of acute public health events and their effects on the ordinary population is questionable, especially in the long run.

In this article, we discuss and evaluate the existing concept and practice of health security and propose its reconceptualisation in accordance with the human security paradigm presented by the United Nations (UN) in 1994. We discuss certain distinctive features of this paradigm and highlight its relevance and effectiveness in securitising public health especially in view of the contemporary and future public health threats.

### The impact of economic sanctions on health and health systems in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^1135oU2j]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

A more fundamental solution to the many limitations of this research domain, however, likely depends on its transformation into a routine monitoring activity, enabled by an adequate institutional framework. The systematic application of prospective assessment, and the extent of information exchange between governments and evaluators that goes with it, would shift research activities, at least in part, away from ex post documentation and towards risk reduction and control. Evaluators would face new decisions, first and foremost about data collection. While a full discussion lies beyond the scope of this review, a few points can be highlighted here with respect to the aim of reducing bias.

First, any assessment will have to begin with a comprehensive retrieval of baseline information, including the scoping of existing qualitative and quantitative data such as knowledgeable local actors, censuses, administrative registers, sample surveys — with an emphasis on determining their usefulness (eg, if a survey's target population is known); a country analysis, documenting relevant pre-existing temporal and spatial trends; and an analysis of sanctions to establish plausible impact channels to investigate.

New data will have to be collected for a minimum sufficient set of indicators, which might change throughout the episode to track the evolving set of possible impacts. The expert process needed to identify such set might benefit from the recommendation of a '4+4 human security measurement domains' set made by the only fully developmend sanction assessment methodology we identified; and from initiatives in humanitarian response, where a similar issue arises. When a useful baseline exists, data collection must aim at ensuring whatever extent of comparability is possible–for example, replicating the methodology of a cross-sectional survey fielded before sanctions to generate a pseudopanel. Credible reconstruction of a de facto baseline through fast rollout of data collection might be possible in special cases–for example, for outcomes that change gradually or that can be measured with well-formulated, pretested recalls. Most other data can probably be best acquired under sanctions through compact, high-quality panel surveys of households and health facilities. Given survey resources, the utility of larger samples must be carefully weighted against that of investing in training and tracking capacity to minimise nonresponse and attrition. Methods might have to incorporate safeguards against respondent mistrust and political pressures, for example, a pharmaceuticals price survey may be implemented by rotating panels of pharmacies if attempts to exaggerate shortages are suspected.

### Responsibility to defend earth as a core principle of the planetary defense security regime [^111R6x1P]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In recent decades, the planetary defense community has performed a considerable job in creating procedural components of a security regime by building a rational foundation for understanding the asteroid impact risk and demonstrating our capability to respond to it. While this new knowledge rearticulates states' responsibility, countries have not reached an internalized consensus over the necessity to act and the appropriate means of action. To broaden the dialogue from just the technical aspects of our response to include the non-contentious policy options, we must analyze, comprehend, and reach a consensus on the very foundation of the problem – what we intend to secure – and stipulate it in a shared norm as a foundational element of the future security regime.

Planetary defense inherently poses a challenge on a planetary scale that stands to benefit from broad international cooperation. To garner cooperation in this field, the countries need to reconcile their divergent interests and ensure to avoid misunderstandings that may arise from dual-use technologies or ambiguous intentions. At the same time, they should encourage cooperation even in the absence of immediate threats and reach a consensus on the notion that cooperating on planetary defense is sensible because it ensures security, stimulates economic growth, and fosters scientific and industrial collaborations. These objectives can be realized through the establishment of a planetary defense security regime that incorporates procedural, cognitive, and normative components [Box 1].

### Clinical bioinformatician body of knowledge-clinical laboratory regulation and data security core: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^1177SYZR]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

Clinical laboratory risk assessments — scope and methods are described as follows: Risk assessment is an essential component of computer system validation, laboratory informatics operations, and general clinical laboratory practice, involving identifying vulnerabilities, hazards, and risks to the system or data, measuring their associated impacts, and taking measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level. Information gathering for identification of potential risks and vulnerabilities can be accomplished via document reviews, expert opinions, checklists, diagramming, structured surveys, medical device security questions (National Electrical Manufacturers Association Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security), and feedback from stakeholders of the system. The evaluation should be directed toward the intended functionality of the system and should consider the specific setting within which the system is deployed, and ideally, the assessment should comprehensively encompass all aspects of the system's processes before its implementation and should be conducted with the participation of members of the workforce and stakeholders. The identified risks are analyzed using qualitative or quantitative techniques to determine their probability of occurrence, severity, and impact; qualitative risk analysis is a subjective approach based on expert judgement rather than numerical values and may use a risk assessment matrix for prioritization, whereas in contrast, quantitative risk analysis uses verifiable data, quantitative tools, and techniques to objectively report risks in numerical terms.

### Can geopolitics derail the pandemic treaty? [^11252WSc]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Changed dynamics

Does this inability to make decisions responding to urgency reflect more than a "phase" of weak multilateralism or a lack of political will in leaders? Analysts studying the politics of climate changehave argued that a new power dynamic is emerging and already manifesting itself in G20 and the COP26 negotiations. Geopolitics today is not about a new cold war but about establishing a new technological order, in which claims to power are inseparable from technology, science, ownership of data, and authority in the digital world — bringing with them new dimensions of inequality. Pandemic response is not only about health security and crisis governance, but also — like climate change — a field marked by innovation, technology, and multiple corporate interests, for which no international rules exist. Global health, with its strong base in science, technology, and data, is now part of a reassessment of how world politics should be organised, according to which principles and values it should proceed, which actors should be involved, and which hierarchy of institutions should apply. This makes it difficult to agree on a way forward.

The lack of global solidarity has made vaccine inequity the defining challenge in global health. Those already hit hardest by global inequity in access to healthcare now face additional barriers in the realisation of their right to health as they cannot gain access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. No wonder civil society organisations call for a "decolonisation of global health"and fight for a waiver of TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights). For the global south to accept a binding treaty, it would need to address the concerns of low and middle income countries, such as equity and human rights, the sharing of knowledge, technology and innovation, and the financing of global public goods for health. This not only meets with opposition from some states but also from major interests in the private sector.

### Safe birth in cultural safety in Southern Mexico: a pragmatic non-inferiority cluster-randomised controlled trial [^115dZrgm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations and strengths

Sample size is a common limitation of research with small and remote Indigenous communities even including, as we did, all the women in the community. Accumulating numbers of events by increasing the duration of the study depends on availability of funding. We reported on 872 completed pregnancies and some additional months of follow up would have allowed us to include in the analysis the outcomes of several hundred women who were still pregnant at the moment of the final survey. The cluster design avoided contamination that would occur if intervention traditional midwives attended women in control communities. The clustered design reduced the power of the study, making it harder to demonstrate non-inferiority. The baseline survey in 2015 revealed intervention women had important differences from control women in their language, schooling and support during childbirth. The direction of the differences would have us expect worse maternal health outcomes in intervention communities, which could lead to underestimation of a positive effect of the intervention.

The difficult field conditions affected measurement of gender violence, a key ripple effect in the pilot study. Interviewers had to administer these questions, for security reasons, under conditions where the respondent could be seen and possibly overheard. We observed similar difficulties and attendant limits to interpretation earlier in Guerrero and in Pakistan.

Knowledge of intervention status could have affected some secondary outcomes (for example, intention of future home-based childbirths). The main outcome indicators (non-inferiority for perinatal mortality, neonatal and serious childbirth complications) and other secondary outcomes would be less susceptible to this bias.

The study benefitted from decades of institutional commitment and experience of CIET researchers that cannot be assumed in other contexts. This community engagement generated the co-designed intervention. During the trial, the researchers also generated institutional support in government facilities, and established a favourable environment to discuss results with local authorities.

### 'Capable of being in uncertainties': applied medical humanities in undergraduate medical education [^115kzr48]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous medical schools have been updating and modernising their undergraduate curricula in response to the changing health needs of today's society and the updated General Medical Council competencies required for qualification. The humanities are sometimes seen as a way of addressing both of these requirements. Medical humanities advocates would argue that the humanities have a vital role to play in undergraduate medical education, allowing students to develop the critical tools required by the 21st-century clinician to deliver the best person-centred care. While we endorse this view, we contend that such training must be taught authentically to have maximal impact. This article arises from a collaboration between Imperial College London and Birkbeck, University of London, which aimed to embed the humanities into Imperial's undergraduate medical curriculum. Here, we use a teaching session on graphic medicine and narrative as a case study to illustrate how the humanities can be a powerful tool for students to explore professional clinical complexity and uncertainty when taught in a transdisciplinary way. In this session, uncertainty operated on several different levels: the introduction of unfamiliar concepts, materials, and methods to students, transdisciplinary approaches to teaching, and the complexities of real-life clinical practice. Further, we argue that to manage uncertainty, medical students must cross from a scientific training based on positivist understandings of evidence and knowledge, to one which foregrounds multiplicity, nuance, interpretive critical thinking, and which understands knowledge as contingent and contextually produced. In facilitating such learning, it is crucial that the teaching team includes experts from both medical and humanities fields to scaffold student learning in an intellectually dynamic way, drawing on their disciplinary knowledge and wide range of personal professional experiences.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^116y73jM]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

4.7 At the beginning of the study, prepare an electronic secured study file to store all study documentation and outputs. Regularly update this file and archive it the end of the study

Maintaining a secure electronic study file helps to ensure that the most up to date versions of all study materials are stored in a single location. An electronic study file should include protocols, data analysis plans, data management plans, ethical review submissions and responses, informed consent forms, data collection tools, anonymised datasets and transcripts, metadata, data management programmes, analysis programmes, statistical outputs, reports and publications. To ensure secure storage, the study file should resists on two physically separate regularly synchronised storage mediums, for example, on a local laptop hard disk and remote backup server. When setting up the storage system, it is important to think about risks to data integrity, externally (eg, fire, flooding), and internally (disgruntled staff member, ransomware, virus attacks, etc) and how to mitigate those.

The choice of where to store and especially where to archive the data may be straightforward if researchers have an established data management facility in their institution. Cost-free remote data repositories may be a useful alternative when these are not available. There are three important considerations when choosing an online repository for data storage and archiving (as opposed to data sharing, which is discussed in criterion 6.6): 1) Does it offer closed access and protected against unauthorised access; 2) Is it hosted by a trusted institution with a vision and capacity to provide long-term secure storage (eg, at least 10 years). Zenodo (zenodo.org) is a general purpose repository hosted by CERN which fits both criteria, while both can be problematic with public could storage services (such as DropBox, Google Drive, etc).

4.8 Retain source data safely, in their original form, preserving data confidentiality for as long as has been described in the protocol

Source data refers to materials collected as part of the research at the primary source of data collection (study participants, household respondents, etc). Thus, source data includes: signed informed consent forms, filled in data collection forms, audios files, videos and photos and biological samples (data, images, photos of slides, but not sample itself). The study protocol should specify how long source data will be stored and under which conditions (and security guidance).

### How do policymakers interpret and implement the principle of equivalence with regard to prison health? A qualitative study among key policymakers in england [^115YVzHa]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The principle of equivalence in prison health has been established for nearly four decades. It seeks to ensure that prisoners have access to the same level of healthcare as members of society at large, which is entrenched within the international legal framework and England's national health policies.

Aims

This study examined how key policymakers interpret and implement the principle of equivalence in English prisons. It also identified opportunities and threats associated with the application of the principle.

Methods

In total, 30 policymakers took part in this research. These participants engaged in policymaking activities and occupied positions of authority in the prison field.

Results

Despite the policymakers' consensus on the importance of the equivalence principle, there was a varying degree of understanding regarding what constitutes 'equivalence'. Participants described how the security culture impedes prisoners' access to healthcare services. Additionally, the increasing size and complexity of the prison population, coupled with a diminishing level of resources, reduce the level of care being provided in prisons and thus compromise implementation of equivalence in English prisons.

Conclusions

Inconsistent interpretation of equivalence, the prevailing security drive, increasing numbers and health complexities of prisoners and fiscal austerity threaten the implementation of equivalence in English prisons. This research calls for new guidance on how to interpret and implement equivalence, along with measures to educate prison governors and staff on the prison rehabilitation value, ensure greater investment in prison health and consider alternatives to imprisonment to future-proof the principle of equivalence in the English prison system.

### Food insecurity in the food allergic population: a Work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^11112ohu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Food insecurity (FI) in food allergy (FA) — conclusion and clinical implications — are that the problem is "often overlooked within the field of allergy and immunology", with contributing factors including "a lack of diverse study samples in FA research" and "a lack of diversity among clinicians and researchers, presence of implicit bias, stigma surrounding FI, the personal nature of FI questions, or lack of resources specifically designed for this population". The authors note that their survey "highlights the fact that most practicing allergists and staff do not have the knowledge or resources to assist their FI patients" and that "More research is needed to fully understand the impact of FI on patients with FA". They emphasize action by stating, "It is the duty of health care providers, especially those working in allergy clinics, to implement FI screenings and provide crucial resources to vulnerable populations, optimizing their treatment and improving their health, nutrition, and quality of life". The context further notes that "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the growing epidemic of FI, having impacted individuals and families on a global and national scale".

### Biodefence and the production of knowledge: rethinking the problem [^114hrbXG]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Biodefence, broadly understood as efforts to prevent or mitigate the damage of a bioterrorist attack, raises a number of ethical issues, from the allocation of scarce biomedical research and public health funds, to the use of coercion in quarantine and other containment measures in the event of an outbreak. In response to the US bioterrorist attacks following September 11, significant US policy decisions were made to spur scientific enquiry in the name of biodefence. These decisions led to a number of critical institutional changes within the US federal government agencies governing scientific research. Subsequent science policy discussions have focused largely on 'the dual use problem': how to preserve the openness of scientific research while preventing research undertaken for the prevention or mitigation of biological threats from third parties. We join others in shifting the ethical debate over biodefence away from a simple framing of the problem as one of dual use, by demonstrating how a dual use framing distorts the debate about bioterrorism and truncates discussion of the moral issues. We offer an alternative framing rooted in social epistemology and institutional design theory, arguing that the ethical and policy debates regarding 'dual use' biomedical research ought to be reframed as a larger optimisation problem across a plurality of values including, among others: (1) the production of scientific knowledge; (2) the protection of human and animal subjects; (3) the promotion and protection of public health (national and global); (4) freedom of scientific enquiry; and (5) the constraint of government power.

### A guide to interpreting economic studies in infectious diseases [^116Y2p9R]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Healthcare providers continue to seek improved methods for preventing, detecting and treating diseases that affect human survival and quality of life. At the same time, there will always be financial constraints because of limited societal resources. Many of the discussions on how to provide economically sound solutions to this challenge have not fully engaged the input of clinicians in the field. The purpose of this review is to increase economic knowledge for clinicians. We cover healthcare cost elements and methods used to assign value to a health outcome. We outline the challenges in conducting economic studies in the field of infectious diseases. Finally, we discuss the meaning of efficiency from multiple perspectives, and how the concept of economic externalities applies to infectious diseases.

4.6 For each data file define levels of anonymisation and privacy protection as well as corresponding access rights in line with national and international frameworks

Data security measures should be made explicitly clear for each stage of the research process in line with national and international frameworks — such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU. Personal data, and especially sensitive personal data should be treated with extreme caution. Personal identifiers can be either direct or indirect. Although none of the indirect identifiers on its own would point to an individual, several indirect identifiers might do. The appropriately anonymised data have: (1) no single direct identifier or less than three indirect identifiers and (2) if dates are necessary for certain analyses, methods should be used to preserve anonymity without compromising statistical analyses, such as adding or subtracting a small, randomly chosen number of days to all dates.

It should be clear at the start of the research, which research team members will have access to which data and how access will be managed (different team members might have different access rights). There are numerous ways to protect sensitive personal data. One method is by saving the personal identification data in a dataset that is separate from the bulk of the study data and only providing the ability to certain research team members to link the two datasets. This can be done by providing different passwords for different datasets or encrypting electronic database files. In the event the data are collected in a paper format, securely stored data forms (in locked cabinets with password access-locks or key-locks to which only specific research members have access) is the best way to keep the data secure.

### Standardization of microbiome studies for urolithiasis: an international consensus agreement [^116wpoxN]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2021). High credibility.

Numerous metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) for urolithiasis have been published, leading to the discovery of potential interactions between the microbiome and urolithiasis. However, questions remain about the reproducibility, applicability and physiological relevance of these data owing to discrepancies in experimental technique and a lack of standardization in the field. One barrier to interpreting MWAS is that experimental biases can be introduced at every step of the experimental pipeline, including sample collection, preservation, storage, processing, sequencing, data analysis and validation. Thus, the introduction of standardized protocols that maintain the flexibility to achieve study-specific objectives is urgently required. To address this need, the first international consortium for microbiome in urinary stone disease - MICROCOSM - was created and consensus panel members were asked to participate in a consensus meeting to develop standardized protocols for microbiome studies if they had published an MWAS on urolithiasis. Study-specific protocols were revised until a consensus was reached. This consensus group generated standardized protocols, which are publicly available via a secure online server, for each step in the typical clinical microbiome-urolithiasis study pipeline. This standardization creates the benchmark for future studies to facilitate consistent interpretation of results and, collectively, to lead to effective interventions to prevent the onset of urolithiasis, and will also be useful for investigators interested in microbiome research in other urological diseases.

### Restoring invisible and abandoned trials: a call for people to publish the findings [^112Nqcq1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Well designed and well performed randomised controlled trials are considered to provide the most reliable evidence on the effects of health related interventions. However, the credibility of findings from individual trials and from summaries of trials examining a similar research question (that is, systematic reviews and meta-analyses) has been undermined by numerous reporting biases in the published medical literature. Reporting biases are often difficult to detect, but have the potential to discredit earnest efforts towards evidence based decision making.

Two basic problems of representation are driving growing concerns about relying on published research to reflect the truth. The first is no representation (invisibility), which occurs when a trial remains unpublished years after completion. The second is distorted representation (distortion), which occurs when publications in medical journals present a biased or misleading description of the design, conduct, or results of a trial. Both go against the fundamental scientific and ethical responsibility that all research on humans be used to advance knowledge and are symptomatic of a general culture of data secrecy. The end result is that the healthcare, biomedical research, and policy communities may, despite best intentions and best practices, end up drawing scientifically invalid conclusions based on only those parts of the evidence base they can see.

### Fraud, deception, and subversion: recommendations for maintaining data integrity [^1172h1z5]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Researchers increasingly use online tools to advertise studies, recruit participants, and collect data, enabling access to individuals in remote or rural areas, those with limited mobility, and participants facing time constraints. While online platforms offer significant advantages, online research remains vulnerable to fraudulent activity, which can compromise the validity of study findings and deplete both funding and human resources. This special communication describes the real-world experiences of two research groups, one in Canada and one in the United States, who encountered fraudsters in both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We conducted a literature review and identified 32 peer-reviewed articles addressing fraudulent participation and deceptive behaviors in online research. Drawing from both our experiences and the literature, we synthesize actionable strategies to prevent, detect, and manage fraud throughout the research process, including study design (e.g. community involvement), advertisement (e.g. limited information), recruitment and screening (e.g. knowledge-based eligibility questions), assessment (e.g. embedding repeated questions), data analysis (e.g. removing fraudulent data), and remuneration (e.g. clarifying reimbursement conditions). Despite the availability of these strategies, each study design presents unique vulnerabilities, and not all approaches are universally applicable. Researchers are encouraged to assess the specific risks associated with their study design and select strategies that align with their study objectives, balancing the need to minimize fraud, recruit genuine participants, and maintain data integrity.

Workflow orchestration, containers, and environment separation — It is important to have a test environment that mimics but is distinct from the production environment; however, it should have the same computational resources and integrations as the production environment, and ideally there should also be a development environment that is distinct from the test and production environments. Workflow management and orchestration software enables modularity within the code, detailed descriptions of inputs, outputs, and connections, error handling and error logging, restarting code from where an error occurs, and easier launching of pipelines. The use of containers enables the packaging of software components or whole pipelines complete with the environments needed to run them, and when building containers it is helpful to restrict the privileges of the container on the host machine to the minimum necessary and minimize the range of software installed in the container to reduce its vulnerability footprint. Containers should be scanned periodically for vulnerabilities, it is also critically important to keep software up to date with appropriate patches to prevent exposing the organization to the potentially catastrophic effects of malware through known vulnerabilities, and preventing unauthorized outside access to the software and limiting the access of laboratory software to necessary networks and applications can further protect the organization from adverse cybersecurity events.

### Privacy-first health research with federated learning [^113McGHg]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Privacy protection is paramount in conducting health research. However, studies often rely on data stored in a centralized repository, where analysis is done with full access to the sensitive underlying content. Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show-on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies-that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research-across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases. As a result, it enables health research participants to remain in control of their data and still contribute to advancing science-aspects that used to be at odds with each other.

### Getting one's bearings: a grounded theory study of fathers' sense of security while attending the birth of their child [^11151FKJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Further studies of fathers' childbirth experiences have shown that knowledge about childbirth increases fathers' sense of security and is associated with a sense of control. However, the opposite is also true: if fathers do not feel sufficiently involved and informed about what happens during childbirth, they feel a lower sense of security, which may be accompanied by a sense of lack of control.

Research on fathers' sense of security remains limited and has focused primarily on the postnatal period. Few studies have examined the antenatal period and childbirth itself to comprehensively analyse the development of a paternal sense of security. The specific strategies that fathers employ to establish or maintain their sense of security and the factors that influence this process remain unclear. Moreover, existing research predominantly provides descriptive insights, whereas the relationships among the factors of paternal sense of security have rarely been explored.

To address this gap, this study explores how fathers' sense of security is constructed and what strategies fathers use to achieve a sense of security during pregnancy and childbirth. The aim of this study is to develop a theoretical model of fathers' sense of security in the context of childbirth, with a focus on fathers who are present at birth. Understanding how these fathers express and interpret their sense of security is essential for supporting their needs in the context of maternity care.

This study was part of a larger research project in which both parents were interviewed separately. The findings from the data on mothers are analysed separately.

### Swedish national survey on MR safety compared with CT: a false sense of security? [^111eAaC9]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As there is no national register for MR-related safety incidents in Sweden, this national survey was performed to gain a baseline overview of MR safety incidents that occurred in the country over a 12-month period. With a response rate of approximately 60% of all MR workers in Sweden, covering 90% of hospitals/facilities with MR units in Sweden, the 21 human injuries, 50 cases of material damage, and 129 close calls reported should cover the majority of MR safety incidents that occurred during the study period. At hospitals with incidents reported, 82% of MR users did not report having knowledge of any incident. An average of 61% of these users do not acknowledge the possibility that incidents might have occurred without their knowledge (65% for human injury, 62% for material damage, and 57% for close calls). This finding suggests that the healthcare system lacks functioning local incident-report systems assuring feedback to employees. This is also reflected by the rather low percentage of multiple reporting of specific incidents. Further, radiographers working with both MR and CT had significantly higher confidence in safety feedback regarding MR than CT incidents (p < 0.0005), illustrating that the efficacy of feedback mechanisms at a department may differ for modalities or be perceived differently. Reported MR incidents were mainly related to burns and projectiles, and were thereby related to the static magnetic field, or the radio-frequency field. Safety incidents related to ergonomic risks affected both patients and personnel and were mainly raised by CT users, which might be related to the larger throughput of patients at CT compared to MR. Reported close calls were predominant among MR safety incidents in this study, and we interpret this finding as reflecting a considerable awareness of safety risks and that safety practices and routines are in place as a necessary base for MR accident prevention. No lethal cases were reported for MR in this study. However, as a high number of close calls has been reported involving large items such as wheelchairs, ventilators, oxygen tanks, and beds, several lethal cases could have happened, inciting again on the necessity to adopt international recommendations for safety. This is also reflected in the fact that 15 (16%) MR safety incidents specified were given the highest potential — worst-case scenario — severity score. James reported that serious harm seems to be 10–20-fold more common than lethal harm.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^111fecaU]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

3.6. Collect data in a respectful and safe manner, in an environment which safeguards the confidentiality of respondents

When data collection is prepared and field workers are selected and trained, it is important to focus exclusively on technical aspects of using the research instruments and to reflect on how study participants and field workers can be protected from harm due to the study. Fieldwork is sometimes conducted in dangerous settings and associated with considerable risks. The gender of data collection teams is an important factor to consider. In many contexts, women can feel uncomfortable if they are interviewed by men or in the presence of their husbands and partners. In such settings, gender-segregated interviews are important part of ensuring a respectful and safe environment for participants. One trick for achieving this is to carry out women's and men's interviews simultaneously to keep men occupied while women participate in the study. Beyond gender, other sociodemographic characteristics (eg, socioeconomic or ethnic or religious backgrounds, etc) may lead to cultural hierarchies which make it difficult for people to relate to each other. A good understanding of the local context is necessary to ensure that the data collection can be as culturally sensitive as possible.

### Creating conditions for a sense of security during the evenings and nights among older persons receiving home health care in ordinary housing: a participatory appreciative action and reflection study [^111pS5k5]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Aim

The aim was to describe the stakeholders' views about how conditions for a sense of security can be created during evenings and nights among older persons receiving home health care in ordinary housing.

Design

This study is part of a larger project where we theoretically and methodologically used a participatory appreciative action and reflection (PAAR) design. The stakeholders invited in this study — older persons receiving home health care in ordinary housing, relatives to persons receiving home health care, NAs, RNs, and their managers working in home health care — were invited to co-create knowledge with us regarding how a sense of security can be created for the older persons during evenings and nights. Our use of sense of security is in accordance with Segesten's definition, where one can create the conditions for someone to have a sense of security, which is based on the individual's perception of it.

The design is underpinned by the view of the stakeholders as narrators of their own stories and interpreters of their own lives and work. This research has its roots in participation, action, and reflection by the stakeholders. It consists of repeated cycles of collecting data, taking it back to the stakeholders, analyzing it, and considering it in reflection, as well as collecting new data. This is done with the aim of learning from the stakeholders' experience and knowledge. An appreciative perspective was applied, and we tried to identify what has worked well to create conditions for a sense of security for older people in practice, as well as solutions to the obstacles.

### Challenges to evidence-informed decision-making in the context of pandemics: qualitative study of COVID-19 policy advisor perspectives [^116tG6ft]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Scientific advisors faced multiple constraints and challenges surrounding available COVID-19 evidence and informing EIDM, which included: the speed and influx of new, evolving, and at times conflicting evidence coming in; concerns about scientific integrity and misinterpretation of evidence; the limited in-country capacity to assess and produce evidence, as well as limitations of adapting evidence from other contexts; navigating multiple forms of evidence and perspectives needed to inform decisions with multi-sectoral impacts; having to provide recommendations quickly and under conditions of uncertainty; and a lack of transparency surrounding the process for how decisions are ultimately made. These findings affirm challenges to COVID-19 EIDM noted elsewhere; and also shed new light on the types of overarching challenges specific to evidence interpretation and translation affecting the global scientific and advisory community that are specific to, or amplified by, pandemic contexts.

Our interviewees, particularly those from LMICs, emphasised challenges associated with accessing and assessing evidence itself, the foundation of EIDM. An emphasis on science and evidence translation, while important, should shift to include how experts process, understand and synthesise evidence for decision-making in a high uncertainty and evolving public health policy environment. For example, interviewees expressed challenges with conflicting evidence, including inability to compare or weight studies that came to disparate conclusions using incongruent approaches or in different contexts, that lacked scientific rigour or integrity, or that were released without standard quality control processes (eg, peer review). While the scientific community responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented vigour and speed, our findings indicate that volume came at the expense of trustworthiness and interpretability, and points to a critical need to rethink how funders, multilateral organisations, governments and scientific organisations prioritise, fund, coordinate and communicate science in the context of pandemics and public health emergencies. Specifically, evaluation of the WHO R&D Blueprint, a global effort designed to enable rapid research and development activities in the context of epidemics, including its impacts on global pandemic response equity, should be prioritised. This Blueprint, for example, could more explicitly focus on generating evidence relevant to LMIC contexts and supporting research capacity development within LMICs, including through investment in local scientific infrastructure and investigators and knowledge translation efforts — for both policy-makers and the general public. Further, it is necessary to assess activities as part of the Blueprint effort to ensure that it is having an equitable impact on research capacity building across both HICs and LMICs.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) statement: guidelines for good epidemiological practice [^112QV3EH]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

A total of 6 standards and 45 criteria were taken into the second round of online consultations. Overall, there was a high level of agreement in the second round, with all but two criteria achieving at least 85% of the 40 respondents grading as 'strongly agree' or 'agree' that the standards/criteria should be part of the final guidelines in their revised formulation. The criterion with the highest disagreement was the data analysis criteria 'Analysts should not work with data that have direct personal identifiers' (undecided: 24%; disagree: 8%; strongly disagree: 3%). The main dissatisfaction was that direct identifiers might be date of birth or a postcode and may be needed for analyses. Instead, respondents favoured a focus on a limited number of people handing personal data, alongside training for data handlers on confidentiality and data security. The criterion with the second highest disagreement was the protocol development criterion: 'The protocol should include a clear and complete data statistical analysis plan which excludes data-driven adaptations' (undecided: 11%; disagree: 8%). This criterion was considered unclear, rigid, unrealistic and potentially leading to inadequate analysis strategies. Instead, respondents favoured a stronger focus on transparency in the reporting stage.

During the face-to-face meeting in Amsterdam, we further streamlined and simplified the standards and criteria taking into account the qualitative feedback from all survey respondents. The outcome of the overall study consists of a final set of 6 standards and 42 accompanying criteria covering the following steps in the study process: (1) study preparation; (2) study protocol and ethical review; (3) data collection; (4) data management; (5) analysis; (6) dissemination and communication (table 2). A glossary of terms can be found in an accompanying explanation and elaboration paper (REF).

### Learning to think continentally [^114GmyQM]. Nature Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is proposing to enhance federal regulation intended to protect human research subjects, in particular to increase measures aimed at security of personal data. Since the ethical review process is partially based on respect for people and their autonomy, harmonization of these rules will be a process of convincing individuals and their states to accept uniform standards that give enough privacy but do not lock away personal data from either research participants or researchers.

### Experimental relativistic zero-knowledge proofs [^113dvEqJ]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Protecting secrets is a key challenge in our contemporary information-based era. In common situations, however, revealing secrets appears unavoidable; for instance, when identifying oneself in a bank to retrieve money. In turn, this may have highly undesirable consequences in the unlikely, yet not unrealistic, case where the bank's security gets compromised. This naturally raises the question of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for identifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct. Developments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of zero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a certain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all 1. In this work, we report the experimental realization of such a zero-knowledge protocol involving two separated verifier-prover pairs 2. Security is enforced via the physical principle of special relativity 3, and no computational assumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our implementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both short (60m) and long distances (≥ 400m) in about one second. This demonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols, promising for identification tasks and blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies or smart contracts 4.

### Making the most of natural experiments: what can studies of the withdrawal of public health interventions offer? [^116fLkop]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Many interventions that may have large impacts on health and health inequalities, such as social and public health policies and health system reforms, are not amenable to evaluation using randomised controlled trials. The United Kingdom Medical Research Council's guidance on the evaluation of natural experiments draws attention to the need for ingenuity to identify interventions which can be robustly studied as they occur, and without experimental manipulation. Studies of intervention withdrawal may usefully widen the range of interventions that can be evaluated, allowing some interventions and policies, such as those that have developed piecemeal over a long period, to be evaluated for the first time. In particular, sudden removal may allow a more robust assessment of an intervention's long-term impact by minimising 'learning effects'. Interpreting changes that follow withdrawal as evidence of the impact of an intervention assumes that the effect is reversible and this assumption must be carefully justified. Otherwise, withdrawal-based studies suffer similar threats to validity as intervention studies. These threats should be addressed using recognised approaches, including appropriate choice of comparators, detailed understanding of the change processes at work, careful specification of research questions, and the use of falsification tests and other methods for strengthening causal attribution. Evaluating intervention withdrawal provides opportunities to answer important questions about effectiveness of population health interventions, and to study the social determinants of health. Researchers, policymakers and practitioners should be alert to the opportunities provided by the withdrawal of interventions, but also aware of the pitfalls.

### Sociohistorical context and adult social development: new directions for 21st century research [^114tDqSV]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, most explanations of adult social development within the field of psychology assume universal age-related processes. The majority of these explanations, however, stem from studies on a limited number of cohorts that were socialized in specific social contexts. As a consequence, the current knowledge on adult social development confounds age-related and contextual influences. We argue that it is essential to disentangle these influences to better understand adult social development. In this article, we apply the theoretical framework of developmental contextualism and provide explanations for adult social development that are firmly based on the sociohistorical context that a cohort experienced during young adulthood. This hypothesis is discussed with the example of romantic relationships. We argue that the relatively strong value that today's older adults ascribe to close social ties might be rooted in experiences of limited life-path options, existential concerns, and stressful historical events (i.e. Great Depression, World War II, postwar era) during their young-adult years. Today's young adults, conversely, are socialized in rapidly changing social structures with increasing diversity in life-path options and in relative security with regard to basic material and security needs. We explore how these experiences might shape the future social development of today's young adults with respect to relationship contexts (e.g., living arrangements, digitalization) and relationship needs (e.g., exploration, self-actualization). We conclude with theoretical and methodological recommendations for future research that will be amply equipped to systematically investigate both age-related and contextual influences that drive development in any previous, present, and forthcoming cohort.

### A knowledge-anchored integrative image search and retrieval system [^112mmz7d]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical data that may be used in a secondary capacity to support research activities are regularly stored in three significantly different formats: (1) structured, codified data elements; (2) semi-structured or unstructured narrative text; and (3) multi-modal images. In this manuscript, we will describe the design of a computational system that is intended to support the ontology-anchored query and integration of such data types from multiple source systems. Additional features of the described system include (1) the use of Grid services-based electronic data interchange models to enable the use of our system in multi-site settings and (2) the use of a software framework intended to address both potential security and patient confidentiality concerns that arise when transmitting or otherwise manipulating potentially privileged personal health information. We will frame our discussion within the specific experimental context of the concept-oriented query and integration of correlated structured data, narrative text, and images for cancer research.

### Patients' and public views and attitudes towards the sharing of health data for research: a narrative review of the empirical evidence [^115fsDAN]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

International sharing of health data opens the door to the study of the so-called 'Big Data', which holds great promise for improving patient-centred care. Failure of recent data sharing initiatives indicates an urgent need to invest in societal trust in researchers and institutions. Key to an informed understanding of such a 'social license' is identifying the views patients and the public may hold with regard to data sharing for health research.

Methods

We performed a narrative review of the empirical evidence addressing patients' and public views and attitudes towards the use of health data for research purposes. The literature databases PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched in April 2019 to identify relevant publications. Patients' and public attitudes were extracted from selected references and thematically categorised.

Results

Twenty-seven papers were included for review, including both qualitative and quantitative studies and systematic reviews. Results suggest widespread-though conditional-support among patients and the public for data sharing for health research. Despite the fact that participants recognise actual or potential benefits of data research, they expressed concerns about breaches of confidentiality and potential abuses of the data. Studies showed agreement on the following conditions: value, privacy, risk minimisation, data security, transparency, control, information, trust, responsibility and accountability.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that a social license for data-intensive health research cannot simply be presumed. To strengthen the social license, identified conditions ought to be operationalised in a governance framework that incorporates the diverse patient and public values, needs and interests.

### Toward security-aware portable sequencing [^113JwAJi]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A common but flawed assumption is that security can be ensured simply by disconnecting the device from the Internet during the sequencing procedure. Unfortunately, this approach does not recognize that a host machine, which can be connected to the Internet at any time, remains vulnerable to security breaches and malware. Thus, merely halting the Internet connection before or during sequencing does not eliminate the risk of data exfiltration and manipulation due to a compromise in the host machine.

Collectively, these observations underscore that the portability of sequencing devices, while enhancing accessibility and operational flexibility, fundamentally redefines the security landscape, necessitating a reevaluation of trust assumptions, host-machine dependencies, and protection mechanisms traditionally accepted in controlled laboratory environments. A clear example is when company policies like Bring Your Own Device allow users to connect their personal computers, not managed by organizations' IT security groups, to the sequencers to perform job duties locally or remotely. An employee in a laboratory might unknowingly fall victim to phishing attacks by clicking on a malicious link in a seemingly legitimate email, thus compromising their device. This compromised personal computer, once connected to the sequencer, can be used to manipulate sequencing data during elaborations or allow unauthorized access to sensitive sequencing data while the user is unaware of the compromise. To the best of our knowledge, these vulnerabilities have not been exposed in the wild, meaning they have not been observed being actively exploited in current real-world systems or environments. Further research and empirical validation are necessary to assess the extent of the threat. A summary of these potential exploitations and their impact is summarized in Table 1.

### Survey research [^1161zsXS]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence on practice, attitudes, and knowledge. However, conducting good survey research is harder than it looks. The authors aim to provide guidance to both researchers and readers in conducting and interpreting survey research. Like all research, surveys should have clear research question(s) using the smallest possible number of high-quality, essential, survey questions (items) that will interest the target population. Both researchers and readers should put themselves in the position of the respondents. The survey questions should provide reproducible results (reliable), measure what they are supposed to measure (valid), and take less than 10 min to answer. Good survey research reports provide results with valid and reliable answers to the research question with an adequate response rate (at least 40%) and adequate precision (margin of error ideally 5% or less). Possible biases among those who did not respond (nonresponders) must be carefully analyzed and discussed. Quantitative results can be combined with qualitative results in mixed-methods research to provide greater insight.

### "3. 2. 1. Impact [factor]: target [academic career] destroyed! ": just another statistical casualty [^112Veuuv]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

"Publish or perish" is the time-honored "principle" for academicians who race to accumulate lines under the "publications" section of a curriculum vitae. The original intent of publication-to inform others of findings and further scientific knowledge-has been corrupted by factors including (1) exponential growth of journals and the journal industry, fueled in part by intrusion of the Internet into all aspects of academic life; and (2) adoption of journal metrics (rather than written content) as the measure of scientific quality. The proprietary Thomson Reuters Impact Factor is the most pernicious metric, having caused editors and publishers to change editorial practices to boost the number. At the same time, gullible administrators and government agencies have been persuaded that metrics for the journal in which materials are published can be used as a measure of the worth of individual investigators (and institutions) and their research efforts: simple numbers can be substituted for the burdensome effort required to read and assess research quality. Thus, granting of research funds, awarding of academic rank and tenure, and determination of salaries (including bonus payments) have become tied to manipulable journal metrics rather than the significance or quality of reported research. Therefore, it is no wonder that the integrity of science is more often being questioned. How should a young investigator approach the "publish or perish" dilemma? Performing sound research and preparing optimal materials for publication must remain the overriding goals: properly articulate the question addressed by the study; thoroughly document all methods and case information; carefully describe results including any conflicting or negative findings; discuss the importance of the findings along with how the results address the initial question and whether findings refute or confirm previous studies; prepare properly cited bibliographic references; list all author contributions, potential conflicts of interest, financial support, and required ethical approvals; and provide a catchy title and an abstract containing sufficient information that other investigators perusing scientific indices will be enticed to read the published article. Submit the completed manuscript to the most appropriate journal based on that journal's previously published content and relevance to the field of study regardless of journal metrics. On publication, notify investigators in the same field to ask for their comments on the work. Thus, an individual will become known for the quality of his or her work product and the worshiping of publication metrics will be unnecessary.

### A critical appraisal of epidemiological studies comes from basic knowledge: a reader's guide to assess potential for biases [^114cAhab]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Scientific literature may be biased because of the internal validity of studies being compromised by different forms of measurement error, and/or because of the selective reporting of positive and 'statistically significant' results. While the first source of bias might be prevented, and in some cases corrected to a degree, the second represents a pervasive problem afflicting the medical literature; a situation that can only be 'corrected' by a change in the mindset of authors, reviewers, and editors. This review focuses on the concepts of confounding, selection bias and information bias, utilising explanatory examples and simple rules to recognise and, when possible, to correct for them. Confounding is a mixing of effects resulting from an imbalance of some of the causes of disease across the compared groups. It can be prevented by randomization and restriction, and controlled by stratification, standardization or by using multivariable techniques. Selection bias stems from an absence of comparability among the groups being studied, while information bias arises from distorted information collection techniques. Publication bias of medical research results can invalidate evidence-based medicine, when a researcher attempting to collect all the published studies on a specific topic actually gathers only a proportion of them, usually the ones reporting 'positive' results. The selective publication of 'statistically significant' results represents a problem that researchers and readers have to be aware of in order to face the entire body of published medical evidence with a degree of scepticism.

Patients "significantly overestimate the likelihood of pregnancy at all ages", and in studies, "most overestimated the reproductive lifespan and fertile window", while among "women aged 18–29 years… 44%" had discussed fertility topics yet only "22% could identify the age of marked fertility decline, the fertile period, and that the ovaries did not continuously produce new eggs". Awareness gaps "persisted among undergraduate students, graduate students, and even medical residents".

### Introduction: how evident is the evidence? [^114qhTWB]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

### SHEA position statement on pandemic preparedness for policymakers: pandemic data collection, maintenance, and release [^116eaQYf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

SHEA position statement on pandemic data systems — A centralized, national data system should focus on secure data collection, harmonization, and curation with dedicated teams of data scientists and clinical experts. Ideally, the system should be searchable with rapid access to data that can be de-identified, and the ability to retain identifiers in a secure national repository is necessary for future linkage to other data sets or other data elements. Efforts to modernize data management and sharing should balance speed, accuracy, reliability, transparency, and feasibility and should include strategies to "future proof" data, as forecasting the necessary data elements is not always possible. Moving forward, the creation of a national data repository with a wide variety of data elements and types is essential to develop and inform future practice and policy.

### Future pandemics and the urge to' do something' [^111hbBzZ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

How reliable are proponents' assertions that the benefits of ePPP research outweigh its risks?

In many areas of medicine, it makes sense to defer to expert (e.g. clinical) judgement, even if clinicians cannot articulate the experience and wisdom that ground their judgement. However, this is not true when we have reason to believe that expert judgements are likely to be compromised by biases that undermine their reliability, as they often are.

And we have such reason in the case of experts who support ePPP research.

First, processes generating expert intuitions could underestimate the probability of a human-engineered pandemic. In response to concerns about risky research, proponents cite existing regulatory structures as if they could not fail or be evaded by a malevolent actor. Such underappreciation may reflect the sheer fact that we have never experienced a devastating engineered pandemic (that the risk is 'theoretical' not 'tangible'). It may also reflect the common tendency to assign too little weight to what are perceived as small probability events, acting as if the probability were zero. The combined bias is especially common in risky decisions that one has made frequently without experiencing harm — precisely the situation of proponent researchers who have never unleashed a pandemic. Proponents' trope that 'nature is the ultimate bioterrorist and we need to do all we can to stay one step ahead' neglects what actual bioterrorists could do with future capabilities. In light of these considerations, there is a high probability that proponents are underestimating the probability that ePPP research will produce engineered pandemics.

Data privacy, transparency, and access — The principle of respect for individuals supports the provision of complete and accurate information about research studies to participants throughout the conduct of the study and the obligation to disseminate the results of research in the interests of the public good. Investigators have the responsibility to clearly communicate the objectives of biomedical research to potential study subjects in the consent process and to inform those enrolled in studies of the research results, and ideally would declare their objectives in a public forum before the conduct of research to mitigate the temptation to publish only aligned findings; dissemination of research results, regardless of the findings, acknowledges participants' contributions. In the electronic age, healthcare data have proliferated exponentially and electronic health records (EHRs) have the capacity to expand patients' access to their own information; however, substantial barriers to such access exist, and the vast data generated create new challenges to patient privacy as organizations providing health care share patient information with external partners typically without patient knowledge and sometimes in the context of exclusive agreements intended to generate profit.

### Identifying the challenges of a telecare system establishment for older adults and providing a solution: a qualitative study [^113gJtaW]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Leveraging the experiences of leading countries in providing smart services can be a valuable solution for addressing standard challenges. In this regard, through conducting comparative studies and reviewing applications, the creation of the most optimal model that aligns with our country's cultural, religious structures, and infrastructure can be pursued. In a study, Molaei et al. suggested that, in order to reduce excess costs and increase the knowledge of users, the telemedicine networks implemented in healthcare centers of developed countries should first be studied and examined.

Despite the benefits associated with the field of electronic health, it must be acknowledged that this technology carries the risk of patient data exposure. Hadara and Stabi, in their study, highlighted challenges related to security, privacy, and data management.

Therefore, In light of the results from our study, establishing levels of access to data, along with legal consequences for errors and breaches of ethical and security issues, as well as an appropriate system of rewards and penalties in this regard, is a suitable solution to address security challenges.

Another challenge in deploying a telecare system for older adults in Iran is structural and organizational challenges. Lack of facilities and equipment is one of the challenges mentioned in the study conducted by Fathi et al; this is in line with the results of the present study. The study conducted by Kaplan et al. has also suggested to adopt "a whole-system strategy" to integrate telehealth into regular services and other functions of information systems. This is consistent with the findings of the present study as well.

Based on the insights gained from our research, one of the appropriate solutions to address structural and organizational challenges is to designate a single trustee body for this field. Additionally, supporting service providers and recipients, or in other words, ensuring that knowledge-based companies providing telecare services receive financial support such as grants and loans, as well as non-financial support, is another solution. Furthermore, telecare services for older adults should be provided with a focus on multidisciplinary teams. Teams of service providers for older adults, consisting of specialists from various fields of medical sciences, play a significant role in improving the quality of services offered to this demoghraphic group. Therefore, programs and policies should be implemented to train specialized human resources in the field of aging.

### The art and science of clinical knowledge: evidence beyond measures and numbers [^114wJjtH]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Medical doctors claim that their discipline is founded on scientific knowledge. Yet, although the ideas of evidence based medicine are widely accepted, clinical decisions and methods of patient care are based on much more than just the results of controlled experiments. Clinical knowledge consists of interpretive action and interaction-factors that involve communication, opinions, and experiences. The traditional quantitative research methods represent a confined access to clinical knowing, since they incorporate only questions and phenomena that can be controlled, measured, and counted. The tacit knowing of an experienced practitioner should also be investigated, shared, and contested. Qualitative research methods are strategies for the systematic collection, organisation, and interpretation of textual material obtained from talk or observation, which allow the exploration of social events as experienced by individuals in their natural context. Qualitative inquiry could contribute to a broader understanding of medical science.

This information should not be disseminated outside the purview of relevant public health authorities unless by mutual agreement or if it has been made public by the provider country, and if the receiving country's public health agencies or institutions are obligated to share data beyond its original purpose because of legal requirements or they become aware of an unintentional leak of information, they should warn as soon as possible the relevant public health agencies of the provider country.

### Decision-making under epistemic, strategic and institutional uncertainty during COVID-19: findings from a six-country empirical study [^11336PAj]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Uncertainty is defined as limited knowledge or lack of predictability about past, present or future events. The COVID-19 pandemic management was significantly impacted by uncertainty, as the gaps between existing information and the necessary knowledge hindered decision-making. Current uncertainty literature primarily focuses on natural disasters, leaving a gap in understanding decision-making under uncertainty in times of public health emergencies. Analysing strategies for making decisions under uncertainty during the pandemic is crucial for future pandemic preparedness.

Methods

Using a comparative research design, we study the strategies governments used to make decisions under uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data through desk reviews, stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders from government, academia and civil society from six purposefully selected countries: Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Bangladesh, Jordan and the UK.

Results

Regardless of political, geographic and economic context, all six countries adopted common strategies to make decisions under three types of uncertainties. Decision-making under epistemic uncertainty involved seeking expert advice and collecting evidence from other countries and international organisations. Decision-making under strategic uncertainty involved coordination, collaboration and communication. Decision-making under institutional uncertainty involved using or adapting pre-existing experiences, structures and relationships and establishing new institutions and processes.

Conclusions

We contribute to the theory and practice of public health crisis decision-making by presenting a unified national-level applied decision-making framework for events involving uncertainty. We provide practical guidance for approaches to enhance decision-making in future health crises that could also be used for other emergencies.

### The remaining unknowns: a mixed methods study of the current and global health research priorities for COVID-19 [^111mWLqQ]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020and then a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The WHO published their Global Research Roadmapon 12 March 2020, within the context of the situation and the epicentre of infection at that time. The Roadmap was built on deliberations of the Global Research Forum, whereby over 400 participants from different sectors across the world identified three to four immediate research priorities for the following 3 months across each of nine themes.

Now, in June 2020, we see the evolution of this pandemic at different points across the globe. We know from our previous experience with Ebola and other outbreaksthat it is essential to embed research into the response to an outbreak, and that there is a finite and unknown window where these questions can be answered. COVID-19 is an unprecedented situation and therefore we must take every opportunity to undertake all the possible research that funding and capabilities allow; and high-quality studies should happen everywhere there are cases in order to maximise the evidence generated and ensure that the resulting data and findings are globally applicable. Therefore, it is important to assess now, what are the most key remaining global health questions that need to be addressed, both to ensure this pandemic can be halted and to learn for future outbreaks of this pathogen or another.

This research intentionally builds from the WHO roadmap, with the aim of strengthening the global health research response effort already aligned to this, rather than generating a completely new set of priorities. Using broad consultative workshops, we have identified additional considerations beyond the WHO roadmap scope in order to broaden the current global research priorities at this point in time to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and to help learn for any future outbreaks.

### Leveraging local knowledge for crisis management: a practice-based approach to managing uncertainty in healthcare during COVID-19 [^113g4poP]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Background/Aim

Crises like the COVID-19 pandemic are inherently uncertain, dynamic and generate broader consequences on organisations, challenging traditional crisis management approaches. Conventional approaches often neglect the mechanisms and processes frontline practitioners enact in their local practices to adapt effectively. This study explores how healthcare professionals (HPs) at a university hospital centre developed and mobilised local knowledge to rapidly respond to the evolving conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

We conducted an interpretive single case study at a designated COVID-19 university hospital in Montreal, Canada. Over 6months (April to September 2020), we collected data through 49 virtual interviews with healthcare practitioners, minutes from an operational crisis unit and organisational records such as protocols and clinical algorithms. Our analysis focused on identifying spaces and mechanisms that facilitated the creation, testing and translation of local knowledge across different clinical units, leading to rapid organisational adaptation.

Results

The study reveals that frontline HPs enacted new mechanisms forming three types of spaces-reflective, experimental and translational-that bypassed existing organisational structures of knowledge development. These spaces enabled the rapid development and translation of local knowledge, fostering dynamic organisational responses to the evolving crisis.

Conclusion

By highlighting the critical role of local knowledge and the processes supporting its integration, this research offers valuable insights into improving crisis management practices. It emphasises frontline practitioners' improvised and flexible organising processes that enable a more global capacity to leverage local knowledge for the effective adaptation in unprecedented crisis situations.

### Access to primary healthcare services for adults with disabilities in Latin America and the caribbean: a review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies [^113szcJ1]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Latin America and the Caribbean is a profoundly unequal and inequitable region, and there are crosscutting social and economic challenges that affect the access of all vulnerable populations to essential services, including healthcare. While more than 218 million people are excluded from social security systems and 140 million people lack access to health services for financial, geographical or cultural reasons, people living with a disability may face additional specific barriers that are unique to their impairment.

Countries in the region are working to implement the progressive legal and institutional changes needed to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Rights for Persons with Disabilities and regional frameworks such as the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities. To support these and other initiatives in this field, this study aims to provide an overview of the existing qualitative evidence in relation to the access of people with disability in Latin America and the Caribbean to healthcare, as well as to identify the barriers that exist in this region. Looking at barriers qualitatively will support the understanding of mechanisms and complex networks that may be missed by existing quantitative studies. Whilst access is a multidimensional aspect of healthcare, the study adopts the framework proposed by Levesque et al. This framework uses a comprehensive approach to access by embracing both the characteristics manifested by the systems and service providers and the skills of individuals, families, and communities. The framework proposes five aspects of accessibility from both the provider and user perspectives, examining their interaction. The initial suggested dimension is "approachability" and "ability to perceive", evaluating individuals' capacity to recognize services, the transparency of services, health literacy, and knowledge about health. "Acceptability" and "ability to seek" consider social and cultural factors influencing access, knowledge of healthcare options, personal autonomy, and individual rights. "Availability and accommodation" and "ability to reach" encompass the physical accessibility of healthcare centers, service delivery speed, urban contexts, provider qualifications, and provider availability. On the user side, it considers transportation and mobility. "Affordability" and "ability to pay" relate to the direct costs of services and whether individuals need to pay for them. "Appropriateness" and "ability to engage" assess service quality, ensuring correct treatment and referrals, as well as patients' ability to decide and engage autonomously.

### Lessons from COVID-19 for rescalable data collection [^112pR93Z]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Novel data and analyses have had an important role in informing the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance systems were scaled up, and in some instances new systems were developed to meet the challenges posed by the magnitude of the pandemic. We describe the routine and novel data that were used to address urgent public health questions during the pandemic, underscore the challenges in sustainability and equity in data generation, and highlight key lessons learnt for designing scalable data collection systems to support decision making during a public health crisis. As countries emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic, COVID-19 surveillance systems are being scaled down. However, SARS-CoV-2 resurgence remains a threat to global health security; therefore, a minimal cost-effective system needs to remain active that can be rapidly scaled up if necessary. We propose that a retrospective evaluation to identify the cost-benefit profile of the various data streams collected during the pandemic should be on the scientific research agenda.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^115zo1ZY]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

3.2. Ensure that research instruments are locally adapted and culturally appropriate

Global health epidemiologists often study a range different communities and countries. Researchers must be cognisant of local cultural sensitivities and should be careful not to violate customary practices with their data collection procedures. In practice, time consuming, invasive or culturally insensitive data collection procedures can lead to non-response biases and measurement errors. It is well known that questions about sensitive topics, such as sexual practices, deaths or religious ideas can be difficult to handle for participants and data collectors. It is less obvious but equally important to consider that apparently harmless topics (eg, questions about food consumption) may also embarrass or upset informants. This further emphasises the importance of including (local) investigators with relevant skills who are experienced in dealing with such circumstances.

3.3. Provide concrete guidance for data collection in a document that is available to all data collection staff

Standardising data collection processes helps to ensure that instruments maintain their validity and reliability and contributes to methods reproducibility. In general, quantitative measurements are easier to standardise than qualitative judgements. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and job aids can help ensure uniformity for various procedures (inclusion and examination of study participants, collection and storage of specimens for the laboratory, laboratory assays, data management and quality assurance). All guidance documents for data collection (field manual) should be developed with care so that they are legible, readable and comprehensible. Generic templates are available for several types of SOPs. All data collection guidance tools should be available whenever and wherever the people involved in data collection need them.

3.4. Select data collection staff according to technical as well as cultural criteria. Clarify the roles and responsibilities for each person involved and provide adequate training and support

In small studies, the lead researchers may be able to interview or examine all participants. But when there are many study participants or when there are sociocultural or linguistic barriers, field workers (intermediary research assistants) may be needed. Depending on the scale of the study, a hierarchy of field staff including interviewers, supervisors and field data editors may have to be recruited. Many global health research projects are highly dependent on field workers. These fieldworkers may be the only people who directly engage with the study participants, hence need to be well trained and oriented to understand the study objectives, ethical issues and the instruments used. Their influence on informed consent and data collection processes should not be underestimated.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^114vBvde]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The ethical review of research conducted in humanitarian emergencies deserves special attention here. In such settings, there is an intrinsic clash between ethical priorities: the research needs to be done swiftly, and participants are particularly vulnerable. A recent review suggests two useful strategies in such settings: (1) pre-approved research protocol templates which can be quickly customised for use in individual emergenciesand (2) 'real-time responsiveness', which is an iterative strategy of constant dialogue between ethics reviewers and researchers while studies are being conducted.

2.7 When working in a setting without ethical review boards or review boards with limited epidemiological capacity, consider what is in the study team's remit to strengthen their epidemiological capacity

Epidemiological studies may take place in countries with insufficient capacity to assess the ethical aspects and/or scientific quality of the research. Adequate capacity to conduct and review biomedical research does not automatically translate into the same for epidemiological and multidisciplinary projects, and this should therefore be regarded as a specific need. Taking advantage of this situation is one of the worst forms of 'ethics dumping'. Instead, epidemiologists should consider what is in the study team's remit to strengthen their epidemiological capacity as part of broader capacity strengthen efforts (as described in criterion 1.1).

2.8 Explicitly state any open data access in the protocol submitted for ethical review and in the informed consent documents

Funding bodies and publishers increasingly encourage public data sharing to maximise the return of investment on research, to increase transparency and accountability, to reduce the cost of duplicating data collection and to promote potential new data uses. Depending on the type of study and data collected, informed consent forms may include conditions of use and provisions for sharing with third parties. Any data sharing with third parties (whether fully open access or not) should be included in the protocol and informed consent documents. For collation of existing data to be used for secondary analyses, sharing with third parties should be agreed with data owners. The protocol should describe plans to publish data in online open access repositories (see criterion 6.6).

### Research integrity in guidelines and evIDence synthesis (RIGID): a framework for assessing research integrity in guideline development and evidence synthesis [^113VTgFd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Where there is no response by the deadline, the study moves into the 'Not Included' category (Fig. 3), based on unresolved potential integrity issues, whereby the study cannot be reliably used to inform the evidence synthesis and/or guideline recommendations. It is possible that potentially valid studies may be excluded due to lack of response, particularly when communication channels are outdated or lacking. All reasonable efforts should be made to reach authors but, once all avenues to contact authors are exhausted, it is appropriate to remove studies with no response to prevent compromising the validity and trustworthiness of the overall evidence.

In the third scenario, as occurs in many situations, the verification process requires more time (e.g. if data sharing agreements are required for original data sharing), precluding inclusion until identified integrity issues are resolved. In these cases, the study remains 'Awaiting Classification' and is not included in the current evidence synthesis (Fig. 3). While there is a risk of excluding potentially valid data, this is anticipated to be minimal with adequate time allocation. Nevertheless, prioritizing the integrity of the evidence synthesis is paramount and, as reviews and guidelines are often 'living' and undergo periodical updates, studies are re-reviewed at each update for retraction notices, published expressions of concern, or resolution of integrity issues by authors and are re-allocated on this basis. Final decisions regarding the inclusion of studies following application of the author response algorithm should be documented as shown in Table 2, and included in the publication or accompanying technical or supplemental reports.

Beyond the immediate guideline or review process, an additional optional step involves escalating concerns to journals and/or editors of published studies. Where studies with significant integrity concerns were identified and attempts to contact authors were unanswered, these studies should be flagged with the appropriate channels to initiate investigations and potentially activate a retraction process. Although not essential to inform the evidence synthesis itself, this is an important step to prevent questionable research from continuing to circulate within the scientific community and potentially contaminating future evidence syntheses and/or guidelines.

3.7. Put in place quality assurance and quality control mechanisms to ensure data accuracy, completeness and coherence

Data accuracy refers to the degree to which data correctly estimate or describe the quantities or characteristics they are designed to measure. In this respect, data fabrication is a common concern in global health epidemiology and it appears to be widespread and very difficult detect. The chief concern is that field workers do not visit the sampled locations and fabricate data. There are a number of quality control activities that can be put in place to ensure accurate data. The use of electronic data collection offers a number of opportunities to check that the sampled locations were visited, including geo-positioning, attachment of photographs and monitoring the start and end date of the interview. Spot-checks and re-collecting data in a random sample (eg, 10%) of sampled units (eg, households or facilities) is another commonly used approach to ensure that data were correctly collected. However, the reality is often more nuanced than total data fabrication, with field workers deviating from the verbatim use of the questionnaire. This can be done for very valid reasons, for example, when field workers prefer using local terms and language, or exercise their own judgement when asking sensitive questions. Efforts to foster a safe an open dialogue with field workers, combined very good understanding of the local context and a willingness to adapt research processes (as advocated by the slow research movement) are key for quality assurance.

Data completeness is usually described as the amount of available data in a database compared with the amount that was expected to be obtained. Prompt review of research instruments by a field supervisor is important to ensure that missing data can be re-collected in time. Distinguishing between different types of missing information on the research instruments is a good way to ensure data completeness during data collection (eg, (1) the question could not be asked; (2) the respondent did not reply; (3) the respondent replied 'do not know').

Coherence refers to the degree to which data are logically connected and mutually consistent. During surveys one way to ensure coherence is include cross-checks within number of questions which should be internally consistent. Electronic data collection offers the possibility of programmed consistency checks which notify (and can even prevent) data collectors from entering inconsistent values.

### Women's experiences of the injury, recovery and desire for rehabilitation after a second-degree vaginal tear-a qualitative study [^1178ysbZ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A second-degree obstetric perineal tear at delivery is believed to have minor impact but the results of this study indicate that the experiences are diverse. Some participants experienced a sense of uncertainty and that neither themselves nor the healthcare providers were sufficient after having suffered a second-degree obstetric perineal tear. On the other hand, others described a sense of security. The experiences of recovery were influenced by a sense of uncertainty when not knowing what is normal and having insufficient information about what to expect. For others there was a sense of security when needs were met, which is in line with previous studies. The women with the injury had different levels of knowledge of the risk of injuries during a delivery and they therefore had varying expectations. Both positive and negative aspects were captured in the material, as the group is heterogeneous and possibly mirrors the situation in society.

How participants viewed the need for healthcare and physiotherapy was divided. Some participants reported that they had not even been aware of having suffered an injury. They found it difficult to express their thoughts when they felt that they did not have enough knowledge about what healthcare is available and what symptoms are normal after a tear injury. The information given in hospital was experienced as insufficient and difficult to understand, in line with a previous study focused on women who suffered a third-to-fourth degree injury. This indicates that information is important regardless of the extent of the injury to increase the feeling of security.

The participants felt as if they had been forgotten and described it as if they had been 'thrown out' after delivery and, from then on, they would have to cope on their own. The participants further described the feeling of not being taken seriously when they sought help and how they then eventually gave up, which we interpreted as resignation. The fact that the focus is on the baby and not on oneself during childbirth could be a reason why information had not been taken in or was forgotten. However, information about injuries is important, and it is the responsibility of the healthcare system to provide this information since they have the knowledge about whether an injury exists and its extent.

### Assessing trauma care systems in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and evidence synthesis mapping the three delays framework to injury health system assessments [^116CMMEM]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Most studies in this review did not use multiple data sources, however we found innovative examples of combining data sources to deepen understanding, such as combining household surveys with focus group discussions for qualitative and quantitative insightsand GIS analysis with facility assessment data to interpret facility resource capacity in light of population proximity. However, LMIC trauma system research could benefit additionally from incorporating methodological approaches from other global health fields that were not evidenced in this review. One example of a method, not found in this review, but that could be adopted to address the relative lack of care process quality assessment, are clinical vignettes, which can be used for assessing standardised clinician care quality. They are more feasible but comparable with standardised patient and case note review for patient–provider interaction assessment and are relatively inexpensive. To address the gap we identified in studying the whole health system across the Three Delays, other methodologies advocated for applying systems thinking to health research could be used. These could include process maps, graphical representation of an end-to-end description of activities, stakeholders and requirements of a process. They have been applied to LMIC health systems evaluation including emergency and surgical care. Causal loop diagrams can similarly help visualise dynamic complexity of health systemsand have been used to evaluate vaccination coverage in Indiaand Fijian public health food policies. Some of the study methodologies we found in our review could also be adapted. An example is preventable death analysis through peer review. It has advantages reported by the identified study authors of triangulating multiple perspectives, being theoretically simple, low costand broadly applicable to any context. If data completenessand local expert engagement were secured, it could be better aligned toward rapid assessment.

While data collection time was often reported by studies in this review, this would not include the time for planning, ethical approval, material sourcing and analysis which are uncommonly reported. These factors should be considered when planning time frames for rapid assessments. Well-designed surveys, electronic data capture and preplanned analysis could potentially allow quicker collection. Qualitative studies across each Delay were judged potentially suitable for rapid assessment in this review. Although the data are often quick to collect, they may require lengthy transcription and analysis. Nevertheless, rapid assessments frequently and typically include qualitative elementsand software can help. Trade-offs between principles could also allow some methods judged to have high resource requirements, like community-based household surveys, to be potentially accomplished quickly, within 1or 2 monthsif given sufficient investment.

### Dignity-based practice in global health research: a framework of expectations [^116uuL11]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Global health research is generally done by researchers, whether locally or internationally, based in locations other than the study locations and by people with more power than the marginalised groups they research. It therefore has a tendency towards unjust practices that sideline, distort, or erase the knowledge and interpretations of the marginalised groups while favouring those of the researchers. To develop a framework of expectations for practices that respect the dignity of marginalised people, we sampled and synthesised complaints about knowledge practices in global health published in 12 journals from 2017 to 2023. We identified four sets of expectations-transparency, non-extraction, democratisation, and transformation-across eight stages of research: funding decisions, framing of issues and posing of research questions, ethics approval, data collection, data analysis and interpretation, immediate or direct use of data and knowledge produced, dissemination of findings, and long-term or indirect use of data and knowledge produced. These expectations affirm the dignity of marginalised groups as knowers, sense-makers of knowledge, and seekers of transformational change.

Useful methodologies for empirical site 3: societal flows and expressions of power

Discourse analysis entails close examination of the use of language in texts (such as laws, policies, strategy documents or news media articles) and oral communication (such as transcribed interviews, debates or speeches) to describe the ways in which communicative acts construct shared understandings of what is normaland what is possible, legitimate, or true. Discourse analysis should include the study of what is present in the text, as well as what is assumed or ignored, shedding light on often unacknowledged material asymmetries and social hierarchies that pervade health policy-making at all levels. In this way, discourse analysis can expose and problematise dominant paradigms in global and domestic health policy-making, such as the ways that standard epidemiological risk factors obscure structural inequities, the assumption that the private sector will act in the public interestor that a primary function of government reproductive health programmes is to decrease the fertility rate, rather than enable reproductive autonomy.

Ethnographers seek to understand how humans in groups interact, behave and perceive, and how meaning and value are established. Ethnography can build rich and holistic understanding of people's perspectives, practices and cultural contextand focuses on depth over breadth, immersive observation in natural settings (eg, non-experimental conditions), exploratory (rather than hypothesis testing) research and describing the meaning and function of human action in context. While ethnography has its origins in colonial conceptions of 'culture' and colonial motivations to study them and has thus been frequently used to 'study down', ethnography has also been employed to research 'up, down and sideways'. This includes work focusing on institutions and politics, political legitimacy, moral universes, tacit knowledge and discourses to provide insight into how power is constructed, solidified and wielded within and beyond health systems, the development and normalisation of certain forms of knowledgeand the implicit or explicit privilege or denigration of individuals or marginalised groups accessing healthcare.

### The urgent need to accelerate synthetic data privacy frameworks for medical research [^116zXgsV]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2025). High credibility.

Synthetic data, generated through artificial intelligence technologies such as generative adversarial networks and latent diffusion models, maintain aggregate patterns and relationships present in the real data the technologies were trained on without exposing individual identities, thereby mitigating re-identification risks. This approach has been gaining traction in biomedical research because of its ability to preserve privacy and enable dataset sharing between organisations. Although the use of synthetic data has become widespread in other domains, such as finance and high-energy physics, use in medical research raises novel issues. The use of synthetic data as a method of preserving the privacy of data used to train models requires that the data are high fidelity with the original data to preserve utility, but must be sufficiently different as to protect against adversarial or accidental re-identification. There is a need for the development of standards for synthetic data generation and consensus standards for its evaluation. As synthetic data applications expand, ongoing legal and ethical evaluations are crucial to ensure that they remain a secure and effective tool for advancing medical research without compromising individual privacy.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^117Lj36G]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

1.8 Agree on work plans and governance structures with all study partners. Allocate adequate time, financial and human resources to all phases of the study

It is important that decision-making processes are clarified before the actual research starts. The roles and responsibilities of all parties involved should be transparently and fairly agreed in writing, so that study team members are on the same page in terms of expectations and contribution. This should including decision making in the event of disagreement. The RACI models are a useful way to do this, focusing on the four responsibilities most typically used: responsible, accountable, consulted and informed. In larger multistakeholder studies, oversight bodies may be needed to advise and oversee the study conduct.

Clear study plans should be developed to ensure that adequate time, financial and human resources are available for all phases of the study. All team members should have a valid role and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role. Trained and experienced local health professionals may possess the perfect skills mix for a given research position but their recruitment needs to be balanced with the potential health system weakening risk of depleting the local human resources for health. While it should go without saying that local research teams should be fairly remunerated for their contribution, it is important to pay special attention to the working conditions of those in the lower echelons of the research hierarchy. This includes field staff (eg, interviewers, supervisors and field data editors). Mitigating the precarious nature of their freelance casual labour should be considered where possible, ideally with mid-term to long-term solutions such as long-term contracts and opportunities for career progression. This can take the form of online courses and qualifications that can be embedded into their roles within the research team, depending on their needs and aspirations. Long-term contracts for field staff should also consider employment benefits such as health insurance and pension planning (as appropriate for the context) and budget for these in the financial planning and budget plans for a study.

Precise budget estimates are not always part of a grant application process, but careful estimation of the different costs during the application stage is beneficial for the practical implementation of a research project. It is important to take currency fluctuations, inflation and uncertainty into account when preparing the budget, especially in fragile and conflicted affect settings.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^111gxwsB]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past decade, two movements have profoundly changed the environment in which global health epidemiologists work: research integrity and research fairness. On one hand, questionable research practices may lead to spurious findings if studies are ill-designed, poorly implemented, inappropriately analysed or selectively reported. On the other hand, local communities, institutions and researchers are too often side-lined from the formulation of research questions, the design and implementation of studies and the dissemination of findings. Taking advantage of weak or inexistent ethics institutions, bypassing local expert knowledge, ignoring local context, failing to develop in-country capacity are some of the practices which de-value global health epidemiology.

The BRIDGE statement

As we have argued in the BRIDGE statement paper, research integrity and research fairness need to be equally nurtured by global health epidemiologists who aim to produce high-quality impactful research. Yet bridging between these two aspirations can lead to practical and ethical dilemmas. In the light of these reflections, we have proposed guidelines for the conduct of fair global health epidemiology, targeted at stakeholders involved in the commissioning, conduct, appraisal and publication of global health research.

The BRIDGE guidelines were developed by a Delphi consensus with global health practitioners from over 20 countries in 5 continents. Our aim was to bring together existing principles in one overarching guideline, with a focus on practical implications for global health practitioners. The outcome consists of a set of 6 standards and 42 accompanying criteria covering the following steps of a study: (1) study preparation; (2) study protocol and ethical review; (3) data collection; (4) data management; (5) analysis; (6) dissemination and communication.

### Decision-making under epistemic, strategic and institutional uncertainty during COVID-19: findings from a six-country empirical study [^116AaRCs]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first multicountry study to empirically study the strategies adopted by national-level governments for making decisions under different conditions of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that regardless of political, geographic and economic context, all six countries faced three common types of uncertainties and adopted common strategies to make decisions in these situations.

Our results suggest that the countries found decision-making under epistemic uncertainty to be most challenging, especially in the initial waves of the pandemic. Epistemic uncertainty has been an issue of study by various scholars, emphasising its components of randomness, subjective judgement and measurement error; its objects like the level and sources of uncertaintyas well as its potential implications resulting in mistakes in building models. We found that both the 'known unknowns and unknown unknowns'represent epistemic uncertainty during the pandemic. Similar to natural disasters, health emergencies also demand preparedness for unknown unknowns or surprises and caution in relying on observational data and models, as they may not always be comprehensive and accurate.

The undetermined uncertaintiesmarked by the lack of or ambiguous knowledge about the clinical, public health and policy aspects of the virus created public mistrust in the government and resulted in low public adherence to government decisions and policies. However, depending on the technical capacities for generating and gathering information as well as the existing relationships with other countries and international organisations and experts, countries managed to equip themselves with the best available knowledge to make decisions.

Our findings on decision-making under epistemic uncertainty confirm the earlier studies emphasising the (scepticism around)and role of science and evidence in pandemic management. Like other existing evidence, our respondents alluded to WHO's role in providing technical and policy guidance.WHO was cited as a reliable organisation in our study when it came to gathering the latest clinical and non-pharmaceutical guidelines. Likewise, most countries were observing China's decisions to control the pandemic.

### 'What we lacked was the courage to take decisions that differed from the rest of the world': expert perspectives on the role of evidence in COVID-19 policymaking in Iraq [^113SBba3]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

However, this interpretation was not universal, with some researchers arguing Iraqi policy was based on research, though conducted outside Iraq. Mutual in all accounts was external reliance for data and decision-making, with limited formal/systematic assessment or adaptation. As one researcher noted, decisions were made based on decision-making in other countries as much as on external scientific evidence.

What we lacked was the courage to take decisions which differed from the rest of the world (Researcher-01)

Some criticised this reliance as 'copying' measures used elsewhere, sometimes without scientific justification or contextual adaptation.

Measures taken by the Ministry of Health to contain the coronavirus pandemic were not research-based. They were partially science-based and the other part was impromptu, whether by the Supreme Crisis Committee or local committees in the governorates. (Researcher-04)

Participants on national committees stressed that external scientific advice should be adapted before adoption, for example, implementing lockdowns, but this did not always happen.

I strongly opposed some decisions… One of the decisions the committee took without scientific basis was banning the importation of goods from neighbouring countries… it was not science-based, but because some countries did it, Iraq took the same decision. (Policymaker-02)

Regarding sources of (international) scientific evidence, participants cited preferences for publications from highly ranked journals, especially if 'WHO endorsed their findings' (Policymaker-11), and substantial dependence on international guidelines and protocols. Some further mentioned informal communication with researchers in neighbouring countries and formal international collaboration, for example, field visits of Chinese experts. None, however, described any mechanisms by which evidence was formally identified, assessed and synthesised to inform recommendations and policies.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^111TjRL1]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

A good discussion section of a completed randomised trial should start with a brief summary of the trial results, balancing both benefits and harms of the intervention. The discussion sections of scientific reports are often filled with rhetoric supporting the authors' findingsand provide little measured argument of the pros and cons of the study and its results. Indeed, some discussion sections can be overly optimistic when discussing the trial findings (interpretation bias; spin). Authors need to guard against such behaviours, as they diminish the rigour of the scientific effort and may result in a loss of trust by readers.

Readers will also want to know how the trial results relate to those of other randomised trials. This can best be achieved by including a published systematic review in the results or discussion section of the report. This might be an easy ask for some authors as a systematic review might have been part of the rationale for conducting the trial. However, for others, such synthesis may be impractical, and quoting and discussing any existing systematic reviews of similar trials may be more appropriate. One recent estimate suggests that nearly 80 systematic reviews are published daily. Discussing trial findings in the context of results from any systematic reviews will help readers assess whether the results of the randomised trial are similar to those of other trials in the same topic area and whether participants are similar across studies. Reports of randomised trials have often not dealt adequately with these points. Several methods to address the issue of setting new trial findings within the context of previous research have been proposed. Where conducting a new updated systematic review is not practical, adding the new trial result to the previous systematic review is a much simpler alternative.

We recommend that at a minimum, the discussion should be as systematic and objective as possible and be based on a comprehensive search, rather than being limited to studies that support the results of the current trial.

### Formulating the research question and framing the hypothesis [^1147m2UY]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

An understanding of the research process is an essential skill for designing a study and developing the research protocol. Poor study design can lead to fatal flaws in research methodology, ultimately resulting in rejection for publication or limiting the reliability of the results. Following the steps of the research process and devising the research question and hypothesis prior to study initiation can avoid common problems encountered with research questions and study design. Formulating the research question is the first step in the research process and provides the foundation for framing the hypothesis. Research questions should be feasible, interesting, novel, ethical, and relevant (FINER). Application of the FINER criteria can assist with ensuring the question is valid and will generate new knowledge that has clinical impact. Utilization of the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format helps to structure the question as well as refine and narrow the focus from a broad topic. The hypothesis is derived from the research question and is used to determine the experiments or interventions that will answer the question. This aim of this paper is to provide guidance for developing research questions and forming a testable hypothesis through application of the FINER criteria and the PICO process.

### On conducting burden-of-osteoporosis studies: a review of the core concepts and practical issues. A study carried out under the auspices of a WHO collaborating center [^112xK8Lt]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a problem that is relevant to public health from the clinical, economic and social viewpoints. Except in a handful of industrialized countries, there is a considerable void in our knowledge of the magnitude of the problem. By exploring both the epidemiological and the economic impact of osteoporosis and the fractures associated with it in a particular country, studies of the 'burden of illness' (BOI) can fill that void. BOI analysis raises many questions at both the conceptual and the practical level. The purpose of this paper is to review the methodology underlying analyses of this type, to discuss its limitations and to provide a general format to improve their implementation in the field of osteoporosis. Investigators involved in BOI analysis should be very clear and explicit regarding the methods they adopt, so that studies in different countries can be interpreted and compared appropriately by interested parties.

### Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) [^111j54Nv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

An EUA is a FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) in the United States under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves biological agent(s) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent(s). Criteria for issuing an EUA include:

The biological agent(s) can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence (including data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available), it is reasonable to believe that
the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and
the known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose, prevent, or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product, taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent(s);
There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the serious or life-threatening disease or condition.

### Re-evaluating our focus in addiction: emotional dysregulation is a critical driver of relapse to drug use [^112wo92r]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the lack of neuroimaging research on emotional dysregulation in the substance dependence field, conclusively characterising brain reactivity patterns during negative emotional processing remains a challenge. Particularly, differences in study design, statistics and participant demographics contribute variability to the results, making interpretation increasingly challenging. Brain regions with significant anatomical overlap and indistinct boundaries may also present challenges when attributing dysfunction to a specific region. The ambiguity between boundaries increases potential for misinterpreting findings, making it difficult to attribute the results within the context of one specific region. This may lend itself to interpreter bias, whereby the effect may be interpreted in line with the hypothesis or current trends in research. The best way to account for this is with Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses, which can estimate the probability of overlap between activations across various studies. However, given there are insufficient studies in this domain to make ALE possible, whilst the field grows, it is important to ensure all data being published is transparent moving forward. Following new results being published in the future, previously published data can be more easily re-evaluated and re-interpreted considering the new findings and be utilised in quantitative meta-analyses. In particular, whilst data in the field remains relatively sparse, a Bayesian approach may be appropriate as it can combine prior knowledge with small or heterogenous study results, reducing uncertainty and stabilising effect sizes.

### Roadmap for conducting neuroscience research in the COVID-19 era and beyond: recommendations from the SNACC research committee [^1122chZp]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2021). High credibility.

Enduring principles and research sustainability during COVID-19 — lessons can be applied to improve sustainability by analyzing previously collected data, writing new manuscripts and grants, and shifting to feasible research methods; virtual platforms can continue certain activities if in-person alternatives are unavailable, and digital communication methods may serve as permanent tools for activities including informed consent and questionnaire completion; recruitment practices have emphasized proactive strategies engaging historically underrepresented communities; although the COVID-19 pandemic has been detrimental to research communities, resilience has been demonstrated, biomedical societies such as SNACC have dedicated significant time and resources, and the ideas and recommendations in this Consensus Statement may help make research more flexible and adaptable for future disruptions.

### FRAME: framework for real-world evidence assessment to mitigate evidence uncertainties for efficacy / effectiveness-an evaluation of regulatory and health technology assessment decision making [^1116VG9X]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

We propose five recommendations based on these findings (Figure 5).

Figure 5
Key recommendations from the FRAME research and corresponding benefits for the different stakeholders. RWE, real‐world evidence.

The first three address challenges encountered in learnings from publicly available assessment reports. First, a higher level of granularity in assessment reports can be achieved if a more structured approach to presenting assessments is established. Templates or checklists could be developed, informed by the variables used in this research and in the relevant literature. Such a structured approach can also be applied to how sponsors present the evidence in their submissions.

Second, assessment reports could also introduce a structured section that describes the submitted RWE, detailing data sources, study design, and other pertinent details. Third, an ongoing public repository to track, characterize, and capture insights on future submissions that include RWE to support efficacy/effectiveness could be established.

These measures aim to enhance transparency and facilitate shared learnings about how authorities evaluate RWE and its evidentiary value. This could benefit all stakeholders. Researchers, sponsors, and authorities could have more informed scientific discussions on RWE, helping them to identify research priorities to make progress collaboratively. Authorities would derive learnings that could be integral to further implementing their RWE frameworks. Sponsors would achieve a clearer understanding and predictability on how authorities interpret and use RWE.

The fourth recommendation, informed by the results around variability across authorities, is to strengthen collaboration on initiatives aiming at defining consistent terminology and common principles for RWE assessment. Such initiatives have been advocated in the literature, and by an ICH reflection paper on pursuing opportunities for harmonization in generating RWE. These efforts recognize the benefits of a greater consistency in how RWE is interpreted and evaluated, which will in turn help promote a better understanding and awareness of RWE, its use and role in decision making. Our findings could aid these initiatives by highlighting areas of inconsistency and in offering reflections on the underlying rationale for key divergences.

The fifth recommendation is drawn from the findings on the characteristics potentially associated with the impact of RWE. Decision‐support tools that evaluate the feasibility of using RWE to support efficacy/effectiveness claims could be developed or enhanced by our results. These tools could assist sponsors in deciding whether to invest additional resources into developing an RWE approach, considering its characteristics and those of their clinical development program.

### Standards and guidelines for validating next-generation sequencing bioinformatics pipelines: a joint recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^113tC2Am]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 6 — design and implementation of the bioinformatics pipeline must ensure the security of identifiable patient information and be compliant with all applicable laws at the local, state, and national levels. Laboratories must be aware of and able to comply with local, state/province, and national health privacy laws, including privacy laws specifically directed toward genetic information. In the United States, the HIPAA Final Security Rule specifies administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protected health information that are stored or transmitted electronically, and these include genomic data. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule made a change to HIPAA to indicate that genetic information, as defined under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, was included in the list of identifiers that had to be removed from protected health information to consider it deidentified data. Countries outside the United States also have privacy laws for health information, which include the Australian Privacy Act of 1988, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, and the Canadian Privacy Act and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. Many vendor-based solutions were developed for research environments and may not comply with regulations pertaining to clinical patient data, and such arrangements should be made with caution and only after consideration of legal compliance. For cloud use, vendors of cloud infrastructure may provide HIPAA-compliant servers for added cost, but HIPAA compliance in these instances is limited to the physical safeguards of the servers, and laboratories in the United States are expected to ensure that the data are managed according to the administrative and technical safeguards as well (including data access and audit trails). The physical location of the cloud-based servers is important; data located on cloud servers in the United States are subject to discovery via the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, whereas data located on cloud servers outside the United States may not be maintained in a HIPAA-compliant manner. In addition to privacy, the definition of security of health data encompasses ensuring that those permitted to access data are able to do so on an ongoing basis, and precautions to prevent sudden and/or prolonged disruptions of access to data are required under the HIPAA Final Security Rule.

### The remaining unknowns: a mixed methods study of the current and global health research priorities for COVID-19 [^112HL4nR]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In March 2020, the WHO released a Global Research Roadmap in an effort to coordinate and accelerate the global research response to combat COVID-19 based on deliberations of 400 experts across the world. Three months on, the disease and our understanding have both evolved significantly. As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities.

Methods

We undertook a mixed methods study seeking the views of the global research community to (1) assess which of the early WHO roadmap priorities are still most pressing; (2) understand whether they are still valid in different settings, regions or countries; and (3) identify any new emerging priorities.

Results

Thematic analysis of the significant body of combined data shows the WHO roadmap is globally relevant; however, new important priorities have emerged, in particular, pertinent to low and lower middle-income countries (less resourced countries), where health systems are under significant competing pressures. We also found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future.

Conclusion

We hope these findings will help guide decision-making across the broad research system including the multilateral partners, research funders, public health practitioners, clinicians and civil society.

### Towards a common European ethical and legal framework for conducting clinical research: the GATEKEEPER experience [^113h8YDH]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, there were striking differences noted regarding the pilots' Ethical Approval Forms themselves. For reference, based on the comparative analysis performed, it became evident that the approaches widely differ based on jurisdiction and the field of activities of each pilot. In particular, the following was noted:
A. Where the pilot was performed in the context of a University Hospital, the requirements tended to be stricter and more extensive compared to pilots performed outside the context of university hospitals and clinics. This is understandable considering not only the frequency in which university hospitals and clinics are subject to such procedures but also the overall sensitive nature of their activities. Considering that their performance of research activities almost always involves patients, vulnerable populations, health data, clinical and medical studies, or a combination of those, it is logical that a higher level of protection and attention to detail is imperative.
B. Pilots performed outside of the EU, albeit still in the EEA, were inclined to impose stricter requirements and request additional information/documentation, frequently simulating the information requested and the structure of the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe programmes. The proposed Ethical Application Form has taken into consideration those requirements, even though they do not reflect the situation in the entirety of the pilots, so as to ensure that all pilot sites are adequately represented. As such, the proposed Ethical Application Form leaves room for the application and compliance with national dispositions that may be applicable.
C. The description and analysis of measures and safeguards adopted throughout the research with regard to privacy and personal data protection have been a central focal point in the procedures of all pilots. Given the transition to a data-centred economy and the ever-increasing processing of personal data, ensuring data subjects' privacy is becoming more and more essential to democratic societies. This focus on privacy and personal data protection reflects precisely the need to balance innovation and human rights, without either of them excluding the other.
D. Most Ethical Review Boards required specific and explicit information on funding sources, aiming at ensuring the impartiality of research. By validating that funding is secured through objective and impartial sources, and that adequate measures are in place, it is ensured that the results are unbiased and trustworthy.
E. In most pilots, a long list of supporting documents was requested, further exaggerating the bureaucratic element of the procedure. Such documents most frequently included the detailed research protocol, the patient information leaflet, and the consent forms, as well as documentation regarding funding and insurance. In many of the pilots, the researchers' curriculum vitae was also requested, along with a formal declaration of assumption of responsibility with regard to the project.

### The impressive and rapidly expanding knowledge base on SARS [^113JLqvJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

James M. Hughes Director, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA

Three days after issuing a global alert about cases of atypical pneumonia in several countries in southeast Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the term SARS to the world's lexicon. Familiarity with the newly coined acronym for "severe acute respiratory syndrome" was immediate, fueled by fear and by virtually continuous coverage by the media. 1 This intense reaction and scrutiny would generate multifaceted outcomes, enabling widespread collaboration and communication to help curb the tragic health consequences while wreaking economic, social, and even political havoc in many areas.

With similar speed, the clinical, public health, and research communities worldwide mounted an aggressive response to the new disease. Under the leadership of WHO, members of normally competitive groups worked together, often communicating several times a day, to acquire and share knowledge to stop the spread of disease. Events unfolded rapidly, requiring implementation of traditional control measures while generating in a matter of weeks an impressive body of knowledge about an unknown member of the coronavirus family. Scientific journals played a major role in this endeavor, expediting online publication of peer-reviewed data and other evolving information.

The articles in this special SARS issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases are representative of this sustained involvement and commitment, with respect to both scope of authorship and range of topics. This diversity also illustrates the substantial contributions of many disciplines to the growing knowledge base on SARS. The articles describe findings from clinical and epidemiologic investigations, laboratory research, and social and behavioral studies, and discuss lessons learned both locally and globally.

More than a decade ago, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report on the continued risks of infectious diseases, outlining factors contributing to the increased emergence of such threats in a globalized era and steps that should be taken to adequately address them. Ironically, within a week of WHO's unprecedented global alert, the IOM released an updated report on emerging microbial threats, expanding on the severity and scope of the problem. The new report describes issues affecting disease emergence such as international travel and commerce, environmental changes, poverty and inequity, and the adaptability of microbes, and strongly emphasizes the need for increased surveillance and response capacity on a global level. The emergence of SARS reinforced the urgency of the situation, serving as an impetus for fundamental changes in the way the global health community interacts and bringing the message home to policymakers and the public.

### What makes health systems resilient? An analytical framework drawing on European learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic based on a multitiered approach [^113a9rkB]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge, which caught many health systems widely unprepared. The aim of this research was to develop a comprehensive analytical framework on health system resilience in the context of pandemics. In addition to serving as a tool to analyse the preparedness and resilience of health systems, the framework is intended to provide guidance to decision-makers in health policy.

Methods

The analytical framework was developed based on a multitiered approach. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was conducted to identify relevant frameworks on health system resilience (published between 1 January 2000 and 30 November 2021) and determinants of resilience that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Input was then gathered in several rounds of consultations with designated field experts and stakeholders, drawing on their experiences from the pandemic. Finally, the framework was empirically validated in several case studies.

Results

The framework distinguishes between prerequisites of resilience, pertaining to precautions to be taken in 'normal' times, and response strategies in the face of shocks. Both sections are further divided into six building blocks that were adapted from the WHO health system framework: governance and leadership, information and research, financing, physical resources, human resources, and service delivery. An overarching component on contextual factors-subdivided into situational, structural, cultural and international factors-represents an important addition to the existing spectrum of resilience frameworks.

Conclusions

Foundations for a resilient health system must be laid in 'normal' times and in all areas of the health system. In the face of a shock, adequate response strategies need to be developed. An essential learning from the COVID-19 pandemic has been that contextual factors of societies and subgroups play a major role in the ability of health systems to overcome a shock, as they impact the implementation and effectiveness of crisis management policies.

### The conceptual framework: a practical guide [^115B1KF7]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

There is no single definition of the conceptual framework (CF) or consensus on how it is best applied in the research process. However, in this piece, the authors argue that the CF is a tool used to link the literature review, research methodology, and study design. The CF grounds the study in the previous literature, theories, and models. It helps the researcher articulate their rationale for why the study should be performed, justify their study design, and describe the lens through which they analyze a phenomenon or research question. Researchers may find the variable use of terms such as theory, theoretical framework, and CF to be confusing. The authors address the distinction between these terms and present strategies to develop and use the CF throughout the research process. The authors provide practical examples and resources for additional learning.

### Principles and methods of global legal epidemiology [^112pZbif]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the theory and methods of legal epidemiology-the scientific study and deployment of law as a factor in the cause, distribution, and prevention of disease and injury in a population-have been well developed in the context of domestic law, the challenges posed by shifting the frame of analysis to the global legal space have not yet been fully explored. While legal epidemiology rests on the foundational principles that law acts as an intervention, that law can be an object of scientific study and that law has impacts that should be evaluated, its application to the global level requires the recognition that international laws, policies and norms can cause effects independently from their legal implementation within countries. The global legal space blurs distinctions between 'hard' and 'soft' law, often operating through pathways of global agenda setting, legal language, political pressures, social mobilisation and trade pressures to have direct impacts on people, places and products. Despite these complexities, international law has been overwhelmingly studied as operating solely through national policy change, with only one global quasi-experimental evaluation of an international law's impact on health published to date. To promote greater adoption of global legal epidemiology, we expand on an existing typology of public health law studies with examples of policymaking, mapping, implementation, intervention and mechanism studies. Global legal epidemiology holds great promise as a way to produce rigorous and impactful research on the international laws, policies and norms that shape our collective health, equity and well-being.

Whilst RWE has long been used in post‐marketing safety evaluation and in characterizing disease epidemiology, it has been used less often to inform authorities' decision making around efficacy or effectiveness. Therefore, details are scarcer about how authorities consider RWE for such decision making. To fully harness the opportunity for RWE in this area, there is a need for a more granular understanding of the characteristics that impact its acceptability and use. This could increase predictability and consistency of interpretation, facilitating harmonization efforts across authorities. In turn, this could contribute to making evidence generation more efficient, enhancing patient access to medicines.

A growing base of literature has quantified the use of RWE for efficacy/effectiveness evaluations and the role it played in those decisions. However, to our knowledge, no systematic investigation has identified a comprehensive set of characteristics and examined how these are considered in authority decision making across multiple products, therapeutic areas, study designs, and authorities. To address this gap, we developed FRAME: a Framework for Real‐world evidence Assessment to Mitigate Evidence uncertainties for efficacy/effectiveness. The methodological framework consists of four steps (Figure S1): (i) identify the characteristics that could impact the consideration of RWE in authorities' decision making; (ii) establish a consistent and reproducible process for extracting and analyzing information related to each of these characteristics; (iii) extract and categorize the information, and (iv) analyze it using both qualitative and quantitative methods.

We implemented FRAME on publicly available assessment reports from a subset of submissions from authorities in North America, Europe and Australia in order to:
Summarize the decision context and intended purpose of the RWE.
Describe the assessment reports' level of granularity.
Investigate convergences and divergences in how RWE was considered across authorities, and
Examine which characteristics might be associated with an increasing role of RWE in decision making.

By taking a holistic approach to this multi‐factorial research question, we seek to support the identification of, and create multi‐stakeholder dialogue on, the optimal approaches that align with authorities' needs and increase confidence in the use of RWE to support efficacy/effectiveness.

### Bridging research integrity and global health epidemiology (BRIDGE) guidelines: explanation and elaboration [^114NDK6m]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

None of what is described here will be new to experienced global health epidemiologists and researchers. Yet we know from first-hand experience that it is not easy to navigate the competing demands on a researcher's loyalty in the complex multistakeholder environment in which we operate. With the benefit of hindsight there are certainly many things we would now do differently. By giving a name and a space to recurring challenges, by stimulating a reflection on routine practice and common assumptions, by offering arguments and background references, we intend to support those who are trying to stand up against questionable research practices and research unfairness.

The notes of caution and invitations to reflect on research integrity and research fairness issues jointly can be valuable for teaching purposes for young epidemiologists and researchers embarking on the field of global health epidemiology. The exposure of these notions early on in their educational and professional development can ensure that the new generation of global health epidemiologists is more aware of the intricacies and challenges of our field, so that they do not unknowingly repeat known mistakes and reinforce unfair patterns of research behaviour. Yet we also hope that more experienced researchers will also be open to reflect on some deeply engrained practices and assumptions in global health epidemiology. Ultimately, we are aware that dissemination of these guidelines to a broad audience — including commissioners, funders, reviewers and publishers of research — is key to have to have a tangible impact.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^1163fprT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Clinical research in critical care decision making — strengths and limitations are outlined: The results of well-designed and well-executed clinical research studies provide medical knowledge that is valid for its potential to reduce bias, and utilizing techniques designed to minimize bias may provide a more sound footing than reliance on personal experience alone; large clinical studies can detect clinically significant effects not easily seen in individuals, and peer review and dissemination provide a shared body of knowledge, yet knowledge gained from populations cannot be directly and indiscriminately applied to individuals, applicability to new times and places is not assured, results may conflict, and even rigorous clinical research remains fallible and at times untrustworthy.

### An approach to the writing of a scientific manuscript [^115K9EiU]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Writing a scientific manuscript is one of the most important tasks facing the academician, and may also be one of the most daunting.

Materials

The essentials of any paper include a description of what is known, an assessment of what is unknown, a clear statement regarding the question and hypothesis being addressed by the current study, and a discussion and summary of new information that has been learned as a result of the study.

Conclusions

A formulaic approach is provided to guide the author through this process.

### Making sense of the shadows: priorities for creating a learning healthcare system based on routinely collected data [^111sWD4W]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Embedded analytical teams

Statisticians and data scientists in academia have an essential role to play in developing new methods for health informatics, data linkage and modelling. Unfortunately, these groups have a limited ability to provide routine support and evaluation within healthcare systems, with some notable exceptions. Data analysts working closely with clinicians at a local level have the advantage of local knowledge, which may make it easier to understand the care pathway and data generating process. Some healthcare providers appear to have successfully embedded data analytics, including the US Veterans Health Administration, Intermountainand University Hospitals Birmingham NHS (National Health Service) Foundation Trust. However, in other health systems it is more challenging to assess the number, job descriptions and skills of data analysts, and so plan for future workforce needs.

Ultimately, data analytics will not reach its full potential unless its importance is recognised by healthcare leaders. Unfortunately, in some instances there is uncertainty about how best to establish thriving analytical teams within healthcare organisations. Ideally, skilled analysts would be able to adapt to local needs and bring their expertise in the design, analysis and interpretation of data with an incentive to produce work that is clinically relevant and benefits patients and the public.

Attitudes towards using data

Public trust in healthcare providers and research must not be undermined by real or perceived abuses of data. Given data protection legislation that is generally formulated in terms of consent, system of collecting explicit patient consent for the secondary use of data would give the greatest certainty to both patients and the users of data, and has been signposted as an aim in England. However, the primary focus when individuals interact with the health system is delivering healthcare, often with several points of access for patients, and so consent is not always sought for the secondary use of data that are generated as part of this interaction.

In the absence of consent, legal frameworks are necessary that strike the right balance between privacy and the public good, and policy development in this area must be informed by an understanding of complex public attitudes about the use of data, which requires an ongoing dialogue about the uses to which the data are put. Although most discussions about routine data are formulated in terms of identifying the subset of people who would prefer that data about them were not used in analysis, it is also worth bearing in mind that the 'data donation' movement shows that many people are prepared to contribute a wide range of data to improve healthcare for other people, as well as to further medical and scientific understanding.

### A passive positioning alarm used by persons with dementia and their spouses – a qualitative intervention study [^112quRJv]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Increasingly, information and communication technology is being used to support persons with dementia living at home and their relatives. The aim of the present intervention study was to describe and explore the use and experiences of using a passive positioning alarm, over time, in daily life among persons with dementia and their spouses.

Methods

Using an ethnographically inspired approach, five couples, each including a person with Alzheimer´s disease and his/her spouse living in their own home, were repeatedly observed and interviewed regarding their experiences of using a passive positioning alarm. Interview text transcripts and field notes were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.

Results

The main findings show changes over time, where testing and checking the passive positioning alarm successively led to trust in the alarm and in one own´s ability to use it. These components were a prerequisite for the couples to perceive the value of the alarm.

Conclusions

A passive positioning alarm for persons with dementia and their spouses needs to be packaged as a "service" with flexibility for each user and based on user needs, abilities, knowledge and skills. Using a passive positioning alarm can be a valuable support that allows persons with dementia to be alone outdoors and can increase safety and security for them and their spouses. The present study contributes to our understanding of what prerequisites need to be in place and what barriers need to be dealt with before successful implementation can occur.

### What a reviewer wants [^117EoDBb]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Understanding what a reviewer wants helps authors write better papers and design better research studies. Central to any research study is the research question. This is the first thing the reviewer looks for. The question, or research aim, should be relevant, original and very clearly defined. The paper should also be scientifically valid; the methods should achieve the aim by addressing the question, and the conclusions should match the results. The statistical analysis often attracts criticism, especially the relatively simple problems arising with the use of P-values and the concepts of statistical and clinical significance. There are several agreed guidelines describing exactly how studies should be reported. Following these is a great help to reviewers.
