## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis is admitted to hospital with fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. Diagnostic paracentesis confirms spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with an ascitic fluid neutrophil count of 600 cells/mm³ and positive culture for Escherichia coli. He is started on intravenous cefotaxime. After 48 hours of therapy, the patient remains febrile, his abdominal pain persists, and his white cell count is unchanged. The medical team is concerned about his lack of clinical improvement.

According to current BSG guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in assessing this patient's response to treatment?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most appropriate next step is to assess treatment response in a 58-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, confirmed SBP, and persistent fever, abdominal pain, and unchanged leukocyte count after 48 hours of IV cefotaxime. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed timing for reassessing SBP. Then, I should verify the objective criterion that defines an inadequate response. Next, I will consider what to do if the PMN count has not decreased adequately, including antibiotic modification and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. Finally, I should confirm supportive measures like albumin and whether any alternative diagnostics are indicated now or later [^9238030b] [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0].

> Let me first confirm the timing. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on reassessing SBP at 48 hours from initiation of antibiotics when there is an apparent inadequate clinical response, so waiting longer without objective reassessment would be inappropriate here [^9238030b] [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0].

> Wait, let me verify the objective criterion for response. The key metric is the ascitic fluid PMN count; a decrease of less than 25% from baseline at 48 hours indicates treatment failure and should trigger broadening of therapy and evaluation for secondary peritonitis, whereas a decrease of 25% or more is considered an adequate biochemical response even if symptoms lag [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0] [^4e6a1322].

> I should confirm the exact action. The most appropriate next step is a second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours to obtain a PMN count and, ideally, repeat culture, because this directly informs whether the current regimen is effective or whether resistance or an alternate diagnosis is present [^9238030b] [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about changing antibiotics yet. If the 48-hour PMN count has decreased by less than 25% from the baseline 600 cells/mm³, I need to broaden antibiotic coverage promptly and initiate evaluation for secondary bacterial peritonitis, including cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation, because persistent infection or a surgically treatable source becomes more likely in that scenario [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0] [^d68c9d8a].

> Let me consider supportive care that should not be overlooked. I should confirm that albumin was administered at diagnosis and again on day 3 if indicated, as this reduces renal failure and mortality in SBP; if not given, it should be started now in the appropriate dosing schedule, particularly when there is renal dysfunction or severe hepatic decompensation [^b51ae477] [^deec7543] [^e5d2f10a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could molecular testing help right now? Studies of ascitic bacterial DNA are promising for prognosis but have not shown utility for early treatment optimization, so multiplex PCR is not recommended to guide immediate antibiotic changes; I should avoid ordering it for that purpose and stick to culture-directed adjustments and clinical response criteria [^44da2cb3] [^d68c9d8a].

> I should double-check that we are not missing a noninfectious explanation for the lack of improvement. Given cirrhosis and encephalopathy, ongoing hepatic decompensation, HRS, or other complications can confound the clinical picture, but in the absence of a new focus of infection, the 48-hour paracentesis remains the most actionable and guideline-concordant next step to distinguish treatment failure from alternative diagnoses [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0].

> Bottom line, after verifying the 48-hour mark and the lack of clinical improvement, I need to ensure a second diagnostic paracentesis is performed now to obtain a PMN count and repeat culture, because this is the most appropriate next step per BSG, AASLD, and EASL guidance and will directly inform whether to broaden therapy and evaluate for secondary peritonitis [^9238030b] [^b51ae477] [^fb973fd0].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **repeat diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours** [^9238030b] to assess treatment response, as recommended by BSG guidelines [^192ea05a]. This should include ascitic neutrophil count and culture to evaluate for **antibiotic failure or secondary peritonitis** [^b51ae477]. If the neutrophil count has not decreased by at least 25% from baseline, broaden antibiotic coverage and evaluate for secondary peritonitis with imaging and surgical input [^fb973fd0] [^d68c9d8a].

---

## Indications for reassessment at 48 hours

BSG guidelines recommend reassessment at 48 hours for patients with **inadequate clinical response** or when secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected [^9238030b]. In this case, persistent fever, abdominal pain, and an unchanged white cell count after 48 hours of cefotaxime meet criteria for **inadequate response** and warrant repeat paracentesis [^192ea05a].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Repeat diagnostic paracentesis

- **Timing**: Perform at 48 hours from initiation of antibiotic therapy [^9238030b].
- **Tests**: Obtain ascitic fluid for neutrophil count and culture [^b51ae477].
- **Interpretation**: A decrease in neutrophil count of less than 25% from baseline indicates treatment failure or secondary peritonitis [^fb973fd0].

---

### Clinical implications of repeat paracentesis

Repeat paracentesis provides **objective data** to guide management:

| **Outcome** | **Clinical implication** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| Neutrophil count decreased by ≥ 25% | Treatment response is adequate | Continue current antibiotics |
| Neutrophil count decreased by < 25% | Treatment failure or secondary peritonitis | - Broaden antibiotic coverage <br/> - Evaluate for secondary peritonitis [^b51ae477] |

---

## Evaluation for secondary bacterial peritonitis

If neutrophil count fails to decrease adequately, **evaluate for secondary peritonitis**:

- **Imaging**: Obtain abdominal CT scan to identify surgically treatable causes (e.g. perforation, abscess) [^d68c9d8a].
- **Surgical consultation**: Involve surgery early if secondary peritonitis is suspected [^c9091915].
- **Antibiotic adjustment**: Broaden coverage based on local resistance patterns and culture results [^78764be0].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Repeat diagnostic paracentesis**: At 48 hours to assess treatment response [^9238030b].
- **Neutrophil count**: Evaluate for ≥ 25% decrease from baseline [^fb973fd0].
- **Broaden antibiotics**: If response is inadequate or secondary peritonitis is suspected [^b51ae477].
- **Imaging and surgical input**: Early CT and surgical consultation if secondary peritonitis is suspected [^d68c9d8a].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **repeat diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours** [^9238030b] to assess treatment response, with further management guided by neutrophil count and culture results [^b51ae477].

2020. 10292 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of fluid that accumulates in the abdomen. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of abdominal fluid, called ascites, that does not come from an obvious place within the abdomen, such as a hole in the intestines or a collection of pus. The condition typically affects people with liver disease, who often develop ascites as their disease worsens. Ascites forms in advanced liver disease when pressure is increased across the liver and when liver function is impaired, which causes levels of certain proteins to be lower in the blood. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can occur when bacteria that normally live in the intestine enter the abdominal cavity and the ascites becomes infected.

This happens in advanced liver disease because the immune system response weakens and the bacterial environment in the gut changes. Inflammation can cause the intestines to become leaky and allow gut bacteria to infect areas of the body that are normally germ free. The most common symptoms in people with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience confusion. However, there can also be no symptoms. Individuals who have advanced liver disease with ascites and are hospitalized for confusion and/or liver or kidney malfunction should be tested for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The biggest risk with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is sepsis, the rapid progression of infection to the whole body. It is important to recognize spontaneous bacterial peritonitis quickly so it can be treated. Doctors test for it by using a small needle and syringe to take a sample of the ascitic fluid to measure the number of white blood cells.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. A few days after starting antibiotics, a doctor may take another fluid sample to make sure the treatment is working. People who have had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are at risk of developing it again. Doctors may prescribe daily oral antibiotics to people who have either had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or who are at risk of developing it because they have very low protein levels in their ascitic fluid. Patients with advanced liver disease and ascites who experience bleeding from the esophagus, stomach, or intestines should receive antibiotics for 5 to 7 days to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Ascites can be treated by lowering salt intake and/or using water pills. People with advanced liver disease should also try to eat a high-protein diet to maintain good nutrition. Regular exercise is also encouraged to prevent loss of muscle.

Antibiotic therapy

The most common organisms isolated in patients with SBP include Escherichia coli, Gram-positive cocci (mainly streptococcus species) and enterococci. Empirical antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately after the diagnosis of SBP. In the 1990s, cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin, was extensively investigated in patients with SBP because it was found to cover 95% of organisms and high ascitic fluid concentrations could be achieved. The take home message from these studies is that matching an effective antibiotic to the cultured organism is key to successful treatment, rather than any apparent superiority of one drug over another. Since these studies, the landscape of bacterial resistance has significantly changed with an increase in antimicrobial resistant organisms, and therefore recommending a specific single empirical antibiotic is challenging. Thus, it is crucial to separate community-acquired SBP from healthcare-associated SBP (nosocomial – defined as infection > 48 hours after hospital admission)and to consider both the severity of infection and the local resistance profile in order to decide the empirical antibiotic treatment of SBP. Over recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms, defined by an acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. It is also important to highlight the shift to extensively drug resistant bacteria, defined by non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories, or to pan-drug resistance bacteria, defined by non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories.

A second diagnostic tap should be considered at 48 hours from starting treatment, to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in patients who have an apparently inadequate response. If ascitic fluid neutrophil count fails to decrease to less than 25% of the pretreatment value, this should raise suspicion of antibiotic resistance or the presence of 'secondary peritonitis'. Specialist microbiology links should be developed within each trust to help guide local policy and patient management and, in addition, de-escalation of anti-microbial agents according to susceptibility of positive cultures is recommended.

The evidence for the use of human albumin solution and recommendations for its use in SBP are discussed in a separate section below.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^4e6a1322]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) response assessment and duration are specified as follows: it is recommended that a diagnostic paracentesis (or thoracentesis for SBE) be performed 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy to assess response, and a negative response is defined by a decrease in PMN count < 25% from baseline that should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days, although a small study found therapy was shorter when discontinued once PMN decreased to < 250/mm³ (mean, 4.8 days) compared with empirically determined duration (mean, 9.6 days). Patients with ascites PMN < 250/mm³ and a positive bacteriological culture (bacterascites) without signs of infection should not receive antibiotics, and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to investigate progression to SBP, while repeat paracentesis/thoracentesis may be unnecessary if an organism is isolated, is susceptible, and the patient is improving clinically.

### Response-guided therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a randomized trial: a validation study of 2021 AASLD practice guidance for SBP [^ba7c169f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin were used as first-line agents. However, considering the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance, it is unclear which of these drugs can be initially recommended. This study aimed to compare the current efficacy of the 3 antibiotics, namely cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, for the treatment of SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites, when guided by therapeutic responses.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The inclusion criteria were 16- to 75-year-old patients with liver cirrhosis with ascites, having polymorphonuclear cell count of > 250/mm³. We performed a follow-up paracentesis at 48 hours to decide continuing or changing the assigned antibiotics and then assessed the resolution rates at 120 and 168 hours of treatment.

Results

A total of 261 patients with cirrhosis who developed SBP were enrolled. Most of the patients were diagnosed as those with SBP within 48 hours of admission. The resolution rates at 120 hours, which is the primary endpoint, were 67.8%, 77.0%, and 73.6% in the cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively (P = 0.388), by intension-to-treat analysis. The 1-month mortality was similar among the groups (P = 0.770). The model for end-stage liver disease score and the SBP resolution were significant factors for survival.

Conclusion

The efficacy of empirical antibiotics, such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, against SBP was not significantly different. In addition, these antibiotics administered based on response-guided therapy were still efficacious as initial treatment for SBP, especially in those with community-acquired infections.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2.

(Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10⁹/L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)

Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 2: decompensated cirrhosis [^1388dbcd]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of ascites management in the outpatient setting is diuretic therapy. This involves a stepwise approach as outlined in figure 3 with the additional specific recommendations:

Secondary antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in patients with a previous episode of SBP. Suitable antibiotic choices are norfloxacin 400 mg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg or co-trimoxazole 960 mg once daily. The ASEPTIC trial, investigating the role of primary prophylaxis of SBP, is ongoing. Some centres offer primary prophylaxis for those considered high risk of SBP (protein concentration < 15 g/L)but there are concerns around antibiotic resistance and this should only be considered following discussion with local microbiology teams. Rifaximin prescribed for secondary prophylaxis of HE may negate the prescription of a second oral systemic antibiotic with substantial evidence to suggest it prevents SBP.
NSBB, when indicated, is not contraindicated in refractory ascites; although patients require close monitoring; dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction.
Long-term outpatient albumin administration to patients with cirrhosis and ascites is not currently recommended: despite encouraging results from the ANSWER trial, the accompanying medical supervision was a strong confounding variable; further research is required to determine the efficacy, practicality, cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life.
Patients with refractory ascites requiring regular large-volume paracentesis should have them performed as planned day case procedures as this reduces costs and improves patient outcomes, particularly in the last year of life.
Indwelling abdominal drains remain experimental but can be considered in palliative patients with advanced disease as an alternative to recurrent large volume paracentesis following careful discussion involving the patient about the risk benefit ratio, and in particular the potential infection risk. Their use is currently being evaluated in the REDUCe2 trial.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^10cc2d7a]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^c87ec50a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

Infections

Patients with cirrhosis have impaired defence against bacteria due to immune dysfunction, and as a result, bacterial infections are one of the most frequent reasons for admission and are associated with a high mortality rate. A careful assessment for infection is critical in all patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, as prompt treatment with antibiotics improves prognosis. The most common infections in cirrhotics are SBP, followed by urinary tract infections and pneumonia, and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Escherichia coli, are the most frequently encountered pathogens. There has been a recent increase in the prevalence of infections with multidrug resistant bacteria in patients with cirrhosis, which emphasises the importance of taking the appropriate samples for culture and sensitivity, so patients can have their antibiotics modified accordingly. Importantly, patients with cirrhosis do not always display typical signs of infection, such as pyrexia or rise in CRP, so clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for infection. Once suspected clinically, infection should be treated promptly with broad spectrum antibiotics as per hospital protocol.

SBP is defined as infection of the ascitic fluid in the absence of a secondary cause, such as intestinal perforation, and occurs in approximately 10% of hospitalised patients with cirrhosis. Although abdominal pain and fever are commonly seen in patients with SBP, symptoms are frequently absent. It is, therefore, recommended that all patients presenting with ascites have a diagnostic ascitic tap to exclude SBP on admission to hospital, or if there is deterioration in their clinical status. Diagnosis of SBP is made when the absolute number of PMN cells is > 250/mm³ of ascitic fluid. Upon diagnosis, SBP should be empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, such as third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), co-amoxiclav or ciprofloxacin, according to hospital policy, with modifications made in light of subsequent culture results. Patients with SBP are at high risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and should have intravenous albumin administered to prevent worsening of renal function. Studies have shown that intravenous albumin 1.5 g/kg at diagnosis and 1 g/kg at 72 h reduces the incidence of HRS from 30% to 10% and reduces mortality from 29% to 10%.

Antimicrobial therapy — combination use, dosing, de-escalation, and duration — In children without immune compromise and without high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we suggest against the routine use of empiric multiple antimicrobials directed against the same pathogen for the purpose of synergy (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), although in certain situations, such as confirmed or strongly suspected group B streptococcal sepsis, use of empiric multiple antimicrobials directed against the same pathogen for the purpose of synergy may be indicated. In children with immune compromise and/or at high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we suggest using empiric multi-drug therapy when septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction is present/suspected (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend using antimicrobial dosing strategies that have been optimized based on published pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles and with consideration of specific drug properties (BPS). In children with septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction who are receiving antimicrobials, we recommend daily assessment (e.g., clinical, laboratory assessment) for de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy (BPS), and this assessment should include a review of the ongoing indication for empiric antimicrobial therapy after the first 48 hours that it is guided by microbiologic results and in response to clinical improvement and/or evidence of infection resolution. We recommend determining the duration of antimicrobial therapy according to the site of infection, microbial etiology, response to treatment, and ability to achieve source control (BPS).

### Bacterial DNA is a prognostic factor for mortality in patients who recover from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^44da2cb3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of the present work is the relatively small number of patients with SBP. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, it is the largest study to assess multiplex PCR in SBP patients. Moreover, it is the first to show that bactDNA detection at diagnosis of an SBP episode is associated with early mortality after resolution of the infection.

In conclusion, the study provided no evidence to support the implementation of bactDNA detected by a standardized multiplex PCR procedure to improve immediate bacterial identification and early optimization of antibiotic treatment in patients with SBP. However, bactDNA was an independent prognostic factor of early mortality in the subset of patients who recovered from the infection.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Prognosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) remains poor, despite proper management
Delayed or inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy has been demonstrated to further increase mortality rates
Sensitivity of ascitic cultures is moderate to low, even when performed according to guidelines

What the new findings are:

Ascitic fluid (AF) bacterial DNA detected by a multiplex PCR method could not increase the sensitivity of identification and optimize the choice of antibiotic treatment in SBP
During the SBP episode, severe liver disease and a vigorous inflammatory reaction were predictors of 7-day mortality
Presence of AF bacterial DNA and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at baseline were associated with short-term mortality after resolution of the SBP episode

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Febrile Neutropenic Patients

The safety and efficacy of empiric cefepime monotherapy of febrile neutropenic patients have been assessed in two multicenter, randomized trials comparing cefepime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours) to ceftazidime monotherapy (at a dose of 2 g intravenously every 8 hours). These studies comprised 317 evaluable patients. Table 10 describes the characteristics of the evaluable patient population.

Table 10: Demographics of Evaluable Patients (First Episodes Only)

ANC = absolute neutrophil count; SBP = systolic blood pressure

Table 11 describes the clinical response rates observed. For all outcome measures, cefepime was therapeutically equivalent to ceftazidime.

Table 11: Pooled Response Rates for Empiric Therapy of Febrile Neutropenic Patients

Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia). No data are available in patients with septic shock.

14.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

Patients hospitalized with complicated intra-abdominal infections participated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing the combination of cefepime (2 g every 12 hours) plus intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 6 hours) versus imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 hours) for a maximum duration of 14 days of therapy. The study was designed to demonstrate equivalence of the two therapies. The primary analyses were conducted on the population consisting of those with a surgically confirmed complicated infection, at least one pathogen isolated pretreatment, at least 5 days of treatment, and a 4 to 6 week follow-up assessment for cured patients. Subjects in the imipenem/cilastatin arm had higher APACHE II scores at baseline. The treatment groups were otherwise generally comparable with regard to their pretreatment characteristics. The overall clinical cure rate among the primary analysis patients was 81% (51 cured/63 evaluable patients) in the cefepime plus metronidazole group and 66% (62/94) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. The observed differences in efficacy may have been due to a greater proportion of patients with high APACHE II scores in the imipenem/cilastatin group.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c1275f1d]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although bacteremia caused by intravascular catheters is often cited as the commonest cause of BSI in the critical care setting, we were unable to identify any prospective, randomized investigations examining the duration of antibiotic therapy for CRBSI. Recommendations for length of treatment from the current IDSA guidelines are based only on expert opinion and retrospective case series and call for 5 to 7 days for infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, 7 to 14 days for Enterococci and Gram-negative organisms, and 2 to 6 weeks for S. aureus. Trials are urgently needed, as this may be the syndrome most appropriate for shorter-course therapy given that the focus of infection is removable and thereby leaves no persisting infectious nidus for most patients.

The available trials randomly assigning patients with intra-abdominal infections to shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic therapy were conducted in non-ICU settings and populations and explicitly excluded those with generalized secondary peritonitis or nosocomial infections. Equivalent outcomes for shorter- versus longer-duration therapy for SBP and localized intra-abdominal infection are in keeping with similar findings in a retrospective analysis of 929 patients with intra-abdominal infections, in which less than 7 days of therapy was not associated with higher complications or mortality. We have not uncovered evidence, though, of whether the effectiveness of short-duration therapy extends to patients with severe infections complicated by bacteremia or in those for whom source control cannot readily be achieved.

Several narrative reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs have provided evidence of the efficacy and safety of treating mild to moderate CAP with short-duration antibiotic therapy (5 to 7 days). The 13 studies of pneumonia identified for this review included 5 studies of CAP that provided the prevalence of bacteremia; in total, 80 patients with bacteremia were randomly assigned in equal numbers to short (3 to 7 days) and long (7 to 10 days) durations of therapy. Only three studies provided outcome data for bacteremic subgroups, and clinical cure was reported in 19 out of 21 patients (89.4%) receiving short-duration therapy (5 to 7 days) and in 17 out of 19 patients (90.4%) receiving extended therapy (7 to 10 days). These results provide a modicum of support for the growing consensus that CAP may be safely treated with shorter durations of therapy irrespective of the presence of bacteremia. Although a large VAP trial documented equivalent survival with shorter (8 days) versus longer (15 days) treatment, very few of these patients were bacteremic, and it is unclear whether shorter-duration treatment can be extended to this subgroup.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^d68c9d8a]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Ascitic fluid culture

Ascites culture is essential to help guide antibiotic therapy. Patients with 'culture-negative neutrocytic ascites' (PMN count > 250 cells/mm 3) have a similar presentation to those with culture-positive SBP. As both groups of patients have significant morbidity and mortality, they should be treated in a similar manner. Some patients have 'bacterascites' in which cultures are positive, but, ascitic neutrophil count is < 250 cells/mm³. In some patients, bacterascites represents a transient and spontaneously reversible colonisation of ascites, in others, particularly those who are symptomatic, it may represent the first step in the development of SBP. Discussion with microbiologists about the organism cultured can help differentiate the above two scenarios, and when a positive culture is obtained a repeat tap should be sent to guide management.

Although the identification of pathogen(s) is essential for the management of infectious diseases, ascites fluid cultures often fail to provide positive results, even when using ascites samples from patients who develop clinical manifestations of SBP. Bacterial DNA detection and sequencing have been applied to the diagnosis of several infectious diseases, and molecular techniques can detect small amounts of bacterial DNA within a few hours. These promising techniques have yet to be introduced into routine clinical practice.

Fungal peritonitis is a rare, less studied complication and observational data suggest a worse prognosis. In a large multicentre study of 2743 cirrhotic inpatients, of whom 1052 had infections, 12.7% of infected patients had evidence of fungal infections with a case fatality of 30%. The majority of these were urinary, but the highest mortality was seen with fungaemia and peritonitis (case fatality > 50%).

Secondary bacterial peritonitis

A small proportion of patients with cirrhosis may develop peritonitis secondary to perforation or inflammation of an intra-abdominal organ, known as secondary bacterial peritonitis. In a small retrospective analysis, secondary peritonitis represented 4.5% of all peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. This should be suspected in those who have localised abdominal symptoms or signs, very high ascitic neutrophil count, the presence of multiple organisms on ascitic culture or in those with inadequate response to treatment. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT, should be performed with early consideration of surgery in this scenario.

### Antibiotic therapy in patients with septic shock [^c8b27d0a]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of a patient with severe sepsis is first to diagnose the infection, to collect samples immediately after diagnosis and to initiate promptly broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy should be based on host characteristics, site of infection, local ecology and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the antibiotics. In severe infection, guidelines recommend the use of a combination of antibiotics. After results of cultures are obtained, treatment should be re-evaluated to either de-escalate or escalate the antibiotics. This is associated with optimal costs, decreased incidence of superinfection and reduced development of antimicrobial resistance. All these steps should be based on written protocols, and compliance to these protocols should be monitored continuously in order to detect violations and implement corrective procedures.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: benefit or risk? [^9a86cf44]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with risk of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Current guidelines recommend primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are at risk of a first episode and to prevent recurrence, respectively. Factors associated with prophylaxis failure leading to SBP, ACLF, and increased mortality are not well established. Gram-positive and multidrug-resistant organisms have become more frequently associated with SBP, particularly in the setting of ACLF. Efforts to understand how long-term antibiotic therapy may affect individual risk of SBP in this population will be critical to developing optimal preventive strategies.

Pediatric sepsis empiric antimicrobial management — timing and reassessment: Most microbiological cultures show significant growth within 24 to 36 hours, so empiric treatment should be reevaluated after no more than 48 hours following initiation. If no pathogen is identified and bacterial/fungal infection is deemed unlikely, clinicians should stop empiric antimicrobial therapy to reduce unnecessary exposure. Decisions to continue, narrow, or stop therapy must often be made on the basis of clinician judgment and indirect clinical information, and complex patients should be discussed with pediatric infectious diseases and/or microbiology specialists to ensure likely pathogens are treated and that antimicrobials are stopped when no longer necessary.

### Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19-an evidence based guideline [^a94fb455]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendation for the use of antibacterial therapy in hospitalized adults with a respiratory infection and suspected or proven 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

We performed a literature search to answer four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Questions Addressed By The Guideline and Recommendations

We assessed evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections and how to treat bacterial infections. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred up to 15%. No or very low quality evidence was found to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available evidence supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, especially upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be undertaken to obtain sputum and blood culture samples as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest to stop antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission when representative cultures as well as urinary antigen tests show no signs of involvement of bacterial pathogens after 48 hours. For patients with secondary bacterial respiratory infection we recommend to follow other guideline recommendations on antibacterial treatment for patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. An antibiotic treatment duration of five days in patients with COVID-19 and suspected bacterial respiratory infection is recommended upon improvement of signs, symptoms and inflammatory markers. Larger, prospective studies about the epidemiology of bacterial infections in COVID-19 are urgently needed to confirm our conclusions and ultimately prevent unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^5894d787]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^3cb1f7bb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^4816fb88]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis — AASLD 2021 guidance states that evidence for primary prophylaxis with antibiotics is not strong and is restricted to patients with very advanced cirrhosis, and SBP prophylaxis should be individualized based on estimated risks and benefits. SBP should receive long-term prophylaxis with daily norfloxacin; in settings in which norfloxacin is unavailable, oral ciprofloxacin is acceptable. In patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, antibiotic prophylaxis for SBP should be instituted; IV ceftriaxone 1 g/24 hours is the antibiotic of choice and should be used for a maximum of 7 days. In patients with cirrhosis and low protein (< 1.5 g/dL) ascites, primary SBP prophylaxis can be considered in selected patients with renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level > 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level > 25 mg/dL, or serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L) or liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score > 9 and bilirubin > 3 mg/dL).

UK regulatory approval is mandatory for any pharmacological or similar intervention to be considered. However, UK NICE approval is not considered.
Multiple treatment arms will be considered. To allow consideration of non-placebo comparators and standard therapies, network meta-analysis will be deployed in key targeted areas, as decided by the GDG subgroups and when sufficient volume of homogeneous studies is likely to be included.
For studies of induction of remission, the key outcomes will be clinical remission (including corticosteroid-free), clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, biochemical remission and biochemical response, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events.
The magnitude of effect of any intervention (against placebo or a comparator) for induction of clinical remission of importance will be defined at 10%.
For studies on maintenance of remission, the key outcomes will be clinical relapse, loss of clinical response, endoscopic and biochemical relapse, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events. Maintenance of remission studies will only be considered if patients were in clinical or endoscopic remission at baseline. Preplanned sensitivity analysis will include studies with patients in response, but this will not be the core analysis.
The magnitude of effect of any intervention (against placebo or comparator) for maintenance of clinical remission of importance will be defined at 10%.
For all such analysis, planned subgroup analysis will include whether patients received concomitant therapies (more than 50% in a group) with immunosuppression, corticosteroids or biological therapy (not anti-inflammatory, antibiotics or other classes of therapy), whether patients were biologically naïve and in the case of maintenance studies, as stated above, whether they are in a state of remission or response at baseline.
For studies not targeting induction or maintenance of remission, outcomes to be considered will include quality of life (using study defined scales), morbidity (including escalation of therapy or hospitalisation), abdominal pain and fatigue.
For all safety outcomes, no predefined levels for magnitude of effect of safety concerns will be made, as this will be dependent on the specific effect. All events with randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will be recorded and presented descriptively, as well as through meta-analysis. However, specific reporting will be made for all the following adverse events in both trials and observational studies: mortality, malignancy, sepsis, organ targeted inflammatory effects (pancreatitis, nephritis, hepatitis) and thromboembolic events will be specifically reported for all interventions.
Therapy delivered in primary, secondary or tertiary care, as well as self-administered will be considered but setting will be described in the technical summary to allow any clarifying statements to be made regarding the context of evidence.

Patients and methods

Study population

This observational study was conducted in a single tertiary center from September 2017 to May 2020. SBP was diagnosed according to international guidelines. Data were prospectively collected from 55 consecutive patients with decompensated cirrhosis and SBP. Patients with extrahepatic solid or hematological malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, previous transplantation or any other type of immunodeficiency, multi-microbial infections, secondary bacterial peritonitis were excluded, as were those on peritoneal dialysis.

Thirty-six patients with decompensated cirrhosis admitted for a scheduled large-volume paracentesis were used as control group to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the bactDNA method to identify causative bacteria. Five (13.9%) controls had a history of SBP. The median time interval between the previous SBP episode and the current data collection was 8 (range 1–11) months. The study protocol was approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee. All study participants or their relatives provided informed written consent prior to study enrolment.

Treatment strategy

Diagnostic paracentesis of ascites was performed on admission, at 48 h post admission to evaluate the result of empirical antibiotic treatment, and after clinical resolution of the SBP episode. Soon after the SBP diagnosis, empirical treatment was administered intravenously and was maintained or modified if the treatment was not appropriate (according to the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility test), or if the AF neutrophil count reduction calculated at 48 h post initiation of empirical treatment did not reach 25%. Infections were classified as HCA in patients with a hospitalization for at least 2 days in the previous 6 months, nosocomial when developed more than 48 h after admission, and CA when they were present on admission or developed within the first 48 h after admission in the absence of previous hospitalization in the previous 6 months. An empirical selection of antibiotics was made according to current guidelines and local epidemiological data for bacterial resistance. SBP was considered cured if neutrophil count was < 250 × 10⁹/L after 5 days of appropriate antibiotic treatment. All patients were followed for 30 days, empirical treatment was recorded, and mortality was evaluated at 7 and 30 days.

Data collection

Clinical and laboratory data (in both blood and AF) were obtained on admission (at baseline) and in those who recovered at day 8 post-admission. Severity of liver disease was assessed by the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores. ACLF was diagnosed in patients who fulfilled the established criteria of the CANONIC study. AF white cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were assessed by light microscopy.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^ea9bec00]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, and increasing frequency and costs are reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) that are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, there are significant treatment challenges, including overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties regarding when to initiate rescue therapy and when to stop treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Also, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing the knowledge on the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in dealing with the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response may be a key factor, due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. The standard assessment of response in SSTI trials has been performed after end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success posttreatment may often be the result of natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following nonantibiotic therapy in studies from the preantibiotic and early antibiotic eras. Moreover, 2 studies published in 1937 comparing antibiotic and ultraviolet therapy found the difference between treatment arms to peak 2–3 days after start of treatment, suggesting that early response is a more treatment-specific measure than cure assessed posttreatment. Clinical response 48–72 hours after treatment initiation is therefore currently recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the primary efficacy endpoint for clinical trials. This has not been without controversy, however, primarily because early response is not the ultimate goal of antibiotic therapy. European guidelines still recommend cure assessed after treatment as the primary endpoint.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the development of bacterial infection of ascites in the absence of any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection. The prevalence of SBP in outpatients is 1.5–3.5% and approximately 10% in hospitalised patients. A recent European study detected a prevalence of 11.3% among inpatients. When first described, mortality associated with SBP exceeded 90%, but, in-hospital mortality has been reduced to approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. In an observational study, each hour of delay in diagnostic paracentesis after admission was associated with a 3.3% increase of in-hospital mortality after adjusting for model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Long-term survival remains poor; 1-year survival after hospitalisation with SBP in a UK study was found to be 34%. Patients recovering from an episode of SBP should always be considered as potential candidates for liver transplantation if they have not already been assessed.

### Guidelines for the management of adult acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure in the ICU: neurology, peri-transplant medicine, infectious disease, and gastroenterology considerations [^78764be0]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) — empiric antimicrobial therapy and resistance considerations emphasize early, targeted treatment and resistance-aware selection. Delayed administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is associated with increased mortality. Systematic reviews report multidrug-resistant pathogens in nosocomial SBP at 30–66% and higher third-generation cephalosporin resistance in nosocomial versus community settings, with nosocomial SBP having higher resistance risk (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14–2.44; p = 0.008). For healthcare-associated SBP, carbapenem-based empirical therapy showed lower mortality and treatment failure than third-generation cephalosporin regimens (6% vs 25%; p = 0.01, 18% vs 51%; p = 0.001) and better cost effectiveness. Accordingly, "we recommend limiting the use of third-generation cephalosporins in the initial empirical treatment to low-risk community-acquired SBP patients in the setting of low prevalence of drug resistance", and "Active agents against ESBL-producing pathogen (Carbapenems) should be considered for the empirical treatment of healthcare-associated SBP". In high-risk critically ill or nosocomial cases, a "tailored approach… covering resistant pathogens (ESBL, MRSA, ± VRE) would be best suited", with de-escalation after cultures since "antibiotic therapy should be tailored to the narrowest spectrum based on organism sensitivities".

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever biomarkers guidance states that in critically ill patients with a new fever and no clear focus of infection, when the probability of bacterial infection is low to intermediate, we suggest measuring procalcitonin (PCT) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) in addition to bedside clinical evaluation versus bedside clinical evaluation alone (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When the probability is high, we suggest not measuring PCT to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence) and we suggest not measuring CRP to rule out bacterial infection (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

Albumin in cirrhosis with infection and SBP indicates benefit and dosing: IV albumin improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and SBP, with those who most benefited having renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dL or creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL) or severe hepatic decompensation (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL). In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^5d87c683]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Early stoppage of empirical antibiotic therapy in paediatric acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia: a randomized, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^80eb0f51]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication seen in paediatric patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. The immunocompromised state caused by intensive chemotherapy blunts the typical inflammatory responses, making early fever often the only clinical clue of a serious underlying infection. Consequently, prompt initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is the cornerstone of management to reduce mortality due to febrile neutropenia.

The latest Clinical Practice Guidelines conditionally recommend cessation of EAT in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia who are clinically stable and have been afebrile for at least 24 h, even in the absence of evidence of bone marrow recovery, provided blood cultures remain negative at 48 h. However, the guidelines currently recommend continuing EAT in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia until bone marrow recovery. Reflecting on this recommendation, a recent survey of clinicians managing paediatric febrile neutropenia found that the majority recommend continuing EAT until marrow recovery in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia. Although continuing EAT until bone marrow recovery is recommended based on the assumption that it may reduce the risk of untreated infections during prolonged neutropenia, conversely, there are concerns that this approach may lead to unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic use in the absence of documented infection or persistent symptoms. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and longer hospital stays, both of which contribute to the financial and time toxicity of cancer treatment.

Multiple randomized trials in adult patients with haematological malignancies have demonstrated that early discontinuation of EAT during febrile neutropenia is a viable strategy that increases antibiotic-free days without elevating the risk of adverse events or mortality. While previous paediatric studies have shown that early discontinuation of EAT is non-inferior to continuation until bone marrow recovery in children with low-risk febrile neutropenia, evidence in high-risk febrile neutropenia among children remains limited. A multicentre randomized trial involving children with low and high-risk febrile neutropenia, who tested positive for respiratory viral pathogens and became afebrile after 48 h of EAT, compared early antibiotic discontinuation versus continuation until bone marrow recovery. Although this study demonstrated the non-inferiority of the early discontinuation strategy, factors such as persistent viral detection after clinical recovery and asymptomatic colonization raised concerns regarding routine viral testing to guide early antibiotic discontinuation.

To address this important evidence gap, we conducted a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial among children with acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia during induction to evaluate whether early discontinuation of EAT among children with sustained clinical improvement before bone marrow recovery is non-inferior to continuation of EAT until bone marrow recovery.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and other spontaneous infections — symptoms and diagnostic criteria specify that symptoms/signs specific to SBP are abdominal pain, tenderness on palpation (with or without rebound tenderness), and ileus, yet up to one third of the patients with spontaneous infections may be entirely asymptomatic or present with only encephalopathy and/or acute kidney injury (AKI). The diagnosis of SBP or SBE is established with a fluid absolute neutrophil count greater than 250/mm³ (ascites or pleural, respectively), and spontaneous bacteremia is established with positive blood cultures.
