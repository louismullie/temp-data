## Question

Why is nitroglycerin given during tilt table test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why nitroglycerin is given during tilt-table testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indication for tilt testing and its inherent limitations. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for using nitroglycerin as a provocative agent. Next, I will review guideline-endorsed protocols and dosing. After that, I need to examine the hemodynamic mechanisms and the sensitivity–specificity trade-off. Finally, I should consider safety, alternatives, and how recent protocol refinements affect practice, before synthesizing a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Tilt-table testing is used when vasovagal syncope is suspected but the diagnosis remains uncertain after history, exam, and ECG, with the goal of reproducing the patient's spontaneous event under monitored conditions to confirm a reflex mechanism and phenotype, while recognizing that a positive test indicates susceptibility rather than proving causality in a specific episode [^1167WJ5n] [^114eqLxv] [^113yR2ne].

> Wait, let me verify the core limitation of passive tilt. Passive head-up tilt alone can miss a substantial proportion of patients with vasovagal syncope because the test's sensitivity is modest, so pharmacologic provocation is often needed to unmask latent reflex hypotension/bradycardia in susceptible individuals [^1167WJ5n] [^115af6jD].

> I will now examine the pharmacologic rationale for nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a nitric oxide donor that causes venodilation and, to a lesser extent, arteriolar dilation, thereby increasing venous pooling and reducing preload; in upright tilt, this augments orthostatic stress and can precipitate the vasovagal reflex in predisposed patients, which is precisely the diagnostic signal we seek [^113VZF3Z].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline-supported protocols and dosing. The Italian protocol, widely adopted in Europe and endorsed in ESC guidance, administers 300–400 micrograms of sublingual nitroglycerin after a passive upright phase, typically at 60–70 degrees for 20 minutes, followed by an additional 15 minutes of observation; a validated fast variant shortens the passive phase to 10 minutes and the drug phase to 10 minutes with similar diagnostic yield, and ACC/AHA/HRS guidance acknowledges that adjunctive nitrates can improve sensitivity at the cost of some specificity [^114EDBHe] [^114NJR5c] [^111tRSms] [^1167WJ5n].

> Next, I should review the hemodynamic mechanism to ensure I'm not over-attributing to vasodilation alone. Let me consider the data: after nitroglycerin during tilt, stroke volume and cardiac output fall substantially while systemic vascular resistance is initially maintained, indicating that the precipitating hypotension is primarily cardiac output–mediated; baroreflex control of heart rate appears impaired, and epinephrine surges may contribute in some patients, aligning with a neurally mediated, preload-sensitive mechanism rather than pure vasodepression [^113VZF3Z] [^112d8thq] [^115fEmvJ].

> But wait, what about diagnostic performance and the sensitivity–specificity trade-off. I should double-check the numbers: nitrate-potentiated tilt increases positivity rates compared with passive tilt, with pooled estimates around 66% sensitivity and about 92–94% specificity in controlled settings, though front-loaded nitrate-first protocols can raise false positives; importantly, guidelines caution that pharmacologic augmentation improves sensitivity but reduces specificity, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^112pcfPb] [^114NJR5c] [^114kLXJf] [^1167WJ5n].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Nitroglycerin-provoked tilt testing is generally safe when performed with continuous ECG and beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring and with resuscitation equipment available; common adverse effects include headache and transient hypotension, and severe bradycardia or asystole can occur but are uncommon and typically self-limited; contraindications include severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and significant ischemic heart disease, and patients should be fasted as per protocol to reduce aspiration risk [^112ohkpD] [^112ksvco] [^114NJR5c].

> Let me consider alternatives and comparative agents. Isoproterenol is an alternative provocative agent, particularly used historically in North America, but it requires intravenous access and carries arrhythmia risk; head-to-head data suggest nitroglycerin and isoproterenol may unmask different subtypes or mechanisms, and in some cohorts nitroglycerin yields more positive responses, whereas clomipramine, a centrally acting agent, can increase positivity in patients with central triggers; the choice should reflect local expertise, patient comorbidity, and the suspected mechanism [^113S8Fvi] [^115N2quo] [^1167WJ5n].

> Hold on, I should verify how recent protocol refinements change practice. The Fast Italian protocol demonstrates noninferior diagnostic yield with substantially shorter duration, improving throughput without sacrificing accuracy, and contemporary reviews emphasize that tilt testing remains valuable for exposing a tendency to reflex syncope and for patient education, even as our interpretation shifts from "diagnosis" to "susceptibility phenotype" [^111tRSms] [^113KyGJv] [^112pcfPb].

> In summary, nitroglycerin is given during tilt testing to pharmacologically amplify orthostatic stress by increasing venous pooling and reducing preload, thereby unmasking vasovagal reflex susceptibility in patients with otherwise inconclusive evaluations; this approach is guideline-endorsed, mechanistically coherent, and operationally efficient, but it must be applied with attention to protocol, safety, and the interpretive limits of sensitivity and specificity [^114EDBHe] [^1167WJ5n] [^113VZF3Z].

---

Nitroglycerin is used during tilt table testing to **increase sensitivity** by provoking vasovagal syncope through venodilation and reduced preload, mimicking real-life triggers [^113VZF3Z] [^1167WJ5n]. It is given after a passive tilt phase if no response occurs, typically as 300–400 μg sublingually [^114EDBHe] [^114NJR5c]. This shortens testing time and improves diagnostic yield [^114kLXJf], but may cause headache or hypotension and is contraindicated in severe valvular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or baseline hypotension [^112ohkpD] [^112ksvco]. The test is stopped if syncope or severe hypotension occurs, with continuous monitoring and resuscitation equipment on standby [^112ohkpD].

---

## Mechanism of action

Nitroglycerin is a **potent vasodilator** that acts primarily on venous capacitance vessels, reducing preload and cardiac output, and secondarily on arterial resistance, lowering afterload [^113VZF3Z]. During tilt testing, this venodilation increases venous pooling and reduces venous return, precipitating reflex vasodilation and bradycardia that mimic spontaneous vasovagal syncope [^113yR2ne].

---

## Clinical rationale for use in tilt table testing

The primary rationale is to **increase diagnostic sensitivity** by unmasking latent vasovagal tendencies that may not appear during passive tilt alone [^112pcfPb]. It is typically administered after a negative passive tilt phase (20 minutes at 60–70°) if no syncope or significant hypotension occurs [^111V7PzS].

---

## Protocol for administration

- **Dose**: 300–400 μg sublingually, administered in the upright position after the passive tilt phase [^114EDBHe] [^114NJR5c].
- **Timing**: Administered after 20 minutes of passive tilt if no response occurs [^114NJR5c].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous ECG and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring throughout the test [^115JJLT8].
- **Termination criteria**: Test terminated upon syncope, severe hypotension, or completion of the drug phase (typically 15–20 minutes) [^111V7PzS] [^115N2quo] [^1158jknh].

---

## Diagnostic yield and clinical utility

Nitroglycerin-potentiated tilt testing **significantly increases diagnostic yield** compared with passive tilt alone, with sensitivity reported between 60–80% and specificity around 85–90% [^112pcfPb]. It is particularly useful in patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and suspected vasovagal syncope, helping confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^1167WJ5n].

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

While generally safe, nitroglycerin can cause headache, flushing, and hypotension; **continuous monitoring and resuscitation equipment are essential** [^112ohkpD]. Contraindications include severe valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, baseline hypotension, and known hypersensitivity to nitrates [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological agents

Isoproterenol, a beta-agonist, is an alternative agent that increases heart rate and contractility, thereby enhancing sensitivity. However, nitroglycerin is **preferred in many centers** due to its simplicity of administration (sublingual spray), rapid onset, and favorable safety profile [^115af6jD].

---

## Recent advancements and modifications

Recent studies have explored shortened protocols ("Fast Italian Protocol") that reduce testing time without compromising diagnostic accuracy [^111tRSms]. These protocols involve shorter passive and drug phases while maintaining similar sensitivity and specificity [^111tRSms].

---

Nitroglycerin is a **valuable adjunct** in tilt table testing, increasing diagnostic sensitivity for vasovagal syncope by provoking reflex hypotension and bradycardia. Its use is well-established, safe, and effective when administered according to standardized protocols, with continuous monitoring and appropriate safety precautions [^1167WJ5n].

In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Russo and colleaguesreport the results of a randomized trial of a considerably shortened version of the widely used Italian tilt test protocol. They compared similar test structures with the new version lasting only 20 min with the currently recommended duration of 35 min. The two test protocols performed very similarly, which offers the possibility of saving precious clinical time. The importance of this study is best understood in the context of current assessment of syncope, considering the long evolution of tilt-table testing, and the necessary diffusion of this simple and short diagnostic tool into many settings.

Tilt testing methodology — protocol parameters and drug provocation are specified as follows: A supine pre-tilt stabilization phase is "of at least 5 min, when no venous cannulation, and of at least 20 min, when cannulation is undertaken, is recommended" (Class I, Level C); the "Tilt angle between 60 and 70° is recommended" (Class I, Level B); and a "Passive phase of a minimum of 20 min and a maximum of 45 min is recommended" (Class I, Level B). For pharmacologic provocation, "For nitroglycerine, a fixed dose of 300–400 μg sublingually administered in the upright position is recommended" (Class IIa, Level B), and "For isoproterenol, an incremental infusion rate from 1 up to 3 μg/min in order to increase average heart rate by 20–25% over baseline is recommended". In addition, for run-in timing, "in the isoproterenol protocol a pre-tilt phase of stabilization of 20 min is required, whereas with sublingual nitroglycerine the pre-tilt phase can be shortened to 5 min".

Tilt-table testing — suspected vasovagal syncope (VVS) after inconclusive initial evaluation: If the diagnosis is unclear after initial evaluation, tilt-table testing can be useful for patients with suspected VVS, with test interpretation based on an inducible presyncope/syncope associated with hypotension with or without bradycardia and hemodynamic patterns (cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, or mixed), and there is general consensus that a tilt-table angle of 70 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes would provide optimal yield; adjunctive low-dose isoproterenol infusion or sublingual nitrates may improve sensitivity but decrease specificity.

### Steep fall in cardiac output is main determinant of hypotension during drug-free and nitroglycerine-induced orthostatic vasovagal syncope [^112d8thq]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

How much of the hypotension occurring during postural syncope is cardiac output-mediated and how much can be ascribed to a fall in systemic vascular resistance are unknown. The contribution of both determinants may be influenced by the use of vasoactive drugs.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the determinants of hypotension during drug-free and nitroglycerine (NTG)-induced vasovagal presyncope in routine tilt table testing.

Methods

In this retrospective study, a total of 56 patients (37 female; age 36 ± 19 years) with suspected vasovagal syncope and a positive tilt test at two clinical centers were selected. In 29 patients, presyncope was provoked by 0.4 mg sublingual NTG, administered in the 60 degrees head-up tilt position. In the other 27 patients, presyncope was provoked by passive tilt alone. Finger arterial pressure was monitored continuously, and left ventricular stroke volume was computed from pressure pulsations.

Results

After NTG administration, heart rate rose, and peak heart rate was similar in all patients. Use of NTG did not affect circulatory patterns precipitating a vasovagal response. On average in all patients, marked hypotension was mediated by an approximately 50% fall in cardiac output, whereas systemic vascular resistance was well maintained until presyncope.

Conclusion

Hypotension during routine tilt testing is cardiac output-mediated, and the mechanism appears independent of the use of 0.4 mg sublingual NTG. The study data challenge the conventional idea of systemic vasodilation as the overriding cause of hypotension during postural syncope.

### Tilt testing evolves: faster and still accurate [^115qoXUh]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

By the late 1990s to early 2000s, Europe was concentrating on sublingual nitroglycerin and tilt testing was in decline in theUSA. At this point, the 'Italian protocol' with a moderate 20 min passive tilt period followed by a 15 min drug intervention period with sublingual nitroglycerin was publishedand adopted by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines in 2001 and all subsequent iterations to the present version issued in 2018.

The 'Italian protocol' is still lengthy and now is challenged by the Russo groupwho have approached further shortening of the test by reduction of the passive phase to 10 min made on a scientific basis (Graphical Abstract). Russo and colleagues examined equal groups (n = 277 in each) of patients with unexplained syncope using the traditional (i.e. longer) and the fast (shortened) Italian protocol, demonstrating almost the same rate of positive responses (58.5% vs. 60.3%). These authors conclude that their 'Fast Italian' protocol may safely replace the traditional one, and it is difficult not to agree with them as the modified protocol may save a lot of time in the tilt laboratory.

Russo's group has made an important stepwhich is expected to be widely adopted. If this happens, patients benefit, with more cases being diagnosed; is the expectation further strengthened by our new understanding of reflex syncope that has accumulated in recent years? The enlightenment was, perhaps, triggered by the 'Reinterpretation of tilt testing' in 2014and has been followed by the identification of a low blood pressure (BP) phenotype prone to sustain a positive tilt testand demonstration of asymptomatic episodes of hypotension in these patients, offering a further test by ambulatory BP monitoring to confirm the patient's susceptibility to reflex syncope.

Vasovagal reflex is the most common syncope aetiology, but almost all subsequent deaths of syncope patients are due to a wide variety of cardiovascular problems. Only 5–10% of diagnosed aetiologies are related to cardiac arrhythmias. In many countries, care is centred in syncope units, use of the Italian protocol is high, and the abbreviated Russo protocol will further streamline care. In countries in which care for syncope patients tends to be directed towards arrhythmia specialists, who are primarily focused on arrhythmia detection, ablation, and devices, with less focus on non-cardiac syncope, adoption of the Fast Italian protocol might be a potential 'game changer'.

Tilt testing — protocols and performance include a low‑dose intravenous isoproterenol test using incremental doses to increase average heart rate (HR) by ~20–25% over baseline (usually ≤ 3 μg/min) and a protocol using 300–400 μg of sublingual nitroglycerine after a 20 min unmedicated phase; both protocols have a similar rate of positive responses (61–69%), with a high specificity (92–94%), and patients should be fasted for 4 h prior to the test.

Tilt testing safety and adverse effects — risk profile and preparedness are described as follows: "Tilt testing is safe. There have been no reported deaths during the test". With nitroglycerine, "No complications have been published with the use of nitroglycerine", though "Minor side effects are common and include palpitations with isoproterenol and headache with nitroglycerine". Arrhythmias can occur since "Atrial fibrillation can be induced during or after a positive tilt test and is usually self-limited", and preparedness is emphasized because "it is recommended that resuscitation equipment should be available".

### Effect of clinical triggers on positive responses to tilt-table testing potentiated with nitroglycerin or clomipramine [^115N2quo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The effect of clinical triggers on tilt-table testing (TTT) responses has not been systematically evaluated. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of clinical triggers on positive responses to TTT potentiated with nitroglycerin (which acts mainly through peripheral dilation) or clomipramine (which acts mainly through a central serotoninergic mechanism). We enrolled 380 consecutive adult patients. In 66 patients, syncope was triggered by emotional distress (central trigger), in 161 by specific situations or prolonged standing (peripheral trigger), and in 153 syncope occurred in the absence of any detectable trigger. Nitroglycerin TTT, performed in 252 patients, consisted of a passive phase of 20 minutes followed, if negative, by sublingual administration of 400 μg nitroglycerin spray and continuation of tilting for 15 minutes. Clomipramine TTT, performed in 128 patients, consisted of 20 minutes of tilting with intravenous administration of 5 mg clomipramine during the first 5 minutes. The positivity of nitroglycerin TTT was greater in patients with clinical triggers (71% central and 75% peripheral) than in those without (36%). With clomipramine TTT, the positivity rate was greater in patients with central triggers (92%) than in those with peripheral triggers (45%) or no triggers (30%). The cardioinhibitory form was more frequent in patients with a central trigger than in the other 2 groups (34% vs 12% and 7%) and with clomipramine TTT than with nitroglycerin TTT (19% vs 11%, respectively). In contrast, mixed or vasodepressor forms were more frequently induced by nitroglycerin TTT (41% vs 24%). In conclusion, the presence of clinical triggers increased the positivity of TTT and influenced the type of response. We found some specificity of nitroglycerin and clomipramine for peripheral and central mechanisms.

### Tilt testing [^1111NuHw]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tilt testing can help to diagnose unexplained syncope, by precipitating an episode during cardiac monitoring. The Italian protocol, now most widely used, involves giving sublingual nitroglycerine after 15min, while monitoring beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and recording on video. Tilt testing is time-consuming but it is clinically useful and can guide therapy. Complications are rare. Syncope types include vasovagal syncope where BP falls after > 3min of tilt-up and later the heart rate falls; classic orthostatic hypotension where there is an immediate, progressive BP fall with minimal heart rate change; delayed orthostatic hypotension with a late BP fall after a stable phase but little or no heart rate rise; psychogenic pseudosyncope with apparent loss of consciousness, but no BP fall and a moderate heart rate rise; and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome where there is a significant heart rate rise but no BP fall.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin used in routine tilt testing provokes a cardiac output-mediated vasovagal response [^113VZF3Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We set out to determine the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG), as used during routine tilt testing in patients with unexplained syncope, on hemodynamic characteristics and baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

Background

Nitroglycerin is used in tilt testing to elicit a vasovagal response. It is known to induce venous dilation and enhance pooling. Also, NTG is lipophilic and readily passes cell membranes, and animal studies suggest a sympatho-inhibitory effect of NTG on circulatory control.

Methods

Routine tilt testing was conducted in 39 patients with suspected vasovagal syncope (age 36 ± 16 years, 18 females). Patients were otherwise healthy and free of medication. Before a loss of consciousness set in, oncoming syncope was cut short by tilt-back or counter-maneuvers. Finger arterial pressure was monitored continuously (Finapres). Left ventricular stroke volume (SV) was computed from the pressure pulsations (Modelflow). Spontaneous baroreflex control of HR was estimated in the time and frequency domains.

Results

During tilt testing, 22 patients developed presyncope. After NTG administration but before presyncope, SV and cardiac output (CO) decreased (p < 0.001), whereas SVR and HR increased (p < 0.001) in all patients. Arterial pressure was initially maintained. Baroreflex sensitivity decreased after NTG. On Cox regression analysis, the occurrence of a vasovagal response was related to a drop in SV after NTG (hazard ratio 0.86, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

The cardiovascular response to NTG is similar in vasovagal and non-vasovagal patients, but more pronounced in those with tilt-positive results. The NTG-facilitated presyncope appears to be CO-mediated, and there is no evidence of NTG-induced sympathetic inhibition.

### 'Front-loaded' head-up tilt table testing: validation of a rapid first line nitrate-provoked tilt protocol for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope [^114kLXJf]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Head-up tilt testing is the investigation of choice in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. The test is time consuming and labour intensive, with conventional tilt testing taking up to 45 min. We compared a shortened 'front-loaded' 20-min glyceryl trinitrate-provoked head-up tilt (FLGTN-HUT) with the standard 40-min passive tilt (HUT) as first line investigations in patients with unexplained syncope and asymptomatic controls. In the study, 149 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope and 83 asymptomatic controls were enrolled. Subjects were randomly assigned to FLGTN-HUT (800 mcg, metred spray) or HUT, then the opposite tilt-test 1 week later. Seventeen (11.4%) patients had diagnostic haemodynamic changes and symptom reproduction during HUT and 54 (36.2%) during FLGTN-HUT. A total of 24.8% more patients had a positive test with FLGTN-HUT than with passive HUT (95% CI: 16.3%, 33.4%). Nine (10.8%) controls had significant haemodynamic changes during HUT and 23 (27.7%) during GTN provocation. Seven controls had haemodynamic changes on both HUT and FLGTN-HUT testing. The controls group had 16.8% more significant haemodynamic changes with FLGTN-HUT than with HUT (95% CI: 0.06, 27.4). The front-loaded GTN protocol provided a higher diagnostic rate than passive tilt testing, and provides a rapid alternative to conventional methods, though false positivity rates are higher.

### Head-up tilt testing in older syncope patients: a systematic review [^113X7GTQ]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points

There is no consistent evidence in the current literature that positivity rates of the head-up tilt test (HUTT) differ between older (≥ 65 years) and younger patients presenting with unexplained syncope.
Nitroglycerin provocation yields more diagnoses than passive HUTT, with low rates of false positives, and is safe to perform in older patients.
The vasodepressive response is the most frequently seen during HUTT in this population.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^113X6Vm1]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether or not heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during the first 20 min of head-up tilt testing could predict whether patients will develop syncope after nitroglycerine administration.

Design

64 patients with previous loss of consciousness underwent head-up tilt testing with the Italian protocol, which involves the administration of nitroglycerine after 20 min of tilt. HRV parameters were analysed from 5 min intervals selected during pretest supine rest (phase 1), the first 5 min (phase 2) and the last 5 min (phase 3) of passive 20 min of tilting, prior to the administration of nitroglycerine. Differences in power (ms²) of the spectral components between the various phases of tilting were calculated for each patient and expressed as Δ.

Results

20 patients (group 1, 9 women, mean age 43.2 ± 24.5 years) had a syncope during tilt testing after nitroglycerine, while the other 44 (group 2, 24 women, mean age 41 ± 20.5 years) did not. In group 1, the HRV spectral parameters high frequency (HF) and total power (TP) had a significant decrement from phases 2 to 3 (p = 0.012 and 0.027, respectively), while in group 2 the average HF and TP values did not change. The Δ of spectral parameters between phases 2 and 3 were able to differentiate between the two groups and to predict syncope after nitroglycerine administration (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

HRV analysis within the first 20 min of passive tilting demonstrated that patients with nitroglycerine-induced syncope are characterised by a progressive decrement of parasympathetic activity, which does not occur in patients with a negative response to nitroglycerine. If confirmed on a wider population, HRV analysis could replace nitroglycerine administration and shorten the duration of the tilt test.

### Short-duration head-up tilt test potentiated with sublingual nitroglycerin in suspected vasovagal syncope: the fast Italian protocol [^111tRSms]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The traditional nitroglycerin (NTG) head-up tilt test (HUTT) is time-consuming and the test duration is a barrier to widespread utilization in clinical practice. It was hypothesized that a short-duration protocol is not inferior to the traditional protocol regarding the positivity rate and has a similar distribution of hemodynamic response.

Methods and Results

Patients undergoing HUTT were randomized 1:1 to a 10 min passive phase plus a 10 min 0.3 mg NTG if the passive phase was negative (Fast) or to a 20 min passive phase plus a 15 min 0.3 mg NTG if the passive phase was negative (Traditional). A sample size of 277 patients for each group achieved 80% power to detect an expected difference of 0% with a non-inferiority margin of -10% using a one-sided t-test and assuming a significant level alpha of 0.025. A total of 554 consecutive patients (mean age 46.6 ± 19.3 years, 47.6% males) undergoing HUTT for suspected vasovagal syncope were randomly assigned to the Fast (n = 277) or Traditional (n = 277) protocol. A positive response was defined as the induction of syncope in presence of hypotension/bradycardia, and was observed in 167 (60.3%) patients with Fast and in 162 (58.5%) patients with the Traditional protocol. There was a trend of lesser vasodepressor response (14.8% Fast vs. 20.6% Traditional) which was significant during the passive phase (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

The diagnostic value of the Fast HUTT protocol is similar to that of the Traditional protocol and therefore the Fast protocol can be used instead of the Traditional protocol.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^111hjVei]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Head-up tilt testing (HUT) has a central part in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope (VVS).

Different protocols have been established over the years, with different strengths and weaknesses. The Italian protocol has the highest sensitivity, but has at times been criticised for lower specificity due to the administration of nitroglycerine. Moreover, in a very recent study carried out in patients with likely VVS, HUT with nitroglycerine had a low-diagnostic value in predicting long-term outcomes, suggesting that HUT is of limited value in the management of patients with suspected neurally mediated syncope.

Through the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological phenomenon resultant from the dynamic modulation of HR by the interaction of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems activity, it is possible to study the dynamics of event-induced changes of cardiac autonomic modulation. Thus, HRV analysis is a powerful, non-invasive tool to explore dynamic interactions between physiological, mental, emotional and behavioural processes, whose interplay can also be pivotal in the genesis of syncopal attacks and has been used to evaluate autonomic adaptation/reaction induced by HUT.

Previous studies have shown contradictory HRV results during HUT in patients with VVS and healthy controls. Most authors agree that HUT induces a decrease in high frequency (HF) power, calculated in absolute (ms 2) and/or normalised units (nu), variable changes of the low frequency (LF) component and an increase in the LF/HF ratio both in patients with VVS and controls. Other authors, however, have reported inadequate sympathovagal balance in response to orthostatism with a decrease in LF/HF in patients with positive HUT.

In two studies, evidence has been provided that the outcome of HUT can be predicted before the onset of syncope through simultaneous HRV and blood pressure measurements, which could reduce the duration of the tilt testing and avoid induction of unnecessary full syncopal events, while maintaining the diagnostic accuracy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if HRV analysis performed before the administration of nitroglycerine could differentiate between negative and positive responders to HUT, carried out according to the Italian protocol.

### Comparison between isoproterenol and nitroglycerin sensitized head-upright tilt in patients with unexplained syncope and negative or positive passive head-up tilt response [^113S8Fvi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

It is unknown if the head-upright tilt test in patients who receive isoproterenol and nitroglycerin can identify different populations with vasovagal syncope. The aim of this study was to compare the positive or negative responses to passive tilt between isoproterenol- and nitroglycerin-sensitized upright tilt. Ninety-six patients referred for unexplained recurrent syncope underwent passive tilt (45 minutes at 70 degrees angle), which was then systematically followed, within the same session and in a random order, by a 20-minute tilt at a 70 degrees angle after administration of nitroglycerin (NTG-tilt) and 10-minute tilt at a 70 degrees angle with a continuous infusion of isoproterenol (ISO-tilt). NTG-tilt led to significantly more positive responses than passive tilt or ISO-tilt (55% vs 34% vs 42%, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with a positive response during passive tilt, the percentage of positive responses with NTG-tilt was significantly higher than with ISO-tilt (94% vs 67%). The agreement between NTG-tilt and ISO-tilt was very weak (Kappa coefficient 0.06). In the subgroup of patients with a negative response during passive tilt, the percentage of positive responses between NTG-tilt and ISO-tilt was similar (35% vs 29%). The agreement between NTG-tilt and ISO-tilt was good (Kappa coefficient 0.34). NTG-tilt led to a higher number of positive responses than ISO-tilt, especially when passive tilt outcome was positive. These 2 pharmacologic agents may identify 2 different subpopulations of patients because of their specific pharmacologic actions.

### Abnormal cardiovascular response to nitroglycerin in migraine [^111h7R9Q]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a common, paroxysmal headache disorder with a complex pathophysiology. The exact role of the vasculature is a matter of debate. Some studies have suggested ictal and interictal functional changes in the systemic circulation in migraine. Interestingly, migraineurs also have an increased rate of vasovagal syncope (VVS), which partly explains the white matter abnormalities found in a population-based study.

Syncope is transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion and also occurs often in the general population. In population-based studies, compared to non-migraine controls, more individuals with migraine had ever had syncope, frequent syncope (> 5 attacks per lifetime) and orthostatic intolerance in between attacks. Syncope can also occur during migraine attacks. One third of people with unspecified syncope have migrainous features during episodes of syncope. Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most likely mechanism for syncope in migraineurs. VVS can be provoked with a tilt table test, which relies on a susceptibility to hypotension in the vertical position. Administration of a systemic vasodilator such as nitroglycerin increases the incidence of tilt-induced VVS, likely due to increased venous pooling. Nitroglycerin may also provoke migraine attacks, but only in migraineurs. Nitroglycerin is de-nitrated to nitric oxide (NO) and vasoactive S-nitrosothiols. Both substances cause vasodilation through activation of cytoplasmic guanylate cyclase, which increases intracellular guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) and cytosolic calcium. NO provokes migraine attacks either directly or indirectly through the NO-activated intracellular cascade.

Taken together, the systemic circulation of individuals with migraine seems abnormally susceptible to nitroglycerin. In this study, we assessed whether this response is indeed different in relation to a forthcoming migraine attack.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^117XjKEn]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether or not heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during the first 20min of head-up tilt testing could predict whether patients will develop syncope after nitroglycerine administration.

Design

64 patients with previous loss of consciousness underwent head-up tilt testing with the Italian protocol, which involves the administration of nitroglycerine after 20min of tilt. HRV parameters were analysed from 5min intervals selected during pretest supine rest (phase 1), the first 5min (phase 2) and the last 5min (phase 3) of passive 20min of tilting, prior to the administration of nitroglycerine. Differences in power (ms²) of the spectral components between the various phases of tilting were calculated for each patient and expressed as Δ.

Results

20 patients (group 1, 9 women, mean age 43.2 ± 24.5years) had a syncope during tilt testing after nitroglycerine, while the other 44 (group 2, 24 women, mean age 41 ± 20.5years) did not. In group 1, the HRV spectral parameters high frequency (HF) and total power (TP) had a significant decrement from phases 2 to 3 (p = 0.012 and 0.027, respectively), while in group 2 the average HF and TP values did not change. The Δ of spectral parameters between phases 2 and 3 were able to differentiate between the two groups and to predict syncope after nitroglycerine administration (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

HRV analysis within the first 20min of passive tilting demonstrated that patients with nitroglycerine-induced syncope are characterised by a progressive decrement of parasympathetic activity, which does not occur in patients with a negative response to nitroglycerine. If confirmed on a wider population, HRV analysis could replace nitroglycerine administration and shorten the duration of the tilt test.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^112pcfPb]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Current status of tilt testing

A positive TT has diagnostic value in syncope/collapse when the history does not provide a conclusive explanation for symptoms. If the history yields a clear diagnosis, TT is not required; nonetheless, TT may provide important patient education and reassurance, together with pathophysiological evidence of the underlying mechanisms, critical for the selection of appropriate therapy.

The methodology and interpretation of TT results have evolved since it was introduced into clinical practice. Initially, prolonged TTs, up to 2 h at angles 40–60°, were used to trigger vasovagal events in susceptible individuals. Subsequently, test duration was shortened, head-up angle was defined as 60–80°, and other interventions were added to improve test sensitivity. These interventions included administration of drugs (e.g. isoproterenol, nitroglycerine, serotonin agonists) alone or in conjunction with physical manoeuvres, such as carotid sinus massage. Several of these provocative measures improved TT sensitivity and remain in use; however, their addition may reduce specificity.

Regarding TT for evaluating the syncope of unknown origin, Forleo et al. reported a meta-analysis of 55 studies incorporating patients with unexplained syncope and asymptomatic controls without history of syncope. The authors excluded studies with < 10 patients and procedures with tilt angulation < 60° or > 80°; the evaluation thereby comprised 4361 patients with syncope (aged 41 ± 17 years) and 1791 controls (aged 39 ± 17 years). The summary receiver-operating curve demonstrated good overall ability to differentiate symptomatic patients from asymptomatic controls with an area under the curve of 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.87]. As expected, pharmacological protocols enhanced sensitivity but reduced specificity. Tilt protocols that included nitroglycerine provocation had the highest diagnostic odds ratio (14.40; 95% CI 11.50–18.05) and greatest sensitivity (66%; 95% CI 60–72%).

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^1126eP5c]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we found that quantitative analysis of time-related changes of HRV parameters during the first 20 min of passive HUT can foretell the outcome of nitroglycerine-induced potentiation according to the Italian protocol without the administration of the drug, with 80% predictive accuracy. HRV analysis during the basal period and the first 5 min of the passive tilt was not sensitive enough to distinguish between patients who will and those who will not have syncope at HUT carried out with the Italian protocol. However, evaluation of the dynamic variation of HRV parameters during the first 20 min of passive HUT evidenced significant differences between patients who will develop syncope after nitroglycerine administration and those who will not. Further research is warranted to evaluate whether or not appropriately timed HRV analysis might improve the differentiation among different mechanisms of syncope.

### Recurrent vasovagal syncope: comparison between clomipramine and nitroglycerin as drug challenges during head-up tilt testing [^115UgAgf]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the responses between clomipramine, a centrally acting substance, and nitroglycerin, with mainly peripheral action, when each drug is used during tilt test for the induction of vasovagal syncope (VVS).

Methods and Results

Hundred patients with recurrent episodes of classical VVS underwent two tilt tests in a randomized sequence. One test included 20 min of tilt at 60 degrees with intravenous administration of 5 mg clomipramine (clomipramine tilt), whereas the other test included an initial 30 min period of passive 60 degrees tilt, followed by sublingual spray administration of 400 microg nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin tilt). Fifty asymptomatic subjects served as controls. Following clomipramine tilt, a positive response occurred in 73 patients (73%), a negative response in 23 (23%), and drug intolerance in 4 (4%). With nitroglycerin tilt, these percentages were 52, 48, and 0%, respectively. Significant differences were observed regarding positive responses (clomipramine vs. nitroglycerin: 73/100 vs. 52/100, P < 0.05), as well as negative responses (23/100 vs. 48/100, respectively, P < 0.05). A high concordance rate was observed in positive responses.

Conclusion

In the evaluation of patients with recurrent classical VVS, clomipramine tilt is associated with an increased positive yield relative to nitroglycerin tilt. This suggests that central mechanisms may be more important than peripheral ones in VVS pathogenesis.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^111V7PzS]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Design

Subjects

Sixty-four patients (31 men, 33 women, mean age 41.7 (SD 21.7) years) who had experienced at least one episode of spontaneous loss of consciousness during the previous year, most likely caused by VVS, were enrolled in the study. All of them underwent medical examinations based on the ESC guidelines. Patients with diabetes and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and multiple systemic atrophy, ischaemic cardiomyopathy and previous myocardial infarction were excluded, because the HRV pattern could have been affected by their underlying disease. Drugs which interact with autonomic modulation were discontinued for at least five half-lives before the day of HUT.

All patients gave their written consent to participate before enrolment in the study.

ECG recordings

All recordings were performed with a 12-lead ECG telemetric system (Mortara-Rangoni Instruments). Owing to certain factors, such as circadian rhythm, body position, activity level prior to recording, medication, verbalisation and breathing condition, which may influence the HRV, special precautions were taken to maintain similar conditions in all patients, such as performing the HUT session at a similar time of the day (usually in mid-late morning) and having the resting basal recordings after an adaptation time of at least 20 min.

Head-up tilt test

HUT was performed according to the Italian protocol in a quiet room at a stable temperature of about 24°C. The tilt table was electrically driven and equipped with a footplate support. After a resting period of 20 min in the supine position under continuous ECG monitoring, the patient was tilted to 60° for 20 min (the so-called passive phase). Thereafter, in the absence of spontaneous syncope, 300 μg of nitroglycerine spray were administered sublingually, and the patient remained tilted for an additional 20 min (provocation phase), unless syncope occurred.

The test was considered completed either when the patient experienced syncope, which required that the patient be immediately brought in the supine position, or at the end of the provocation phase in the absence of symptoms. The haemodynamic response to HUT was classified according to the VASIS classification.

On the basis of the results of HUT, the patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients (11 men, 9 women, mean age 43.2 (24.5 SD)) who experienced syncope during HUT, while group 2 involved 44 patients (20 men, 24 women, mean age 41 (20.5 SD)) with a negative response to HUT.

Graphical Abstract

Graphical Abstract
Evolution of the tilt test protocol for reflex syncope and autonomic dysfunction 1986–2023. The left side represents evolution of the tilt test protocol for reflex syncope leading to the 'Fast Italian protocol', and years when changes were introduced. Tilt angles have progressively increased, with 70° now being the norm. Tilt durations have progressively shortened in the passive phase, with less change in the active (drug challenge) phase, which may be at the minimum for the drug to produce its effect and for the effect to initiate reflex syncope. The figure shows centrally a tilt test being conducted. It will be noted that the intravascular blood volume shifts into the legs with upright posture. The right side summarizes applications of the tilt test for detection of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction with tilt duration proposed by autonomic societies.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^115gUdXU]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

HUT is a standardised, non-invasive and fast method suggested by current guidelines for the diagnosis of reflex VVS. However, over the years, different protocols have been used to improve its sensitivity and specificity.

Among others, the Italian protocol was developed to speed up the test and to increase its sensitivity, by introducing drug-mediated vasodilatation. However, some criticism has risen against this approach in that the administration of nitroglycerine could enhance the possibility of false-positive results.

Given that HRV analysis is well recognised as a method to evaluate dynamic changes of autonomic modulation of cardiovascular functionand that the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the nervous system are greatly affected by the changes that occur during HUT for syncopal patients, HRV has been increasingly used in combination with HUT to better understand the mechanisms involved in the development of syncopeand to predict HUT outcome. Virag et al predicted VVS with a 95% sensitivity and 93% specificity in 1150 patients undergoing HUT, using an algorithm based on the spectral analysis of heart rate and systolic blood pressure variability.

In the present study, we have found evidence that patients who will develop syncope after the administration of nitroglycerine according to the Italian protocol might be predicted by short-term HRV analysis carried out at the beginning and at the end of the first 20 min of HUT, even before the administration of the drug. In these patients, the power of HF and LF spectral components kept decreasing as the passive HUT progressed. In contrast, HRV parameters of patients who did not develop syncope with the pharmacological stimulus did not change significantly along the passive phase of HUT. Accordingly, the Δ of HF, LF and TP between the first 5 min of HUT and the last 5 min of the 20 min passive phase of the tilt were significantly different between group 1 and group 2 patients. These changes were consistent with changes in TD and non-linear HRV parameters, further confirming the physiological relevance of these findings.

### Venepuncture during head-up tilt testing in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope-implications for the test protocol [^114F92mR]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Head-up tilt (HUT) testing is a widely used diagnostic tool in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope (VVS). However, no gold standard exists for this examination and the various protocols used have a limited sensitivity and specificity. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of a sequential HUT testing protocol including venepuncture (VP) and sublingual nitroglycerin application.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of the diagnostic gain of a sequential HUT testing protocol including VP applied 10 min after the start of HUT testing and sublingual application of nitroglycerin 20 min after the start of the test protocol in 106 patients with a final diagnosis of VVS. The sensitivity of the test protocol was compared between patients with positive and negative history for VP induced VVS.

Results

Overall, pre-syncope or syncope occurred in 68 patients (64.2%). Only 17% of all patients fainted spontaneously within 10 min of passive HUT. Another 39.6% fainted within 20 min. Application of nitroglycerin after 20 min of HUT evoked syncope in another 7.5% until the end of 45 min of HUT. The sensitivity of the test protocol for evoking (pre-)syncope was 94.4% in patients with a positive history for VP associated VVS and 58% in patients with a negative history (P < 0.01**); 85.7% of patients with a positive history and 42.9% of patients with a negative history fainted within 20 min of HUT testing (P < 0.01**).

Conclusions

Implementation of VP in sequential HUT testing protocols allows the sensitivity of HUT testing to be increased, especially in patients with a positive history for VP associated VVS.

### Tilt testing potentiated with sublingual nitroglycerin in children with unexplained syncope [^1164jSGT]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the diagnostic value of a sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) potentiated head-up tilt (HUT) testing protocol in children with unexplained syncope.

Methods and Results

One hundred and sixty-four consecutive paediatric patients with syncope of unknown origin and no evidence of organic heart disease (115 female, mean age 13 ± 3 years) and 29 control children underwent a sublingual NTG-potentiated tilt testing protocol. Paediatric patients and controls were tilted at 60 degrees for 20 min and, if no symptom occurred, for other 15 min after sublingual 400 mug spray NTG administration. During the drug-free phase of the test, 13 patients (8%) and no controls had a positive response. After drug administration, a positive response occurred in another 88 patients (55%) and in four controls (14%), whereas an exaggerated response was observed in nine patients (5%) and in four controls (14%). Thus, the positive rate and specificity of sublingual NTG HUT test in children were 63 and 86%, respectively. No relevant adverse events were observed during the test.

Conclusion

Tilt testing potentiated with sublingual NTG has proved to be effective and safe in unmasking the neurally mediated origin of unexplained syncope in children. The NTG challenge greatly increased the positive rate of passive tilt, with a small decrease in specificity.

### Validation of non-invasive central blood pressure devices: ARTERY society task force consensus statement on protocol standardization [^115WMBK3]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Data acquisition at BP intervention. Validation testing under hemodynamic conditions involving a change from the resting state may be undertaken. 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring is used as an adjunct to clinical BP to determine underlying BP control and devices with ambulatory central BP capacity are available. Testing the performance of non-invasive central BP monitors under ambulatory conditions is not feasible using intra-aortic monitoring, but in any case this may not necessarily be required since subjects undertaking 24 hour ambulatory BP are instructed to avoid exercise and temporarily stop moving or talking, to relax the arm and breathe normally during device operation. Thus, the main objective for validation testing of ambulatory BP monitors is to determine device performance under conditions of a change in BP and heart rate from the stable resting state. To this end, a variety of standardized interventions causing a statistically significant (P < 0.05) hemodynamic change for BP and heart rate, may be acceptable, for example administering a standard dose of glyceryl trinitrate, table tilting, isometric hand grip exercise, or supine cycling. Once the hemodynamic change has been initiated, performance of the non-invasive BP test device can be tested against the intra-arterial standard, as described for the resting state. Description of the intervention procedure must be reported. Care should be taken to avoid testing during phases of large and acutely variable hemodynamic shifts such as may occur with bolus administration of vasoactive drugs, contrast dye or in the early phase of table tilting.

### Different mechanisms of isoproterenol-induced and nitroglycerin-induced syncope during head-up tilt in patients with unexplained syncope: important role of epinephrine in nitroglycerin-induced syncope [^115fEmvJ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

A reduction in left ventricular volume and an increase in epinephrine levels have been reported in tilt-induced neurally mediated syncope. To compare the mechanisms of isoproterenol-induced and nitroglycerin-induced syncope during head-up tilt and to investigate the role of catecholamines, the temporal changes in plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine and in left ventricular volume were measured.

Methods and Results

The first study population consisted of 90 patients with syncope of unknown etiology and 12 control subjects. The second study population consisted of 43 patients with unexplained syncope. In the first study, head-up tilt (80 degree angle) was conducted for 40 minutes, and norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were measured. In the second study, all patients were randomly allocated to either isoproterenol test (20 patients) or nitroglycerin test (23 patients) for 20-minute head-up tilt. Isoproterenol infusion was given at a rate of 1 to 3 microg/min. Intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin was started at 250 microg/hour with increasing dosages up to 1,500 microg/hour. Norepinephrine and epinephrine were measured in peripheral venous blood. Left ventricular volumes were measured by echocardiography with patients in the supine position and during head-up tilt every 1 minute. End-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were calculated. In the first study, 61 patients demonstrated a positive response and 29 patients demonstrated a negative response. Plasma norepinephrine changes during head-up tilt were not significantly different, whereas epinephrine levels were significantly higher in the positive patients than in the negative and control subjects (148 ± 118 pg/mL vs 66 ± 31 pg/mL and 55 ± 27 pg/mL). Thirteen of the 20 patients given isoproterenol and 15 of the 23 patients given nitroglycerin showed a positive head-up tilt (65.0% vs 65.2%; P = NS). During isoproterenol and nitroglycerin infusion head-up tilt, epinephrine in the positive group determined by the nitroglycerin test was significantly higher than that in the other three groups (103 ± 38 pg/mL vs 60 ± 33 pg/mL, 31 ± 21 pg/mL, and 50 ± 52 pg/mL). In contrast, end-systolic volume was significantly smaller in the positive group than in the other three groups based on findings of the isoproterenol test.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that nitroglycerin triggers head-up tilt-induced syncope by increasing epinephrine levels, whereas isoproterenol induces syncope by decreasing left ventricular volume.

### Tilt testing evolves: faster and still accurate [^115af6jD]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a very common cardiovascular presentation. It is a symptom with a wide range of causes, results in injury in 15%, and is associated with well-documented reductions in quality of life. The complexity and sequelae of syncope presentations mean that there is a pressing need for simple, efficient diagnostic approaches. The most common cause of syncope is vasovagal reflex and, if the history is not diagnostic, the most sensitive and specific investigation is tilt testing. The contribution of Russo and colleagues stands to make it simpler and more widely accessible.

A recent article in the journal has shown that tilt testing in patients with syncope remains a valuable assetdespite a shift from diagnosis to exposure of a tendency to reflex syncope.

Tilt testing as a clinical tool emerged in 1986 with a small series of unexplained syncope patients being diagnosed with vasovagal reflex by prolonged passive head-up tilt, reported by Kenny and colleagues. This revelation sparked its world-wide implementation. However, the first tilt test protocol, although suitable for diagnosis in the highly symptomatic, was inadequate for widespread use. The tilt angle was too low at 40° and required too long an upright period, 60 min. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many sought modifications which included higher tilt angles up to 60–80° and shorter tilt durations, all of which have been successively adopted, (Graphical Abstract). In addition, lower-body negative pressure and drug interventions (i.v. isoproterenol or sublingual nitroglycerin), designed to potentiate the effect of diminished venous return in the upright position were introduced. Isoproterenol was favoured in North America while Europe selected nitroglycerin, quickly finding it effective, with sublingual delivery obviating the need for establishing i.v. access. I.v. access also had a disadvantage of possible accompanying pain, polluting the autonomic atmosphere of the patient. Another aspect was that i.v. access may have, in some instances, allowed better reimbursement in the United States accompanied by the huge rise in the cost of isoproterenol, but with the outcome that tilt testing fell from favour. In this context, Sheldonproposed in 1993 a dramatic change in the tilt testing protocol with elimination of the passive phase and only a 10 min drug challenge using isoproterenol up to 5 μg/min. This proposal did not, however, gain wider acceptance either in North America or in Europe.

### Spontaneous vs nitroglycerin-induced vasovagal reflex on head-up tilt: are there neuroendocrine differences? [^112THXra]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Head-up tilt test (HUT) has been used for nearly 30 years for diagnosing vasovagal syncope (VVS) and was enhanced by sublingual nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]) challenge in the 1990s.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to explore neuroendocrine differences between spontaneous and drug-induced HUT positivity.

Methods

Two hundred eighty-eight patients (41.3% male, age 49 ± 21 years) with either positive passive (n = 60 [20.8%], age 38 ± 17 years) or GTN-enhanced HUT (n = 228, age 51 ± 21 years) were assessed. Beat-to-beat hemodynamic data, plasma epinephrine, plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin, C-terminal pro-arginine vasopressin (CT-proAVP), C-terminal endothelin-1, and mid-regional fragment of pro-atrial natriuretic peptide were measured resting supine and after 3 minutes of HUT. In multivariate-adjusted regression analyses controlling for age and gender, clinical, neuroendocrine, and hemodynamic parameters were compared between spontaneous and GTN-mediated positive tests.

Results

Patients with spontaneous VVS reported more syncope compared to those with GTN-mediated VVS (median interquartile range 6 [17] vs 4 [6], P = 0.002). There was no difference in resting concentrations of neurohormones between the 2 groups. However, after 3 minutes of HUT, those who later developed spontaneous VVS demonstrated higher levels of CT-proAVP (59.5 ± 137 vs 6.9 ± 4.6, P < 0.001) and epinephrine (0.57 ± 1.43 vs 0.23 ± 0.19, P = 0.003), and lower blood pressure (119/73 vs 139/81 mm Hg, P < .001). Asystole during VVS was more common in the spontaneous VVS group (35% vs 17.5%, P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Patients with spontaneous VVS on HUT reported more syncopal events than those with drug-potentiated positive HUT, but both groups shared similar supine neuroendocrine profiles. However, spontaneous VVS during HUT is characterized by lower blood pressure, pronounced increases in epinephrine and vasopressin during early HUT phase, and higher frequency of reflex asystole.

### Provocation of neurocardiogenic syncope during head-up tilt testing in children: comparison between isoproterenol and nitroglycerin [^116g3kFU]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Although nitroglycerin- and isoproterenol-augmented tilt tests are of equal value in the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope in adults, no data exist in children. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of the 2 tests in a pediatric population.

Patients and Methods

We studied 85 patients (33 boys; mean age: 11.6 ± 2.9 years). Of them, 56 had a diagnostic history of neurocardiogenic syncope, whereas 29 served as controls. After a negative passive phase, they were randomly assigned to either intravenous isoproterenol or sublingual nitroglycerin, and tilt was continued for 20 minutes.

Results

Sensitivity was 0.78 for the isoproterenol test and 0.79 for the nitroglycerin test, but specificity was significantly higher for isoproterenol test compared with nitroglycerin test. In patients with a positive test, the duration of the recovery period was significantly longer after nitroglycerin (8.4 ± 2.7 minutes) than after isoproterenol (5.1 ± 1.6 minutes).

Conclusions

Nitroglycerin- and isoproterenol-augmented tilt tests are associated with equal sensitivity in the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope in children and adolescents. However, nitroglycerin results in more false-positive tests and produces more prolonged vasovagal symptoms. Our data do not support the routine use of nitroglycerin in the evaluation of syncope in this age group.

### Abnormal cardiovascular response to nitroglycerin in migraine [^1153uaEt]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We tested the hypothesis that the systemic responses to nitroglycerin differ between non-headache controls and migraineurs with a forthcoming attack. Using continuous photoplethysmography, we showed that intravenous nitroglycerin administration induced a faster and more prolonged decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output, a steep decrease in total peripheral resistance after an initial increase, a slightly higher mean arterial pressure, and a sustained increase in heart rate in migraine participants in whom an attack developed later. The most pronounced differences occurred in those migraine patients in whom an early attack developed, whereas the changes were less marked in the three patients in whom no attack developed. The enhanced response of the systemic circulation to nitroglycerin in migraineurs suggest that the systemic vasculature is more susceptible to its (vasodilatory) effects.

Normal circulatory physiology consists of complex feedback mechanisms regulating blood pressure, maintaining adequate tissue perfusion throughout the body (for more details see Figure 4). Some of the differences in cardiovascular responses to nitroglycerin (the overall lower stroke volume, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure and steep decrease in total peripheral resistance after initial increase) that we have reported in this study suggest insufficient compensatory mechanisms to nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation in the migraine group. Interestingly, the mechanism described here in migraineurs is similar to the mechanism described in individuals with VVS who are exposed to nitroglycerin during head-up tilt (Figure 4). Our data suggest that migraineurs have more venous pooling of blood and altered (arteriolar) total peripheral resistance after nitroglycerin in the supine position. Since some of the participants in both groups had had VVS in the past (year), we cannot exclude that the results might in part be due to VVS rather than to migraine itself. Subgroups in this study were too small to run separate analyses and further research is warranted to investigate this.

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^1168tTnU]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Results

There were no significant differences between the positive (group 1) and negative (group 2) responders to HUT in terms of age and sex. Haemodynamic parameters at rest were also similar between the two groups (table 1). No significant differences in the mean RR intervals in any phase, or in the Δ mean RR, were found between the two patient groups.

Table 1
Demographics and physiological data

No patient had syncope during the first 20 min of passive tilt. On average, a positive response to HUT occurred at about 4 min and 30 s (median 4.5 (2:00–8:20) min) after the administration of nitroglycerine.

According to the VASIS classification, 5 of the 20 patients who experienced syncope had mixed-type reflex (type 1), seven had a pure cardioinhibitory response (type 2) and eight had a vasodepressor response (type 3).

In phase 1, absolute values of LF, HF and total power (TP) were slightly higher in group 2 patients than in group 1 patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. No difference in the LF/HF ratio was observed between the two groups.

When comparing phases 1 and 2, a consistent and significant decrement of HF power (p < 0.001) and increment of the LF/HF ratio (p = 0.002) were found in group 1 and group 2 patients (figures 2 and 3), with no significant difference between the two groups. In contrast, the behaviour of the LF power was highly variable, with approximately 60% of patients from both groups showing an increment and the remainder showing a decrement of the LF component (p = n.s.; figure 4).

### Sublingual isosorbide dinitrate-stimulated tilt test for diagnosis of vasovagal syncope in children and adolescents [^112PHri2]. Pediatric Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is the most likely cause of syncope in the young. Head-up tilt-table test (HUT) provides the ability to provoke vasovagal syncope under controlled laboratory settings. In adult populations, pharmacologic stimulation with intravenous/sublingual isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) has been shown to be an alternative to isoproterenol for increasing the diagnostic yield of HUT. In this study, 40 patients aged 9–18 years with unexplained syncope and 12 healthy age-matched children were evaluated by HUT to 70 degrees for 45 minutes. If tilting alone did not induce symptoms (syncope and presyncope), 0.1 mg/kg ISDN was given while the patient lay supine. After 5 min, the table was tilted to 70 degrees for 15 min or until the symptoms occurred. The control group consisted of 12 healthy age-matched children studied in a similar manner. Six patients (15%) had a positive basal tilt test. Twenty-five patients (62.5%) lost consciousness following ISDN administration. In the control group, nobody had a syncopal episode during the basal tilt test. However, ISDN administration resulted in 1 positive response (8.3%). The sensitivity of the test was 77.5% and its specificity was 91.6%. It is concluded that sublingual nitroglycerin HUT is suitable for routine clinical practice in children and adolescents with unexplained syncope.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^113yR2ne]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope diagnosis — key clinical features and tilt-table testing include that there are 4 categories of key diagnostic features (predisposing situations, prodromal symptoms, physical signs, and recovery time and symptoms), and "Prolonged" can mean as little as 2–3 minutes distinguishing vasovagal syncope from initial orthostatic hypotension. During events, fine and coarse myoclonic movements have been observed in approximately 10% of cases, and unconsciousness usually lasts less than 1–2 minutes with patients often feeling very tired for minutes to hours after the episode. Tilt-table tests feature prolonged passive postural stress and the vasovagal reflex is often triggered by adjunctive agents such as isoproterenol, nitrates, and clomipramine, with a positive response defined as clinically reminiscent presyncope or syncope associated with hypotension and usually bradycardia. When patient populations with strong presumptive evidence are studied, the sensitivity approaches 78%–92%, and the currently recommended protocols have specificities of approximately 90% compared with the response of asymptomatic patients, but the use of high doses of isoproterenol during tilts exceeding 10 minutes at 80° head-up tilt is accompanied by reduced specificity. The tilt test has not been prospectively validated with populations with rigorously defined vasovagal syncope, there is no "ideal" protocol given the inexorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, and tilt testing, when positive, suggests a tendency or predisposition to vasovagal syncope and does not establish it as the cause of the patient's syncope.

### Unprovoked and glyceryl trinitrate-provoked head-up tilt table test is safe in older people: a review of 10 years' experience [^116u9Z6d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To test the safety of the head-up tilt test (HUT) in older adults.

Design

Direct observation and measurements.

Setting

Tests performed in a quiet room with dim lighting in a laboratory setting.

Participants

One thousand ninety-six subjects aged 60 to 74; 873 aged 75 and older.

Measurements

Blood pressure and pulse at baseline for 10 minutes and 70 degrees tilt for maximum of 45 minutes. Subjects with unprovoked HUT had test repeated on a separate day after 800 mg glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).

Results

One thousand four hundred ninety-five drug-free and 474 GTN-provoked HUTs were studied. In those aged 60 to 74, the proportion of hypotensive unprovoked HUT was 16% (27% in those aged ≥ 75); this was higher with GTN provocation (43% in those aged 60–74, 44% in those aged ≥ 75; P < .01). Systolic blood pressure decreased during provoked HUT (lowest mean ± standard deviation = 67 ± 20 in those aged 60–74, 63 ± 24 in those aged ≥ 75; P < .01). There was one cardiovascular and no neurological complications.

Conclusion

This study included 10 times as many people as previous studies and demonstrates the safety of HUT in older people.

### Mechanism of syncope: role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular autonomic function assessment [^114ougJj]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Passive standing was part of the CSM procedure and was performed for 3 min on the tilt table prior to upright CSM, following supine CSM in all patients > 40 years. Positive response was defined as reproduction of spontaneous (pre)syncope in the presence of a fall in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg and/or standing SBP < 90 mmHg within 3 min of standing.

HUT was performed according to the 'fast Italian protocol'. The fast Italian protocol includes a passive phase of 10 min at an angle of 60–70° followed, in case of negative outcome, by a 10-min nitroglycerine phase consisting of sublingual administration of nitroglycerine spray at a fixed dose of 300–400 µg; the test is continued until complete loss of consciousness occurs (defined by the lack of response to a vocal stimuli and/or loss of muscle tonus and/or jerking movements) or until the completion of the protocol without syncope, whichever occurred first. Compared with the traditional 20 + 15 min protocol, the fast protocol was shown to have a similar positivity rate and similar pre-valence of cardio inhibitory, mixed, and vasodepressor responses. Therefore, the fast protocol can be used instead of the traditional protocol in clinical practice, allowing for low costs and timesaving. Positive response was defined as reproduction of spontaneous syncope, recognized by the patient, associated with the typical haemodynamic pattern of hypotension and bradycardia without an asystolic pause/s > 3 s (mixed or vasodepressor form) or with an asystolic pause/s > 3 s (cardioinhibitory form). Pre-syncope episodes were considered a positive response only in the case of delayed orthostatic hypotension.

A summary of the positivity criteria of the 2STEPS tests and their definitions is reported in the Supplementary data online, including diagnostic criteria for hypotensive (Supplementary data online, Table S1) and bradycardic (see Supplementary data online, Table S2) phenotypes. An example of SCAFA test is shown in the Supplementary data online, Figure S1.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^113Jjzi8]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

If we could help somebody else by sharing this story, that would be wonderful. My father's quality of life taking no medication was just awful. Is it perfect? By no means not, but I believe he would not be here with us today without this treatment. He can at least function in his home. He needed to get used to using a wheelchair on outings. We do the (nitroglycerin) patches at night if his blood pressure is really high. My advice to patients and families is if you take it slowly you can figure out what works best for you. My father's quality of life has been so much better than when we started this journey.

My advice for doctors is please don't tell patients there's no hope. Pretty much everyone gave up hope on my dad. My thing is, please, as a doctor, please do everything in your power to figure out what you can do and send patients to another doctor if you can't figure out what to do. Please continue to do testing.

If we could impact somebody's life… I can't explain how horrific this was at that time, how scary to wonder if he was going to wake up. It means so much to have doctors that fight for you. You do get to a point in your life where it's so hopeless. I can't even imagine what my dad felt. 'I'm not going to last much longer'; that was his thinking. Until we found The Heartbeat Clinic it was bleak and pretty hopeless. I don't want anyone else to feel alone.

Learning points

Orthostatic hypotension is a common cause of syncope and can be identified through orthostatic blood pressure measurements.
A blood pressure drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing (or head-up tilt) accompanied by little or no increase in heart rate is suggestive of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.
Although patient history and physical examination findings may be helpful in the diagnostic process for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, autonomic function testing can provide more definitive information to facilely diagnose the condition.
If non-pharmacological measures and initial pharmacotherapy are ineffective in reducing symptoms of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, it is critical for patient safety and quality of life that healthcare practitioners continue to seek an effective treatment to reduce symptoms, syncope events and fall risks.

### Evaluation of cardiac autonomic dysfunctions in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^1158jknh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

All patients were evaluated by a tilt table test. Patients fasted for 4 to 6 h before the test. The procedure was conducted with a tilt-adjustable table. Patients lay down on the table when it was in a horizontal state, and they remained in this position for 5 min before starting the test. Vascular access was established, and patients were monitored to track heart rate and blood pressure values. After the test started, patients waited for 20 to 45 min on a 60 to 70-degree angled table; this phase of the test is referred to as the passive phase. If no syncope developed, patients proceeded to the second phase. In the second phase, 300 μg sublingual nitroglycerine was applied, and patients waited at the table, under the same conditions as the passive phase, for 15 to 20 min. The entire process lasted about 45 to 85 min (5 min for lying down, 20 to 45 min for the passive phase, and 15 to 20 min for the second phase). Test termination criteria were established as the onset of syncope (accompanied by arrhythmias and/or hypotension) or the patient not wanting to continue testing. Rates of developing orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and presyncope in patients were recorded. The definition of postural hypotension was determined as SBP decreasing by equal to or more than 20 mmHg or DBP decreasing equal to or more than 10 mmHg during the test compared to the start of the test. This part of our study aims to determine the relationship between sympathetic vasoreflexes, poor glycemic index, and the duration of diabetes.

### Diagnostic efficacy of transcranial Doppler combined with upright tilt test in vasovagal syncope [^115mfUVQ]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety of HUTT in patients with suspected VVS

The safety of the HUTT depends on several factors, including the testing protocol and appropriate patient selection. While the HUTT is generally considered a relatively safe procedure for patients with VVS, it can occasionally trigger cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. These may include transient aphasia, seizures, and myocardial ischemia and may even lead to severe arrhythmias, such as significant bradycardia and sinus arrest. The probability of inducing seizures during the HUTT is 3.74–11.6%. The incidence of transient aphasia during the HUTT is 3.18%, with higher rates observed in adults than in children (7.0% vs. 1.6%). This discrepancy may be attributed to underlying cerebrovascular diseases in adults, such as cerebrovascular stenosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with a history of severe cardiovascular conditions, significant autonomic dysfunction, and prior episodes of severe syncope may require alternative diagnostic approaches or additional precautions during the tilt test. The HUTT is often conducted on a diverse range of patients with suspected VVS, including those with comorbidities such as severe cerebral artery stenosis, coronary artery stenosis, or severe arrhythmias, which are not always strictly excluded. This practice inadvertently increases the risks associated with the test.

Additionally, some patients required more than 10 min to regain consciousness during the HUTT, indicating prolonged cerebral ischemia and a slow recovery process due to impaired self-regulatory capacity (Fig. 2). To ensure patient safety during the HUTT, inducing syncope requires careful monitoring, such as continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow using TCD and preparedness for immediate intervention, which relies on the operator's experience and professional judgment.

Fig. 2
Cerebral blood flow changes in patients with vasovagal syncope during nitroglycerin-induced upright tilt table testing. A At baseline, the mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was 65 cm/s and the vascular pulse index (PI) was 0.83; B mean CBFV was 49 cm/s in the upright position; C after taking nitroglycerin in the upright tilt position, the mean CBFV was 37 cm/s, and the PI was 1.11; D after returning to the supine position, the mean CBFV and the PI were 45 cm/s and 0.75, respectively

### Heart rate variability analysis during head-up tilt test predicts nitroglycerine-induced syncope [^114dLa3X]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 5
Box plot of the total power (TP).

As concerns the Δ of LF, HF and TP between the different phases, those between phases 1 and 2 were not predictive of syncope during HUT. In contrast, the Δ of spectral parameters between phases 2 and 3 were able to differentiate between the two groups and to predict syncope after nitroglycerine administration (figure 6).

Figure 6
Different behaviours between group 1 and group 2 patients of the mean and SD of Δ for low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and total power (TP) calculated between the beginning and the end of the 20 min of passive tilt.

Certain time-domain and non-linear HRV parameters also showed statistically significant changes in group 1 patients, which were consistent with the previously described changes in the spectral components. In particular, RMSSD, pNN50 and SD1 (all indices of vagal modulation, thus correlated to the HF spectral component) significantly decreased in group 1. In contrast, no significant change in group 2 patients was found (table 2 and figure 7). In addition, SD2, an index of long-term variability and also linked to overall variability, decreased between phases 2 and 3 in group 1 patients, but remained unchanged in group 2 patients (table 2 and figure 7).

Table 2
Phase-dependent changes of HRV TD and NL parameters during HUT

Figure 7
Statistically significant differences of the mean and SD of Δ for some time-domain and non-linear parameters between group 1 and group 2 patients.

By applying LDA against the whole dataset of HRV parameters and the Δ between phases 2 and 3, a good separation was obtained between group 1 and group 2 patients. The highest classification accuracy (80%) obtained was based on the combination of features ΔHF, ΔLF, ΔSDNN/RMSSD, ΔLF/HF, ΔTP and HF of phase 2 (ms²), using the following equation:

This equation provided 85% sensitivity and 77% specificity in predicting nitroglycerine-induced syncope during HUT.

### Reproducibility of nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group [^117TMhy3]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing may be used to diagnose vasovagal syncope or to guide therapy. To date, the reproducibility of the test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and healthy controls is undetermined. A high reproducibility is a prerequisite for correct interpretation of the test result. This study investigates the reproducibility of a nitrate-stimulated tilt test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group.

Methods and Results

We studied 43 patients (24 women, 19 men) with a typical history of vasovagal syncope and 18 healthy controls (3 women, 15 men). We used a combined tilt protocol with a 30-minute passive and 15-minute nitrate-stimulated phase. The second tilt test was performed 16 ± 12 days after the first. In both patients and controls, overall positive tilt responses were reproduced in the second test in 100%. In contrast to this, the reproducibility of an overall negative test was 50% in patients but 93% in controls. Overall hemodynamic responses to tilt were reproducible in 80%.

Conclusion

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in both patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and controls has an excellent reproducibility of positive results but a moderate reproducibility of negative results. Importantly, these results are still valid at a repeat interval of 2 weeks and longer. These data suggest that in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope, a nitrate-stimulated tilt test may provide a suitable tool to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic approach.

### Nitroglycerin lingual [^112ksvco]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use.

---

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^115eRNnj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General: Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of nitroglycerin. This drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is somewhat blunted. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pains, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence.

Some clinical trials in angina patients have provided nitroglycerin for about 12 continuous hours of every 24-hour day. During the nitrate-free intervals in some of these trials, anginal attacks have been more easily provoked than before treatment, and patients have demonstrated hemodynamic rebound and decreased exercise tolerance. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of transdermal nitroglycerin is not known.

Information for Patients: Daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with nitroglycerin. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with nitroglycerin, since loss of headache is likely to be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy.

Treatment with nitroglycerin may be associated with lightheadedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol. Patient instruction leaflet is included.

Drug Interactions: The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of other vasodilators. Alcohol, in particular, has been found to exhibit additive effects of this variety.

Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agents may be necessary.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of nitroglycerin have not been performed. Nitroglycerin's effect upon reproductive capacity is similarly unknown.

### An increased endothelial-independent vasodilation is the hallmark of the neurally mediated syncope [^1114VePo]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is sustained by complex cardiac and vascular reflexes, acting on and amplified by central autonomic loops, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension.

Hypothesis

Our aim was to assess whether the pathophysiology of NMS is also related to an abnormal peripheral vasoreactivity.

Methods

We evaluated by ultrasound the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and the nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) in 17 patients with NMS, induced by drug-free tilt test in 6 subjects and by nitrate-potentiated tilt test in the other 11 cases; the syncope was classified as vasodepressive (VD) in 8 cases, cardioinhibitory (CI) in 7, and mixed in 2.

Results

The FMD was not different from controls (10.2 ± 4.5 vs 11.4 ± 3.9, P = ns), with normal recovery times; the NMD was greater in fainting subjects than in controls (26.7 ± 7.3 vs 19.0 ± 3.6, P < 0.05), with higher values in VD than in CI syncope (31.1 ± 7.0 vs 23.1 ± 5.0, P = ns); compared to controls, subjects with NMS showed normal recovery times after FMD but longer recovery times after nitrate administration (13.0 ± 5.6 vs 6.3 ± 0.7 minutes, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The evaluation of endothelial function supports evidence that NMS is characterized by a marked and sustained endothelial-independent vasodilation, in the presence of a normal FMD; vascular hyperreactivity in response to nitrate administration is particularly overt in vasodepressive syncope and can explain the high rate of responses to nitrate administration during tilt test.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^116k5XHg]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance (5.1).

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute anginal attack should be used [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

As tolerance to other forms of nitroglycerin develops, the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin on exercise tolerance, although still observable, is reduced.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin. The drug should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume-depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris.

The benefits of NitroMist in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use NitroMist in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used because of the possibility of hypotension and tachycardia.

5.3 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, which may be severe. Tolerance to headaches occurs.

Figure 4
Box plot of the low frequency (LF) power at the three investigated phases. Although non-significant (n.s.), a trend towards reduction of LF power between phases 2 and 3 was observed in group 1 patients.

The most relevant difference between the two groups was found by comparing the phase 2 and phase 3 parameters, where the HRV spectral components behaved differently. In fact, whereas in group 2 patients the average LF, HF and TP values did not change significantly between phases 2 and 3, in group 1 patients the average HF and TP values showed a significant decrease (p = 0.012 and 0.027, respectively; figures 2 and 5). The average LF value of group 1 also decreased, but this change was not significant (p = 0.078; figure 4), because in 30% of the patients the LF component increased. This variable behaviour of the LF component was apparently unrelated to the mechanism of syncope, since three of the six patients with an increase in the LF component had cardioinhibitory syncope, two had vasodepressor syncope and one had a mixed-type response. Among the patients with a decrease in the LF component, four had cardioinhibitory syncope, six had vasodepressor syncope and four had a mixed-type response. The average LF/HF ratio also decreased in both groups, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.245 and 0.604, respectively; figure 3).

### Temporal relationship of asystole to onset of transient loss of consciousness in tilt-induced reflex syncope [^115rm6Gr]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the onset of asystole and transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) in tilt-induced reflex syncope and estimate how often asystole was the principal cause of TLOC.

Background

The presence of asystole in vasovagal syncope (VVS) may prompt physicians to consider pacemaker therapy for syncope prevention, but the benefit of pacing is limited in VVS.

Methods

We evaluated electrocardiography, electroencephalography, blood pressure, and clinical findings during tilt-table tests. Inclusion required TLOC (video), electroencephalographic slowing, accelerating blood pressure decrease, and an RR interval ≥ 3 s. We excluded cases with nitroglycerin provocation. Asystole after onset of TLOC (group A) or within 3 s before TLOC (group B) was unlikely to cause TLOC, but an earlier start of asystole (group C) could be the cause of TLOC.

Results

In one-third of 35 cases (groups A [n = 9] and B [n = 3]), asystole was unlikely to be the primary cause of TLOC. The median of the mean arterial pressure at the onset of asystole was higher when asystole occurred early (45.5 mm Hg, group C) than when it occurred late (32.0 mm Hg, groups A and B), which suggests that vasodepression was not prominent at the start of asystole in early asystole, further suggesting that early asystole was the prime mechanism of syncope.

Conclusions

In one-third of cases of tilt-induced asystolic reflex syncope, asystole occurred too late to have been the primary cause of TLOC. Reliance on electrocardiography data only is likely to overestimate the importance of asystole.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112x5wXZ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Investigation protocol

All participants were asked to discontinue cardiovascular medications (beta‐blockers, ivabradine and midodrine) 48 h prior to testing. Fasting was started during the evening before, with unrestricted water consumption.

POTS patients were investigated with head‐up tilt test. The protocol included supine rest for 10 min preceding table elevation to 60–70° for 20 min, and optional nitroglycerine provocation according to the Italian protocol, exclusively for patients with unexplained syncope and negative unmedicated phase of head‐up tilt. Beat‐to‐beat blood pressure and ECG were recorded continuously using a non‐invasive validated method (Nexfin monitor, BMEYE, Amsterdam or Finapres Nova, Finapres Medical Systems, Enschede, The Netherlands). POTS diagnosis was defined by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance lasting for ≥ 6 months associated with pathological head‐up tilt test or active standing test showing HR increase > 30 bpm (HR increase > 40 bpm in patients < 19 years) or HR exceeding 120 bpm in upright position (prior to nitroglycerine administration), within 10 min and in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.

Healthy controls were examined with active standing. Before initiating the active standing test, each participant had to lie quietly in a supine position for 10 min, after which baseline supine blood pressure and HR were measured. The subject was then asked to perform active standing for 10 min. Blood pressure was measured at 1, 3, 5 and 10 min using an automatic BP monitor (Omron M6, Kyoto, Japan). An average of two measurements was used for group comparisons.

### Vasovagal syncope in the older patient [^1132UnSL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) has been diagnosed with increasing frequency in older patients since the head-up tilt-table test (HUT) was described over 2 decades ago. The incidence and prevalence of VVS in this age group remains unknown. Older individuals are more likely to display a dysautonomic hemodynamic pattern with a predominantly hypotensive response during HUT. The positivity rates to passive and isoprotenerol-provoked HUT are reduced with age, but positivity rates for glyceryl-trinitrate-induced HUT are comparable with younger subjects. Few studies into treatment strategies have included older subjects. This is a review of the existing literature on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies for VVS in older patients, highlighting important areas for future research.

### Impact of cardiovascular neurohormones on onset of vasovagal syncope induced by head-up tilt [^1154f951]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Patient Population

The present study was conducted from August 27, 2008 through December 31, 2014 as a part of the ongoing SYSTEMA (Syncope Study of Unselected Population in Malmö) project. 6, 10 Patients with unexplained syncope were referred to the tertiary syncope unit at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö from primary care and hospitals in southern Sweden. The syncope unit is the only referral center in the catchment area of about 1.5 million citizens. Unexplained syncope was defined as transient loss of consciousness without established diagnosis after the initial evaluation. 1, 2 Before the standard diagnostic workup at the syncope unit, which included cardiovascular autonomic testing and HUT according to the Italian protocol, 11 additional tests were carried out: resting, exercise, and continuous 24‐hour (Holter) ECG, external event recorder, echocardiography, coronary angiography, brain imaging, and electroencephalography, if appropriate and recommended by the referring physician. Patients with an established diagnosis of cardiac syncope were excluded.

During the study period, 1141 consecutive patients (60.6% women; age 53 ± 22 years) were enrolled. Of these, 827 patients had blood samples collected from an intravenous line obtained both in supine position and after 3 minutes of HUT as per the initial SYSTEMA study protocol. 6 Among patients with collected blood samples, 466 (56.3%) were diagnosed with VVS according to the current syncope management guidelines, that is, a positive HUT with a typical pattern of sudden‐onset hypotension and bradycardia accompanied by the reproduction of characteristic symptoms. 1, 2 Using a concept previously applied by Kohno and collaborators, 8 we identified 173 patients (20.9%) who developed VVS during the drug‐free HUT; of these a total of 161 patients had no missing values and were analyzed. Figure 1 illustrates the flowchart of the study.

From the cohort of patients investigated in 2008‐2014 for unexplained syncope with head‐up tilt testing (HUT) according to the Italian protocol, 11 ie, a 20‐minute drug‐free HUT phase followed by 15‐minute nitroglycerin‐potentiated phase, 872 had blood samples collected while supine and after 3 minutes of HUT. A total of 173 patients developed and reproduced vasovagal syncope during the drug‐free phase. Of these, 161 had no missing values and were included in the analyses of 6 neurohormones vs time to syncope onset during the drug‐free HUT phase.

Methods

Patient population

Patients were recruited from the previously described SYSTEMA cohort, which includes patients referred for investigation of syncope to the tertiary syncope unit at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö from hospitals and outpatient care in the southern Sweden.

During the study period from August 2008 to October 2018, a total of 1972 consecutive patients undergoing HUT for unexplained syncope were enrolled. Before referral to the syncope unit, initial evaluation was carried out according to the European syncope guidelines. The number and proportion of different tests made prior to referral is shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1. Patients with an established diagnosis of cardiac syncope or non-syncopal loss of consciousness were excluded. In patients aged < 30 years, there were no known cases of congenital heart disease or channelopathies. Unexplained syncope was defined as a transient loss of consciousness without an established diagnosis after the initial evaluation according to the current syncope guidelines. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. The regional ethical review board in Lund, Sweden, approved the study protocol (reference number 82/2008) and all study participants gave written informed consent.

Investigation protocol

Data were drawn from medical history, including the year of the first-ever syncope, the total number of syncope episodes, and the characteristics of syncope-related symptoms of recent syncopes using a self-administered questionnaire. Evaluation in the syncope unit included a thorough history taking. Head-up tilt was performed according to the Italian protocol, i.e. a drug-free HUT phase of 20 min or until syncope occurred and if the drug-free phase was negative, 400 μg sublingual nitroglycerine was administered, and the patient remained tilted upright for another 15 min. Beat-to-beat blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored continuously by a validated non-invasive photoplethysmographic method (Nexfin monitor; BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, or Finapres Nova, Finapres Medical Systems, PH Enschede, The Netherlands).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)

Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.000000000000000e+00 2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use.

Methods

Study setting and population

The Syncope Study of Unselected Population in Malmö (SYSTEMA) project was initiated to investigate systematically and manage patients with unexplained syncope. Between August 2008 and December 2016, 1705 patients with suspected syncope that is, unexplained transient loss of consciousness by initial evaluation, who were referred to the tertiary Syncope Unit of Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden, were enrolled and underwent cardiovascular autonomic assessment including carotid sinus massage (CSM) and HUT. Following cardiovascular autonomic tests, patients were monitored using an ILR, if the aetiology of syncope could not be established. In addition to the main syncope workup, other tests may have been carried out, including exercise and external long-term ECG, echocardiography, coronary angiography, brain imaging and electroencephalogram, whenever appropriate.

Examination protocol

Cardiovascular autonomic tests included CSM, supine and upright, if appropriate, according to Newcastle protocol, and tilt-table testing at 60°–70° plus optional nitroglycerin provocation according to the Italian protocol. The patients were asked to take their regular medication and fast for 2 hours before the test, although they were allowed to drink water freely. Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and ECG were continuously monitored using a non-invasive validated method (Nexfin monitor, BMEYE, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and subsequently analysed offline using a dedicated programme provided by the monitor manufacturer. In addition, the patients were asked to complete a questionnaire, which explored medical history, duration, frequency and features of syncope-related symptoms, smoking status, and current pharmacological treatment. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden accepted the study protocol (ref no 82/2008), and all study participants gave their written informed consent.

Clinical implications

Migraine and vasovagal syncope are comorbid conditions that may share part of their pathophysiology through autonomic control of the systemic circulation.
We found that intravenous nitroglycerin administration induced stronger systemic cardiovascular responses in migraine patients in comparison to controls.
The enhanced response of the systemic circulation to nitroglycerin in migraineurs suggests that the systemic vasculature is more susceptible to its (vasodilatory) effects.

OVERDOSAGE

Signs and symptoms of overdose are generally similar to the described adverse reactions (see Adverse Reactions).

There is no specific antidote for overdose of nitroglycerin. The risk of overdose can be minimized by close monitoring during treatment.

Hemodynamic Effects:

The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which -if any- of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.

No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary.

The use of epinephrine or other arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.

In patients with renal disease or heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.

Figure 4.
Normal circulatory physiology and cardiovascular responses to nitroglycerin in individuals with migraine and vasovagal syncope. Blood pressure depends on cardiac output (CO) and on the total peripheral (arteriolar) resistance (TPR): Blood pressure = CO × TPR (neglecting central venous pressure). Mean arterial pressure then is the average blood pressure during one cardiac cycle and is approximated by the sum of 2/3 × diastolic blood pressure and 1/3 of the systolic blood pressure. In turn, cardiac output (CO) is the product of the volume of blood pumped out by the heart per beat (stroke volume; SV) and heart rate (HR): CO = SV × HR. Blood pressure is therefore proportional to heart rate, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance. RA: right atrium; LA: left atrium; RV: right ventricle; LV: left ventricle; CV: circulating volume.

(a) Normally, the venous system contains 65% of the circulating volume and is responsible for the venous return to the heart. When blood pressure drops, autonomic control mechanisms should limit the decrease, aiming to maintain an adequate blood pressure. If, during a blood pressure decrease, one or more of heart rate, stroke volume, or total peripheral resistance also decrease, the decreasing parameter must represent the cause of the blood pressure decrease. In contrast, if low blood pressure is accompanied by an increase in stroke volume, heart rate or total peripheral resistance, the increasing parameter represents an attempt at blood pressure restoration. For instance, a low blood pressure accompanied by a low stroke volume and high heart rate suggests that the heart rate attempts to compensate for the low stroke volume, and that the latter represents the primary problem.

Effects of nitroglycerin on migraine attacks and syncope

Both migraine and control participants reported a mild to moderate headache during infusion of nitroglycerin (Figure 1), with a similar peak intensity (2.0 ± 2.5 points vs. 1.4 ± 1.8; p = .10) and no difference in time of onset of headache between groups (group*time interaction: p = .30). Thirteen of the 16 (81.3%) migraineurs developed a migraine attack versus none of the controls (0%; Fisher's exact test p = .0001), with a mean ± SD of 314 ± 126 minutes (median 270 minutes; range 155–600 minutes) after NTG administration. The six migraineurs in whom a migraine-like attack occurred within 270 minutes after infusion were labelled the 'early attack' group. The seven migraineurs who developed a migraine-like attack > 270 minutes after infusion were labelled the 'late attack' group. No syncope was provoked.

Parameters related to wave reflection, DTI, TTI, and BI are summarized in Figure 4. There was no significant change in TTI during incremental exercise (P = 0.386) because heart rate and blood pressure increased together. However, after nitroglycerin, there was a significant reduction in TTI compared with peak exercise (P = 0.024) because systolic blood pressure and augmentation index fell. Timing of the reflected pressure wave shortened with exercise (P = 0.004) but did not significantly change in the peak period, and changes were similar in both groups. There was no significant change in augmentation index to 50% of peak exercise, but significant reductions were seen as exercise continued regardless of treatment group (P = 0.014 for the nitroglycerin group; P = 0.033 for the control), contributing to a reduction in afterload. LV ejection time, DTI, BI, and diastolic time fraction all decreased significantly with exercise (P < 0.05), consistent with increased myocardial oxygen demand and reduced perfusion. After nitroglycerin, there was a significant increase in BI at 2 minutes after administration (P = 0.0171) and in diastolic time fraction (P = 0.0260), consistent with improvement in myocardial oxygen supply.

Background

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries.

Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 min is usually sufficient to see the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope, however in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 min of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management (table 1). A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Table 1
Potential causes of syncope

Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (eg, hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope and falls. Neurogenic OH is commonly comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

In those cases in which the aetiology of a patient's syncope is unclear after initial evaluation and an ECG has ruled out a cardiac cause of syncope, referral for autonomic testing may aid in pinpointing the cause and guide decisions of the most appropriate steps in treating and managing the symptoms of the patient. In this context, autonomic testing should include continuous BP monitoring during prolonged head-up tilt (HUT) on a tilt table, HR in response to paced breathing and BP in response to the Valsalva manoeuvre. Decreased autonomic function, if observed, in this battery of tests indicates a neurogenic origin of OH and that the syncope is neurally mediated. Such a diagnosis should suggest a course of treatment.

When the cause of syncope has been identified as OH or nOH, pharmacological management of the condition may be necessary. Droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, is the only drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat symptoms of nOH in adults, whereas midodrine, an alpha−1 adrenergic agonist, is approved to treat symptoms of OH.

3 Developments in Tilt‐Testing

The major recent development in tilt‐testing is really a recapitulation.

Tilt‐testing came to clinical practice in 1986 by the serendipitous discovery that tilt could reveal the mechanism of syncope in older highly symptomatic patients. The revealed mechanism was and is reflex that is, vasovagal.

All the patients in this study were taken to full syncope — complete loss of consciousness.

There has since been a tendency to avoid inducing complete loss of consciousness. Perhaps, a feeling of being kind to the patient? This softening of the method is not a service to the patient as it may lead to a wrong diagnosis or reduced interpretability as emphasized in case of possible pacemaker selection as therapy in older VVS patients — see invasive therapy section. With work of the Russo and colleagues we return to the original method.

Another valuable modification of the Italian tilt‐testing protocol, believed to be the most widely used protocol, also comes from Russo et al. with the shortening of the passive phase of the protocol, labeled the "Fast Italian Protocol", without prejudicing the results, thus yielding greater laboratory efficiency. The new protocol demands 5 min. supine pretest, 10 min. Head‐up at 70°, administration of 300–400 mcg sublingually and continue head‐up for a further 10 min.

Syncope, even reflex syncope can present diagnostic problems. An important recent advance is the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to support a reflex syncope diagnosis and to understand more of the symptoms and background of these patients; Rivasi et al. have shown that striking asymptomatic BP falls to < 90 mmHg systolic occur frequently in VVS patients. One fall per day of this magnitude has OR 6.2 (p < 0.001) with a high specificity but low sensitivity. Such falls are only infrequently seen in controls and, thus, may offer confirmation of the VVS diagnosis in less clear cases.

### Abnormal cardiovascular response to nitroglycerin in migraine [^115Bn5xo]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine and vasovagal syncope are comorbid conditions that may share part of their pathophysiology through autonomic control of the systemic circulation. Nitroglycerin can trigger both syncope and migraine attacks, suggesting enhanced systemic sensitivity in migraine. We aimed to determine the cardiovascular responses to nitroglycerin in migraine.

Methods

In 16 women with migraine without aura and 10 age- and gender-matched controls without headache, intravenous nitroglycerin (0.5µg·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) was administered. Finger photoplethysmography continuously assessed cardiovascular parameters (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance) before, during and after nitroglycerin infusion.

Results

Nitroglycerin provoked a migraine-like attack in 13/16 (81.2%) migraineurs but not in controls (p = .0001). No syncope was provoked. Migraineurs who later developed a migraine-like attack showed different responses in all parameters vs. controls (all p < .001): The decreases in cardiac output and stroke volume were more rapid and longer lasting, heart rate increased, mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance were higher and decreased steeply after an initial increase.

Discussion

Migraineurs who developed a migraine-like attack in response to nitroglycerin showed stronger systemic cardiovascular responses compared to non-headache controls. The stronger systemic cardiovascular responses in migraine suggest increased systemic sensitivity to vasodilators, possibly due to insufficient autonomic compensatory mechanisms.

### Twenty-eight years of research permit reinterpretation of tilt-testing: hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis [^113Bs5qW]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing scepticism over utility of tilt-testing for syncope diagnosis, which has been shown unable to distinguish vasovagal from other syncope, especially cardiac, despite its acceptable sensitivity and specificity in true positive and negative subjects. The new interpretation is that the test reveals a susceptibility to reflex hypotension, which may exist in coincidence with any cause of syncope. This implies an important change in patient management including selecting effective therapy, in particular in guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reflex syncope.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin in dextrose) [^116GFfje]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table.

Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent.

When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.

Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection.

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) × 60 min/h / Concentration (mcg/mL)]

Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:

Example 1: for a dose of 30 µg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) × 60 (min/h) / 100 (mcg/mL)] = 18 (mL/h)

Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

### Clinical laboratory testing: what is the role of tilt-table testing, active standing test, carotid massage, electrophysiological testing and ATP test in the syncope evaluation? [^115M81P7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected syncope begins with an "initial evaluation" consisting of careful history taking, physical examination including orthostatic blood pressure measurement and electrocardiogram. However, even in expert centers the diagnostic yield of this "initial evaluation" is only approximately 50%. In the remaining cases in which a satisfactory diagnosis is either unknown or uncertain after initial assessment, additional clinical testing is needed. This article reviews the role of some of the more commonly used additional diagnostic tests, including: tilt-table testing, the active standing test, carotid sinus massage, electrophysiological testing, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test. The role of angiography, exercise testing and imaging is noted briefly. Other clinical laboratory investigations, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring, are examined in other papers in this issue. In brief, clinical laboratory tests, carefully interpreted, may be useful in the evaluation of the basis of suspected syncope. However, these tests should be selected carefully and performed based on the pre-test probability inferred from the initial examination, and the less invasive tests should be used first.

Visit 1: Associated headache symptoms

Associated headache symptoms provoked by nitroglycerin are compared to those during spontaneous attacks in Table 6. The agreement for associated headache symptoms is moderate-to-good for all symptoms apart from osmophobia and nausea.

Table 6.
Summary of the cranial autonomic symptoms reported following nitroglycerin exposure.

Between 0–3 (mean 1) cranial autonomic symptoms were triggered in 26 subjects with NTG (49%). Of these 26 subjects, 18 had reported cranial autonomic symptoms associated with spontaneous attacks (69%). Given the relatively small numbers for each symptom group, formal statistical comparison was not performed for these symptoms. A summary of the cranial autonomic symptoms reported spontaneously and during the NTG triggering is summarised in Tables 6 and 7. Cranial autonomic symptoms presented in various phases of the migraine attack triggered by NTG, from the premonitory phase through to following headache resolution in the postdrome.

Summary of cranial autonomic symptoms reported throughout the triggered migraine attack.

Visit 2/3: Premonitory-like symptoms triggered with placebo

Paired nitroglycerin and placebo triggering data was available for 21 subjects. At least three premonitory-like symptoms were reported by seven of these when exposed to placebo infusion (33%). The most common symptoms were tiredness (11/21, 52%), yawning (6/21, 29%) and neck stiffness (6/21, 29%). The mean number of symptoms reported with placebo was two (range 0–5). There was a statistically significant difference in the number of symptoms reported following placebo infusion compared to following NTG infusion on visits 2–3 (mean difference four symptoms, 95% confidence interval 3.1–5.7, t 20 = 7.06, p < 0.001). Based on randomisation, the number of subjects who received NTG first (n = 11) and placebo first (n = 10) was balanced. There was no significant correlation between the number of placebo-triggered symptoms reported and the baseline headache frequency (Pearson correlation 0.284, p = 0.211). Delayed migraine headache was induced by placebo infusion in two subjects. Symptoms provoked by both placebo and NTG are shown in Figure 4.

### Nitroglycerin, dextrose (Nitroglycerin in dextrose) [^1146NEUm]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Lower concentrations of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection increase the potential precision of dosing, but these concentrations increase the total fluid volume that must be delivered to the patient. Total fluid load may be a dominant consideration in patients with compromised function of the heart, liver, and/or kidneys. The necessary flow rates to achieve various dose rates with the available concentrations are shown in the following table.

Using nonadsorptive tubing, the initial adult dosage of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be 5 mcg/min. Subsequent titration must be guided by the clinical results, with dose increments becoming more cautious as partial response is seen. Initial titration should be in 5 mcg/min increments at intervals of 3 to 5 minutes. If no response is seen at 20 mcg/min, increments of 10 and even 20 mcg/min can be used. Once some hemodynamic response is observed, dosage increments should be smaller and less frequent.

When the concentration is changed, the tubing must be disconnected from the patient and flushed with the new solution before therapy is continued. If this precaution is not taken, then depending upon the tubing, pump, and flow rate used, it might be several hours before nitroglycerin is delivered at the desired rate.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact.

Do not add supplementary medication to Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection.

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [Dose (mcg/min) × 60 min/h / Concentration (mcg/mL)]

Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:

Example 1: for a dose of 30 µg/min using a 100 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [30 (mcg/min) × 60 (min/h) / 100 (mcg/mL)] = 18 (mL/h)

Example 2: for a dose of 240 mcg/min using a 400 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/h) = [5 (mcg/min) × 60 (min/h) / 400 (mcg/mL)] = 36 (mL/h)

TTT in OH: The use of TTT in diagnosis of OH in older adults represents a further crucial concern. The AHA and ESC guidelines note that TTT plays a role in OH and postural intolerance, but active standing may be a simpler, cheaper, and more specific test. With respect to active standing, TTT reduces the effect of the muscle pump reflex in the lower limbs so increasing venous pooling. However, in older adults even the effort of standing up may cause an increase in transient ischemia and metabolites in the muscles, reducing venous return and so increasing venous pooling. In clinical practice, active standing is widely performed because it gives a reliable result at very low cost. Moreover, active standing can be performed anywhere, patients easily comply with it, and it does not require specific skill on the part of the operator or physician. However, especially in older people, besides the classical OH, there can be a delayed form, which occurs only after 3 min of standing. The test time of active standing is usually too brief to detect delayed OH, and a misdiagnosis could result in a high risk of fall or ischemic attack in this age group. Hence, in these patients, TTT plays a leading role in the diagnosis of OH even compared to active standing. In theory, simply by prolonging the duration of active standing it could be possible to detect a delayed response to postural change, but in practice, many older patients are affected by mobility problems or postural disturbances, such as Parkinson's disease. In these patients prone to risk of falling, TTT is a safer test to diagnose delayed OH. TTT can also be useful in distinguishing OH due to reversible causes (e.g. hypovolemia, blood pressure lowering drugs, dehydration, large varicose veins, and physical deconditioning) from neurogenic OH (nOH). nOH is due to reduced norepinephrine release from postganglionic efferent sympathetic nerves, resulting in defective vasoconstriction when standing up. When postural blood pressure decreases, the concomitant measurement of heart rate, beat to beat, may detect an exaggerated tachycardia suggesting OH due to dehydration or vasodilators, whereas a slight or absent increase in heart rate response (e.g. < 15 beats per minute in the face of significant OH) would suggest nOH. In this regard, however, the bedside screening test for OH represents an effective, low‐cost way to detect nOH especially when no TTT facilities are available. However, when balance disturbances occur in older adults, TTT should be considered mandatory.

Forming recommendations — wording and strength uses explicit phrasing tied to benefit, harm, and legal or economic context: recommendations stating that an intervention "must" are reserved for circumstances with a legal obligation or very serious consequences, exemplified by the prohibition "Ultra-rapid detoxification under general anesthesia or heavy sedation (where the airway needs to be supported) must not be used. This is because of the risk of serious adverse events, including death". A "strong" recommendation is made when benefit and cost-effectiveness are clear, illustrated by "Offer an alpha blocker (alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin or terazosin) to men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms". If an intervention does more harm than good or is less cost-effective than alternatives, the guideline may recommend it "should not be used", as in "Do not offer a tilt test to people who have a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope". When a strong recommendation is not appropriate — such as when similarly cost-effective options exist or patients may prefer a cheaper, less effective option — the guidance may be to "consider" an intervention, for example, "Consider a serum natriuretic peptide test (if not already performed) when heart failure is suspected after transthoracic Doppler 2D echocardiography has shown a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction".

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1132ZTDm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Determination of the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination (including supine and standing BP measurements and an ECG; figure 1). If determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, then autonomic function testing is warranted.

Figure 1
Diagnostic algorithm and treatment options for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; DBP, diastolic BP; HR, heart rate; MI, myocardial infarction; nOH, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; OH, orthostatic hypotension; SBP, systolic BP.

The underlying causes of nOH can be varied, and there are multiple factors to be considered in the management of nOH, especially in the face of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient who presented with autonomic nervous system impairment and OH with systemic organ involvement including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with PD and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia because the symptoms overlap with those seen in nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before diagnostic testing for nOH was even considered. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms like dizziness and lightheadedness, even when there are other comorbidities present.

Autonomic function testing, including HUT, HR with deep breathing and response to the Valsalva manoeuvre, can determine whether orthostatic syncope is neurogenic in origin.

Although the standard supine-to-standing BP test is more commonly used and can be performed in many clinical settings, HUT testing on a tilt table has several advantages. When secured to the tilt table, HUT is markedly safer for patients who experience syncope on standing. Passive HUT eliminates the potential confound of compensatory muscle contraction, leading to a more sensitive test. Abnormal response to the HR with deep breathing test or to the Valsalva manoeuvre indicates autonomic dysfunction is likely causing orthostatic symptoms. In the current case, autonomic testing led to an efficient diagnosis of nOH, which allowed for implementation of appropriate pharmacological intervention.
