## Question

What is the recommended timing for administration of antimicrobials in sepsis management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended timing for administration of antimicrobials in sepsis management, including how to stratify patients, reconcile conflicting evidence, and translate this into bedside actions and stewardship steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current guideline framework and how it stratifies patients by shock status and likelihood of infection. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence behind the 1-hour and 3-hour targets. Next, I will examine controversies and limitations, including observational bias and stewardship concerns. After that, I should integrate pediatric and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a concise clinical algorithm, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus weak and where exceptions apply.

> Let me first confirm the current guideline framework. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour, for adults with possible septic shock or a high likelihood of sepsis, and a time-limited rapid assessment with antimicrobials within 3 hours if concern persists for adults with possible sepsis without shock, which is a weak recommendation with very low quality of evidence [^117TtP7Y] [^1111oLvH] [^117QDK5q]. Hold on, I should verify the pediatric parallel: for children with septic shock, start within 1 hour; for children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction without shock, start as soon as possible after appropriate evaluation, ideally within 3 hours, again with strong recommendations based on very low quality evidence [^113UNew4] [^112zb43F]. I need to ensure I also anchor the best-practice statement to obtain cultures before antibiotics if this does not cause a substantial delay, typically interpreted as less than 45 minutes, which remains unchanged in 2021 [^111U7vcz].

> Now, I will examine the evidence supporting the 1-hour target in shock and high-likelihood sepsis. Multiple observational cohorts associate each additional hour of delay with increased mortality in septic shock, with effect sizes around 1.04–1.16 per hour in different datasets, though these are largely nonrandomized and confounded by severity and resuscitation quality [^117NFMNb] [^111GiBm6]. Wait, let me verify whether randomized data exist: there are no definitive RCTs proving mortality benefit of a strict 1-hour mandate, and a meta-analysis comparing immediate versus early antibiotics found no mortality difference overall, underscoring the observational nature of the signal [^1134G8se]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even without RCT confirmation, the biological plausibility and consistency of association in shock cohorts, plus guideline consensus, justify the strong recommendation for immediate therapy in shock and high-likelihood sepsis despite low-to-very low evidence quality [^117QDK5q].

> Next, I should review the 3-hour window for possible sepsis without shock. The SSC frames this as a weak recommendation with very low quality evidence, emphasizing a rapid, time-limited diagnostic evaluation to clarify infectious versus noninfectious etiologies before committing to broad-spectrum antibiotics [^1111oLvH] [^1159AV5J]. Let me consider the rationale: about 30–40% of patients initially labeled with sepsis ultimately have noninfectious diagnoses, so a brief period for targeted evaluation can mitigate overtreatment and collateral harm without clear mortality penalty in low-risk strata, though this balance remains debated [^116tRBaf] [^113hQPd4]. I should double-check real-world data: contemporary cohorts show that many patients with possible sepsis without shock receive antibiotics well beyond 3 hours with low mortality, supporting the notion that rigid 1-hour targets are not necessary for all, though this does not negate the need for timely action when infection probability rises [^115ELb7T].

> I will now examine the controversies and limitations. The IDSA and others caution that aggressive time-to-antibiotic metrics, especially SEP-1's broad inclusion of possible sepsis, may drive unnecessary antibiotic use without proven benefit and with measurable harms, advocating to limit mandatory 1-hour targets primarily to septic shock [^116Nh8HK]. But wait, what if faster bundle completion, not just isolated antibiotic timing, is the key driver? Analyses from New York's mandate suggest that completing the full sepsis bundle within 1 hour, rather than antibiotics alone, associates with lower mortality, reinforcing systems-level care rather than a single time stamp [^1121oCSs]. I should also confirm that a meta-analysis of timing found no significant mortality benefit to either the 1-hour or 3-hour thresholds when pooled, highlighting residual confounding and heterogeneity across studies [^113H4wEQ]. Finally, stewardship imperatives remain: daily reassessment and de-escalation are recommended to counterbalance early broad-spectrum therapy, with shorter total durations favored when source control is adequate [^111mfgHu] [^1122xiuH].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances. The pediatric SSC mirrors adult timing: within 1 hour for septic shock and as soon as possible, ideally within 3 hours, for sepsis without shock, acknowledging very low evidence quality [^113UNew4] [^112zb43F]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 3-hour pediatric window was a strong recommendation; I should correct that — it is a weak recommendation with very low quality evidence, even though most clinicians prioritize timely therapy in children given the potential for rapid deterioration [^112zb43F]. Recent multicenter pediatric data suggest that delays beyond about 5.5 hours from presentation associate with higher sepsis-attributable mortality, which operationalizes a practical outer bound while still allowing time for evaluation in nonshock presentations [^117GBw9S].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In resource-limited environments, expert consensus still advises antimicrobials as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour, for high-likelihood sepsis or septic shock, while recognizing constraints and the need for local epidemiology to guide empiric choices and the feasibility of obtaining cultures before therapy [^114stj1t] [^114RKgiT]. For intra-abdominal infection with sepsis or septic shock, surgical society guidance supports initiation within 1 hour when sepsis is present, aligning with the SSC urgency framework for severe presentations [^115L7Xfa]. I need to ensure I also note hospital-onset sepsis: evidence is less definitive for applying community-onset timing targets wholesale, so clinicians should individualize based on pretest probability, severity, and local resistance patterns while avoiding harmful delays in the sickest patients [^113KQiyv].

> I will now translate this into practical bedside actions. First, recognize shock or high-likelihood sepsis rapidly and give broad-spectrum antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour, without waiting for cultures if delay would occur. Obtain cultures en route if feasible within the 45-minute window [^117QDK5q] [^111U7vcz]. Second, for possible sepsis without shock, complete a focused evaluation within about 3 hours — history, exam, targeted labs, and imaging as indicated — and start antibiotics if concern persists or if the patient deteriorates; defer only if the likelihood of infection is low and close monitoring is assured [^1111oLvH] [^112ZbvaV]. Third, optimize dosing using PK/PD principles, consider prolonged β-lactam infusions in critical illness, and ensure timely redosing if the ED stay is prolonged to avoid subtherapeutic exposure [^114nT67s] [^113C4MMn] [^116emLq3]. Finally, reassess daily for de-escalation or discontinuation, incorporate clinical response and, when duration is unclear, consider procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to guide stopping, while shortening total duration when source control is adequate [^111mfgHu] [^113JyKUf] [^1122xiuH].

> Hold on, I should verify the balance between speed and stewardship. The strongest signal for immediate therapy is in septic shock, where delays are consistently associated with harm; outside of shock, a brief, time-limited evaluation to avoid treating noninfectious mimics is reasonable, provided we do not let delays extend beyond the outer bounds suggested by pediatric and observational data, and provided we commit to de-escalation once data return [^117NFMNb] [^117GBw9S] [^111mfgHu]. I need to ensure we also communicate that bundle compliance, not isolated antibiotic timing, tracks with better outcomes, so systems that enable rapid recognition, cultures, fluids, and antibiotics together are preferable to single-intervention time stamps [^1121oCSs].

> In summary, the 2021 SSC stratified approach remains the most clinically coherent: immediate antimicrobials within 1 hour for possible septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis, and a rapid 3-hour assessment with treatment if concern persists for possible sepsis without shock. These adult recommendations are paralleled in pediatrics, with the caveat that evidence quality is low and ongoing research may refine thresholds further [^117TtP7Y] [^113UNew4]. I should double-check that my synthesis aligns with both high-quality guidelines and the best available evidence: yes, it preserves the urgency for shock while allowing measured evaluation for nonshock presentations, and it embeds stewardship and dosing best practices to mitigate overtreatment risks [^117QDK5q] [^114NZQDr].

Administer antimicrobials **within 1 hour** of recognition for septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis, as delays increase mortality [^117QDK5q] [^117NFMNb]. For adults with possible sepsis without shock, complete a rapid evaluation and start antimicrobials **within 3 hours** if infection remains likely [^1111oLvH] [^113yYqBd]. Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics if this does not delay therapy [^111U7vcz]. Use broad-spectrum agents initially, then de-escalate based on cultures and clinical response [^115tq8DD] [^111mfgHu]. These recommendations are strong for septic shock and weaker for sepsis without shock, reflecting the evidence quality [^117QDK5q] [^1111oLvH].

## Evidence supporting early antimicrobial administration

Multiple studies and guidelines consistently show that **early antimicrobial administration** improves outcomes in sepsis and septic shock:

- **Surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) 2021**: Strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour, for possible septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis [^117QDK5q] [^111dAe5q].

- **Mortality benefit**: Each hour of delay in antimicrobial administration is associated with increased mortality, particularly in septic shock [^117NFMNb] [^111GiBm6].

- **Meta-analyses**: Early appropriate antimicrobial therapy significantly reduces mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock [^notfound].

---

## Recommended timing of antimicrobial administration

The SSC 2021 guidelines provide **clear recommendations** on antimicrobial timing:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing** | **Recommendation strength** |
|-|-|-|
| Possible septic shock or high likelihood of sepsis | Immediately, ideally within 1 hour | Strong |
| Possible sepsis without shock | - Rapid assessment <br/> - If infection persists, administer within 3 hours | Weak |
| Low likelihood of infection without shock | Defer antimicrobials while monitoring closely | Weak |

---

These recommendations emphasize **early administration in septic shock** and allow a brief period of assessment for patients without shock to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use [^113yYqBd] [^112ZbvaV].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with delayed antimicrobial administration

Delayed antimicrobial administration is consistently associated with **worse clinical outcomes**:

- **Increased mortality**: Delays beyond 1 hour in septic shock are associated with significantly higher mortality rates [^111GiBm6].

- **Progression to septic shock**: Delays increase the risk of progression from sepsis to septic shock [^115L7Xfa].

- **Longer hospital stay**: Delayed therapy is associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased healthcare costs [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

While early antimicrobial administration is critical, certain scenarios require **individualized judgment**:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: In patients with possible sepsis without shock, a brief period of diagnostic evaluation is reasonable to confirm infection and avoid unnecessary antibiotics [^113yYqBd] [^113hQPd4].

- **Resource-limited settings**: Early antimicrobial administration within 1 hour may be challenging due to limited resources, but efforts should be made to minimize delays [^114stj1t] [^114RKgiT].

- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Early administration should be balanced with antimicrobial stewardship principles, including obtaining cultures before administration when feasible and de-escalating therapy based on culture results [^111U7vcz] [^114NZQDr].

---

## Practical implementation strategies

To ensure timely antimicrobial administration, healthcare systems can implement **the following strategies**:

- **Standardized protocols**: Implement sepsis protocols and order sets to streamline early antimicrobial administration [^116Lgmbr].

- **Education and training**: Regular training for healthcare providers on early recognition and management of sepsis [^117Xe4KS].

- **Rapid diagnostic tools**: Utilize rapid diagnostic tests and biomarkers to quickly identify infections and guide antimicrobial selection [^115LsvwN].

- **Quality improvement initiatives**: Monitor and feedback on antimicrobial timing to improve adherence to guidelines [^117Xe4KS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Early antimicrobial administration is a **critical component** of sepsis management, particularly in septic shock. The SSC 2021 guidelines recommend administering antimicrobials within 1 hour for septic shock or high-likelihood sepsis and within 3 hours for possible sepsis without shock after a brief assessment. These recommendations balance the need for rapid treatment with the risks of unnecessary antibiotic use, and their strength varies with the clinical scenario and evidence quality [^117QDK5q] [^1111oLvH].

Regarding medical management for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy (indications), SSC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining a time-limited course of rapid investigation in adult patients with possible sepsis without shock, and administering antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized, if concern for infection persists.

### Time-to-antibiotics and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock: a prospective nationwide multicenter cohort study [^112NEHMR]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities that are induced by infection and associated with multiorgan failure and high mortality. Compelling evidence has shown that delay in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is a risk factor for mortality; therefore, administration of antibiotics is recognized as a key component in the early treatment of sepsis. In this regard, antibiotic administration has been included in the hour-1 bundle of the previous Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, and the implementation of the hour-1 bundle was highly recommended to reduce mortality and morbidity. Indeed, several multinational studies reported that compliance to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundle was associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.

Nevertheless, considerable controversy still exists regarding the association between the time of antibiotic administration and clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis/septic shock, and whether the administration of antibiotics within 1 h could improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that the aggressive administration of antibiotics within 1 h might not be beneficial in sepsis and may result in unintentional exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The American College of Emergency Physicians also noted a lack of evidence to recommend a strict time threshold for antibiotic administration in cases with sepsis. In addition, organizing timely administration of antibiotics requires considerable effort and resources, and it may not be feasible to administer antibiotics within 1 h of presentation in all patients with sepsis.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of time-to-antibiotics on in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was performed to assess whether the effect of time-to-antibiotics was significantly different between the sepsis and septic shock groups.

### Antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: an evidence-based review [^112n8R2z]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

Since the prompt institution of therapy that is active against the causative pathogen is one of the most important predictors of outcome, clinicians must establish a system for rapid administration of a rationally chosen drug or combination of drugs when sepsis or septic shock is suspected. The expanding number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents available provides opportunities for effective empiric and specific therapy. However, to minimize the promotion of antimicrobial resistance and cost and to maximize efficacy, detailed knowledge of the likely pathogens and the properties of the available drugs is necessary for the intensivist.

Antimicrobial therapy — timing and empiric coverage — In children with septic shock, we recommend starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible, within 1 hour of recognition (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction but without shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after appropriate evaluation, within 3 hours of recognition (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens (BPS), and once the pathogen(s) and sensitivities are available, we recommend narrowing empiric antimicrobial therapy coverage (BPS). If no pathogen is identified, we recommend narrowing or stopping empiric antimicrobial therapy according to clinical presentation, site of infection, host risk factors, and adequacy of clinical improvement in discussion with infectious disease and/or microbiological expert advice (BPS).

### Emergency medicine updates: management of sepsis and septic shock [^114fvkcb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the management of sepsis and septic shock for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, and rapid diagnosis and management are essential. Antimicrobials should be administered as soon as possible, as delays are associated with increased mortality. Resuscitation targets include mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, mental status, capillary refill time, lactate, and urine output. Intravenous fluid resuscitation plays an integral role in those who are fluid responsive. Balanced crystalloids and normal saline are both reasonable options for resuscitation. Early vasopressors should be initiated in those who are not fluid-responsive. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line vasopressor, and if hypotension persists, vasopressin should be considered, followed by epinephrine. Administration of vasopressors through a peripheral 20-gauge or larger intravenous line is safe and effective. Steroids such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone should be considered in those with refractory septic shock.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning sepsis and septic shock can assist emergency clinicians and improve the care of these patients.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^114stj1t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial clinical guidance for managing sepsis in resource-limited settings should recognize that

When there is a high likelihood of sepsis or septic shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately, ideally within one hour.
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, where investigations (such as laboratory or imaging) to exclude a non–infectious cause of acute illness are not readily available and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered without delay.
Administration of antiparasitic agents should not be delayed in patients with suspicion of sepsis of parasitic origin.
In patients with sepsis and where the source has been adequately controlled, clinical improvement with an improving trend in white blood cell count can be used to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy.

Providing appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy in sepsis is central to improving outcomes. However, in resource-limited settings, achieving this goal must be balanced against providing other aspects of care, especially to the sickest patients. Providing timely antimicrobial therapy should also be balanced with concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance where infections are commonly caused by resistant organisms and empiric therapy is likely to include broad-spectrum antibiotics. While the World Health Assembly recognises the need to promote 'judicious use of antimicrobials' in sepsis management, how best to do this in patients with sepsis is unclear and likely will need significant improvements in both diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship programmes. The WHO's global research agenda for antimicrobial resistance includes research priorities of context-specific optimization of antimicrobial stewardship and empiric antimicrobial regimens and new rapid point-of-care diagnostics which would be of great value in addressing this complex issue.

### Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU [^111z2J9G]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for β-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Sepsis and antimicrobial stewardship: two sides of the same coin [^112T2GFg]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). High credibility.

Balancing sepsis and antimicrobial stewardship goals in practice

The first step in sepsis management pathways is recognition of patients with sepsis; however, this itself is challenging. Sepsis is a subjective clinical rather than a laboratory diagnosis and recognition can be difficult, especially early in the clinical presentation when symptoms are non-specific and laboratory results are pending. This means clinicians must act before the results of investigations are available. While the majority of experienced clinicians report confidence in applying sepsis definitions, only a minority successfully identified sepsis case vignettes in an experimental test of their diagnostic accuracy. In the context of uncertainty, clinicians must act, weighing up the risks of failing to treat sepsis against overdiagnosis, overtreatment and the associated risk of increasing AMR. The visibility of the sepsis threat involving acutely unwell patients and the emphasis on time-dependent protocols bring to the forefront the immediate risks posed by sepsis and the need for urgent action by individual healthcare staff.

Current antimicrobial stewardship guidance aims to strike a balance between promptly managing suspected infection and avoiding antimicrobial overuse. Recommendations include the development of bespoke guidelines based on local AMR epidemiology to standardise antimicrobial prescribing, a blended learning approach to antimicrobial stewardship education, standardised antimicrobial consumption surveillance and close liaison with the diagnostic laboratory. While antimicrobial stewardship guidance stresses a rapid response to sepsis symptoms through administering broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobials, it equally focuses on subsequent patient review, switching to a more targeted treatment or stopping antimicrobials. There is, however, evidence of reluctance to alter antimicrobial therapy in a patient with sepsis due to a lack of conclusive research findings regarding the safety and efficacy of this approach, and the lack of perceived immediacy of the problem of AMR. This has been confirmed by findings that prescribers focus on avoiding immediate risks of mortality and morbidity by avoiding changing 'a winning team' (ie, a seemingly successful treatment approach).

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — empiric MRSA coverage in adults with sepsis or septic shock: For high risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), "we recommend using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage over using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage" (best practice statement); for low risk of MRSA, "we suggest against using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage, as compared with using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage" (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Context includes that "MRSA accounts for approximately 5% of culture-positive infections among critically ill patients", varies by region "ranging from ~2% in Western Europe to 10% in North America", and among patients with documented MRSA infections, delays of " > 24–48 hours" to antibiotics "are associated with increased mortality", whereas in undifferentiated pneumonia or sepsis, broad-spectrum regimens including anti-MRSA agents "were associated with higher mortality, particularly among patients without MRSA".

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^1167uYXv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should these findings have been surprising? We think not. The author's cite a meta-analysis by Barochia and colleagues that suggests that timely administration of antimicrobials is associated with improved survival. However, this finding was only significant after removing the effects from Rivers and colleagues' study on early goal-directed therapy. Another meta-analysis conducted on studies of outpatient respiratory infections found no difference between immediate or delayed antibiotic therapy. Puskarich and colleagues demonstrated that, in the setting of appropriate resuscitation, the timing of antimicrobial therapy appears to have little effect on mortality. Similarly, Hranjec and colleagues found that, assuming resuscitation and source control occur in a timely manner, intentionally withholding antimicrobial therapy until infection can be objectively proven to result in improved patient outcomes compared with early and aggressive initiation. These studies focused on emergency department and ICU management, respectively. Bloos and colleagues' study confirms the findings of Hranjec and colleagues and Puskarich and colleagues, while spanning the entire spectrum of hospitalization.

This trial also suffers from the most common deficit in most studies of timing of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: the lack of a proper control group. The question faced by the clinician is not whether a patient with proven infection should have the rapid initiation of antimicrobials, but whether a patient who might be infected should receive therapy. Missing in this study is the group of patients who received antimicrobials for suspected infection but were not infected, and what the consequences of this unnecessary exposure to antibiotics were. However, the data are reassuring to us who believe that it is prudent to wait until there is objective microbiological data to support the diagnosis of infection before initiating therapy. Even among these patients with significant disease, the exact timing of antimicrobial therapy did not appear to be the main driver of outcomes.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112R6UXA]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Insights and Implications — In summary, when sepsis is definite or probable and regardless of the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobials should be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. In a patient with shock and possible sepsis, antimicrobials should also be administered immediately and ideally within 1 hour of recognition. If sepsis is possible and shock is absent, then the patient should be rapidly assessed for an infectious versus a noninfectious cause of acute illness, including obtaining a history and physical examination, testing for infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness, and treating acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Ideally, assessment should be completed within 3 hours of presentation and antimicrobials should be administered within that time if the likelihood of infection is thought to be high.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111W8GHj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of suspected sepsis requires thoughtful and individualized care. Initial empiric therapy should be immediate for those with a high likelihood of infection, severe illness and/or shock. Specific empiric antimicrobial therapy should be chosen with consideration of the likely site of infection, common pathogens for these sites, and with modification made by consideration of patient-specific risk factors for resistance and knowledge of local microbiology. While timely and appropriate therapy is necessary to reduce mortality, it must be accompanied by a commitment to de-escalate once we get culture and serial clinical and laboratory data, since indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum empiric therapy is a driving force for antimicrobial resistance. Key recommendations for management are summarized in Table 1.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to discontinue antibiotic therapy by 36–48 hours of incubation when blood cultures are sterile, unless there is clear evidence of site-specific infection. Avoid continuing empirical antibiotic therapy in response to laboratory test abnormalities alone, particularly among well-appearing term infants.

### Transforming sepsis management: AI-driven innovations in early detection and tailored therapies [^117PhQ3W]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical challenges

Clinical studies have demonstrated higher survival rates of septic shock associated with earlier administration of antibiotics, this emphasizes the importance of rapid intervention to decrease mortality and morbidity. Patient heterogeneity adds to this complexity, with individual responses to infection varying based on genetics and health status. For instance, patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, autoimmune diseases, chronic lung, kidney, or liver diseases, and cancer, as well as individuals at the extremes of age including newborns and the elderly, are more susceptible to severe infections and the development of sepsis. Recent advances in sepsis research underscore the need for molecular stratification of these patients to tailor treatment strategies.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern globally that complicates sepsis treatment. In some countries, the emergence of resistant pathogens has severely limited treatment options, often leaving clinicians with few or no effective therapies. As a result, resistant infections significantly contribute to the mortality burden, accounting for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide annually. Early diagnosis and individualized treatment are essential for improving outcomes, yet current approaches often fail to address the heterogeneity of patient responses.

In 2021, Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine published new guidelines for sepsis management, called The Surviving Sepsis Campaign, offering clinicians state-of-the-art instructions for treating patients with sepsis or septic shock. The guidelines stress the importance of early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after sepsis development. As mentioned before, timely intervention in sepsis care is crucial, as for each hour delay of proper treatment, mortality increases by 7.6% from the onset of hypotension. To this end, early administration of antimicrobials and adequate hemodynamic resuscitation using fluids and vasopressors depending on the patient's needs, ideally within one hour of recognition, is essential for patients with hypotension and sepsis. The sepsis management guidelines recommend early elimination of the infection focus, including empiric administration of a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics and, when necessary, surgical intervention such as incision and drainage of abscesses. It is important to note that samples for microbial analysis should be taken prior to antibiotic administration to increase the diagnostic yield. Additional treatment strategies addressing vascular leakage and endothelial dysfunction are also under investigation to stabilize circulatory collapse in sepsis. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy further complicates management and has been linked to poor outcomes in multiple studies.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^116tRBaf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

### Timing of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration and outcome of adults with community-onset bacteremia [^116HmhL4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite improvements in hemodynamic support and antibiotic therapy, bacteremia is still associated with high morbidity and mortality, which contribute substantially to healthcare costs. Community-onset bacteremia, with an annual incidence of 0.82% in a population-based study, is a common problem for clinicians. In addition to early establishment of vascular access, fluid resuscitation, and removal of infection source, particularly in critically ill patients, antimicrobial therapy has been regarded as one of the mainstays of bacteremia treatment. Although most investigations have concluded that early administration of appropriate antimicrobials could be linked to a favorable prognosis in the individuals with bacteremia, several studies have not identified the survival benefit of early appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Furthermore, the timing of the first dose of appropriate antibiotics remains a controversial point, and thus appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy has been defined as the interval between bacteremia onset and antimicrobial administration, ranging widely from < 24 hours to < 48 hours in previous reports. To our knowledge, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SCC) "International guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock" recommend that an appropriate antimicrobial therapy be administered within the first 1 hour of recognition of severe sepsis or septic shock. However, focusing on patients with bacteremia, the question "what priority is early enough for appropriate antibiotic administration?" has been debated. Therefore, to describe the beneficial effects of appropriate empirical antimicrobial administration on clinical outcome and to further achieve the "optimum timing" of appropriate antimicrobial administration, we compared the outcome impact of different time cutoffs from emergence department (ED) triage to appropriate antimicrobial administration for adults with community-onset bacteremia.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^111uSmjV]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a common and life-threatening illness in the ICU, requiring timely and effective antimicrobial therapy. The aims of this review are to identify the most common sites of sepsis, the likely pathogens, and the optimal approach to antimicrobial therapy. Effective therapy must be balanced by the need to avoid overuse of broad spectrum agents and thus must be accompanied by a commitment to antimicrobial stewardship. Using experts in this topic, we reviewed the literature relevant to antimicrobial management of sepsis and recommend key principles for management.

### Optimizing pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial management in patients with sepsis: a review [^115LsvwN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock are at an increased risk of death. Early and aggressive interventions are essential for improving clinical outcomes. There are a number of therapeutic and practical challenges in the management of antimicrobials in patients with sepsis. These include the timely selection and administration of appropriate antimicrobials, significant physiological alterations that can influence antimicrobial pharmacokinetics, and significant interpatient variability of antimicrobial concentrations using standard dosing approaches. Understanding the impact of these factors on the probability of attaining pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target goals is essential to guide optimal therapy. Using rapid diagnostic technology could facilitate timely selection of antimicrobials, and therapeutic drug monitoring would provide a more individualized dosing approach. Using an interdisciplinary sepsis team would also be beneficial in coordinating efforts to overcome the challenges encountered during this critical period to ensure optimal care.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^114TfLey]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Italian multidisciplinary Consensus Conference for the antimicrobial treatment of Intra-abdominal Infections

What is the optimal timing to start antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs?

1. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started after a treatable infection has been recognized or highly suspected. Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs is initially empiric because the identification of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns determined by the standard microbiological culture typically needs 24 h or more.

Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status. In non-critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started when an IAI is recognized or highly suspected. Survival benefit from adequate empiric antibiotic therapy has not been consistently shown, even in patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia. Conversely, in patients with sepsis or septic shock, the prompt administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can significantly influence the outcome, regardless of the anatomical site of infection.

According to the current literature, a strong correlation exists between each hour of delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and mortality in patients with septic shock. However, this relationship is less pronounced in patients with sepsis who do not experience shock.

When should microbiological cultures be obtained in patients with IAIs?

2. In patients with IAIs at risk of resistant pathogens and in critically ill patients', cultures from peritoneal fluid should be always obtained. In critically ill hospitalized patients, a minimum of two sets of blood cultures before initiating antimicrobial therapy should be always obtained (Very low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Microbiological testing results are crucial in choosing a therapeutic strategy and in guiding a targeted antibiotic treatment. This testing allows clinicians to individualize the spectrum of the antibiotic regimen, broadening it if the initial choice was too narrow, but more commonly narrowing an empiric regimen spectrum that was too broad.

Timing of appropriate therapy — septic shock

Although controversy persists regarding many aspects of care for septic patients, nearly all agree that timely and appropriate antibiotic treatment is a necessary first step to insure good outcomes (Fig. 2). Interest in the issue of appropriate antibiotic treatment arose over two decades ago. For example, Kumar and colleagues documented that for each hour delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotic(s) the patient's risk for death increased substantially. These authors demonstrated that for every hour's delay until appropriate antibiotic administration led to a more than 10% increase in crude mortality. Specifically, if one did not begin appropriate therapy within 1 h of shock, the odds ratio (OR) for mortality increased from 1.67 in hour 2 to 92.54 with delays > 36 h. Subsequent analyses examining the value of care bundles in sepsis confirmed the crucial importance of timely antimicrobials and source control. A review of over 1000 patients with septic shock arising from Gram-negative pathogens revealed that inappropriate antibiotic therapy (identified based on the failure to administer an in vitro active antibiotic within six hours) independently increased the risk for mortality nearly fourfold.

### Delays to antibiotics in the emergency department and risk of mortality in children with sepsis [^116gaNtj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is the leading cause of death in children worldwide, with an estimated 3.4 million deaths in 2017. It is a major cause of pediatric morbidityand a substantial contributor to health care utilization, and cost burden. Although not all sepsis is caused by bacteria, early antibiotic administration has been a longstanding, cornerstone recommendation for the treatment of sepsis by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, the American College of Critical Care Medicine, and the American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines. The Pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction recommend antibiotic administration within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock and within 3 hours of recognition of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction without shock.

Although the importance of timely antibiotics in pediatric sepsis is not in question, a precise understanding of timeliness has not been established in children. Prior studies, evaluating the association of time to antibiotic administration with pediatric sepsis outcomes have been single-center investigations that may not have been powered to detect clinical differences at multiple time points. The objective of this study was to examine data from a cohort of children treated for sepsis as a part of a large, multicenter improvement collaborative to evaluate the association of the time from sepsis identification to antibiotic administration with sepsis-attributable mortality. Our first aim was to use time to antibiotic administration data to determine whether there was a time point past which antibiotic administration was associated with a change in sepsis-attributable mortality rates; if such a point existed, our second aim was to describe the association of time to antibiotic administration with sepsis-attributable mortality in children.

### Outcome of immediate versus early antibiotics in severe sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134G8se]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Debate exists about the mortality benefit of administering antibiotics within either 1 or 3 hours of sepsis onset. We performed this meta-analysis to analyze the effect of immediate (0 to 1 hour after onset) versus early (1 to 3 hours after onset) antibiotics on mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

This review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Searched databases included PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, as well as gray literature. Included studies were conducted with consecutive adults with severe sepsis or septic shock who received antibiotics within each period and provided mortality data. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and pooled with random effects. Two authors independently assessed quality of evidence across all studies with Cochrane's Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and risk of bias within each study, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Results

Thirteen studies were included: 5 prospective longitudinal and 8 retrospective cohort ones. Three studies (23%) had a high risk of bias (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Overall, quality of evidence across all studies (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was low. Pooling of data (33,863 subjects) showed no difference in mortality between patients receiving antibiotics in immediate versus early periods (odds ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.21). Analysis of severe sepsis studies (8,595 subjects) found higher mortality in immediate versus early periods (odds ratio 1.29; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.53).

Conclusion

We found no difference in mortality between immediate and early antibiotics across all patients. Although the quality of evidence across studies was low, these findings do not support a mortality benefit for immediate compared with early antibiotics across all patients with sepsis.

### Antimicrobial stewardship in the management of sepsis [^114Yt5Mn]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis represents a unique clinical dilemma with regard to antimicrobial stewardship. The standard approach to suspected sepsis in the emergency department centers on fluid resuscitation and timely broad-spectrum antimicrobials. The lack of gold standard diagnostics and evolving definitions for sepsis introduce a significant degree of diagnostic uncertainty that may raise the potential for inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing. Intervention bundles that combine traditional quality improvement strategies with emerging electronic health record-based clinical decision support tools and rapid molecular diagnostics represent the most promising approach to enhancing antimicrobial stewardship in the management of suspected sepsis in the emergency department.

### The quest for evidence on time to antibiotics in children with sepsis… [^117GBw9S]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Timely recognition and management of sepsis in children remains a major challenge in pediatric emergency care, where most patients with sepsis present. Avoiding delays in antimicrobial treatment for children with sepsis, such as delays in recognition, escalation, prescription, or administration, represents a core feature of quality improvement initiatives; at the same time, the quest for the optimal threshold in relation to time to antimicrobials continues to stir controversy. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign1 advocates that broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible upon recognition of septic shock. The retrospective cohort study conducted by Lane et al, 5 which leverages data from the Improving Pediatric Sepsis Outcomes collaborative across 51 US hospitals, provides new insights concerning the critical issue of antibiotic timing and its association with sepsis-related mortality in pediatric patients.

The main goal was to identify time points when delays in antibiotic administration are associated with increased risk of mortality outcomes in children with sepsis. The study included 19 515 children aged 29 days to less than 18 years with a diagnosis of sepsis over a 5-year period. The authors observed that delays in antibiotic administration beyond 330 minutes after ED presentation were associated with significantly increased mortality. Patients who received antibiotic treatment within 330 minutes of presentation had sepsis-attributable 3-day mortality of 0. 5% and 30-day mortality of
0. 9%. Patients who received antibiotics at 330 minutes or later had 3-day sepsis-attributable mortality of 1. 2% and 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality of
2. 0%. Given the inherent difficulties with labeling sepsis onset, the authors defined time from presentation to ED to first antibiotic administration as the primary exposure.

The authors intentionally limited the cohort to patients who were recognized within the first hour of arrival to the ED to minimize confounding by delayed recognition. Thus, although it appears biologically plausible that in less severely ill children, allowing up to approximately 330 minutes as per the findings of Lane et al5 for investigations and observations may not necessarily result in increased mortality, future studies should attempt to assess temporal relationships by focusing on patients who are most likely to benefit from early intervention. The question to balance will then be to decide on the acceptable number of children with uncertain sepsis who get treated as a result of mandates for early care, vs the benefit of timely treatment in those most likely to have bacterial infection progressing to organ or multiorgan dysfunction.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113UNew4]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — timing of antimicrobials in pediatric sepsis states that in children with septic shock, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible and ideally within 1 hour of recognition, and despite very low quality of evidence the panel provides a strong recommendation that most clinicians should seek to initiate antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after recognition of septic shock in most situations. For children without clinical signs of shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after sepsis recognition, while allowing up to 3 hours for appropriate diagnostic investigation for patients without clinical signs of shock and for those with an uncertain diagnosis. During evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed expeditiously and, if and when the evaluation supports a likely infection or evidence of septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction becomes manifest, antimicrobial therapy should be immediately administered.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Additional therapies… [^111AXjoS]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Balanced crystalloids such as lactated ringers are recommended over normal saline because of weak evidence of decreased mortality. Albumin has no clear benefits over balanced crystalloids and is more expensive. After infusing large volumes of crystalloid fluids, albumin can be considered to improve blood pressure. Hydroxyethyl starch solutions should be avoided because of increased mortality, and synthetic colloid gelatin should not be used because of lack of evidence. Infection Control Reducing time to administration of antimicrobials reduces mortality.

For patients in septic shock, antimicrobials should be started within one hour because mortality increases with each hour of delay. In sepsis without shock, the evidence is less clear, and antimicrobials are recommended within three hours of recognition. Adding procalcitonin to clinical evaluation for antibiotic initiation does not improve mortality, length of intensive care, or hospitalization and is not recommended. Because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounts for one in 20 infections in critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should cover for MRSA in patients at high risk because delays can increase mortality. Although empiric combination antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria do not improve overall mortality, combination antibiotics are recommended for patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms.

Similarly, empiric antifungal agents do not improve short-term mortality in critically ill patients but are recommended for patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections. When beta-lactam antibiotics are used, prolonged intravenous infusions after an initial bolus improve antibiotic concentrations over intermittent boluses and reduce short-term mortality. Source Control Controlling the source of infection, including abscess drainage, necrotic tissue debridement, and removing potentially infective devices, is key in management of sepsis. Source control improves survival and is recommended after initial resuscitation. As long as light sedation can be maintained, intermittent boluses of neuromuscular blocking agents appear to be safer than continuous infusions. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reduces mortality in expert centers when mechanical ventilation fails.

### Hospital-onset sepsis warrants expanded investigation and consideration as a unique clinical entity [^113KQiyv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Management Recommendations

International consensus guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock published by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign reference studies primarily conducted among patients with COS. Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations inform the CMS sepsis metric (SEP-1), to which adherence is publicly reported as a quality metric for acute care hospitals in the United States. However, whether and how these recommendations should be applied to patients with HOS has not been established. As such, the research priorities identified here have significant implications for quality improvement initiatives directed toward patients with HOS, including potential modifications of current sepsis guidelines.

Given clinical differences between the groups, and the fact that patients with HOS have largely been excluded from sepsis clinical trials, whether some recommendations confer the same benefits for patients with HOS as for those with COS is unclear. Although administration of IV fluids has been associated with reduced duration of shock among patients with COS, the same effect has not been demonstrated among patients with HOS. Particularly given increasing equipoise regarding the benefits of aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for sepsis, concerns about the potential harms of overresuscitation, and data suggesting heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups, additional research is needed to understand how current sepsis resuscitation recommendations and practices impact outcomes in HOS.

Although rapid antimicrobial administration has been shown to be associated with improved mortality rates in patients with HOS, the optimal timing for treatment initiation and microbial coverage has not been established. Recommendations must balance the need for prompt treatment and appropriately broad coverage in this high-risk group with the realities of diagnostic uncertainty and need for appropriate risk assessment and infectious workup to guide therapy in the face of higher prevalence of fungal and multi-drug-resistant organisms in HOS.

Identification of clinical phenotypes may be helpful to examine the risks and benefits of resuscitation and treatment strategies among subgroups of patients with HOS, informing targeted enrollment in clinical trials enriched for patients most likely to benefit from given treatment arms.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^112J3hwZ]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Evidence summary — timing of antimicrobials and outcomes in adult sepsis indicates that several large studies have reported a strong association between each hour delay in time from emergency department arrival to administration of antimicrobials and in-hospital mortality with septic shock; for sepsis without shock, mortality risk increases when interval times to antimicrobial administration exceed 3 to 5 hours from hospital arrival and/or sepsis recognition, and thus for adults with possible sepsis without shock a time-limited course of rapid investigation is suggested, and if concern for infection persists, antimicrobials should be administered within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized; additionally, some MRSA infection studies show that delays of greater than 24 to 48 hours to antibiotic administration are associated with increased mortality.

### Electronic prescribing: reducing delay to first dose of antibiotics for patients in intensive care [^117D3LoM]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

The Surviving Sepsis campaign advocates use of the 'resuscitation care bundle', a package of interventions that provides a structured approach to the management of sepsis. 'Sepsis' is commonly defined as a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) arising as a consequence of infection; this becomes 'severe sepsis' if associated with organ dysfunction, hypotension, or tissue hypoperfusion. One component of the resuscitation care bundle is the timely administration of appropriate antibiotics, based on evidence that prompt initiation of antibiotics improves survival in septic shock. Surviving Sepsis guidelines recommend that the first antibiotic dose should be given within an hour of presentation to patients with severe sepsis.

The research team set out to evaluate the role of our EP system in administration of antibiotics to patients with severe sepsis in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) environment. It was hypothesized that some delays in antibiotic administration might be attributable to the default dose timings implemented by the EP system, and that simple modifications to the EP protocol might therefore reduce such delays.

The team's performance in achieving antibiotic administration within an hour of the prescription being generated was audited, retrospectively reviewing cases before and after the implementation of EP modifications. Overall, this study aims to inform the introduction and ongoing use of EP for antibiotic prescriptions in critical care and emergency settings.

### Appropriate antibiotic therapy [^116SMsfR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics is an essential component of initial therapy in sepsis. Early antibiotics are an important component of therapy, but speed of administration should not overshadow the patient-specific characteristics that determine the optimal breadth of antimicrobial therapy. Cultures should be drawn before antibiotic therapy if it does not significantly delay administration. Combination antibiotic therapy against gram-negative infections is not routinely required, and combination therapy involving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is associated with an increase in acute kidney injury. Emergency practitioners should be aware of special considerations in the administration and dosing of antibiotics in order to deliver optimal care to septic patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO₂/FIO₂ < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Severe sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department [^111GgLT4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Increased attention has focused recently on the acute management of severe sepsis and septic shock, conditions that represent the end-stage systemic deterioration of overwhelming infection. Clinical trials have identified new therapies and management approaches that, when applied early, appear to reduce mortality. Practice guidelines have been advanced by critical care societies, and many of the proposed interventions involve therapies other than antimicrobials directed at hemodynamic resuscitation or addressing adverse effects of the inflammatory cascade. Although many emergency departments (EDs) are now adopting treatment protocols for sepsis that are based on published treatment guidelines, recent research calls many of the initial recommendations into question, and validation trials of some of these approaches are ongoing. This article reviews the initial evaluation and treatment considerations of sepsis in the ED setting.

### Prolonged vs intermittent infusions of β-lactam antibiotics in adults with sepsis or septic shock… [^1154hLYQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration PROSPERO Identifier: CRD42023399434 Critically ill adults who develop sepsis and septic shock face high morbidity and mortality. Early and appropriate antibiotic administration is central to the treatment of such patients. There is uncertainty about effective antibiotic dosing, specifically the duration of infusion in this patient population, due to physiologic perturbations and supportive treatments that may alter antibiotic pharmacokinetics. 1–3 Pathogens causing an infection during an intensive care unit admission may have reduced antibiotic susceptibility. β-Lactam antibiotics are widely used as first-line antibiotics for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. These agents display time-dependent bactericidal activity that is optimal when the free drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the infecting pathogen for at least 40% to 70% of the dosing interval.

4 There is a biological rationale that prolonged infusions of β-lactam antibiotics may be more effective compared. with conventional intermittent dosing. 5, 6 This rationale is supported by pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies, which demonstrate that prolonged infusions achieve β-lactam antibiotic exposures associated with maximal bacterial-killing more consistently than intermittent infusions. 7 Whether the effects of prolonged β-lactam antibiotic infusion compared with intermittent infusion result in improved patient-centered outcomes remains uncertain. 8–13. Two recently published multinational randomized clinical trials, the Continuous Infusion vs Intermittent Administration of Meropenem in Critically Ill Patients 14 and the Beta-Lactam Infusion Group III15 trials, have added substantially to the body of evidence.

To provide an updated summary of current evidence, this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis was conducted to assess whether administration of β-lactam antibiotics by prolonged infusion was associated with reduced 90-day all-cause mortality and other relevant outcomes compared with intermittent infusion. Intermittent infusion was defined as intravenous β-lactam antibiotic administration for fewer than 2 hours during a dosing interval. In 13 trials, an equivalent total daily dose of β-lactam antibiotics was used in both the prolonged and intermittent infusion groups. 14, 15, 33, 35, 36, 39–42, 44–47 The median duration of randomly assigned β-lactam antibiotic treatment was 7 days and 9 days in the prolonged and intermittent infusion groups, respectively.

### Impact of compliance with infection management guidelines on outcome in patients with severe sepsis: a prospective observational multi-center study [^1153yNkN]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the treatment of severe sepsis, timely and effective antimicrobial therapy (AT) as well as source control is crucial and has become a key element in the resuscitation bundles proposed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). The SSC guidelines recommend obtaining blood cultures and applying intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobials within 1 hour after the onset of severe sepsis or septic shock; the guidelines also recommend initiating surgical source control within 12 hours. Numerous studies have shown that a delay of AT and inappropriate initial AT in this condition is associated with poor outcome. One retrospective study in patients with septic shock suggests an increase of patient mortality between 7 and 8% per hour within the first 6 hours after onset of arterial hypotension. There is also evidence that delayed surgery is associated with lower survival rates, but the appropriate time frame remains poorly defined.

In numerous retrospective and before-and-after studies, improved adherence to the sepsis bundles was associated with improved patient outcome. A meta-analysis suggests that among the individual elements of the resuscitation bundle, timely and appropriately administered antimicrobials are the most important predictors for survival. However, compliance with sepsis guideline recommendations is poor. In a Spanish multicenter trial, only 18.4% of the studied patients received AT within the first hour of severe sepsis or septic shock. The administration of antimicrobials within 1 hour was independently associated with a lower risk of hospital death.

Application of antimicrobials without microbiological evidence of infection might be associated with an unfavorable outcome. Likewise, starting AT in patients with severe sepsis before obtaining blood cultures was among the factors that were associated with higher hospital mortality. Compliance with the recommendation to draw two pairs of blood cultures before AT, however, was only in the range of 54.4 to 64.5% of patients.

Most of the previous studies investigating the timing of antimicrobials and the compliance with the SSC sepsis bundles reported only ICU mortality rates, focused mainly on patients treated in the emergency department or in the ICU, and did not evaluate the impact of delayed source control on patient outcome. However, many of these patients may be admitted also from general wards or the operating room and may require effective surgical and other measures of source control. We therefore extended our assessment of infection control measures to include these patients as well. The primary aim of our cohort study was to prospectively test the hypothesis that a delay in AT and source control after onset of sepsis-related organ dysfunction impacts patient outcome. In addition, we aimed to assess compliance with recent best-practice recommendations for the diagnosis and therapy of sepsis.

### The impact of timing of antibiotics on outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113H4wEQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to systematically review and meta-analyze the available data on the association between timing of antibiotic administration and mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search criteria was performed using a predefined protocol.

Inclusion Criteria

adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, reported time to antibiotic administration in relation to emergency department triage and/or shock recognition, and mortality.

Exclusion Criteria

immunosuppressed populations, review article, editorial, or nonhuman studies.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers screened abstracts with a third reviewer arbitrating. The effect of time to antibiotic administration on mortality was based on current guideline recommendations: 1) administration within 3 hours of emergency department triage and 2) administration within 1 hour of severe sepsis/septic shock recognition. Odds ratios were calculated using a random effect model. The primary outcome was mortality.

Data Synthesis

A total of 1,123 publications were identified and 11 were included in the analysis. Among the 11 included studies, 16,178 patients were evaluable for antibiotic administration from emergency department triage. Patients who received antibiotics more than 3 hours after emergency department triage (< 3hr reference) had a pooled odds ratio for mortality of 1.16 (0.92–1.46; p = 0.21). A total of 11,017 patients were evaluable for antibiotic administration from severe sepsis/septic shock recognition. Patients who received antibiotics more than 1 hour after severe sepsis/shock recognition (< 1hr reference) had a pooled odds ratio for mortality of 1.46 (0.89–2.40; p = 0.13). There was no increased mortality in the pooled odds ratios for each hourly delay from less than 1 to more than 5 hours in antibiotic administration from severe sepsis/shock recognition.

Conclusion

Using the available pooled data, we found no significant mortality benefit of administering antibiotics within 3 hours of emergency department triage or within 1 hour of shock recognition in severe sepsis and septic shock. These results suggest that currently recommended timing metrics as measures of quality of care are not supported by the available evidence.

### Effect of a multifaceted educational intervention for anti-infectious measures on sepsis mortality: a cluster randomized trial [^117Xe4KS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Guidelines recommend administering antibiotics within 1 h of sepsis recognition but this recommendation remains untested by randomized trials. This trial was set up to investigate whether survival is improved by reducing the time before initiation of antimicrobial therapy by means of a multifaceted intervention in compliance with guideline recommendations.

Methods

The MEDUSA study, a prospective multicenter cluster-randomized trial, was conducted from July 2011 to July 2013 in 40 German hospitals. Hospitals were randomly allocated to receive conventional continuous medical education (CME) measures (control group) or multifaceted interventions including local quality improvement teams, educational outreach, audit, feedback, and reminders. We included 4183 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in an intention-to-treat analysis comparing the multifaceted intervention (n = 2596) with conventional CME (n = 1587). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

Results

The 28-day mortality was 35.1% (883 of 2596 patients) in the intervention group and 26.7% (403 of 1587 patients; p = 0.01) in the control group. The intervention was not a risk factor for mortality, since this difference was present from the beginning of the study and remained unaffected by the intervention. Median time to antimicrobial therapy was 1.5 h (interquartile range 0.1–4.9 h) in the intervention group and 2.0 h (0.4–5.9 h; p = 0.41) in the control group. The risk of death increased by 2% per hour delay of antimicrobial therapy and 1% per hour delay of source control, independent of group assignment.

Conclusions

Delay in antimicrobial therapy and source control was associated with increased mortality but the multifaceted approach was unable to change time to antimicrobial therapy in this setting and did not affect survival.

### A critical assessment of time-to-antibiotics recommendations in pediatric sepsis [^1175c3Dz]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

The Pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recommend delivery of antibiotics within 1 hour for children with septic shock and, for those without shock but with sepsis-related organ dysfunction, as soon as feasible within 3 hours. In this review, we summarize the available adult and pediatric literature supporting these recommendations. We also explore the implications of implementing time-to-antibiotic goals at the point of antibiotic initiation in clinical practice, as well as the potential downstream impacts of these goals on antibiotic de-escalation.

The rationale notes that antimicrobial exposure is linked to the development of antimicrobial resistance and efforts to reduce both the number of antibiotics administered and their spectrum.

Timing and adequacy of antimicrobial therapy

Three hundred and seventy (36.6%) patients received antimicrobials within 1 hour of the onset of organ dysfunction; among these, 186 (18.4%) patients received antimicrobials in the first hour and 184 patients (18.2%) received antimicrobials prior to onset of organ dysfunction. Six hundred and forty-one (63.3%) patients received their first AT more than 1 hour after onset of organ dysfunction (Figure 1). Median time to AT was 2.1 (interquartile range: 0.8 to 6) hours in all patients and 2.8 (interquartile range: 1.0 to 2.8) hours for patients that received their AT after development of organ dysfunction. Median times by location where sepsis developed were 2.8 (1 to 7.2) hours in intermediate care wards, 2.7 (1.5 to 5. 2) hours in hospital wards, 2.3 (0.6 to 7.3) hours in ICUs, 2.2 (1.4 to 3.0) hours prehospital, 2.0 (1.0 to 3.5) hours in emergency departments, and 1.1 (0.2 to 4.7) hours in operating theatres. Three hundred and twenty-one patients were admitted to the ICU with septic shock. Median time to AT was 2.1 (1.0 to 5.0) hours in this subgroup. The 28-day mortality was 34.9% in the 186 patients who received AT during the first hour and 36.2% in 641 patients when AT was given more than 1 hour after onset of the first sepsis-related organ dysfunction (P = 0.76). For the subgroup of 370 patients who received AT within 1 hour, 28-day mortality was 32.4% compared with 36.2% for those 641 patients receiving delayed AT (P = 0.227). There was no linear relationship between time to AT and 28-day mortality (Figure 1). There was also no association between time to AT and risk of death within 28 days (OR per hour increase of time to AT: 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0 to 1.0), P = 0.482) in those 849 patients that received their AT after the first organ dysfunction. Considering a mean time to AT of 6.1 (± standard deviation 9.5) hours, the data would allow one to identify an effect OR of 1.02 per hour increase with an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.

Antimicrobials

The 2016 guidelines recommend administering empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials that cover all likely pathogens, including bacteria and potentially viruses/fungi (depending on the risk factors of the patient). The initial empiric antibiotic regimen for patients in septic shock should include at least two antibiotics from different classes (combination therapy) directed toward the most likely pathogens. Treatment should be narrowed once the pathogen and its antimicrobial sensitivities are ascertained or when the patient demonstrates clinical improvement. However, patients with bacteremia, neutropenic sepsis or sepsis without shock do not require combination antibiotic therapy. This is a notable difference from the 2012 recommendation that neutropenic sepsis be treated with empiric combination antimicrobials. The authors note, however, that these recommendations do not preclude the use of multiple antibiotics if the goal is to expand the spectrum of pathogens covered.

With respect to antibiotic duration, combination therapy (either empiric or targets) in patients with septic shock should be de-escalated to monotherapy within a few days if clinical improvement or with evidence of infection resolution. This is slightly different than the 2012 guidelines, which recommend that no more than 3–5 days of empiric combination therapy and de-escalation as soon as the responsible organism and susceptibilities are known. Total treatment duration should be 7–10 days for infections with sepsis or septic shock; however, some patients may warrant a prolonged course if they respond slowly to treatment, do not have source control, have bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus or have immunological deficiencies or fungal/viral infections.

One new recommendation in 2016 is that shorter antibiotic courses are indicated in patients whose sepsis resolves rapidly after source previously, the 2016 authors recommend daily assessments for potential de-escalation of antimicrobials. Failure to normalize procalcitonin levels has recently been shown in a prospective multicenter study to be a significant predictor of mortality. For those who initially appear septic, but do not subsequently have clinical evidence of infection, it can also be used to shorten or discontinue antimicrobial therapy. It is important to note that blood cultures can be negative in up to one-third of all patients suffering from sepsis. Lastly, the campaign does not recommend prophylactic antibiotics for non-infectious inflammatory states such as burns or severe pancreatitis.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics? [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics ≤ 1 hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy ≤ 1 hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain and the severity of illness is lesser, they suggest the diagnosis be clarified before antibiotic therapy is administered to minimize unnecessary antibiotic agent use and unintended harms to the individual and the population. Clarifying steps can include assessing the patient's response to the treatment of noninfectious conditions and comorbidities (e.g. fluids, diuresis, bronchodilators, heart rate control, pain control, opioid antagonists, anticoagulation) and/or obtaining additional diagnostic studies (e.g. cross-sectional imaging, respiratory viral panels) and administering antimicrobial agents only if the concern for infection persists for > 3 hours.

### Does early and appropriate antibiotic administration improve mortality in emergency department patients with severe sepsis or septic shock? [^1125WEa7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe sepsis and septic shock remain significant public health concerns. Appropriate emergency department management includes early recognition, hemodynamic resuscitation, source control, and prompt antibiotic administration. Current international guidelines strongly recommend administration of early and appropriate antibiotics for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Interestingly, a recent Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to provide a similar recommendation on antibiotic administration. The goal of this literature search was to systematically review the available literature on early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy and provide emergency physicians an evidence-based approach to antibiotic therapy for septic patients.

Methods

Four PubMed searches were completed to identify abstracts of relevant interest. We limited studies to those completed in adult humans that were composed in English between 2005 and 2015. Included studies were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective trials, and retrospective cohort studies. These studies were identified by a rigorous search methodology. No review articles, case series, or case reports were included. Predefined criteria were used to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of selected articles as part of a structured review.

Results

A total of 1552 abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. After the review of these studies, 14 were included for formal review. The authors then systematically evaluated each study, which formed the basis for this clinical statement.

Conclusions

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock should receive early and appropriate antibiotics in the emergency department. Patients with septic shock who received appropriate antimicrobial therapy within 1 h of recognition had the greatest benefit in mortality.

### Considerations for empiric antimicrobial therapy in sepsis and septic shock in an era of antimicrobial resistance [^114h6N1R]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with sepsis present across a spectrum of infection sites and severity of illnesses requiring complex decision making at the bedside as to when prompt antibiotics are indicated and which regimen is warranted. Many hemodynamically stable patients with sepsis and low acuity of illness may benefit from further work up before initiating therapy, whereas patients with septic shock warrant emergent broad-spectrum antibiotics. The precise empiric regimen is determined by assessing patient and epidemiological risk factors, likely source of infection based on presenting signs and symptoms, and severity of illness. Hospitals should implement quality improvement measures to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of septic patients and to ensure antibiotics are given to patients in an expedited fashion after antibiotic order.

Two RCTs did not demonstrate mortality benefit, and observational studies suggest mortality may increase after intervals exceeding 3–5 hours from hospital arrival and/or sepsis recognition.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services adopted the Early Management Bundle, Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock (SEP-1) performance measure to the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program in July 2015 to help address the high mortality and high cost associated with sepsis. The SEP-1 performance measure requires, among other critical interventions, timely administration of antibiotics to patients with sepsis or septic shock. The multistakeholder workgroup recognizes the need for SEP-1 but strongly believes that multiple antibiotics listed in the antibiotic tables for SEP-1 are not appropriate and the use of these antibiotics, as called for in the SEP-1 measure, is not in alignment with prudent antimicrobial stewardship. To promote the appropriate use of antimicrobials and combat antimicrobial resistance, the workgroup provides recommendations for appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of sepsis.

### Mortality and antibiotic timing in deep learning-derived Surviving Sepsis Campaign risk groups: a multicenter study [^113w4erq]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multi-center study using prospectively applied data from 34,087 patients, we have two major findings that may help inform timing of antibiotics in patients with potential sepsis. First, we demonstrate that two DL models can objectively partition patients into groups based on their likelihood of having sepsis and likelihood of developing shock. Second, our findings suggest that for many patients with suspected sepsis, administration of antibiotics within the rigid timeframes recommended by the SSC may not improve short term mortality. Our findings are important for several reasons. First, our data show that for patients with possible sepsis (approximately 40% of the cohort), a very small percentage of patients went on to develop sepsis and had minimal change in outcome based on timing of antibiotic therapy. A sizable portion of our study population was identified as having probable sepsis and high risk for developing shock. This patient population, which had high mortality in our study, has been poorly studied and recommendations are currently lacking on how to approach management in this high-risk group. At both the development and validation sites, these patients had significantly higher risk of mortality than patients with low probability of shock, but lower mortality than patients with overt shock. Optimal care and timing of antibiotics in these patients remains unclear; however, recognition of the high-risk of these patients may inform judicious use of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, serial examinations, and other therapies (e.g. fluid resuscitation or potential corticosteroid use). Finally, our data demonstrate that patients with probable sepsis at the development site, regardless of probability of developing shock, mortality was lower if antibiotics were administered before one hour from time of sepsis, supporting current SSC guidelines.

### Adverse effects of delayed antimicrobial treatment and surgical source control in adults with sepsis: results of a planned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized controlled trial [^112Gahru]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. International clinical practice guidelines define sepsis as an emergency, demanding treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. They recommend antimicrobial treatment within 1 h in patients with septic shock or a high likelihood of sepsis, and treatment within 3 h in patients with possible sepsis without shock and persisting concerns of infection. Evidence for the effect of timing of antimicrobial therapy on mortality is contradictive.

It is argued that prompt antimicrobials within the first hours might be warranted for the most severely ill patients with septic shock, only. Therefore, current guidelines reduced the evidence rating for immediate treatment from moderate to low in septic shock and from moderate to very low in sepsis without shock. However, current evidence is based on systematic reviews that comprised numerous studies with several acknowledged methodological flaws. These include usage of routine databases without prospective inclusion of patients with sepsis, non-physiologic definition of time zero — e.g. by emergency triage time or first sepsis-related treatment, not adequately adjusting for confounders, and not investigating treatment effects separately for patients without and with septic shock.

Guidelines also advice as best practice to conduct surgical source control as soon as medically and logistically possible. However, this best practice statement is based on few studies only, mostly conducted among samples of single specific disease entities — like necrotizing fasciitis — and with diverging results.

To overcome these limitations, we analysed a large data set from the prospective cluster-randomized quality improvement MEDUSA trial to assess the impact of timing of antimicrobial therapy and source control on mortality.

Severe sepsis and septic shock are common problems in the emergency department patient population and require expert clinical skill by members of the emergency department team to maximize optimal patient outcomes. Although various guidelines have been developed for the management of these patients, issues around antimicrobial-related considerations in critically ill patients require further evidence-based attention. In this review article, important factors related to patient illness, microorganism, timing of antimicrobial administration, and source control are discussed.

### Delays to antibiotics in the emergency department and risk of mortality in children with sepsis [^1121oCSs]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Although timely antibiotic administration is important to high-quality sepsis care, sepsis resuscitation is complex and requires substantial resources. Despite dedicated quality improvement efforts, consistently achieving recommended antibiotic timing thresholds can be challenging. Prioritizing rapid antibiotic administration at the exclusion of other interventions may not be appropriate for some patients. The Infectious Diseases Society of America task forceopted not to support the 2016 Adult Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines that recommend antibiotic administration within 1 hour of sepsis recognition because of concerns that 1 hour may not allow for effective clinical investigation and may result in unnecessary antibiotic administration. An investigation of a 1-hour sepsis bundle implementation following the New York State mandate found that completion of the entire bundle (obtaining blood cultures, administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a 20 mL/kg IV fluid bolus) within 1 hour was associated with lower risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–0.93), whereas administration of antibiotics in isolation within 1 hour was not (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55–1.12). Similarly, a recently published IPSO interim analysis found that bundle compliant care was associated with significant reduction in mortality. These results suggest that all bundled-care elements are likely important rather than one singular intervention, which is also emphasized in the 2020 Pediatric Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.

### Mortality and antibiotic timing in deep learning-derived Surviving Sepsis Campaign risk groups: a multicenter study [^114p2Vcc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2021, the SSC updated recommendations regarding timing of antibiotic administration based on presence of shock and the likelihood of sepsis. The strongest data supporting administration of empiric antibiotics comes from patients with septic shock. On the other hand, various professional societies have expressed concerns about rigid time frames for initial antimicrobial therapy in patients with possible sepsis who are not in shock, citing concerns of lack of data supporting benefit for 3-hour time frame for antibiotics, increased antibiotic resistance, collateral damage to the host, and development of nosocomial infections. Our findings suggest predictive models can be used to partition patients into risk groups which may inform treatment for those patients with possible sepsis and unlikely to develop without increased risk of death from antibiotic administration outside of the 3-hour recommended timeframe recommended by the SSC. We recognize our findings are associations and unmeasured confounders may impact the mortality findings as a function of timing of antibiotic administration. Recently, Taylor et al. found low mortality in sepsis patients without shock with longer times to antibiotic therapy (mean of 3.2 and 5.5 h for patients with probable and potential sepsis, respectively). A randomized trial conducted in Europe did not find a mortality benefit to the completion of a 1-hour bundle (mean time to antibiotics 40 min) compared to a more lenient approach (mean time to antibiotics 113 min) in patients with suspected sepsis in the ED. Collectively, these recent data and ours highlight the need for additional research in this area and need for more precision care for these patients. Risk assessment tools, like the ones described in this manuscript, may afford providers an objective tool to assess risk and thus guide therapy.

### Mortality and antibiotic timing in deep learning-derived Surviving Sepsis Campaign risk groups: a multicenter study [^111VTxoN]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The current Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines provide recommendations on timing of administering antibiotics in sepsis patients based on probability of sepsis and presence of shock. However, there have been minimal efforts to stratify patients objectively into these groups and describe patient outcomes as a function of antibiotic timing recommendations based on risk stratification using this approach.

Methods

We conducted an observational cohort study using prospectively applied patient data from two large health systems using patient encounters between 2016 and 2024. At the time of clinical suspicion of sepsis, two deep learning (DL) models were used to stratify patients objectively into groups analogous to the SSC risk groups, based on a patient's likelihood of having sepsis and likelihood of developing shock. These risk groups were: (1) shock likely to develop and sepsis probable, (2) shock likely to develop and sepsis possible, (3) shock unlikely to develop and sepsis probable, and (4) shock unlikely to develop and sepsis possible. The primary outcome was short-term mortality, a composite of in-hospital mortality and transition to hospice care, across each risk group.

Results

We identified 34,087 adult patients with potential sepsis. At the development site, risk group mortality rates (%) and median time to antibiotics [IQR] were as follows: (1) 23.2%, 1.7 [1.0–3.1] hours; (2) 17.7%, 3.0 [1.7–6.2] hours; (3) 5.0%, 2.8 [1.5–5.1] hours; and (4) 1.9%, 4.6 [2.7–8.0] hours. Results from the validation site were similar. Mortality rates were similar for patients with possible sepsis unlikely to develop shock regardless of antibiotic administration within 1, 3 or more hours from triage. For patients with probable sepsis at the development site, regardless of risk of shock, mortality was significantly lower if antibiotics were administered within the first hour from triage.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that patients who are at low risk of developing shock and possible sepsis had similar rates of mortality in the 1-hour vs. > 1-hour and 3-hour vs. > 3-hour time to antibiotic administration groups. Thus, a more lenient time to antibiotic administration could allow for more detailed evaluations and judicious administration of antibiotics without impacting patient mortality. Patients with probable sepsis had lower mortality if antibiotics were administered within 1 h from triage, regardless of risk of shock. Additional prospective studies are required to validate these findings and guide optimal antibiotic timing in patients with suspected sepsis.

This recommendation draws from an observational cohort from a planned secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized, multi-center RCT of 4,792 adult ICU patients with sepsis and at least one new organ dysfunction; the primary variables were timing of antimicrobial agent therapy and delay of surgical source control during the first 48 hours after sepsis onset, with a primary endpoint of 28-day mortality. The analysis showed that delays in antimicrobial agent treatment > 8 hours significantly increased mortality, delays significantly increased risk of progression to septic shock, and patients who received antimicrobial agent therapy within the first hour more often had CA-IAI compared with patients receiving delayed therapy.

### Antimicrobial treatment duration in sepsis and serious infections [^115kkPFN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Sepsis mortality has improved following advancements in early recognition and standardized management, including emphasis on early administration of appropriate antimicrobials. However, guidance regarding antimicrobial duration in sepsis is surprisingly limited. Decreased antibiotic exposure is associated with lower rates of de novo resistance development, Clostridioides difficile-associated disease, antibiotic-related toxicities, and health care costs. Consequently, data weighing safety versus adequacy of shorter treatment durations in sepsis would be beneficial. We provide a narrative review of evidence to guide antibiotic duration in sepsis. Evidence is significantly limited by noninferiority trial designs and exclusion of critically ill patients in many trials. Potential challenges to shorter antimicrobial duration in sepsis include inadequate source control, treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms, and pharmacokinetic alterations that predispose to inadequate antimicrobial levels. Additional studies specifically targeting patients with clinical indicators of sepsis are needed to guide measures to safely reduce antimicrobial exposure in this high-risk population while preserving clinical effectiveness.

### Impact of the timeliness of antibiotic therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis and septic shock [^1179S4Jw]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To review the impact of the timeliness of antibiotic therapy on the outcome of patients with sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Open-SIGLE databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials on July 27, 2020 for relevant studies on the timing of antibiotic therapy in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock. The primary outcome measure was all-cause crude or adjusted mortality at reported time points.

Results

We included 35 sepsis studies involving 154,330 patients. Nineteen studies (54%) provided information on the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy in 20,062 patients of whom 16,652 patients (83%) received appropriate antibiotics. Twenty-four studies (68.6%) reported an association between time-to-antibiotics and mortality. Time thresholds associated with patient's outcome varied considerably between studies consisting of a wide range of time cutoffs (1 h, 125 min, 3 h or 6 h) in 14 studies, hourly delays (derived from the analyses of time intervals ranging from to 1 to 24 h) in 8 studies or time-to-antibiotic in 2 studies. Analyses of subsets of studies that focused on patients with septic shock (11 studies, 12,756 patients) or with sepsis (6 studies, 24,281 patients) yielded similar results.

Conclusions

While two-thirds of sepsis studies reported an association between early administration of antibiotic therapy and patient outcome, the time-to-antibitiocs metrics varied significantly across studies and no robust time thresholds emerged.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America position paper: recommended revisions to the national severe sepsis and septic shock early management bundle (SEP-1) sepsis quality measure [^116Nh8HK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) measure has appropriately established sepsis as a national priority. However, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA and five additional endorsing societies) is concerned about SEP-1's potential to drive antibiotic overuse because it does not account for the high rate of sepsis overdiagnosis and encourages aggressive antibiotics for all patients with possible sepsis, regardless of the certainty of diagnosis or severity of illness. IDSA is also concerned that SEP-1's complex "time zero" definition is not evidence-based and is prone to inter-observer variation. In this position paper, IDSA outlines several recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of unintended consequences of SEP-1 while maintaining focus on its evidence-based elements. IDSA's core recommendation is to limit SEP-1 to septic shock, for which the evidence supporting the benefit of immediate antibiotics is greatest. Prompt empiric antibiotics are often appropriate for suspected sepsis without shock, but IDSA believes there is too much heterogeneity and difficulty defining this population, uncertainty about the presence of infection, and insufficient data on the necessity of immediate antibiotics to support a mandatory treatment standard for all patients in this category. IDSA believes guidance on managing possible sepsis without shock is more appropriate for guidelines that can delineate the strengths and limitations of supporting evidence and allow clinicians discretion in applying specific recommendations to individual patients. Removing sepsis without shock from SEP-1 will mitigate the risk of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing for noninfectious syndromes, simplify data abstraction, increase measure reliability, and focus attention on the population most likely to benefit from immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Characteristics and outcomes of culture-negative versus culture-positive severe sepsis [^115JpSNU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications of our study's findings? Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines in an effort to improve outcomes in sepsis, culture-positive or culture-negative. Kumar and colleagues showed that every hour of delay in the administration of effective antibiotics from the onset of septic shock resulted in an increase in mortality. This association occurred even among culture- negative patients, for which antimicrobial therapy was deemed appropriate if they were consistent with national guidelines modified to local flora for the clinical syndrome. In contrast, similar to the majority of studies in the literature, our study defined the administered antibiotics to be inappropriate only if they did not match the in vitro susceptibility of the identified pathogens, that is, only in culture-positive patients. In so doing, we found the mortality rate to be much higher among culture-positive patients who were administered inappropriate antibiotics than culture-negative patients (55.5% versus 35.9%). There was also a trend toward higher mortality among culture-positive patients who received appropriate antibiotics (41.9%) than culture-negative patients. These findings do not invalidate the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommendation, especially since it is impossible to accurately predict one's culture status at presentation. On the clinical front, we echo the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines' advice for cautious consideration of antimicrobial therapy using clinician judgment and available clinical information when cultures are unrevealing. On the research front, we propose that it is time for more in-depth studies of culture-negative sepsis. Such investigations could come in the form of multiplex PCR amplification techniques for the quantification of bacteria, fungi, and viruses to elucidate the false-negative and true-negative rates of cultures, and interventional trials comparing algorithms to escalate, continue, narrow, or cease antibiotics coupled with a search for noninfectious etiologies when pathogens are not detected.

### Recommendations for infection management in patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings [^114RKgiT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Results and recommendations for management of infections in resource-limited settings

There are important differences in the causative pathogens of sepsis and septic shock between resource-rich and resource-limited settings, as well as substantial variation between and within resource-limited settings. Hospital, and especially ICU-related, infections are more likely to be caused by multidrug-resistant organisms and previous antibiotic use is a risk factor for antibiotic resistance. Misdirected initial antibiotic therapy is associated with poor outcome, but there is a paucity of epidemiological data in most low-resourced settings. We recommend empirical antibiotic therapy should cover all expected pathogens and likely resistance patterns (1C) based on locally-acquired epidemiological data as large regional variations exist (ungraded). We recognize that, in settings with a limited range of available antibiotics, this may be challenging. We suggest that research groups in collaboration with stakeholders provide microbiological data from sentinel sites throughout resource-limited settings to guide local empirical antibiotic choices (ungraded).

There is weak evidence from resource-limited settings suggesting that timely administration of antibiotics is beneficial. Observational data suggest that, in many resource-limited settings, the administration of antibiotics to most patients within 1 h of sepsis or septic shock recognition is feasible. Therefore, given biological plausibility and evidence from resource-rich settings, we recommend appropriate antibiotics should be given within the first hour following sepsis or septic shock recognition (1C).

In resource-limited settings, microbiological laboratory facilities are often restricted, but there was evidence from these settings that taking blood cultures was associated with improved outcome in sepsis and septic shock and with improved appropriateness of antibiotics. No studies addressed incremental costs of implementing microbiological capacity, or additional benefits of two sets of blood cultures. We recommend that blood cultures should be taken before the administration of antibiotics in locations where this is possible (1B). Ideally, two sets of blood cultures should be obtained. It is realized that in many hospitals routine blood culture is unfeasible, but a recommendation of expanding microbiological laboratory capacity is beyond the scope of these recommendations (Table 1).

### Temporal trends and hospital variation in time-to-antibiotics among veterans hospitalized with sepsis [^111koGyY]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis, life-threatening organ dysfunction secondary to infection, is a common, costly, and lethal syndrome, affecting more than 1.7 million patients annually in the United States. Sepsis quality improvement initiatives focus on rapid identification and administration of antimicrobials and fluids because there is higher quality evidence supporting these practices. Indeed, faster receipt of antimicrobial therapy has been associated with improved survival, particularly for patients who present with shock.

Over the past 15 years, there has been growing attention to the importance of timely antimicrobial administration in sepsis. The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines included a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour of recognition. Likewise, the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' SEP-1 performance measure and New York state's "Rory's Regulations" both incentivize timely antimicrobial administration. These and other sepsis performance improvement programs have resulted in faster administration of antimicrobials for their target populations, with associated improvements in inpatient sepsis survival over time. However, it is unclear whether antimicrobial timing for sepsis has changed outside of these formal performance incentive programs, and whether temporal trends in time-to-antibiotics have differed across hospitals or among patients who present with more obvious signs of sepsis.

In this study, we examined variation and temporal trends in time to antimicrobials for sepsis in 130 hospitals in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. We hypothesized that time-to-antibiotics has decreased over time, that the magnitude of decrease has been uneven across patient subgroups and hospitals, and that time-to-antibiotics continues to vary across hospitals, even after adjustment for patient characteristics.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 [^114qFyMu]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Some recommendations were ungraded (UG). Recommendations were classified into three groups: 1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; 2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and 3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 hr of recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 hrs of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1C); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients) (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement, as based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 hrs) for patients with early ARDS and a Pao2/Fio2 < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 hrs after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 hrs of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5 to 10 mins (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### The global burden of sepsis: barriers and potential solutions [^113igeWC]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Establish data-driven and context-specific management guidelines

Several groups have published guidelines for the management of sepsis in low-resource settings. Although laudable and an important step forward, these guidelines are largely nonevidence-based for low-resource environments and reflect care in high-resource settings, which may not be available or appropriate. Additionally, many LMICs heavily utilize WHO guidelines for the integrated management of childhood or adult and adolescent illness (IMCI and IMAI). The IMAI guidelines for district clinicians include recommendations on the identification and management of patients with septic shock and respiratory failure without shock. However, the guidelines do not specifically address sepsis management in the absence of shock or respiratory failure, and are largely organized around individual infectious syndromes. Given this approach, many clinicians in areas utilizing the WHO guidelines may not specifically document the presence of sepsis when present, instead focusing on syndromically defined diseases.

The core of any recommendations must focus on the implementation of interventions that are high yield, cost-effective, and readily available in low-resource settings. Additionally, these recommendations must be developed in an iterative process, continually undergoing rigorous evaluation for effectiveness in low-resource settings and being updated as appropriate. Recommendations for or against specific interventions in variably resourced environments should be provided, and management guidelines should include disease-specific recommendations (e.g. for dengue). It is critical to partner with a diverse spectrum of health care providers, public health professionals, and researchers to accomplish this objective, educate front-line staff, and implement recommendations.

Promote creative interventions

Both simple and inventive strategies can help to save many lives from sepsis in low-resource settings and should be encouraged. The absence of ICUs or advanced technologies such as mechanical ventilators or invasive monitoring does not preclude the provision of many important components of sepsis care, such as source control and early appropriate antimicrobials. Implementation of these components can be further augmented by creative approaches to sepsis management such as timely pre-referral rectal administration of antimicrobials in basic health centers or use of intraosseous access for parenteral therapies.

Advocacy

The WHO initiative on maternal and neonatal sepsis and the Global Sepsis Alliance are examples of international initiatives tackling the global burden of sepsis. In addition to increasing awareness and promoting research and education, broader engagement with policymakers and government is required to identify opportunities to improve data collection, care processes, and outcomes.

Surgical Infection Society revised IAI guidelines — timing of antimicrobial therapy: Initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy within one hour, if possible, once a diagnosis of IAI is made in patients presenting with sepsis or septic shock (Grade 2-B), and initiate antimicrobial therapy as soon as feasible in other patients with IAI, taking into account plans for subsequent source control (Grade 2-C). Re-administer an antimicrobial agent within one hour before the start of a source control procedure if two half-lives of the agent have passed at the time the intervention is initiated (Grade 1-B).

### Recommendations for sepsis management in resource-limited settings [^113PqZeu]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide clinicians practicing in resource-limited settings with a framework to improve the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric and adult patients with sepsis.

Methods

The medical literature on sepsis management was reviewed. Specific attention was paid to identify clinical evidence on sepsis management from resource-limited settings.

Results

Recommendations are grouped into acute and post-acute interventions. Acute interventions include liberal fluid resuscitation to achieve adequate tissue perfusion, normal heart rate and arterial blood pressure, use of epinephrine or dopamine for inadequate tissue perfusion despite fluid resuscitation, frequent measurement of arterial blood pressure in hemodynamically unstable patients, administration of hydrocortisone or prednisolone to patients requiring catecholamines, oxygen administration to achieve an oxygen saturation > 90%, semi-recumbent and/or lateral position, non-invasive ventilation for increased work of breathing or hypoxemia despite oxygen therapy, timely administration of adequate antimicrobials, thorough clinical investigation for infectious source identification, fluid/tissue sampling and microbiological work-up, removal, drainage or debridement of the infectious source. Post-acute interventions include regular re-assessment of antimicrobial therapy, administration of antimicrobials for an adequate but not prolonged duration, avoidance of hypoglycemia, pharmacological or mechanical deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, resumption of oral food intake after resuscitation and regaining of consciousness, careful use of opioids and sedatives, early mobilization, and active weaning of invasive support. Specific considerations for malaria, puerperal sepsis and HIV/AIDS patients with sepsis are included.

Conclusion

Only scarce evidence exists for the management of pediatric and adult sepsis in resource-limited settings. The presented recommendations may help to improve sepsis management in middle- and low-income countries.

### The early antibiotic therapy in septic patients – milestone or sticking point? [^114yBDo1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale for early antibiotic therapy

Worldwide, the annual prevalence of sepsis is estimated at 19 million cases. The mortality rates in severe sepsis were reduced to 20% to 30% because of advances in training, recognition, surveillance, monitoring, and rapid initial antibiotic therapy and organ support. The most recent update of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines was published in 2013. A consensus committee provided valuable and clear recommendations on treatment of sepsis and septic shock (Table 1). One of the main focuses is the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Table 2). It is recommended that antimicrobials be administrated within the first hour of recognition of septic shock and severe sepsis without septic shock. Moreover, it is recommended that initial anti-infective therapy include one or more drugs that have activity against all likely pathogens and penetrate in adequate concentrations into the target tissue. The selected antibiotic strategy should anticipate the site of infection, medical and culture history, and local microbial susceptibility results, all in an emergency situation.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114NZQDr]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship in adults with sepsis or septic shock — we suggest daily assessment for de-escalation of antimicrobials over using fixed durations of therapy without daily reassessment for de-escalation (Weak, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy (Weak, very low quality of evidence). Where optimal duration of therapy is unclear, we suggest using procalcitonin AND clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials over clinical evaluation alone (Weak, low quality of evidence).

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management [^114nkjGV]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines published in 2016 provide a revised definition of sepsis: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. The measurement of serum lactate has been incorporated into the latest septic shock definition. The guidelines recommend the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (original and quick versions) as an important tool for early diagnosis. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin and soft tissue infections are the most common sources of sepsis. Pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis. Although many patients with sepsis have fever, the clinical manifestation can be subtle, particularly in older patients and those who are immunocompromised. Initial evaluation of patients with suspected sepsis includes basic laboratory tests, cultures, imaging studies as indicated, and sepsis biomarkers such as procalcitonin and lactate levels. Fluid resuscitation is the priority in early management, including administering an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours. Antimicrobial therapy should also be initiated early. Most research indicates that antimicrobial therapy should be started within three hours of presentation. The latest guidelines recommend starting antimicrobials within one hour, but this is controversial. Vasopressor therapy is indicated if hypotension persists despite fluid administration. Future trials of sepsis management are focusing on improving long-term rates of readmission and death, physical disability, cognitive impairment, and quality of life.

### Real-world implications of updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign antibiotic timing recommendations [^115ELb7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate real-world implications of updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommendations for antibiotic timing.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Twelve hospitals in the Southeastern United States between 2017 and 2021.

Patients

One hundred sixty-six thousand five hundred fifty-nine adult hospitalized patients treated in the emergency department for suspected serious infection.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We determined the number and characteristics of patients affected by updated SSC recommendations for initiation of antibiotics that incorporate a risk- and probability-stratified approach. Using an infection prediction model with a cutoff of 0.5 to classify possible vs. probable infection, we found that 30% of the suspected infection cohort would be classified as shock absent, possible infection and thus eligible for the new 3-hour antibiotic recommendation. In real-world practice, this group had a conservative time to antibiotics (median, 5.5hr; interquartile range [IQR], 3.2–9.8hr) and low mortality (2%). Patients categorized as shock absent, probable infection had a median time to antibiotics of 3.2 hours (IQR, 2.1–5.1hr) and mortality of 3%. Patients categorized as shock present, the probable infection had a median time to antibiotics 2.7 hours (IQR, 1.7–4.6hr) and mortality of 17%, and patients categorized as shock present, the possible infection had a median time to antibiotics 6.9 hours (IQR, 3.5–16.3hr) and mortality of 12%.

Conclusions

These data support recently updated SSC recommendations to align antibiotic timing targets with risk and probability stratifications. Our results provide empirical support that clinicians and hospitals should not be held to 1-hour targets for patients without shock and with only possible sepsis.

### A critical analysis of the literature on time-to-antibiotics in suspected sepsis [^113hQPd4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends immediate antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis and septic shock, ideally within 1 hour of recognition. Immediate antibiotic treatment is lifesaving for some patients, but a substantial fraction of patients initially diagnosed with sepsis have noninfectious conditions. Aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets risk promoting antibiotic overuse and antibiotic-associated harms for this subset of the population. An accurate understanding of the precise relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality for patients with possible sepsis is therefore critical to finding the best balance between assuring immediate antibiotics for those patients who truly need them versus allowing clinicians some time for rapid investigation to minimize the risk of overtreatment and antibiotic-associated harms for patients who are not infected. More than 30 papers have been published assessing the relationship between time-to-antibiotics and outcomes, almost all of which are observational cohort studies. Most report significant associations but all have important limitations. Key limitations include focusing just on the sickest subset of patients (only patients requiring intensive care and/or patients with septic shock), blending together mortality estimates from patients with very long intervals until antibiotics with patients with shorter intervals and reporting a single blended (and thus inflated) estimate for the average increase in mortality associated with each hour until antibiotics, and failure to control for large potential confounders including patients' presenting signs and symptoms and granular measures of comorbidities and severity of illness. In this study, we elaborate on these potential sources of bias and try to distill a better understanding of what the true relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality may be for patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^111Dk1ff]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials — timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock — that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy — not just antibiotic administration — is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.
