what are the ddx for acute heel pain in adults?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for acute heel pain in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical framework and how to organize the differential by anatomic location and acuity. Then, I should verify the most common etiologies and their classic features. Next, I will consider traumatic, neurologic, infectious, neoplastic, and systemic causes that can mimic or complicate the picture. After that, I need to check the key history and examination discriminators that narrow the differential. Finally, I will review when and how to use imaging and outline a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm with red flags and referral triggers.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Acute heel pain in adults is best organized by anatomic location (plantar, posterior, medial/lateral) and by etiologic category (mechanical, traumatic, neurologic, infectious, neoplastic, systemic), because this structure guides both the bedside assessment and the imaging strategy; most heel pain is mechanical, but I need to ensure I do not miss high-morbidity alternatives that can present acutely [^113RJXRe] [^114msJot] [^112PVkqZ].

> I will now examine the most common cause, plantar fasciitis, and verify its classic phenotype. Plantar medial heel pain that is worst with the first steps after rest and improves with gentle activity, with tenderness at the medial calcaneal tubercle and a positive windlass test, is highly suggestive; risk factors include limited ankle dorsiflexion, high BMI, and abrupt increases in weight-bearing activity, and symptoms often persist beyond a year before presentation, so I should confirm these elements on history and exam before labeling it as such [^113eBHGA] [^113XYk32] [^11371qNi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for mimics of plantar heel pain that can present acutely. Calcaneal stress fracture typically follows a load change and produces diffuse, progressive pain with a positive calcaneal squeeze test; radiographs can be initially negative, so if suspicion is high, MRI or bone scan is warranted; plantar fascia rupture can occur spontaneously or after injection and presents with acute severe pain, ecchymosis, and a palpable gap; tarsal tunnel syndrome causes burning or paresthesias and may coexist with plantar fasciitis; Baxter's neuropathy (first branch of the lateral plantar nerve) can mimic plantar fasciitis but often shows focal abductor digiti quinti weakness; heel pad atrophy produces diffuse bruise-like pain in older or obese patients; and plantar fibroma presents as a firm nodularity in the fascia with localized pain [^114oF9ZC] [^115HMEfw] [^112GJPvP] [^1124oQtb] [^114Fvvc7] [^115YtBmW].

> Next, I should review posterior heel pain etiologies. Achilles tendinopathy, whether insertional or midportion, presents with load-related posterior pain and focal tenderness; the arc sign and Royal London Hospital test help localize disease; retrocalcaneal bursitis and Haglund deformity produce pain aggravated by shoe counters and relieved by open-back shoes; I need to ensure I distinguish these from partial or complete Achilles rupture, which presents with acute pain, swelling, a palpable defect, and impaired plantarflexion strength [^115EjuLF] [^111V1mmS] [^114DUXSq] [^1155xXt4].

> Let me consider traumatic etiologies more broadly. Acute calcaneal fractures, often intra-articular, present with diffuse hindfoot pain after a fall from height or motor vehicle trauma; radiographs are first-line, but CT is frequently needed to define joint involvement and plan care; stress fractures, as noted, can be radiographically occult early and require MRI or bone scan for detection; I should confirm mechanism and perform a careful squeeze test to raise suspicion [^114oF9ZC] [^112jbhEq].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook neurologic causes. Tarsal tunnel syndrome can cause medial heel and arch pain with paresthesias; medial calcaneal nerve entrapment or neuroma produces focal plantar pain; sural nerve irritation can contribute to lateral heel symptoms; and proximal radiculopathy from the spine can refer pain to the heel, so I should screen for back pain, sensory changes, and bilateral symptoms that might suggest a proximal source or systemic neuropathy [^112GJPvP] [^116qYbYp] [^111TH51G].

> But wait, what if the pain is driven by infection or malignancy. Heel osteomyelitis or soft-tissue abscess can present with progressive pain, swelling, erythema, and systemic signs; MRI helps define extent and guide drainage; calcaneal tumors are rare but should be considered with persistent, unexplained pain, night pain, or systemic symptoms; I should maintain a low threshold for advanced imaging when red flags are present [^111oGY1o] [^115f7gSq].

> I should confirm the key history discriminators that separate these entities. Onset and tempo matter: first-step pain favors plantar fasciitis, progressively worsening load-related pain suggests stress fracture, and sudden severe pain with a pop raises concern for rupture; location guides the anatomic source; associated features such as burning or paresthesias point to nerve involvement, fever or systemic symptoms suggest infection, and antecedent trauma or fluoroquinolone use shifts pretest probabilities; I need to ask about footwear, activity changes, and comorbidities like diabetes or inflammatory arthritis [^114msJot] [^113RJXRe].

> Next, I should review the physical examination maneuvers that refine the differential. Palpation at the medial calcaneal tubercle supports plantar fasciitis, whereas tenderness at the lateral calcaneal wall supports stress fracture; the windlass test is supportive for plantar fasciitis; the calcaneal squeeze test is sensitive for stress fracture; the arc sign and Royal London Hospital test localize Achilles disease; I should also assess ankle dorsiflexion, foot posture, and the plantar fat pad, and perform a neurovascular exam including Tinel's at the tarsal tunnel when indicated [^113XYk32] [^114oF9ZC] [^115EjuLF] [^116WT4ci].

> Hold on, I should verify the imaging strategy so I do not over-order or under-order tests. For suspected plantar fasciitis, routine radiographs are not indicated initially; if symptoms persist beyond 6 to 12 weeks despite appropriate care, weight-bearing radiographs can be considered to exclude other pathology; if radiographs are negative but suspicion remains for plantar fascia tear, tarsal tunnel syndrome, or Baxter's neuropathy, ultrasound or MRI are appropriate next steps; MRI is the most comprehensive modality for complex or refractory cases; bone scan or MRI is indicated when a stress fracture is suspected and radiographs are non-diagnostic; for posterior heel pain with suspected Achilles rupture, ultrasound can rapidly confirm diagnosis in the acute setting [^113M7Hy9] [^112bkJpC] [^114hgPah] [^114oF9ZC] [^112o9tRo].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm while keeping verification steps in mind. Start with history and exam to localize pain and identify mechanical versus non-mechanical features; if classic for plantar fasciitis, begin tier 1 management and reassess in 6 weeks; if atypical features or failure to improve, obtain radiographs and consider ultrasound or MRI to evaluate for stress fracture, fascia tear, nerve entrapment, or other pathology; if posterior heel pain, distinguish insertional Achilles disease from bursitis/Haglund and use ultrasound to assess for partial tear; if infection or tumor is suspected, proceed directly to MRI and labs; if radicular features or bilateral symptoms are present, evaluate the spine and consider EMG/NCV [^1136matF] [^112bkJpC] [^112GJPvP].

> Finally, I should double-check red flags and referral triggers so I do not delay urgent care. Acute severe pain after trauma with inability to bear weight warrants radiographs and urgent orthopedic evaluation; fever, erythema, or systemic illness with heel pain requires urgent assessment for infection; neurologic deficits, progressive weakness, or saddle anesthesia mandate emergent spine evaluation; failure of 6 to 12 weeks of appropriate conservative care should prompt specialty referral and advanced imaging; and any suggestion of malignancy or atypical systemic disease should trigger expedited workup and referral [^111oGY1o].

Acute heel pain in adults has a **mechanical etiology in most cases** [^113RJXRe], with plantar fasciitis the most common cause [^114Fvvc7], presenting as medial plantar heel pain with first-step pain and tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity [^116jb7EB]. Other frequent causes include Achilles tendinopathy (posterior heel pain with load-related pain) [^1155xXt4], calcaneal stress fracture (diffuse heel pain after increased activity, positive squeeze test) [^114oF9ZC], and retrocalcaneal bursitis/Haglund deformity (posterior pain with shoe pressure) [^114DUXSq]. Less common but critical causes include tarsal tunnel syndrome (burning/numbness) [^112GJPvP], heel pad atrophy (thin fat pad, bruise-like pain) [^114Fvvc7], and acute calcaneal fracture (post-trauma, inability to bear weight) [^114oF9ZC]. Red flags (fever, systemic illness, weight loss, night pain) [^111oGY1o] require urgent evaluation for infection, malignancy, or inflammatory arthritis [^111oGY1o]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with imaging reserved for refractory or atypical cases [^112bkJpC] [^114hgPah].

### Diagnosing heel pain in adults [^114Fvvc7]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of the heel pain. The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes. Tendonitis also may cause heel pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain. Bursae adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain. Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome. Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, bony abnormalities (such as calcaneal stress fracture), or tumor. Heel pain rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.

### The heel complex: anatomy, imaging, pathologic conditions, and treatment [^112PVkqZ]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad but primarily involves abnormalities of the Achilles tendon, calcaneus, and plantar fascia. Achilles tendon disorders include tendinosis, tendinitis, and partial or complete tears. Tendinosis refers to tendon degeneration, while tendinitis is inflammation after acute overload. Untreated tendinosis can progress to partial or complete tears. Tendon disorders can be accompanied by paratenonitis or inflammation of the loose sheath enclosing the tendon. Initial management involves rehabilitation and image-guided procedures. Operative management is reserved for tendon tears and includes direct repair, tendon transfer, and graft reconstruction. The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. The majority of fractures are intra-articular; extra-articular fractures, stress or insufficiency fractures, medial process avulsion, and neuropathic avulsion can also occur. Posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis or Haglund deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and insertional Achilles tendinosis form the characteristic triad of Haglund syndrome. It is initially managed with orthotics and physiotherapy. Operative management aims to correct osseous or soft-tissue derangements. The plantar fascia is a strong fibrous tissue that invests the sole of the foot and contributes to midfoot stability. Inflammation or plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and can be related to overuse or mechanical causes. Acute rupture is less common but can occur in preexisting plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatment includes footwear modification, calf stretches, and percutaneous procedures. The main operative treatment is plantar fasciotomy. Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation within the fascia that can be locally aggressive and is prone to recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

Plantar heel pain — presentation, contributing factors, and evaluation emphasize that the most common cause cited is biomechanical stress of the plantar fascia and its enthesis at the calcaneal tuberosity, with localized nerve entrapment also potentially contributory; patients usually present with pain at initiation of weight bearing that eases after minutes then returns with activity, and evaluation should include targeted history, exclusion of neurologic symptoms, and comprehensive lower-extremity examination including assessment of plantar fat pad quality and height.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management [^114msJot]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of heel pain is extensive, but a mechanical etiology is the most common. The specific anatomic location of the pain can help guide diagnosis. The most common diagnosis is plantar fasciitis, which leads to medial plantar heel pain, especially with the first weight-bearing steps after rest. Other causes of plantar heel pain include calcaneal stress fractures (progressively worsening pain after an increase in activity or change to a harder walking surface), nerve entrapment or neuroma (pain accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness), heel pad syndrome (deep, bruise-like pain in the middle of the heel), and plantar warts. Achilles tendinopathy is a common cause of posterior heel pain; other tendinopathies result in pain localized to the insertion site of the affected tendon. Posterior heel pain can also be attributed to Haglund deformity (a prominence of the calcaneus that may lead to retrocalcaneal bursa inflammation) or Sever disease (calcaneal apophysitis common in children and adolescents). Medial midfoot heel pain, particularly with prolonged weight bearing, may be due to tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve. Sinus tarsi syndrome manifests as lateral midfoot heel pain and a feeling of instability, particularly with increased activity or walking on uneven surfaces.

### Treatment of plantar fasciitis [^112Voj19]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain in adults. The disorder classically presents with pain that is particularly severe with the first few steps taken in the morning. In general, plantar fasciitis is a self-limited condition. However, symptoms usually resolve more quickly when the interval between the onset of symptoms and the onset of treatment is shorter. Many treatment options exist, including rest, stretching, strengthening, change of shoes, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, anti-inflammatory agents and surgery. Usually, plantar fasciitis can be treated successfully by tailoring treatment to an individual's risk factors and preferences.

Plantar heel pain — initial nonoperative management states that initial treatment options may include padding and strapping of the foot, therapeutic orthotic insoles, oral anti-inflammatories, and a corticosteroid injection localized to the area of maximum tenderness; patient-directed treatments appear to be as important as these approaches in resolving symptoms.

### Plantar and medial heel pain: diagnosis and management [^117Fr37P]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Heel pain is commonly encountered in orthopaedic practice. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is critical, but it can be challenging due to the complex regional anatomy. Subacute and chronic plantar and medial heel pain are most frequently the result of repetitive microtrauma or compression of neurologic structures, such as plantar fasciitis, heel pad atrophy, Baxter nerve entrapment, calcaneal stress fracture, and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Most causes of inferior heel pain can be successfully managed nonsurgically. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonsurgical measures. Although corticosteroid injections have a role in the management of select diagnoses, they should be used with caution.

Calcaneal fractures and stress fractures — clinical features and management are outlined as follows: intra-articular fractures involving the subtalar joint result in diffuse pain in the hindfoot that is poorly localized to the heel itself; diagnosis is made by a history of trauma, focal pain upon palpation, and radiographic confirmation of the fracture; treatment may be surgical, although many relatively minor fractures often may occur in older or high-risk individuals for whom nonsurgical management may be the most judicious course; stress fractures of the calcaneus occur as a consequence of repetitive load to the heel, with the most common site of stress fracture immediately posterior and inferior to the posterior facet of the subtalar joint; the physical findings include tenderness to the lateral wall of the calcaneus, swelling and warmth may be present, pain elicited with compression of the calcaneus is highly suspicious of a stress fracture, and frequently the onset of symptoms precedes the radiographic findings, and ancillary measures can assist in early diagnosis, including Technetium bone scans or MRI.

Calcaneal stress fractures and plantar fascia rupture — In patients with heel pain, scans are highly sensitive for stress fractures of the calcaneus, and radiographic features include an area of linear sclerosis corresponding to the fracture site. Treatment is conservative and involves protection and immobilization of the involved foot, and progression to an acute fracture is uncommon. Soft tissue trauma (eg, acute plantar fascia rupture) also can cause heel pain even with negative radiographic and bone scan findings, and plantar fascia rupture has also been reported as a complication of heel corticosteroid injection.

Posterior heel pain — Bursitis/Haglund's pathway outlines a parallel evaluation and stepwise care: Significant history includes acute or chronic posterior heel pain, pain aggravated by shoe pressure, morning pain, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness lateral to Achilles, posterior lateral subcutaneous bony prominence, and ± local inflammation/bursitis. Radiographs demonstrate posterior superior prominence to calcaneus — Haglund's deformity and soft tissue swelling — bursitis. Initial treatment options include patient-directed treatment options (open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics) plus orthoses, accommodative padding, oral antiinflammatories, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker, continuation of initial treatment options, and consideration of injection of bursa are directed; continued lack of improvement leads to surgery with resection Haglund's/bursa or calcaneal osteotomy. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, with a reminder to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — Achilles enthesopathy and tendinopathy conservative care emphasizes load reduction and avoidance of intratendinous steroid. Initial treatment focuses on reduction of pressure to the area (eg, open-back shoes); reduction of tensile stress on the tendo Achilles with heel lifts, orthotic devices, or rocker sole shoes; topical anti-inflammatory agents; and various physical therapy modalities including stretching. Primary treatment with immobilization may be considered in particularly acute cases, although this is more commonly used if the previously described treatments are unsuccessful. Local corticosteroid injections in the Achilles tendon are not recommended, although various transdermal modalities including iontophoresis may be considered. If retrocalcaneal bursitis is present, injection therapy may be used with caution to avoid intratendinous injection. Postinjection reduction of activity and/or immobilization is recommended. EBM conclusions regarding initial or nonsurgical treatment of Achilles enthesopathy and tendinopathy reflect a Level IV level of evidence. Resistant cases should be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon.

Neurologic heel pain — definition, nerve etiologies, and referral: "Neurologic heel pain is defined as pain in the heel as a result of an entrapment or irritation of one or more of the nerves that innervate this region", and "persistent symptoms may yield neurologic-related pathology". Patients "with a history of previous heel surgery or trauma should be highly suspect for neurologic heel pain". Nerves considered include "Posterior tibial (tarsal tunnel syndrome)", "Medial calcaneal (heel neuroma)", "Medial plantar", "Lateral plantar, including branch to abductor digiti minimi", and "Sural, including lateral calcaneal". Proximal processes also apply: heel pain or sensory loss "can also be attributable to more proximal nerve impingement syndromes", and back-to-foot radiation "must be evaluated for radiculopathy secondary to proximal nerve root pathology", with "double-crush syndrome, in which concomitant proximal and distal nerve entrapments may occur simultaneously". When suspected with sensory findings and radiating pain, the text notes "appropriate referral for diagnostic studies and/or assessment by a specialist".

Plantar heel pain initial (tier 1) management — evidence-based medicine (EBM) conclusions cite Padding and strapping of the foot [Grade B recommendation], Therapeutic orthotic insoles [Grade B recommendation], Cortisone injections [Grade B recommendation], and Achilles and plantar fascia stretching [Grade B recommendation]. Initial treatments include regular Achilles and plantar fascia stretching, avoidance of flat shoes and barefoot walking, cryotherapy applied directly to the affected part, over-the-counter arch supports and heel cups, and limitation of extended (high-impact) physical activities, and patients usually have a clinical response within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment; if little or no improvement is noted, the patient should be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon if not already under this specialist's care.

Neurologic heel pain — diagnostics and surgical management are described: Diagnostic studies may include electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pressure specific sensory device (PSSD) test. Most cases of neurologic heel pain are unilateral; however, bilateral cases of entrapment neuropathy causing symptoms have been reported, and in suspected neurologic heel pain, especially in bilateral presentations, an underlying systemic disease must be ruled out. In some instances, a combination of pathologies may occur and surgical management will require intervention at both the area of nerve entrapment and the plantar fascia; EBM conclusions are as follows: intervention at both the area of nerve entrapment and the plantar fascia [Grade B recommendation].

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to perform a physical examination to elicit the following:

- pain on palpation of the tendon and the subjective report of pain in the midportion (2–6 cm above the calcaneal insertion) for diagnosing midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- location of pain on palpation for distinguishing between an insertional or midportion injury and for the differential diagnosis; greater pain on palpation anterior to the tendon than in the tendon itself is suggestive of posterior ankle impingement or os trigonum syndrome; posterior ankle pain differential diagnosis also includes acute Achilles tendon rupture, accessory soleus muscle, sural nerve irritation, fat-pad irritation, and systemic inflammatory disease

- the arc sign - palpation of tendon identifying thickened nodules - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- the Royal London Hospital test - pinching the tendon to identify the most symptomatic location with the foot at rest - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Plantar heel pain second-tier therapy and outcomes — The second tier of the treatment ladder includes continuation of initial options with additional therapies including orthotic devices, night splints to maintain an extended length of the plantar fascia and gastro-soleus complex during sleep, repeat corticosteroid injection or injection of botulinum toxin, a course of physical therapy, and cast immobilization for 4 to 6 weeks or use of a short-leg walking boot to immobilize or offload the foot during activity. In patients with a high body mass index (BMI), a consultation and referral for an appropriate weight-loss program may be considered. Clinical response to this second tier of treatment will usually occur within 2 to 3 months in 85% to 90% of patients; for those who have shown improvement, continuation of tier 1 and tier 2 therapies should be continued until resolution of symptoms, and following a therapeutic regimen as outlined in Pathway 2, 90% to 95% of patients experience resolution of symptoms within 1 year.

### Diagnosis of heel pain [^1166efNw]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common presenting symptom in ambulatory clinics. There are many causes, but a mechanical etiology is most common. Location of pain can be a guide to the proper diagnosis. The most common diagnosis is plantar fasciitis, a condition that leads to medial plantar heel pain, especially with the first weight-bearing steps in the morning and after long periods of rest. Other causes of plantar heel pain include calcaneal stress fracture (progressively worsening pain following an increase in activity level or change to a harder walking surface), nerve entrapment (pain accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness), heel pad syndrome (deep, bruise-like pain in the middle of the heel), neuromas, and plantar warts. Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition that causes posterior heel pain. Other tendinopathies demonstrate pain localized to the insertion site of the affected tendon. Posterior heel pain can also be attributed to a Haglund deformity, a prominence of the calcaneus that may cause bursa inflammation between the calcaneus and Achilles tendon, or to Sever disease, a calcaneal apophysitis in children. Medial midfoot heel pain, particularly with continued weight bearing, may be due to tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve as it courses through the flexor retinaculum, medial calcaneus, posterior talus, and medial malleolus. Sinus tarsi syndrome occurs in the space between the calcaneus, talus, and talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints. The syndrome manifests as lateral midfoot heel pain. Differentiating among causes of heel pain can be accomplished through a patient history and physical examination, with appropriate imaging studies, if indicated.

Criteria for selecting studies

Type of studies

Published RCTs evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention for PHP were considered for inclusion. No language restrictions were imposed. All other designs including quasi-experimental studies, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, editorials and conference abstracts were considered ineligible.

Characteristics of participants

An RCT was included if the participants were clinically diagnosed with PHP with explicit reference to pain on the underside of the heel that was most noticeable on weight-bearing after periods of rest but also worse following prolonged weight bearing. All participants were over the age of 16 years and had experienced symptoms of any duration. RCTs were excluded if participants' PHP was related to fractures, tumours or infections or confounded by other conditions that might be rheumatological, neural, vascular or dermatological in origin.

Types of interventions

Any RCT that investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of an intervention compared with another intervention, placebo, sham or wait and see was included, provided there was a follow-up of at least 2 weeks.

Outcome measures

Studies that reported at least one of the three outcome measures — patient-reported pain, first step pain or foot-related function — were included. Where multiple methods of quantifying the same outcome were reported, the author's main prespecified outcome metric was accepted, or that of the metric with the lower level of effect. This was done to avoid making recommendations based on type 1 error with the rationale that an intervention which results in a meaningful effect size for a given outcome should be consistent irrespective of the measure used.

Short term was defined as 1 week to 3 months, medium term as > 3 and up to 6 months and long term as > 6 months. Where multiple follow-ups within a time window were reported, the outcome at the latest time point within short and medium term, and closest to 1 year for long term was selected.

Clinical Relevance

Currently, there is no standardized ways of early assessing and treating patients with HPI. Lack of well-conducted clinical studies prevents the definition of a shared policy of clinical management and contributes to unjustified heterogeneity in clinical behaviors and patients outcomes.

In particular, clinical evidence is limited to few case series, largely insufficient to guide practice. On the contrary, a number of narrative reviews are available, showing different and sometimes conflicting opinions among experts coming from different specialties, professions, and countries.

Current practice favors a minimally invasive approach to plantar fasciotomy versus extensive open surgical exposures, and in most cases removal of the plantar heel spur does not seem to add to the success of the outcome. In some cases multiple etiologic factors including nerve entrapment may necessitate combining nerve release and plantar fasciotomy, and radiofrequency coblation of the plantar fascia as well as radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoprobe have been advocated more recently as an alternative surgical approach to chronic heel pain.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management… [^111R772m]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

15 Pain usually begins after an increase in weight-bearing activities or after changing to a harder walking surface. The pain initially occurs only with activity, but it can later occur at rest. Swelling or ecchymosis may be noted on examination, with point tenderness at the fracture site. A positive calcaneal squeeze test suggests the diagnosis. 22 Excessive mechanical loading of the muscle, such as with increased running, can cause tendinopathy that leads to posterior heel pain. The pain associated with Achilles tendinopathy is achy, occasionally sharp, and worsens with increased activity or pressure to the area. 13, 22 Fluoroquinolone use has been shown to precipitate Achilles tendinopathy, particularly in older persons.

Effective treatments include activity modification, eccentric exercises, reduction of pressure to the area, deep friction massage, tendon mobilization, and use of analgesic medications and heel lifts or other orthotic devices. 22, 25 Some studies have shown benefit with extracorporeal shock wave therapy 26 and nitroglycerin patches. 27 Kinesiology taping 28 and corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma injections 22, 24 have been found ineffective for Achilles tendinopathy. Injections, particularly with corticosteroids, should be avoided because of the risk of tendon rupture. Severe cases may require surgery. Treatment is aimed at decreasing pressure and inflammation and may include wearing open-heeled shoes, corticosteroid injections, physical therapy, and use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications. 13, 29 In refractory cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the deformity. 13, 29.

18, 33 Treatment is typically conservative and consists of activity modification, corticosteroid injections, biomechanical interventions, and use of oral or topical anti-inflammatory medications, orthotic devices, and neuromodulator medications. Surgery can be considered if conservative measures are ineffective. 17, 18, 33. 34 Treatment includes ice, massage, taping, balance and proprioceptive training, muscle strengthening, corticosteroid injections, and use of anti-inflammatory medications, ankle braces, and orthotics. 1, 34 Surgery is usually required in patients for whom rehabilitation has been ineffective. 34 This article updates previous articles on this topic by Tu and Bytomski.

### Plantar heel pain and plantar fasciitis [^116EfPmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis, causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. Pain associated with the condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? What are the effects of non-conservative treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 162 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 84 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 39 studies and the further review of 45 full articles. Of the 45 full articles evaluated, five systematic reviews and nine RCTs were included at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 30 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for 12 interventions based on information relating to the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid injection alone (both short-term and longer-term effects), corticosteroid injections plus local anaesthetic injection (both short-term and longer-term effects), customised foot orthoses, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel pads and cups, local anaesthetic injection alone, night splints, stretching exercises, surgery, and taping.

We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: casted orthoses (custom-made insoles), corticosteroid injection (alone, or plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel cups, heel pads (alone or with corticosteroid injection), lasers, local anaesthetic injection (alone or with corticosteroid injection), night splints plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, stretching exercises, surgery, taping, and ultrasound.

### Getting to the heel of the problem: plantar fascia lesions [^1121o3PV]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a frequent disabling symptom. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult with a large range of possible diagnoses. Lesions of the plantar fascia form an important group. We present a review describing the common lesions of the plantar fascia, including plantar fasciitis, plantar fascia rupture, plantar fibromatosis, and plantar xanthoma, and illustrate them with appropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging. We also address foreign-body reactions, enthesopathy, and diabetic fascial disease.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^116nYyF7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We synthesised high-quality RCTs, elicited expert clinical reasoning and surveyed patients to produce this BPG. Our work meets the majority of the relevant Agree II criteria, and the high-quality criteria previously reported for guideline development.

The BPG defines a core approach (figure 2) to management which consists of the simple but active, supported self-management interventions of plantar fascia stretchingand taping (labelled 'DO' in the figure) to support the plantar fascia, alongside less well-defined educational interventions (labelled 'DECIDE' in the figure). The interviews with experts gave clear direction that this education should encourage:

individual assessment;
footwear advice to ensure comfort in shoes that allow a small rearfoot to forefoot drop while also considering social acceptability to improve adherence;
load management to break up long periods of static loading or problematically rapid training changes in more athletic populations;
support to address comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (online supplemental file 1);
teaching patients the parameters required to self-monitor the pain response to activity and how to interpret pain with respect to tissue damage in order to allay fears of long-term consequences.

The educational delivery should adopt a realistic tone as recovery may take several weeks or months but stress the positive prognosis, a recommendation that came through strongly in the expert interviews.

The role of ESWT

The systematic review showed ESWT had the best evidence of modalities that have been evaluated. It is typically used for people with non-resolving, persistent symptoms. As ESWT is inferior to stretching for acute symptoms, and based on the clinical reasoning elicitation, ESWT is recommended in the BPG when patients are failing to recover optimally using the core approach (figure 1). ESWT had the best evidence of any adjunctive treatments, and has large combined study cohorts, with minimal documented adverse events, demonstrating positive efficacy in the short term, medium term and long term for most patient-reported outcomes. Focused shock wave is applied so that the peak intensity is deep to the skin thus being targeted directly at the lesion and RCTs showed moderate positive short-term findings on pain of large effect. Radial ESWT results in peak intensity at the surface and showed moderate positive effects, again of large effect at all time points for patient-reported outcomes. When pooled as single arms of multiple studies, effect size magnitude for ESWT is large, with these data informing clinicians about the likely real-world outcome, rather than illustrating comparative effect.

### Acute monoarthritis: diagnosis in adults [^116tBBP3]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute monoarthritis, characterized by pain or swelling in a single joint, is a diagnostic challenge in the primary care setting. Intra-articular conditions typically manifest with reduced active and passive range of motion, whereas patients with periarticular conditions such as tendinitis or bursitis often maintain passive range of motion. When evaluating a patient with acute monoarthritis, it is essential to remember that many polyarthritic processes can initially present in a single joint. A broad differential diagnosis for monoarthritis should include septic arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, trauma, and Lyme arthritis. Of these, septic arthritis is the most urgent and requires prompt intervention. Bacterial culture of the synovial fluid is the most accurate diagnostic test for a septic joint. However, diagnostic accuracy can be increased in the short term by evaluating additional markers such as synovial white blood cell count, synovial lactate, and serum biomarkers. These supplementary tests aid in early decision-making while awaiting bacterial culture results. Osteoarthritis is often clinically diagnosed and may be confirmed with radiography. Gout, the most prevalent crystalline arthropathy, can be diagnosed using specialized calculators, ultrasonography, and dual energy computed tomography. Gout is typically most painful at night or in the early morning. Ultrasonography is useful for identifying effusions in less-visible joints and facilitating precise joint aspiration.

### Simplifying the complicated heel-an emergency imaging approach to calcaneal fractures [^112jbhEq]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The calcaneum is the most inferior and largest tarsal bone and supports the axial load of the weight of the body. Calcaneal fractures formulate 60% of the tarsal fractures and are frequently encountered in almost all trauma centres. It becomes imperative to understand and report calcaneal fractures in a structured fashion for better clinical and treatment outcomes for the patients. Radiologists should be well acquainted with calcaneal fractures and their various classifications and should develop an algorithmic approach for diagnosing and reporting heel fractures.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Calcaneal osteosarcoma: a rare cause of heel pain in the paediatric population [^112UJiAa]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary non-haemopoietic malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents. However, it rarely occurs in the calcaneus with only a few case reports in the literature. We report a case of a 14-year-old boy with calcaneal osteosarcoma, who presented with heel pain followed by swelling. The pain was initially thought to be related to a benign process and treated with analgesics, delaying the diagnosis. We discuss the clinical presentation, the differential diagnosis, multi-imaging and pathological findings of a calcaneal osteosarcoma, its clinical outcome and the importance of early diagnosis to improve outcome.

Unlabelled

This article reviews the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of plantar heel neuroma, an entity that has previously been described and recognized, yet one that we feel warrants further review because of the prevalence of plantar heel pain that does not respond to the usual array of treatments. We feel that neuroma of the medial calcaneal nerve often goes undiagnosed, and may progress to a severely painful condition that requires surgical intervention. In this article, we describe another case of heel neuroma in an otherwise healthy patient with a history of chronic plantar heel pain that was unresponsive to a wide array of nonsurgical treatments.

### Injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults [^1162gKrT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar heel pain, commonly resulting from plantar fasciitis, often results in significant morbidity. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), orthoses, physical therapy, physical agents (e.g. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), laser) and invasive procedures including steroid injections.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Latest search: 27 March 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of plantar heel pain in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, when a random-effects model was considered. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included a total of 39 studies (36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 quasi-RCTs) that involved a total of 2492 adults. Most studies were small (median = 59 participants). Participants' mean ages ranged from 34 years to 59 years. When reported, most participants had heel pain for several months. The trials were usually conducted in outpatient specialty clinics of tertiary care hospitals in 17 countries. Steroid injection was given with a local anaesthetic agent in 34 trials. Follow-up was from one month to over two years. With one exception, trials were assessed at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding, including lack of confirmation of allocation concealment. With two exceptions, we rated the available evidence as very low quality, implying in each case that we are 'very uncertain about the estimate'. The 39 trials covered 18 comparisons, with six of the seven trials with three or four groups providing evidence towards two comparisons. Eight trials (724 participants) compared steroid injection versus placebo or no treatment. Steroid injection may lead to lower heel pain visual analogue scores (VAS) (0 to 100; higher scores = worse pain) in the short-term (< 1 month) (MD -6.38, 95% CI -11.13 to -1.64; 350 participants; 5 studies; I² = 65%; low quality evidence). Based on a minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) of 8 for average heel pain, the 95% CI includes a marginal clinical benefit. This potential benefit was diminished when data were restricted to three placebo-controlled trials. Steroid injection made no difference to average heel pain in the medium-term (1 to 6 months follow-up) (MD -3.47, 95% CI -8.43 to 1.48; 382 participants; 6 studies; I² = 40%; low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence for no effect on function in the medium-term and for an absence of serious adverse events (219 participants, 4 studies). No studies reported on other adverse events, such as post-injection pain, and on return to previous activity. There was very low quality evidence for fewer treatment failures (defined variously as persistent heel pain at 8 weeks, steroid injection at 12 weeks, and unrelieved pain at 6 months) after steroid injection. The available evidence for other comparisons was rated as very low quality. We are therefore very uncertain of the estimates for the relative effects on people with heel pain of steroids compared with other interventions in:1. Tibial nerve block with anaesthetic (2 trials); orthoses (4 trials); oral NSAIDs (2 trials); and intensive physiotherapy (1 trial).2. Physical modalities: ESWT (5 trials); laser (2 trials); and radiation therapy (1 trial).3. Other invasive procedures: locally injectable NSAID (1 trial); platelet-rich plasma injections (5 trials); autologous blood injections (2 trials); botulinum toxin injections (2 trials); cryopreserved human amniotic membrane injection (1 trial); localised peppering with a needle (1 trial); dry needling (1 trial); and mini scalpel needle release (1 trial). We are also uncertain about the estimates from trials testing different techniques of local steroid injection: ultrasonography-guided versus palpation-guided (5 trials); and scintigraphy-guided versus palpation-guided (1 trial). An exploratory analysis involving pooling data from 21 trials reporting on adverse events revealed two ruptures of plantar fascia (reported in 1 trial) and three injection site infections (reported in 2 trials) in 699 participants allocated to steroid injection study arms. Five trials reported a total of 27 participants with less serious short-term adverse events in the 699 participants allocated steroid injection study arms. Reported treatments were analgesia, ice or both. Given the high risk of selective reporting for these outcomes and imprecision, this evidence was rated at very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low quality evidence that local steroid injections compared with placebo or no treatment may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. The available evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was very low quality. Where available, the evidence from comparisons of steroid injections with other interventions used to treat heel pain and of different methods of guiding the injection was also very low quality. Although serious adverse events relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. Further research should focus on establishing the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared with placebo in typical clinical settings, subsequent to a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, aimed to obtain consensus on the priority questions for treating plantar heel pain.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^115vjbus]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

If I tape them and their symptoms decrease and then I can say — okay, I think I can replicate what the tape is doing with either shoes or orthoses. (Expert 13)

There was moderate evidence of large effect that plantar fascia stretching is superior to radial ESWT for first step pain in the short term (SMD: 1.21, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.63)and of medium effect in the medium term (SMD: 0.64, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04) but not in the long term (SMD: −0.04, 95% CI −0.43 to 0.35). The sample was mainly people presenting with acute PHP, and this finding complements expert reasoning well, with there being clear guidance to continue stretching targeting the plantar fascia and related structures in a variety of ways throughout rehabilitation:

They can feel an immediate response, and there seems to be some adaptation to this stretching, but again I would say this is definitely not the cure for this. (Expert 4)

Expert interviews

Interview transcript analysis revealed 6 themes and 30 subthemes. The first two themes concerned diagnosis and patient education (table 2) and particularly influenced the core approach (figure 2), along with the findings on stretching in the 'rehabilitation' theme alongside 'factors underlying management' and 'specific interventions' (online supplemental file 1 — expert reasoning results), which had particular influence on the stepped approach to care (figure 1). 'Perceptions of evidence' (online supplemental file 1) was the final theme and informed the recommendations made concerning application of specific interventions for patients recovering too slowly or not responding at all (figure 1).

Table 2
Qualitative analysis of expert interview data pertaining to diagnosis and patient education

Patient survey

Forty people responded to the online survey with the Framework analysis resulting in one overarching theme of 'patient experience' with eight subthemes (table 3). The quantitative check showed 95% of 266 specific treatment components or descriptions of management approaches mentioned in the patient responses were consistent with the core approach initially derived from the review and expert interviews therefore indicating good agreement between the evidence, experts and patient experience.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^114KHRyv]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The ESWT evidence has some limitations that affected synthesis of related trials. Continuous outcomes that evaluated overall pain, first step pain or function were often reported at baseline but were presented as the overall success rate with regard to heel pain at follow-up. For example, Gerdesmeyer et al and Gollwitzer et al presented first step pain, pain while doing activities and pain after application of a dolorimeter at baseline on a continuous scale. However, at follow-up they reported scores on a dichotomous scale by defining success as > 60% reduction in heel pain from baseline for at least two out of three measures that evaluated pain. While it might be desirable to label participant's outcome as either a 'success' or 'not a success' in response to an intervention, this approach has disadvantages. For example, participants that are close to but on opposite sides of the clinical cut-off point for success are labelled as being categorically different rather than being similar. Our synthesis was strengthened by the effect sizes being large, and the presence of enough adequately powered trials of high quality to determine efficacy. These guide practice where patients are not improving quickly enough or failing to respond to the core intervention (figure 1). High-quality effectiveness studies are warranted, particularly in people with PHP who are not responding to the core approach as the majority of published work has been efficacy studies, and cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated.

### The role of SPECT / CT of foot and ankle in the evaluation of heel pain [^114pG1F1]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common symptom in foot and ankle disorders. Typical heel pain can be assessed according to the patient's history and the location of pain. In some atypical inconclusive cases, bone SPECT/CT is the upcoming imaging modality for the detection of causes of heel pain. We present the case of 57-year-old man with atypical heel pain, plantar and Achilles spurs. SPECT/CT images demonstrated increased bony activity in arthritis of midfoot, not plantar and Achilles spurs. It suggests potential role of SPECT/CT in the evaluation and management of heel pain by showing hidden pathology of foot and ankle.

### Is radiographic evaluation necessary in children with a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis (sever disease)? [^113Tzmk9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease) is most often diagnosed clinically, and radiographic evaluation is believed to be unnecessary by many physicians. To evaluate the need for radiographic evaluation in children with a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis, we determined the frequency of abnormal radiographic findings in a group of patients with this clinical diagnosis.

Methods

Clinical records and radiographs of all children between the age of 4 and 17 years who presented with a chief complaint of heel pain were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with an insidious onset of heel pain were included; those with acute trauma and a diagnosis of Achilles tendinitis were excluded. Radiographs were reviewed by 3 orthopaedists (blinded to the clinical diagnosis) to determine if any radiographic abnormalities were present. Clinical records were reviewed in an attempt to determine what factors, if any, indicated a diagnosis other than calcaneal apophysitis.

Results

Review identified 98 patients (134 feet) with a mean age of 10.8 years who had a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis. Positive radiographic findings (all on lateral radiographs) were identified in 5 patients (5 feet): 3 calcaneal unicameral bone cysts, 1 distal tibial nonossifying fibroma, and 2 calcaneal stress fractures (1 patient had both a calcaneal unicameral bone cysts and a stress fracture in the same foot). The rate of abnormal radiographic findings in the 96 patients was 5.1% (3.75% in the 133 feet).

Conclusions

The abnormal radiographic findings seen in 5.1% of children usually led to more aggressive treatment including close radiographic follow-up or immobilization. No common findings in the history or examination indicated patients who were more likely to have positive radiographs. Despite concern about exposure to ionizing radiation and the cost of medical imaging, routine lateral radiographs appear to be justified for screening of pediatric patients with heel pain. If a diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis is made without obtaining radiographs, a lesion requiring more aggressive treatment could be missed.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

### Determining the feasibility of exercise therapy and activity modification for treating adolescents with heel pain: a study protocol [^117GJkHe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Little is known about the development of Achilles tendon injury during adolescent years. Adolescents with insidious symptoms and pain at the posterior heel are commonly diagnosed as calcaneal apophysitis. Calcaneal apophysitis is caused by repeated pull and strain at the cartilaginous growth plate where the Achilles tendon inserts. The condition affects 3.7 per 1000 adolescents, with the highest prevalence in boys aged 8–15 years and girls 7–13 years. In adults, the same symptoms are clinically diagnosed as Achilles tendinopathy, defined by Achilles tendon pain with loading and loss of function.

Calcaneal apophysitis may be the most common diagnosis for heel pain in adolescents because little evidence for the presence of Achilles tendon injury and the associated tendon structural alterations (tendon thickening, altered mechanical properties) exists in this population. Calcaneal apophysitis is a clinical diagnosis that relies on the patient history of gradual onset of heel pain with activity and the patient's age (< 18 years old) relative to maturity. Radiograph is considered uninformative due to the appearance of a separated apophysial plate, which is seen in all skeletally immature children. Therefore, a radiograph is rarely used to confirm the diagnosis. Without imaging to confirm the diagnosis, the main distinction between a diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis or Achilles tendinopathy is patient age and pain location. Considering chronological age and biological development are not equivalent, it is plausible that Achilles tendon injury masquerades as calcaneal apophysitis in some adolescents. The lack of description regarding pain location in studies may also contribute to the historic disregard of Achilles tendon involvement in adolescents. Few studies have used ultrasound imaging when evaluating adolescent patients with heel paindespite the frequent use of ultrasound for adults with tendon injuries. Determining the presence of Achilles tendon pain and/or altered tendon structure in adolescents diagnosed with calcaneal apophysitis is a critical concern considering that injury to either structure may prompt different treatment approaches.

### A 40-year-old woman with pain in the chest, hands, and feet [^11475MKg]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Figure 8
Treatment of plantar heel pain in three steps according to the 2010 CPG Heel Pain Committee of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons guidelines. ESWT, extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

The 2014 guidelines show a model that guides clinical decisions on the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment planning for individuals with heel pain/plantar fasciitis: in the diagnosis, the ICD category of plantar fasciitis and the associated International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health impairment-based category of heel pain should be used. Clinicians should assess for diagnostic classifications other than heel pain/plantar fasciitis, including spondyloarthritis, fat pad atrophy and proximal plantar fibroma, when the individual's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or when the individual's symptoms do not resolve with interventions aimed at normalisation of body function.

As regards therapy, Karl B Landorf, in a review of literature, reported the following: customised foot orthoses are more effective than sham orthoses in improving functions up to 12 months in people with plantar heel pain, but with less effect in reducing pain; heel pads and heel cups are effective but lack randomised studies; taping may be more effective than no taping or sham taping in reducing pain in the short term (at 1 week); stretching exercises are more effective than no treatment or taping in reducing pain or improving function in people, but the evidence is weak and inconsistent; EWST may be more effective than placebo in reducing pain at 12 weeks in people with chronic heel pain, but there is a need for more randomised controlled trials; and corticosteroid injections may be associated with a high rate of plantar fascia rupture and other complications, which may lead to chronic disability in some people.

Data synthesis

For studies reporting continuous data, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMD), irrespective of whether the outcomes were similar or different but ensuring only outcomes of a similar construct were combined. Effect sizes were set as 0.20–0.49 being small, 0.50–0.79 as medium and 0.80 or above as large. Final scores at each follow-up period were evaluated in preference to mean or median change from baseline values, unless only change scores were availableas the use of follow-up scores is more conservative and are less likely to find significant results. For studies reporting dichotomous data, to represent treatment success, ORs were calculated. For studies that included three or more active treatment arms, and reported continuous outcomes, the active arms were combined and compared with the control group, to avoid a unit of analysis error, using accepted methods according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Comparable studies, reporting continuous data, were pooled using an inverse variance weighting method within a random-effects model. For dichotomous outcome variables, the Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate an association between a treatment and outcome. The χ² test and I² statistic were used to evaluate statistical heterogeneity. Finally, to evaluate the overall outcome of an intervention of proven efficacy, individual studies that evaluated a specific intervention were combined to determine the size of within-group changes.

Semi-structured interviews with international experts

Participants

International experts, defined as having a minimum of 5 years of experience in a given setting and specialty in which they regularly encountered significant numbers of people with PHP and who were actively involved in PHP research, were purposively recruited. Experts were identified by the authors through recommendations of researchers that publish in the field of PHP and snowball sampling. All experts were invited to participate via email.

In total, 14 expert clinicians (6 from Australia, 3 from Denmark, 2 from the UK, 2 from the USA and 1 from Canada) were recruited and interviewed, of which 7 were physiotherapists, 6 were podiatrists (including 2 podiatric surgeons) and 1 was a rheumatologist. Experts had a mean monthly exposure to 9 patients with PHP per month and had published an average of 51 publications (online supplemental file 1).

### Everything achilles: knowledge update and current concepts in management: AAOS exhibit selection [^114wKuZL]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon pathology is common and affects athletes and nonathletes alike. The cause is multifactorial and controversial, involving biological, anatomical, and mechanical factors. A variety of conditions characterized by Achilles tendon inflammation and/or degeneration can be clinically and histologically differentiated. These include insertional Achilles tendinopathy, retrocalcaneal bursitis, Achilles paratenonitis, Achilles tendinosis, and Achilles paratenonitis with tendinosis. The mainstay of treatment for all of these diagnoses is nonoperative. There is a large body of evidence addressing treatment of acute and chronic Achilles tendon ruptures; however, controversy remains.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, APTA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider using a subjective report of pain located 2–6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion that began gradually and pain with palpation of the midportion of the tendon, in addition to the arc sign and Royal London Hospital test, for the diagnosis of midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Posterior ankle pain — differential diagnosis when findings are inconsistent with midportion Achilles tendinopathy: Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than midportion Achilles tendinopathy when the patient's reported activity limitations or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with guideline sections or when symptoms are not resolving with interventions aimed at normalization of impairments of body function. The following conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with nontraumatic posterior ankle pain: partial tear of the Achilles tendon; retrocalcaneal or subcutaneous bursitis; posterior ankle impingement; irritation or neuroma of the sural nerve; and tibial or calcaneal stress fractures.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^112jihv8]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Several pathologies involving structures other than the PF may mimic PF disease and should be included in the differential diagnosis. Achilles tendinopathy may present with symptoms that are similar to those of plantar fasciitis. This may be related to the close anatomic connection between the PF and the paratenon of the Achilles tendon. Thus, both the Achilles tendon and PF should be carefully evaluated using ultrasound or MRI. Further, if MRI reveals marked bone marrow oedema at the calcaneal origin of the PF in patients with plantar fasciitis, a concomitant enthesopathy of the Achilles tendon should be suspected. The presence of plantar calcaneal spurs should also be assessed. Spur genesis has traditionally been attributed to chronic traction of the PF and repetitive microtrauma, which in turn lead to periostitis and calcification. The role of vertical compression of the heel in spur formation has recently been hypothesised and related to older age, osteoarthritis and obesity. As stated above, calcaneal spurs are not specific for plantar fasciitis and are often identified in asymptomatic individuals; however, a strong association between spurs and chronic plantar heel pain has been demonstrated, specifically in cases of concurrent fat pad abnormalities. Finally, entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's neuropathy), stress fractures of the calcaneus, vascular disease and heel fat pad atrophy and necrosis may present with nonspecific heel pain and represent all differential diagnoses of PF disease.

In conclusion, PF disorders are common causes of heel pain and disability in the general population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries. As an inexpensive, quick and dynamic imaging technique that also provides high-resolution depiction of the PF and comparison with the contralateral side, ultrasound should be considered the modality of first choice for assessing PF disorders. Several indirect findings of PF disorders can be detected on conventional radiographs and should be identified even in patients examined for other reasons. MRI can reliably delineate both the soft tissue and bone anatomy of the sole of the foot and enables correct diagnosis of PF disorders, but is expensive and should be regarded as a second-line imaging modality.
