## Question

Can administering propranolol after acute trauma reduce the risk of developing PTSD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether administering propranolol in the immediate aftermath of acute trauma reduces the risk of developing post‑traumatic stress disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the question as universal or secondary prevention and define the population and timing after trauma. Then, I should verify the neurobiologic rationale for β‑adrenergic blockade and whether it plausibly disrupts consolidation of traumatic memories. Next, I will review guideline recommendations, followed by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and then examine individual studies and their methodological constraints. Finally, I need to synthesize the evidence into a practical, risk‑benefit guidance with safety checks and note any promising alternative strategies such as early trauma‑focused psychotherapy or other pharmacologic candidates.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework so I do not mix prevention with treatment, because that error can quickly derail conclusions and recommendations. This is a universal or secondary prevention question about giving a medication to trauma‑exposed individuals in the hours to days after exposure to reduce later PTSD incidence or severity, not augmentation of psychotherapy in established PTSD nor post‑retrieval reconsolidation protocols for chronic PTSD, and I should keep those distinct to avoid conflating different mechanisms and evidence bases.

> Now, I will examine the biological rationale to see if the hypothesis is even coherent before chasing clinical data. Traumatic memory consolidation is facilitated by locus coeruleus noradrenergic signaling, with β‑receptors in the basolateral amygdala playing a key role in enhancing salience and long‑term storage, and propranolol is a lipophilic, nonselective β‑blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier and reduces amygdala reactivity in humans, which makes it theoretically attractive for dampening consolidation of trauma‑linked cues if delivered in the right window [^117TxqFv] [^112h88F7]. Wait, let me verify the timing constraint here, because if the pharmacokinetics do not align with the memory consolidation window, the rationale might not translate clinically despite being mechanistically plausible.

> Next, I should review clinical practice guidelines to anchor the evidence hierarchy before diving into individual trials, since guidelines synthesize methodologically diverse data with explicit grading. The 2023 VA/DoD PTSD/ASD guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against pharmacotherapy, including β‑blockers such as propranolol, in the immediate post‑trauma period to prevent PTSD, and they similarly find insufficient evidence for pharmacologic prevention in patients with acute stress reactions or acute stress disorder, while recommending consideration of trauma‑focused cognitive behavioral psychotherapy when ASD is diagnosed, which I should not overlook in practice [^112cMhQo]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I almost took "insufficient evidence" to mean "it does not work", but technically it means the data do not support a recommendation for routine use at this time, which is a subtle but important distinction for shared decision‑making and research directions [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq].

> I will now examine meta-analyses and systematic reviews, since they provide pooled estimates and often clarify heterogeneity and bias that single studies cannot, which should help me verify whether any signal exists for prophylactic propranolol. A 2018 review of preventive traumatic memory interventions found that across five propranolol studies started in emergency settings, there was no overall reduction in PTSD symptom severity, with notable practical barriers including 60–90 minute absorption that likely missed the consolidation "golden hours" in many protocols and recruitment shortfalls that underpowered trials, which is a key feasibility constraint I need to factor in. A 2015 Lancet Psychiatry review concluded that across early pharmacotherapy trials within one month post‑trauma, no firm evidence supported prevention when limited to randomized controlled trials, with hydrocortisone showing the most promising signal while propranolol did not, which tempers enthusiasm for β‑blockade as universal prevention. A 2022 meta‑analysis of propranolol's traumatic memory disruption showed no beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms overall, despite small physiologic changes such as reduced heart rate during recall, underscoring that clinical outcomes remain unproven in prevention contexts.

> But wait, what if specific experimental paradigms or subgroups show benefit that broad meta‑analyses wash out, and could that guide more targeted prevention designs? In a trauma‑film paradigm in healthy women, single‑dose propranolol immediately post‑exposure reduced intrusive memories by about 42 percent over a week without altering voluntary narrative recall, suggesting the mechanism can manifest in controlled conditions, although this is not real‑world trauma and thus is hypothesis‑generating rather than practice‑changing for emergency care [^115iDQum]. Conversely, a retrospective cohort of burned service members showed no difference in PTSD prevalence with propranolol exposure, and a small peri‑cardiac‑surgery observational study suggested a sex‑specific protective effect of β‑blockade in women, but both designs are confounded and not generalizable to civilian trauma in emergency settings, so I should not over‑interpret them against higher‑level syntheses [^112otrw8] [^115yBiSf]. I should double‑check that I am not mixing fMRI biomarker effects with clinical endpoints; propranolol reliably dampens amygdala reactivity, but that does not guarantee prevention of PTSD in heterogeneous, real‑world trauma [^117TxqFv].

> Let me consider recurrent methodological barriers that might explain why a mechanistically plausible strategy keeps failing to deliver in clinical prevention trials, as these constraints matter for any practical recommendation I make [^113esdFU]. Propranolol's oral absorption takes 60–90 minutes, which is often misaligned with the first hours after trauma when consolidation occurs, and emergency workflows rarely allow tight dosing windows, thereby limiting brain levels during the critical period, and many studies were underpowered due to recruitment constraints in chaotic emergency settings, making false‑negative results more likely but also highlighting feasibility barriers to implementation [^113esdFU] [^113MD7wq]. Risk of bias, small sample sizes, uncertain blinding, and attrition further weaken inferences in related β‑blocker trauma literature, which I need to acknowledge when weighing potential off‑label use outside of trials [^115QHXij] [^116Mg7j7]. Population heterogeneity by sex, trauma type, and prior psychiatric history probably moderates effects, but most studies lack stratification or precision phenotyping, which reduces the chance of detecting subgroup benefits even if they exist [^115Hwk2r].

> Hold on, I should contextualize propranolol against other early pharmacologic signals, so I do not anchor on a single mechanism when the field might point elsewhere [^115f8Tx3]. Observational data from combat injury care suggested early morphine was associated with lower later PTSD risk, which hints that aggressive analgesia and perhaps opioid receptor mechanisms may influence traumatic memory consolidation and peri‑traumatic distress, though confounding remains a concern given the nonrandomized design even in a high‑quality registry study [^11636iWr]. Small randomized hydrocortisone trials shortly after trauma reported substantially lower PTSD rates in selected populations, proposing HPA‑axis modulation as a more promising biologic target than β‑blockade for prevention, although replication, dosing, and safety boundaries still need clarification before routine use [^112h88F7]. I need to check benzodiazepines as well, because in acute coronary syndrome and other trauma contexts they have been associated with higher subsequent PTSS or PTSD, which cautions against their routine use for acute distress if prevention is the aim [^111Ps1qM] [^113FRwMe].

> I should confirm safety and practical considerations for propranolol, because even if a clinician were to contemplate off‑label prevention, patient safety and contraindications would drive decision‑making in emergency environments [^116MQuxa]. Propranolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and can mask hypoglycemia, and overdose management is nontrivial, with specific rescue agents such as glucagon sometimes required, all of which present additional risks for trauma patients who may be hemodynamically labile or have occult injuries, asthma, or diabetes, so I need to ensure these risks are weighed against an unproven preventive benefit [^116MQuxa] [^113Yhy3Y]. Given the pharmacokinetic delay and the narrow consolidation window, even optimal dosing in a busy emergency department may not achieve the theoretical CNS targets in time, which further erodes the risk‑benefit calculus for routine prophylaxis [^113esdFU].

> Wait, I almost conflated post‑retrieval reconsolidation blockade in established PTSD with immediate post‑trauma prevention, and I should explicitly separate them so the recommendation is precise [^115wBjyp]. In chronic PTSD, propranolol given with traumatic memory reactivation shows mixed and often negative effects on symptoms or psychophysiology, with small trials and meta‑analyses failing to demonstrate robust clinical benefits, although isolated physiologic or neuroimaging changes have been reported, so these data do not justify using propranolol for universal prevention right after trauma exposure [^113FRwMe] [^114wiVxZ] [^113B3LGy] [^116vcyra]. I should confirm that guidelines for established PTSD continue to prioritize trauma‑focused psychotherapies and certain antidepressants rather than anti‑adrenergics for core symptoms, reinforcing that β‑blockade has not earned a frontline role even in treatment, let alone prevention [^116qJmRp] [^1115cUhZ].

> Synthesis for clinical practice: considering guideline statements, pooled evidence, feasibility barriers, and safety, I do not recommend routine propranolol administration after trauma to prevent PTSD in general trauma populations outside of clinical trials, and I should communicate this clearly while offering evidence‑based alternatives for early care [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq]. Instead, I should ensure rapid pain control, avoid routine benzodiazepines for acute distress when prevention is a goal, screen for acute stress disorder, and offer or arrange early trauma‑focused cognitive behavioral psychotherapy for those meeting ASD criteria, while monitoring emerging data on alternative biologic strategies such as hydrocortisone within carefully selected, protocolized settings [^112cMhQo] [^111Ps1qM] [^112h88F7]. If a research protocol considers propranolol, timing within hours, hemodynamic stability, pulmonary status, diabetes risk, and informed consent about uncertain benefit and known risks must be verified, or else the intervention may be more likely to cause harm or fail to reach mechanistic targets [^116MQuxa] [^113esdFU].

> Bottom line, after double‑checking the totality of evidence and correcting for my initial temptation to over‑generalize from mechanistic and experimental models, propranolol has a coherent neurobiologic rationale but insufficient and inconsistent clinical evidence for preventing PTSD when given after acute trauma, so it should not be used routinely for this purpose outside trials, whereas timely identification and treatment of acute stress reactions with trauma‑focused psychotherapy remains the recommended pathway for prevention in current guidelines [^113esdFU] [^115f8Tx3] [^112Fns4V] [^112KzRee] [^112cMhQo].

---

Propranolol is not recommended after acute trauma to prevent PTSD because evidence is insufficient [^115wBjyp] [^115f8Tx3] and guidelines advise against routine use [^111wkPXq] [^112KzRee]. Early propranolol does not reliably reduce PTSD incidence or severity, and any effects are small and inconsistent [^113esdFU] [^112Fns4V] [^111weNsc]. Current VA/DoD guidelines state there is insufficient evidence [^111wkPXq] to recommend propranolol or any pharmacotherapy for PTSD prevention after trauma [^112KzRee]. Propranolol may be considered only in research settings or select high-risk cases with careful monitoring, and trauma-focused CBT remains the preferred early intervention [^112cMhQo] [^113xZVCC].

---

## Mechanism of action and theoretical rationale

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier [^116MQuxa] and reduces central noradrenergic activity, a pathway implicated in fear conditioning and emotional memory consolidation [^115TrQDS]. The rationale for post-trauma use is its potential to disrupt memory consolidation and reconsolidation [^117D3DGC], thereby reducing the emotional intensity and physiological arousal associated with traumatic memories [^115TrQDS] [^117TxqFv].

## Clinical evidence for propranolol in PTSD prevention

Several studies have evaluated early propranolol after trauma to prevent PTSD, and results have been mixed and generally inconclusive:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: A meta-analysis of seven studies found no significant beneficial effect of propranolol on PTSD symptoms or physiological responses, although a modest reduction in heart rate during trauma recall was observed [^112Fns4V] [^115f8Tx3].

- **Early administration studies**: Studies administering propranolol within hours of trauma exposure have generally failed to demonstrate significant reductions in PTSD incidence or severity [^113esdFU] [^115wBjyp].

- **Reconsolidation blockade studies**: While some studies have shown reduced physiological responses during trauma recall, these effects have not consistently translated into clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms [^113B3LGy] [^112Fns4V] [^114wiVxZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines, including those from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD), state there is insufficient evidence to recommend propranolol or any pharmacologic intervention for PTSD prevention after acute trauma [^111wkPXq] [^112KzRee]. They emphasize the need for further research and caution against routine use.

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Propranolol is generally well tolerated but carries potential risks, particularly in trauma patients with underlying medical conditions [^116MQuxa]:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Bradycardia, hypotension, and potential cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve [^116MQuxa].

- **Respiratory effects**: Bronchospasm, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^116MQuxa].

- **Central nervous system effects**: Fatigue, dizziness, and sleep disturbances [^116MQuxa].

Given these risks, careful patient selection and monitoring are essential if propranolol is considered.

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological interventions

Other pharmacologic agents, such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants, have also been studied for PTSD prevention. Benzodiazepines have been associated with an increased risk of PTSD and are not recommended [^111Ps1qM] [^111bHSDp]. Antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) are recommended for established PTSD treatment, not for prevention [^116qJmRp] [^115f8Tx3].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Despite the theoretical rationale, significant research gaps remain:

- **Optimal dosing and timing**: The effective dose and timing of propranolol administration remain unclear [^113esdFU].

- **Patient selection**: Identifying individuals who may benefit from propranolol prophylaxis is not well-established [^115m2J2t].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Long-term efficacy and safety data are limited [^115wBjyp].

Future research should prioritize well-designed randomized controlled trials to address these gaps and clarify the potential role of propranolol in PTSD prevention [^115wBjyp].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, current evidence does not support routine use of propranolol after acute trauma to prevent PTSD, and guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend propranolol or any pharmacologic intervention for this purpose [^115wBjyp] [^112KzRee]. Propranolol may be considered in specific high-risk cases or research settings, but careful patient selection and monitoring are essential. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remains the preferred early intervention for individuals exposed to traumatic events [^112cMhQo] [^113xZVCC].

### Memory and forgetting [^113esdFU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

- **Preventive and treatment interventions aimed at traumatic memories**: Based on the idea that overconsolidation of the traumatic memory is causally involved in PTSD, several studies have attempted to block consolidation by giving the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol to patients admitted to the emergency room in the hours immediately following a traumatic event. A meta-analytic review of five studies failed to demonstrate an overall effect on reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms. Despite these negative results, it is important to note that propranolol is not fully absorbed for 60–90 minutes and that most studies did not succeed in achieving adequate propranolol concentrations within the 6-hour window within which most consolidation is thought to occur. The studies also faced considerable difficulties in recruitment. Thus, although the proposed mechanism has not yet been fully tested, practical considerations mean that this intervention is unlikely to make a substantial impact in practice.

- **An alternative to pharmacological intervention**: This involves the use of competing tasks that are hypothesized to interfere with the consolidation of the sensory aspects of the trauma memories. A recent study compared a trauma reminder followed by 20 minutes of playing a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris) to an attention-placebo control in patients admitted to an emergency department within six hours of a motor vehicle accident. Patients who played Tetris reported finding this easy and helpful. They experienced fewer intrusive trauma memories in the subsequent weeks.

### Effects of propranolol on the modification of trauma memory reconsolidation in PTSD patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Fns4V]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops after exposure to a life-threatening event and is characterized by intrusive memories. According to memory reconsolidation theory, retrieval of memory under certain conditions leads to its labilization and subsequent re-storage, which could be disrupted by drugs. Propranolol has been the most commonly investigated drug for memory reconsolidation therapy in clinical trials. Intervention with propranolol has shown mixed results in PTSD patients, with some studies showing improvement in symptoms, while others fail to replicate these findings.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of trauma memory disruption by propranolol on PTSD symptoms and physiological responses in PTSD patients. A total of 3,224 publications were assessed for eligibility. Seven studies on the effects of propranolol on PTSD symptoms and three studies on the effects of propranolol on physiological responses were incorporated into the meta-analyses. Overall, results indicate that propranolol did not show a beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms (standardized mean difference: 1.29; 95% CI = -2.16–0.17). Similarly, propranolol did not influence skin conductance (standardized mean difference: 0.77; 95% CI = -1.85–0.31) or EMG response (standardized mean difference: 0.16; 95% CI = -0.65–0.33). However, propranolol significantly reduced heart rate after trauma memory recall compared to placebo (standardized mean difference: 0.67; 95% CI = -1.27 to -0.07). This study finds a lack of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol on traumatic memory disruption.

### Human amygdala reactivity is diminished by the β-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol [^117TxqFv]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Animal models of anxiety disorders emphasize the crucial role of locus ceruleus-noradrenergic (norepinephrine, NE) signaling, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and their interactions in the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses to stress. Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a β-noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder, preclinical evidence for a β-noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing.

- **Method**: We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers with probabilistic mapping of intra-amygdalar responses to fearful, neutral, and happy facial expressions to test the hypothesis that a β-noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol would inactivate the BLA.

- **Results**: Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions, independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of β-noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry. Moreover, our findings add to emerging evidence that NE modulates both the reactivity (sensitivity) and the operating characteristics (specificity) of the BLA via β-noradrenergic receptors.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^113MD7wq]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Most preventive studies at the time of writing are theory-informed. The main theoretical models of PTSD pathogenesis link each model with specific interventions. A progression exists from genetics and epigenetic vulnerability factors, and childhood experience to peri-traumatic distress, leading to specific pathogenic mechanisms during trauma exposure and its aftermath. These mechanisms include psychological aspects (such as trauma appraisal and recovery environment) and putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD pathogenesis. The review focuses on secondary and tertiary prevention, targeting the progression of psychopathology following a traumatic event.

- **Interventions targeting progression elements**: Interventions are associated with elements such as fear conditioning, emotion processing, and initial neuroendocrine response. Timing and opportunity windows are crucial for affecting relevant pathogenic mechanisms. For example, trauma memories may consolidate within hours of trauma or during the first night's sleep. Thus, interventions designed to disrupt initial memory consolidation (pharmacological or psychological) must be provided within this timeframe.

Other mechanisms in post-traumatic psychopathology, such as changes in memory, context processing, and nociceptive circuits, may occur within an unmapped timeframe, necessitating time-dependent intervention delivery.

### Psychopharmacological strategies in the management of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): What have we learned [^1176CzbC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). High credibility.

There have been significant advancements in the pharmacologic management of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the past two decades. Multisite randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have noted the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for PTSD treatment. Unfortunately, there have been no new medications approved to treat PTSD in the past 10 years. Although there have been exciting new findings in our knowledge of the neurobiology of PTSD, clinical trials testing new medications have lagged. This review summarizes recent research that builds on the unique pathophysiology of PTSD and suggests ways to move the field forward.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: A retrospective cohort study [^111jkedP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Regular use of RAS blockers was associated with a lower risk of probable PTSD following a mean follow-up of 7.5 years among middle-aged adults under antihypertensive treatment. The findings of this study may have implications for the choice of antihypertensive medications for the primary prevention of PTSD. This added benefit of RAS blockers should be considered in the selection of antihypertensive treatment, particularly for people at risk of trauma exposure and/or developing PTSD.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^113FRwMe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

We further found that, in contrast to benzodiazepine exposure during ACS, exposure to morphine and β‐blockers and use of antidepressants was not significantly associated with the development of PTSS. This is consistent with available evidence from randomized controlled trials on early pharmacotherapy in survivors of noncardiac trauma. However, such studies are rare, precluding meta-analysis on the effects of morphine, which reduced PTSD incidence in civilian and military patients, but may delay the onset of action of oral antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS.

In addition, only propranolol was tested, a lipophilic and nonselective β‐blocker able to cross the blood-brain barrier and block traumatic memory consolidation, but not administered during ACS. Interestingly, metoprolol, which is also lipophilic but a selective β1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, was suggested to have fear-reducing properties after trauma. In a previous study, patients exposed to β‐blockers during emergency department evaluation for ACS had less severe PTSS at 1 month, although not the subgroup with confirmed ACS, and unfortunately, the types of β‐blockers used were unknown.

Previous trials with escitalopram were not prevention, but early treatment trials, and our patients were taking antidepressants before MI, indicating the vulnerable health of this small subgroup. Specifically, the use of antidepressants was associated with a history of lifetime depression, poorer self-rated health, and negative mood.

### Morphine use after combat injury in Iraq and post-traumatic stress disorder [^11636iWr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common adverse mental health outcome among seriously injured civilians and military personnel who are survivors of trauma. Pharmacotherapy following serious physical injury or exposure to traumatic events may be effective for the secondary prevention of PTSD.

- **Methods**: We identified 696 injured U.S. military personnel without serious traumatic brain injury from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database. Complete data on medications administered were available for all personnel selected. The diagnosis of PTSD was obtained from the Career History Archival Medical and Personnel System and verified through a review of medical records.

- **Results**: Among the 696 patients studied, 243 received a diagnosis of PTSD and 453 did not. The use of morphine during early resuscitation and trauma care was significantly associated with a lower risk of PTSD after injury. Among the patients in whom PTSD developed, 61% received morphine; among those in whom PTSD did not develop, 76% received morphine (odds ratio, 0.47; P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for injury severity, age, mechanism of injury, status with respect to amputation, and selected injury-related clinical factors.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the use of morphine during trauma care may reduce the risk of the subsequent development of PTSD after serious injury.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m9Qyv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders have not been systematically evaluated previously. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, addressing the efficacy of oral propranolol versus placebo or other medication as a treatment for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders.

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies concerned panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (four studies, total n = 130), specific phobia (two studies, total n = 37), social phobia (one study, n = 16), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (one study, n = 19).

Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses. These meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory reconsolidation.

In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.

### Risk and preventive factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Alcohol consumption and intoxication prior to a traumatic event diminishes the relative risk to develop PTSD in response to that trauma [^111iZLir]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Previous reports examined the effects of selected pre- (e.g. female gender, previous trauma), peri- (e.g. the horror of the trauma, threatened death), or post-exposure (e.g. the physical injury caused by the trauma) risk factors on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder associated with a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience. We hypothesized that alcohol consumption prior to traumatic events may reduce the incidence rate of PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the above risk factors and preventive factors, such as alcohol consumption, on the development of PTSD.

- **Methods**: An epidemiological cohort study was carried out on 127 victims trapped in a ballroom fire. Data were collected 7–9 months after the traumatic event by means of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and structured interviews, aimed to assess the above pre-, peri-, and post-exposure factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of PTSD with the etiologic factors and to delineate those risk factors which contribute most to the development of PTSD.

- **Results**: Female gender, the number of previous trauma, a past history of simple phobia, threatened death, trauma exposure, hospitalization for trauma-induced injuries, and the presence of burns increased the odds of PTSD, whereas a sense of control during the trauma and alcohol consumption and intoxication decreased the odds of PTSD. Six factors made independent contributions to the prediction of PTSD.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^113Yhy3Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

In cases of overdosage, propranolol is not significantly dialyzable. If ingestion is or may have been recent, evacuate gastric contents with caution to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

- **Supportive therapy**: Hypotension and bradycardia are common following propranolol overdose and should be managed appropriately. Glucagon, known for its potent inotropic and chronotropic effects, can be particularly useful in treating hypotension or depressed myocardial function following a propranolol overdose. Administer glucagon at a dose of 50 to 150 mcg/kg intravenously followed by a continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for a positive chronotropic effect. Other agents such as isoproterenol, dopamine, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also be useful, although epinephrine may provoke uncontrolled hypertension. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol, with serious cases potentially requiring temporary cardiac pacing.

Monitor electrocardiogram, pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status, and intake and output balance. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used to manage bronchospasm.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^112h88F7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Hydrocortisone has been shown to be effective, especially in patients who have never been treated for psychiatric disorders. A study recruited 64 trauma survivors in a level I trauma center and randomly assigned them to a hydrocortisone group and a placebo group. At three months post-trauma, none (0%) of the hydrocortisone recipients and three (14%) of the placebo recipients met the full PTSD diagnostic criteria. PTSD symptom severity decreased over time in both groups, with hydrocortisone recipients reporting lower Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores than the placebo group (19.4 ± 4 vs. 31.3 ± 3). The underlying mechanism has not yet been established. One hypothesis is that hydrocortisone can facilitate extinction learning through both non-genomic and genomic effects. Some also believe that high-dose exogenous hydrocortisone administered shortly after trauma may promote recovery through enhancing synaptic plasticity and connectivity. An animal model showed significantly increased dendritic growth and spine density, with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and decreased postsynaptic density protein 95 expression in steroid-treated stressed rats.

- **Propranolol**: Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is therefore capable of reducing the central nervous system adrenergic drive associated with defensive threat responses. Experimental studies of propranolol in healthy subjects have shown that its administration prior to exposure to potentially traumatic narratives reduced the recollection of stressful elements of the narratives.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^111bHSDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Induced by the traumatic experience of ACS as a life‐threatening disease, 13 patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 4% and clinically significant PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in 12% after 1 to 12 months. Typical PTSS may include re-experiencing aspects of ACS in thoughts or dreams, avoidance of activities that remind of ACS, and hyperarousal symptoms. Notwithstanding their short‐term anti-anxiety effects, benzodiazepines could be a risk factor for the development of ACS‐induced PTSS, seen in critical illness survivors exposed to benzodiazepines in the intensive care unit. Moreover, benzodiazepines increase the risk of developing PTSD at least 2‐fold in patients who experience trauma, because benzodiazepines could interfere with the acute physiological stress response and memory‐related processes necessary to cope with PTSS.

On the other hand, a decrease in both pain and fear conditioning could explain less severe PTSS at follow‐up in civilian and military patients who received morphine within hours of trauma. Pain and fear of dying during ACS are risk factors for the development of PTSS, but effects of morphine use on ACS‐induced PTSS have not yet been investigated. There is currently no meta‐analytic evidence that antidepressants or the β‐blocker propranolol prevent the development of PTSS following a traumatic event. However, one previous study observed lowered PTSS at 1 month in patients with β‐blockers during emergency department evaluation for ACS.

On the basis of the evidence, the primary aim of our observational study was to evaluate…

### A prospective study of pre-trauma risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression [^111Sgitj]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Emergency workers are routinely exposed to potentially traumatic events and are at risk of developing stress-related mental disorders. Whilst post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the more common outcome following trauma, evidence suggests that major depression (MD) can develop without co-occurring PTSD in the aftermath of trauma and is a common outcome following repeated exposure to stressful life events.

There is accumulating evidence linking PTSD and MD to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease and even early death. To prevent the negative effects of repeated trauma exposure on emergency workers' mental and physical health, there is a need to identify risk factors for PTSD and MD that can be targeted with resilience interventions. Some predictors, such as psychiatric history, are fixed and cannot be modified. However, others, such as cognitive styles and behavioral traits, are modifiable by training to reduce the risk of developing PTSD and MD and their negative impact on health.

Theories and empirical studies suggest several potentially modifiable predictors for both PTSD and MD. These include cognitive styles, such as attributional style; maladaptive post-traumatic cognitions; cognitive responses to memories of negative events, including rumination; coping styles; psychological traits like neuroticism; and poor social support.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: Evolving conceptualization and evidence, and future research directions [^112FUYk7]. World Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The understanding of responses to traumatic events has been greatly influenced by the introduction of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, we review the initial versions of the diagnostic criteria for this condition and the associated epidemiological findings, including sociocultural differences. We consider evidence for post-traumatic reactions occurring in multiple contexts not previously defined as traumatic and the implications that these observations have for the diagnosis. More recent developments, such as the DSM-5 dissociative subtype and the ICD-11 diagnosis of complex PTSD, are reviewed, adding to evidence that there are several distinct PTSD phenotypes.

We describe the psychological foundations of PTSD, involving disturbances to memory as well as to identity. A broader focus on identity may be able to accommodate group and communal influences on the experience of trauma and PTSD, as well as the impact of resource loss.

- **Evidence concerning the biological foundations of PTSD**: We summarize evidence with a particular focus on genetic and neuroimaging studies. Whereas progress in prevention has been disappointing, there is now extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of a variety of psychological treatments for established PTSD.
	- **Trauma-focused interventions**: These include trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).
	- **Non-trauma-focused therapies**: These also include some emerging identity-based approaches, such as present-centered and compassion-focused therapies.

### Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in severely burned patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QHXij]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

- **Risk of bias**: Seven trials (70%) and ten trials (100%) were rated as having an unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. The remaining three trials (30%) in the random sequence generation domain were categorized at low risk of bias. Only one trial (10%) reported masking of study participants, while the remaining nine trials (90%) were rated as having an unclear risk of bias in this domain. All trials were rated with an unclear risk of bias concerning the blinding of outcome assessors.

- **Attrition and reporting biases**: Three trials (30%) were identified as high risk for attrition bias due to losses to follow-up. High risk of selective reporting was observed in eight trials (80%), indicating a substantial possibility of reporting bias; however, estimating the likely magnitude and direction of this bias was challenging.

- **Other biases and ethical considerations**: High risk of other biases was present in six trials (60%) due to small sample sizes. Five trials (50%) reported receiving research funding, but none were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, none of the trials posted results on clinical trials websites, and six trials reported receiving ethical approval.

The overall risk of bias of the included RCTs is best represented in the figures accompanying the study.

### Early pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^115wBjyp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers as of November 2020. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random-effects model, we analyzed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NN).

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^115fTkjU]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, despite the reduction in patient depression associated with pre-admission β-blockers (BB), the unadjusted reduction in the incidence of depression between groups (BB (+) vs. BB (−)) did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.20). However, the unadjusted analysis does not account for confounding factors; for instance, patients who had been prescribed β-blockers had significantly longer ICU stays and were older, both factors associated with depressive syndromes. Trauma patients admitted to the ICU have been estimated to have a four times greater risk of developing moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms six months post-injury. Additionally, the observed protective effect of BB in this study increased when adjustment was made for significant group differences in the logistic regression model, strengthening the observed impact of BB on the risk of depression.

While our findings provide support for a possible BB effect on post-trauma depression, the retrospective design does not establish a direct causal link. Further investigation is required into the mechanisms behind this effect, and a prospective design examining whether early β-blockade during the admission itself results in the same outcome would be of value. Additionally, the national drugs registry neither keeps records of alternative therapies for depression, such as electroconvulsive or talking/behavioral therapies, nor does it register the medical indication for prescriptions. Except for the exclusion of patients prescribed pre-admission antidepressants, the study design is una…

### The role of early pharmacotherapy in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after traumatic injury: An observational cohort study in consecutive patients [^113EaBKZ]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological intervention during traumatic memory consolidation has been suggested to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to examine the association between the prescription of early pharmacotherapy and the risk of developing PTSD symptoms following traumatic injury.

- **Method**: The use of opiate analgesics, beta-adrenergic blockers, corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines within 48 hours post-injury was documented based on hospital charts for 629 Level 1 trauma center patients. PTSD symptoms were assessed using structured clinical interviews. The primary outcome was 6-week PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcomes were PTSD diagnoses at 6 weeks and during 1 year post-trauma.

- **Results**: Linear regression analyses showed that opiate administration within 48 hours was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms at 6 weeks (β = -0.14, P = 0.009) after controlling for demographic and injury-related characteristics and concurrent pharmacotherapy. Fewer patients with opiates had a PTSD diagnosis at 6 weeks (P = 0.047) and during 1 year post-trauma (P = 0.013) than patients with none of the specified pharmacotherapies. A low prescription frequency of beta-blockers (3.8%), corticosteroids (2.2%), and benzodiazepines (7.8%) precluded further examination of their role in the development of PTSD symptoms due to limited statistical power.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests a possible beneficial influence of opiate administration within 48 hours post-trauma on the development of PTSD symptoms. Future studies may evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital opiate analgesics compared to placebo.

### Cytokine fluctuation during acute stress is correlated to life trauma [^116izyPG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma/stress-associated psychiatric disorder that can develop in an individual after being involved in or witnessing an event that the individual perceives as traumatizing or extreme. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including flashbacks, severe anxiety, dissociative episodes, and fleeing or combative behaviors. Interestingly, however, not everyone who experiences or witnesses the same event will go on to develop PTSD. This suggests an underlying risk profile, perhaps immune-modulated, toward the development of PTSD that has yet to be fully elucidated.

Although PTSD is primarily recognized as a psychiatric disorder, it also manifests with physiological dysfunctions, especially with regard to the immune system. In 2015, there was a large-scale retrospective study conducted on 666,269 Iraq war veterans. This study discovered a twofold increase in the risk of autoimmune diseases in individuals with PTSD compared with those without any psychiatric illness, and a 51% increased risk when compared with individuals with other psychiatric illnesses. This strongly suggests a considerable connection between trauma, whether from a chronic or acute stressor, and immune system dysregulation. To quantitatively describe this relationship between stress, inflammatory cytokines/biomarkers, and the immune system, we used the Life Events Checklist 5 (LEC-5) survey.

The LEC-5 is a survey that can be used to determine the number and severity of life trauma events individuals have experienced, allowing for the establishment of their exposure to PTSD.

### Predicting post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans: Interaction of traumatic load with COMT gene variation [^111EN21E]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Because post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), by definition, can occur only after exposure to a traumatic event, military veterans who are at high risk for trauma exposure are a particularly relevant population for studying the interaction of trauma with genetic factors that may predispose for the disorder. A number of studies have implicated specific genes as possible risk factors in developing PTSD, including the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT).

- **Methods**: Data from Iraq War veterans (n = 236) were used to examine the interaction between COMT and traumatic experiences in predicting later development of PTSD symptoms. Subjects were assessed for exposure to traumatic events both before and during deployment.

- **Results**: The interaction between trauma load and COMT was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms. Those with the heterozygous genotype (Val/Met) showed fewer symptoms associated with trauma exposure compared to those with either homozygous genotype. This interaction remained significant after controlling for other risk factors for PTSD, including personality dimensions of Internalizing and Externalizing.

- **Conclusions**: COMT genotype affects risk for development of PTSD symptoms following exposure to trauma.

### Propranolol as an anxiolytic to reduce the use of sedatives for critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation (PROACTIVE): An open-label randomized controlled trial [^114wmDcZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Propranolol has also been used in the management of PTSD, a common feature of post-intensive care syndrome. Once PTSD is established, propranolol may be effective for blunting the symptoms triggered by traumatic memory reactivation. A recent review was inconclusive about the potential for propranolol to prevent the development of PTSD due to the risk of bias and heterogeneity of results. We did not follow our patients beyond discharge to assess for PTSD symptoms, given the limited scope of the study in the pandemic context.

There are important variations in sedation practices around the world, including differing use of medications, protocolized sedation, spontaneous awakening, and spontaneous breathing trials, so the results of a three-site study in Canada may not be generalizable to settings with different sedation practices. For pragmatic reasons, our study was focused on the small minority of mechanically ventilated patients who required high doses of IV sedatives, which also limits generalizability. Our study used an open-label design out of necessity due to the desire for safety and logistical simplicity given the urgency of the research question. Because the study was pragmatic, care providers were not restricted in their use of other sedatives, which makes the findings more generalizable. However, since the study was not blinded, we cannot exclude the possibility that care providers altered their sedation management based on treatment assignment. Differences in the new prescriptions of parenteral benzodiazepines and other factors need to be considered.

### Pharmacotherapy in the aftermath of trauma; opportunities in the 'golden hours' [^117D3DGC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Several lines of research have demonstrated that memories for fearful events become transiently labile upon re-exposure. Activation of molecular mechanisms is required in order to maintain retrieved information. This process is called reconsolidation. Targeting reconsolidation, as in exposure-based psychotherapy, therefore offers a potentially interesting tool to manipulate fear memories and subsequently to treat disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In this paper, we discuss the evidence for reconsolidation in rodents and humans and highlight recent studies in which clinical research on normal and abnormal fear extinction resulted in the reduction of the expression of fear by targeting the process of reconsolidation. We conclude that reconsolidation presents an interesting opportunity to modify or alter fear and fear-related memories. More clinical research on normal and abnormal fear extinction is required.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^115m2J2t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

From a risk assessment perspective, PTSD is likely multi-causal, and as such, individuals with differing vulnerabilities and different exposure and post-exposure circumstances may come to express the PTSD symptom complex through individual-specific pathways and be responsive to individual-specific interventions. One way to advance the prevention of PTSD is to better map the variety of paths leading to this condition and map those paths into subsets of trauma-exposed individuals. Once such knowledge becomes available, personalized target-specific early interventions might replace generic treatment protocols, which, in practice, are effective for some but not for all.

Several steps should be taken in future studies. We need to step beyond diagnosis-based screenings and develop more complex and accurate methods to predict individual risks of expressing debilitating symptoms and impairment after traumatic events. By enhancing prediction models, intervention studies can take the important step to select the most relevant sample for a more rigorous study design and the best clinical interest. At the same time, researchers need to continue exploring and confirming the underlying mechanisms of post-traumatic pathogenesis and, thereby, suggest new targets for novel interventions. These targeted intervention methods can allow clinicians to focus on both specific populations and specific pathological processes.

The internal validity of each trial included in this review was critically evaluated for bias according to the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias. This tool covers sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective reporting, and other biases. Two independent investigators assessed the possible risk of bias from extracted information, rating it as "high risk", "low risk", or "unclear risk". We utilized RevMan 5.3 to compute a graphic representation of potential bias.

### Beta-blocker therapy in severe traumatic brain injury: A prospective randomized controlled trial [^115vPYVe]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The study "Propranolol in Severe TBI" was published by Hosseinali Khalili and colleagues in 2020 in the journal World Journal of Surgery. This study is related to the following disease: traumatic brain injury.

- **Study design**: Single center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 219 patients (30 female, 189 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury; intracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Pre-injury β-blocker therapy, persistent shock at 24 hours after admission, and transfer from another hospital.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Β-blocker therapy positive (n = 99)**: 20 mg propranolol PO every 12 hours up to 10 days or until discharge.
	- **Β-blocker therapy negative (n = 120)**: No propranolol.
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in death in the hospital (8.1% vs. 16.7%; aIRR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.4).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in death in the hospital for patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (4.4% vs. 18.6%; aIRR 0.32, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9).
	- Significant increase in the rate of functional outcome at 6-month follow-up, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended ≥ 5 in patients with isolated traumatic brain injury (92.3% vs. 79.1%; aIRR 1.2, 95% CI 1 to 1.3).

### Pharmacological prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115f8Tx3]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

An increasing number of studies have investigated the pharmacological prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD). This is the first systematic review to examine the effects of pharmacotherapies, such as β-blockers, hydrocortisone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, administered within the first month following a traumatic or aversive event to prevent PTSD or ASD, compared with no pharmacotherapy or placebo control.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Randomised Trials. The studies included randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and cohort studies, with an overall quality ranging from low to moderate. We computed the pooled incidence risk ratio (IRR), representing the risk of PTSD or ASD incidence in the pharmacotherapy groups relative to the incidence in the control groups. Additionally, Hedges' g effect sizes for PTSD or ASD continuous outcomes were calculated.

- **Findings**: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 1765 individuals. Pharmacotherapy demonstrated greater effectiveness in preventing PTSD or ASD than placebo or no intervention (14 studies, 1705 individuals, IRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55–0.78; number needed to treat 11.36). However, no significant effect was observed when only randomised controlled trials were considered (ten studies, 300 individuals, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40–1.21). Hydrocortisone exhibited a large effect in reducing PTSD risk (five studies, 164 individuals, IRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16–0.92).

- **Interpretation**: No firm evidence was found for the efficacy of all early pharmacotherapy interventions in the prevention of PTSD or ASD.

### Pharmacologic treatment of acute and chronic stress following trauma: 2006 [^1151CJmt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

This article reviews pharmacologic treatment options for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), focusing on the goals of pharmacotherapy and the clinical trial evidence for drug treatments available for PTSD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended as first-line therapy for PTSD. The roles of these and other drug classes, including anticonvulsants, mood enhancers, atypical antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, alpha1-adrenergic antagonists, and beta-blockers, in achieving improvement in PTSD symptom and outcome scores, achieving remission, and avoiding relapse are discussed. Treatment of PTSD in association with other comorbid conditions is addressed, and the role of pharmacotherapy in treating early PTSD and acute stress disorder is examined. Dosing strategies for the SSRIs sertraline and paroxetine are provided, and an algorithm for PTSD pharmacotherapy is discussed.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^113xZVCC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

- **Overview of preventive interventions**: Psychological or behavioral interventions play a crucial role in the prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

- **The demise of psychological debriefing**: Psychological debriefing was a widely used method in the 1980s–1990s, aimed at preventing long-term post-traumatic symptoms by promoting quick emotional processing of traumatic events shortly after trauma exposure. Debriefing was offered to survivors of potentially traumatic events without prior diagnosis or evaluation, as exposure was considered a sufficient risk indicator. The method typically involved a single session within hours or a few days after trauma exposure, conducted either in a group or individually. It included general education about trauma exposure and its effects, sharing and validation of individuals' experiences, and preparation for future encounters. This method has face validity and is still well-known; therefore, it may be expected by laypeople when confronted with traumatic events. However, well-conducted studies showed no evidence of beneficial effects and even suggested that debriefing may have a negative effect on recovery. Following a negative Cochrane review first published in 1997, most treatment guidelines have been updated to recommend against providing single-session psychological debriefing on a routine basis for adults after trauma.

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Trauma-focused CBT can involve different strategies with distinct aims. Exposure-based CBT, exemplified by the prolonged exposure (PE) protocol, aims to achieve and maintain fear extinction through repeated exposure to trauma-related stimuli in a safe context.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^112SfizL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Interventions' taxonomy: Individuals' reactions to traumatic events follow diverging trajectories. From quasi-universal disarray and distress shortly after exposure, some survivors develop very few symptoms; others show transient and reversible initial symptoms, and a substantial minority continues to express severe non-remitting symptoms. These findings define two primary goals for early interventions: firstly, to mitigate the development of early symptoms, and secondly, to increase the likelihood of remission in those who develop symptoms, with special focus on the non-remitting subgroup.

Interventions addressing the first goal include attempts to reduce the stressfulness of the traumatic event (e.g. 'stress management', 'need-based assistance') and interventions meant to reduce participants' initial responses to the event or its encoding in memory. Studies addressing the second goal include specific intervention protocols delivered at different time intervals from the traumatic event to survivors identified as being at high risk for PTSD. The efficacy of the latter, therefore, hinges on proper risk detection in the early aftermath of trauma exposure. Individual risk prediction, however, is currently far from perfect.

### Propranolol's impact on cognitive performance in post-traumatic stress disorder [^1174mU4d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Propranolol has effectively diminished fear-based emotional memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and this effect has been attributed to traumatic memory reconsolidation blockade. However, propranolol may also exert cognitive effects by modulating stress and arousal.

- **Method**: Within a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, propranolol's impact on cognitive functioning was examined in individuals diagnosed with chronic PTSD. Participants received a single dose of 1 mg/kg of propranolol (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) and completed subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III). PTSD symptoms were assessed one week before and after treatment using the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R).

- **Results**: The propranolol group performed significantly better on the Processing Speed composite measure compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, greater heart rate decreases were associated with higher Perceptual Organization performance within the propranolol group.

- **Limitations**: The generalizability of results may have been reduced as participants were treatment-seeking; the sample size was small and included a greater proportion of females. This study could not assess whether pre-existing psychological function influenced cognitive performance post-trauma. Future studies might consider including a non-PTSD control group to determine if our findings are specific to propranolol's effect on PTSD-associated cognitive impairment.

- **Conclusions**: Our preliminary results demonstrated that cognitive functioning improved following propranolol treatment in PTSD patients, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit in ameliorating cognitive impairments associated with PTSD.

### Reduction in the occurrence of distressing involuntary memories following propranolol or hydrocortisone in healthy women [^115iDQum]. Psychological Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatments targeting the neuroendocrine stress response may hold special promise in the secondary prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, findings from clinical trials have been inconsistent, and the efficacy of specific drugs, their temporal window of efficacy, effective doses, and the characteristics of likely treatment responders remain unclear.

Using an experimental human model of distressing involuntary memory formation, we compare the effects of two drugs that have theoretical or empirical support as secondary preventive agents in PTSD. Eighty-eight healthy women (average age: 23.5 years) received oral propranolol (80 mg), hydrocortisone (30 mg), or matched placebo immediately after viewing a 'trauma film'. They then completed daily, time-stamped intrusion diaries for one week, at the end of which, voluntary memory was tested.

While neither drug affected voluntary memory for the trauma narrative, propranolol treatment was associated with 42% fewer, and hydrocortisone with 55% fewer intrusions across the week, relative to placebo. Additionally, propranolol reduced general trauma-like symptoms, and post-drug cortisol levels were negatively correlated with intrusion frequency in the hydrocortisone group.

Overall, this study shows substantial reductions in intrusive memories and preserved voluntary narrative-declarative memory following either propranolol or hydrocortisone in an experimental model of psychological trauma. As such, despite some inconsistencies in clinical trials, our findings support the potential efficacy of these pharmacological interventions for PTSD prevention.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^113NTufB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may affect 10% of women and 5% of men at some stage, and symptoms may persist for several years. Risk factors include major trauma, lack of social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and psychiatric or personality factors.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent and to treat PTSD? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006. Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 36 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Psychological therapies**: CBT, drama therapy, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, group therapy, hypnotherapy, multiple-session CBT, multiple-session collaborative trauma support, multiple-session education, internet-based psychotherapy
	- **Pharmacological treatments**: Antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, benzodiazepines, brofaromine, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, mirtazepine, nefazodone, olanzapine
	- **Other interventions**: Affect management, hydrocortisone, inpatient treatment programmes

### Does memory of a traumatic event increase the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with traumatic brain injury? A prospective study [^111hRqSx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The present study examined prospectively the relationship between memory of the traumatic event and subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More specifically, the aims of this study were to investigate the possibility that lack of memory of the traumatic event might be a protective factor; assess whether memory of the traumatic event equally affects the three symptom clusters of PTSD — reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal; and explore the predictive value of memory of the traumatic event for the development of subsequent PTSD in the immediate aftermath of the event.

One hundred twenty subjects with mild traumatic brain injury who were hospitalized for observation were assessed immediately after the trauma and followed up 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months later. All participants underwent psychiatric evaluation and self-assessment of their memory of the traumatic event.

Overall, 17 (14%) of the participants met full criteria for PTSD at 6 months. Subjects with memory of the traumatic event were significantly more likely to develop PTSD than those without memory of the traumatic event; the difference between the groups resulted primarily from the reexperiencing cluster. Logistic regression analysis revealed that memory of the traumatic event within the first 24 hours is a strong predictor of PTSD 6 months after the event.

Our study indicated that memory of a traumatic event is a strong predictor and a potential risk factor for subsequent development of PTSD. Future studies are needed to show whether this association persists over longer follow-up periods.

### Effect of post-retrieval propranolol on psychophysiologic responding during subsequent script-driven traumatic imagery in post-traumatic stress disorder [^113B3LGy]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol given within hours of a psychologically traumatic event reduces physiologic responses during subsequent mental imagery of the event. Here, we tested the effect of propranolol administered after the retrieval of memories of past traumatic events. Subjects with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder described their traumatic event during a script preparation session and then received a one-day dose of propranolol (n = 9) or placebo (n = 10), in a randomized and double-blind manner. A week later, they engaged in script-driven mental imagery of their traumatic event while heart rate, skin conductance, and left corrugator electromyogram were measured. Physiologic responses were significantly smaller in the subjects who had received post-reactivation propranolol a week earlier. Propranolol given after reactivation of the memory of a past traumatic event reduces physiologic responding during subsequent mental imagery of the event in a similar manner to propranolol given shortly after the occurrence of a traumatic event.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^1152g9Rp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Three months after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), one patient was diagnosed with full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 17 patients were diagnosed with subsyndromal PTSD, bringing the total number of patients diagnosed with clinical PTSD to 18, a prevalence of 11.7%. Most of the study participants were men, well-educated, and presented with relatively low medical comorbidity. The vast majority were treated in the coronary care unit with opioids, specifically morphine, and β‐blockers, with metoprolol administered in approximately 90% of cases. Slightly more than a third of the participants received benzodiazepines, primarily lorazepam in about 80% of these cases.

Three patients reported using benzodiazepines before the ACS — one in the group with clinical PTSD and two in the group without PTSD. All three also received a benzodiazepine during ACS. A total of 45 patients (29.2%) reported having had depression in the past, and 11 (7.1%) reported use of antidepressants. Compared with those without clinical PTSD, patients with clinical PTSD were significantly younger, more often diagnosed with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) than non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, and exhibited a more severe negative mood and more pronounced PTSD symptoms. Patients with clinical PTSD were also more frequently exposed to benzodiazepines, though not to morphine, β‐blockers, or antidepressants, than those without clinical PTSD.

### Treatment with β-blockers and incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiac surgery: A prospective observational study [^115yBiSf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to investigate perioperative factors associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. This was a prospective observational study conducted at a single academic center, involving 128 consecutive patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Patients were interviewed within the surgical unit 1 to 3 days before cardiac surgery. Six months after surgery, participants were mailed the modified version of the Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Inventory 10. Of the 71 patients who completed the questionnaire and returned it at follow-up, 14 (19.7%) were diagnosed with PTSD. Among female patients not treated with β-blockers, 7 out of 13 received a PTSD diagnosis compared with 0 out of 12 treated with β-blockers (p = 0.005, Fisher exact test). In a general linear model, including sex and β-blocker treatment as predictors, the Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Inventory 10 score was significantly predicted by β-blockade (F = 4.74, p = 0.033), with a significant interaction between sex and β-blockade (F = 9.72, p = 0.003).

These findings suggest that the use of β-blockers might be protective against the development of PTSD in women after cardiac surgery.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KdgLo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders have not been systematically evaluated previously. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, addressing the efficacy of oral propranolol versus placebo or other medication as a treatment for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria.

These studies concerned:

- **Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia**: Four studies, total n = 130.
- **Specific phobia**: Two studies, total n = 37.
- **Social phobia**: One study, n = 16.
- **Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**: One study, n = 19.

Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses. These meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory reconsolidation. In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.

### Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in severely burned patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JWh1a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis was performed to assess the overall outcomes of propranolol compared to usual care or placebo. The statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan® 5.3). For dichotomous outcomes, data were extracted on the total number of participants, the number that experienced the outcomes, and the number analyzed. For continuous outcomes, end-value means with standard deviations (SD) were extracted. Whenever possible, results from an intention-to-treat population were used.

Mean differences (MD) and risk differences were pooled using a random-effects model. The results were reported in forest plots of the estimated effects of the included studies with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Meta-analysis was considered appropriate since the included studies were similar in terms of participants, interventions, and outcomes, confirming clinical homogeneity. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I² test. For the interpretation, it was determined that values of 25, 50, and 75% in the I² test corresponded to low, medium, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively.

### The effect of propranolol on posttraumatic stress disorder in burned service members [^112otrw8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2008). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is reported to affect almost one third of the civilian burn patient population. Predisposing factors for PTSD include experiencing a traumatic event. Of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) soldiers returning home after deployment without injury, 17% reported cognitive symptoms of PTSD. The authors' recent study of soldiers burned in OIF/OEF showed a PTSD prevalence of approximately 30%, which is similar to civilian studies. Burns are characterized by hypermetabolism and increased catecholamine levels. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, like propranolol, decrease catecholamine levels. Propranolol may reduce consolidation of memory and act as a prophylaxis for PTSD.

This retrospective study examines the relationship between PTSD prevalence and propranolol administration. After institutional review board approval, data such as propranolol received, number of surgeries, anesthetic/analgesic regimen, TBSA burned, and injury severity score were collected from patients' charts. The military burn center received 603 soldiers injured in OIF/OEF, of which 226 completed the PTSD Checklist-Military. Thirty-one soldiers received propranolol and 34 matched soldiers did not. In propranolol patients, the prevalence of PTSD was 32.3% vs 26.5% in those not receiving propranolol (P = 0.785). These data suggest propranolol does not decrease PTSD development in burned soldiers. The prevalence of PTSD in patients receiving propranolol is the same as those not receiving propranolol. More research is needed to determine the relationship between PTSD and propranolol.

### Slc6a4 methylation modifies the effect of the number of traumatic events on risk for posttraumatic stress disorder [^117YPnBs]. Depression and Anxiety (2011). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder that occurs following exposure to a traumatic event. However, most individuals do not develop PTSD following even a severe trauma, leading to a search for new variables, such as genetic and other molecular variations associated with vulnerability and resilience in the face of trauma exposure.

- **Method**: We examined whether serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter genotype and methylation status modified the association between the number of traumatic events experienced and PTSD in a subset of 100 individuals from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study.

- **Results**: The number of traumatic events was strongly associated with the risk of PTSD. Neither SLC6A4 genotype nor methylation status was associated with PTSD in main effects models. However, SLC6A4 methylation levels modified the effect of the number of traumatic events on PTSD after controlling for SLC6A4 genotype. Persons with more traumatic events were at increased risk for PTSD, but only at lower methylation levels. At higher methylation levels, individuals with more traumatic events were protected from this disorder. This interaction was observed whether the outcome was PTSD diagnosis, symptom severity, or the number of symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Gene-specific methylation patterns may offer potential molecular signatures of increased risk for and resilience to PTSD.

### Pharmacological blockade of memory reconsolidation in posttraumatic stress disorder: three negative psychophysiological studies [^114wiVxZ]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may involve over-consolidated emotional memories of the traumatic event. Reactivation (RP) can return a memory to an unstable state, from which it must be restabilized (reconsolidated) if it is to persist. Pharmacological agents administered while the memory is unstable have been shown to impair reconsolidation. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) may promote memory destabilization.

In the three studies reported here, we investigated whether the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol or the glucocorticoid (GR) antagonist mifepristone, given at the time of traumatic memory reactivation, could reduce PTSD symptoms and physiological responding during subsequent traumatic imagery.

- **Study one**: Individuals with PTSD were randomized to receive propranolol with memory reactivation (n = 10) or without reactivation (n = 8).
- **Study two**: Participants received reactivation mifepristone (n = 13), non-reactivation (NRP) mifepristone (n = 15), or double placebo (PL) (n = 15).
- **Study three**: Subjects received reactivation mifepristone plus D-cycloserine (n = 16), or two placebos (n = 15).

Subjects underwent memory retrieval by describing their traumatic event. A week later, they engaged in script-driven traumatic mental imagery while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and facial electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. There were no significant group differences in physiological responsivity or change in PTSD symptoms in any of the studies. These results do not support successful blockade of reconsolidation of traumatic memories in PTSD.

### Emotional face processing in post-traumatic stress disorder after reconsolidation impairment using propranolol: A pilot fMRI study [^116vcyra]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit exaggerated emotional reactions to threatening stimuli, which may represent deregulated fear-conditioning, associated with long-term adaptations in the sympathetic nervous system. Within a repeated measures design, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to investigate neural responses to threat in PTSD participants (N = 7) during the presentation of emotional facial expressions. Scans were separated by six weekly reconsolidation impairment treatment sessions, consisting of traumatic memory reactivation under the influence of propranolol.

Greater activation before versus after treatment emerged in the thalamus and amygdala during fearful versus neutral face processing. Furthermore, participants showed greater activation after versus before treatment in the right anterior cingulate during fearful relative to happy face processing. PTSD symptoms significantly improved (d = 1.75) post-treatment. These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit, a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116MQuxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At doses greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The effects of propranolol are due to selective blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are found primarily in the heart. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of ventricular rate during arrhythmias. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve.

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in smooth muscle–vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^111weNsc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that may be diagnosed in individuals who, following a sufficient delay, respond with intense fear, helplessness, or horror to traumatic events. There is some evidence suggesting that the use of pharmacological interventions immediately after exposure to trauma may reduce the risk of developing PTSD.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for the prevention of PTSD in adults following exposure to a traumatic event.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) as of 14 February 2014. This register contains relevant reports of randomized controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (all years), EMBASE (1974 at the time of writing), MEDLINE (1950 at the time of writing), and PsycINFO (1967 at the time of writing). We identified unpublished trials by searching the National Institute of Health (NIH) Reporter, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials database (mRCT), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to December 2013. We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies with no constraints on language and setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We restricted studies to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions compared with placebo for the prevention of PTSD in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors (TA and JI) independently assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion based on the review selection criteria. We independently extracted data.

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^116NTVVW]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The exposure to pre-admission β-blockers significantly reduces the risk of developing depression by a factor of three up to one year following severe traumatic extracranial injury. Further investigation is needed to explore whether β-blockade in these instances may have a prophylactic or possibly therapeutic role.

### A beta-adrenergic antagonist reduces traumatic memories and PTSD symptoms in female but not in male patients after cardiac surgery [^115Hwk2r]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Epinephrine enhances emotional memory, whereas beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers, BBs) impair it. However, the effects of BB administration on memory are sex-dependent. Therefore, we predicted differential effects of epinephrine and the BB metoprolol given to male and female patients after cardiac surgery (CS) on traumatic memories and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.

- **Method**: We performed a prospective observational study and determined the number of standardized traumatic memories (NTRM) and PTSD symptom intensity in cardiac surgical patients 1 day before surgery, and at 1 week and 6 months after the procedure. PTSD symptoms and NTRM were quantified using validated questionnaires. Metoprolol could be administered any time post-operatively.

- **Results**: Baseline NTRM was not significantly different between male (n = 95) and female patients (n = 33). One week after CS, the NTRM in male patients was significantly higher. Metoprolol had no significant effect in either sex. At 6 months, females with metoprolol (n = 18) showed a significantly lower NTRM and significantly lower PTSD symptom scores than females without BBs (n = 15, p = 0.02). By contrast, the total administered dosage of epinephrine correlated with NTRM in males (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) but not in females (r = 0.21, p = 0.29).

- **Conclusions**: Beta-adrenergic stimulation with epinephrine enhances memory for adverse experiences in males but not in females, whereas beta-blockade selectively reduces memory for post-operative adverse events and PTSD symptoms in females.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: a retrospective cohort study [^116FRXJP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic mental disorder that affects a substantial number of individuals, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 4–9% in the US, U.K., and Canadian general population. PTSD develops among individuals with a history of trauma and is characterized by symptoms such as re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. Although various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PTSD have been developed, there remains a need to further prevent and manage PTSD to mitigate its burden on affected individuals' lives.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the link between trauma and PTSD. Renin is released in response to stress, with plasma levels elevated among individuals exposed to trauma. Severe stress sensitizes angiotensin II signaling in the central nervous system of rodents. Moreover, individuals with PTSD have been shown to have altered RAS activities. Given these consistent strands of inquiry, modification of RAS could play a key role in the development of PTSD following trauma or, conversely, in the improvement of its symptoms.

RAS blockers, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are types of medications used to lower blood pressure by inducing vasodilation and inhibiting sodium retention. In addition to their protective effects on diabetic kidney diseases and heart diseases, RAS blockers have also been associated with decreased risks of mo.

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^111HmHmY]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in patients following severe trauma. It has been hypothesized that the catecholamine surge occurring at the time of trauma may be an underlying factor facilitating the formation of strong emotional memories that are easily maintained. Ruminating on memories is a significant contributory factor in the development and maintenance of clinical depression. Beta-blockade (BB) inhibits adrenergic receptor activity and might inhibit the consolidation of such memories. This inhibition, in turn, could blunt the emotional effect of traumatic events and prevent post-injury depression.

Interestingly, the use of pindolol together with serotonergic antidepressants has previously demonstrated a synergistic effect on negative moods. Regular BB intake also appears to have a protective role in reducing emotional distress and depressive thoughts in the context of cancer diagnoses as well as following percutaneous coronary intervention in ischemic heart disease. These studies support the findings that BB may play a role in the prevention of post-traumatic depression.

The study shows that 13.8% of the total cohort commenced antidepressant therapy within 12 months of sustaining a severe extracranial injury. The incidence of clinical depression was lower in the group exposed to BB prior to the traumatic event (8.8%) compared to those who were not (14.4%). The average prevalence of patients prescribed antidepressant therapy in the county of Stockholm during the studied period (2007–2011) varied between 9.1% and 9.4% yearly. This suggests that beta-blockade may reduce the risk of depression in this patient population.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: A retrospective cohort study [^112MUPcn]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

We conducted subgroup analyses to assess whether the associations differed by sex, age, or antihypertensive combination therapy. The associations between RAS blocker use and probable PTSD were generally consistent, regardless of sex and age (Additional file 1: Table S5). However, this association was weaker in participants with antihypertensive combination therapy than in those with antihypertensive monotherapy (Monotherapy, OR = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.66–0.89]; combination therapy, 0.92 [0.77–1.10]; interaction-p = 0.023). We conducted the analysis covering the entire UK Biobank population, rather than just participants taking antihypertensive medications, to extend the generalizability of our results. In these analyses, RAS blocker use was associated with a lower risk of probable PTSD (OR = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.90–0.99]), while the use of other antihypertensive medications was associated with an increased risk of probable PTSD (users vs. non-users; CCBs, 1.21 [1.15–1.26]; beta-blockers, 1.33 [1.28–1.40]; thiazide-related diuretics, 1.15 [1.10–1.21]) (Additional file 1: Table S6).

The robustness of the primary analyses was confirmed through several sensitivity analyses (Additional file 1: Table S7). First, when participants with a history of diabetes, MI, or HF were excluded from the analyses, the association between RAS blocker use and probable PTSD remained statistically significant (OR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.71–0.92]). Second, when participants with a history of mental disorders were excluded, the association was generally consistent with that in the primary analysis (OR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.72–0.94]).

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^111Ps1qM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and morphine are administered during acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) to alleviate anxiety and pain, and β‐blockers may also reduce pain. ACS may induce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS). When taken during trauma other than ACS, benzodiazepines increase the risk of PTSS, but it is unknown if benzodiazepines increase the risk of PTSS in ACS. We examined the effects of drug exposure during ACS on the development of PTSS.

- **Methods and results**: Study participants were 154 patients with a verified ACS. Baseline demographics, clinical variables, and psychological measures were obtained through a medical history, psychometric assessment, and patient records, and used as covariates in linear regression analysis. Three months after ACS, the severity of PTSS was assessed with the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale. During ACS, 37.7% of patients were exposed to benzodiazepines, 72.1% to morphine, and 88.3% to β‐blockers, with only 7.1% exposed to antidepressants. Eighteen (11.7%) patients developed clinical PTSD. Adjusting for all covariates, benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale total severity score (unstandardized coefficient B [SE], 0.589 [0.274]; partial r = 0.18; P = 0.032) and the reexperiencing subscore (B [SE], 0.433 [0.217]; partial r = 0.17; P = 0.047). Patients exposed to benzodiazepines had an almost 4‐fold increased relative risk of developing clinical PTSD, adjusting for acute stress disorder symptoms (odds ratio, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.31–1).

### Noradrenergic dysfunction and the psychopharmacology of posttraumatic stress disorder [^115TrQDS]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The catecholamine norepinephrine is a critical effector of the mammalian stress response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a syndrome intrinsically related to the experience of extraordinary stress. Symptom-linked hypernoradrenergic derangements have been observed in PTSD, and several studies have examined the potential therapeutic effects of agents that dampen the centrally hyperactive noradrenergic state. These agents include compounds that decrease norepinephrine release, such as centrally acting alpha(2) agonists like clonidine, and those that block post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors, such as centrally acting alpha(1) or beta receptor antagonists like prazosin or propranolol.

In this article, we review studies of central noreadrenergic hyperactivity under both basal and challenge conditions and explore the evidence for these derangements as potential psychopharmacological targets in patients with PTSD. Given the significant involvement of CNS norepinephrine hyperactivity in PTSD and its link to intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms, it is not surprising that interventions directed at this system have therapeutic potential in PTSD. The utility of these anti-adrenergics in the clinical treatment of PTSD remains to be determined, though it is possible that they may prove to have primary roles in a disorder that is only modestly responsive to antidepressant treatment.
